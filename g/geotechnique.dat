40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the paper}} is to present briefly the {{geotechnical}} and geological conditions of Bucharest city. The paper includes five sections covering: geological and geomorphological conditions; the lithological succession from the surface {{to a depth of}} about 250 m; the hydrogeological characteristics of the main geological units; their geotechnical properties and the dynamic properties of the soil layers. The last section emphasises the seismic characteristics of the lithological layers using information obtained from measurements taken during the earthquakes of 1977 and 1986 and also from experimental tests using geophysical methods. Bucharest city is located on a plain with micro-relief resulting from erosion and sedimentary processes which extended along the valleys of the Dambovita River to the south and the Colentina River to the north. The city is located in the axial area of a syncline where the thickness of the sedimentary deposits is greatest (1000 m). Subsidence features, oriented NE-SW, are caused by neotectonic movements that affect Neogene and Quaternary deposits. The area represents a seismic risk {{due to the lack of}} solid rocks at surface. The geotechnical part of the paper utilises geotechnical data used in the design of the metro.

40|$|Abstract: The rapid {{urbanization}} of {{the areas}} around the big cities, and even in some areas inside them, very often takes place in locations with poor geological and geotechnical conditions. Mass movement affecting slopes is a common example of such problems, with very adverse social and economical consequences. This is due mainly {{to the lack of}} adequate planning. In fact, the geological and geotechnical site conditions do not receive much attention either from the politicians or from the planners who prepare the land use plans. The northern end of Almada County, near Lisbon, on the left bank of the Tagus River, is limited by dip slopes, which have been surrounded by construction during the last few decades. Those slopes are composed of hard soil/soft rock Miocene layers partially covered by colluvium. Slope evolution essentially takes place in the form of mass movements of different types, mostly rock falls and shallow slides. In this paper, the authors present some case studies of landslides affecting a small part of Almada's slopes, with many houses in the neighbouring area. The physical and mechanical properties of the slope materials are presented and the failure mechanisms of two landslides are discussed.

40|$|Abstract: A {{case study}} of onshore and {{offshore}} geotechnical investigations carried out in Mumbai (Bombay), India for a western freeway sea link project is presented here. 76 boreholes were drilled in soil and rock to assess the geotechnical parameters along a proposed bridge alignment {{on the west coast}} of Mumbai. The crucial task of drilling marine boreholes was achieved using a Jack up barge. A geophysical study using a sub-bottom profiler and side scan sonar was also carried out to supplement the geotechnical observations between boreholes. The field data obtained from drilling and in situ testing (including pressuremeter tests) is presented, and correlations with laboratory test results and geophysical data have allowed an evaluation of the geological model of project site. The data available from this investigation is interpreted to reveal the local geology in general and rock mass characteristics and classifications based on Rock Mass Rating. It has been observed from these investigations, in conjunction with other literature, that the sub surface stratum of west coast of Mumbai consists predominantly of westerly dipping basalt along with breccia and tuff with very little or no overburden. Laboratory tests reveal a wide range of strength and other engineering parameters for the characteristic material types present throughout the site area.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the foundation design process adopted for two high-rise buildings in Dubai, the Emirates Twin Towers. The foundation system {{for each of}} the towers was a piled raft, founded on deep deposits of cal-careous soils and rocks. The paper outlines the geotechnical investigations undertaken, the field and laboratory testing programs, and the design process and describes how potential issues of low skin friction and cyclic degradation of skin friction due to wind loading were addressed. An advanced numerical computer analysis was used for the design pro-cess, which was carried out using a limit state approach. This necessitated analysis {{of a large number of}} load cases, and the paper describes how the information was processed to produce design information. A comprehensive program of pile load testing was undertaken, and class A predictions of both axial and lateral load–deflection behaviour were in fair agreement with the load test results. Despite this agreement, the overall settlements of the towers observed during construction were significantly less than predicted. The possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed.

40|$|The rapid {{urbanisation}} in {{the commune}} of Menton (French Riviera) {{is linked to}} the attractivity of the site (micro-climate and landscape quality). Nearly half of the territory that has been declared as constructable in the urban planning documents cannot be build upon since the elaboration of a "Plan d'exposition aux risques". This policy has lead to a higher land-use pressure in the non protected territory. In this area there is multiplication of new building sites that obtain a permission by a simple demand following a superficial analysis. Based on a case study in Val des Castignins, that is an area characterised by important housing operations, the article stresses that the geotechnical valuation do not always bring the vital information concerning the risks. The author highlights the importance that the local planners take into account the mesh of hazards that may be generated by the difference between the real danger and the way they perceive the danger.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Laws mandate that cultural resources be identified, evaluated, protected and preserved. These requirements have been ignored. The unexpected occurrence of buried cultural resources has caused time consuming and costly delays in construction projects. Therefore, a strategy to aid cultural resource management (CRM) is needed. A geoscience strategy for CRM was developed by modifying engineering geological approaches. Evaluation of existing approaches revealed a common three or four phase strategy to converge on a solution. Adapting the approaches led to a geoscience strategy that combined the mandated CRM phases with engineering stages into a decision tree. Objective scientific inquiry and assessment are the center of the strategy tree. Decisions are made by managers based on benefits, costs and risks. The process cascades positively through the phases and stages if benefits are greater than risks and costs. If not, the solution is: no action or to redefine the problem. The geoscience strategy to assist CRM was examined for three shipwrecks in alluvial environments. The first two, an unnamed British merchant vessel found in the York River, and the Bertrand buried along the Missouri River came from literature review. The third, USS F,astport, a Union ironclad gunboat, scuttled on the Red River was derived from experience. Archival information suggested the location of the gunboat. The subsequent search for the USS Eastport relied on an engineering geologic approach. Geomorphic analyses determined the location of the 1864 channel where the US Navy abandoned the boat. Magnetometer surveys revealed strong dipolar anomalies {{in the area of the}} abandoned channel. Geotechnical exploration indicate the remains of two boats believed to be the USS Eastport and Dix. <b>Geotechniques</b> evaluated the choices for a conceptual excavation design needed to test the vessels for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. This research demonstrates the importance of a geoscience strategy and the need for an interdisciplinary team for CRM. The geoscience strategy is efffective because it offers a geologic framework for the phases of CRM. Improved archaeological interpretations of context and significance are possible because artifacts are placed in their stratigraphic provenance. Interdisciplinary cooperation will save time and money by reducing redundant and fragmented efforts as the team converges on a common solution...|$|R

This paper appeared in the Journal of the Boston Society of Civil Engineers in 1950. Later in 1950 Ruth's research led to her being assigned to determine the cause of the deterioration of concrete railway structures across the United States. Her experience in this field caught the attention of a bridge engineer Orwin Peck.

40|$|Many of the {{important}} developments {{in the field of}} foundation engineering have been addressed in <b>Géotechnique</b> papers over the past 60 years. This paper briefly reviews some of these developments and related articles, particularly with respect to shallow and deep foundations. In the early days of <b>Géotechnique,</b> the power to perform sophisticated numerical analyses did not exist. Papers tended to focus on the solution of problems using simple models in which soil was modelled either as linear elastic or as perfectly plastic. Engineers sought simple closed-form analytical solutions for boundary-value problems. With the development of more powerful analytical, computational and experimental capabilities, and of more sophisticated pile installation technology (especially offshore), more recent papers have explored much more sophisticated approaches to a range of foundation problems, striving to achieve more realistic representation of working conditions. <b>Géotechnique</b> papers have attempted to solve the problems faced by the foundation engineering industry, with a strong emphasis on the underlying science; as a result, these papers have {{played a key role in}} the advancement of both the science and its applications in our discipline...|$|E

An alternative approach {{with a similar}} framework of Sassa et al. (<b>Geotechnique</b> 2001; 51 (10) : 847 - 857) is developed to correct the inappropriate mechanism of wave components used. Then, a two-layered wave model which includes viscous effects is established and applied to describe the progressive nature of wave-induced liquefaction. A comprehensive comparison shows that Sassa's model overestimates the maximum liquefaction depth. It is found that the viscosity of liquefied soil cannot be ignored and the solution for an infinite seabed is not suitable for liquefaction analysis of shallow seabed.

40|$|The Tresca failure {{criterion}} is used regularly in geotechnical engineering {{to compute the}} failure loads of clay soils deforming under undrained conditions. When this criterion is used together with the finite element method a plastic flow rule must also be incorporated in the elasto-plastic soil model. The effects of the flow rule {{on the performance of}} a non-linear analysis using an elastic perfectly plastic soil model obeying the Tresca failure criteria are discussed in this note. Application of this model in a three-dimensional analysis causes computational difficulties, due to the gradient discontinuities that exist {{at the corner of the}} Tresca yield surface. Such discontinuities can be removed from the yield (or failure) surface using different methods. Two of the most widely used methods in removing singularities from the yield surface and their overall performances in a three-dimensional finite element analysis are discussed. The motivation for this study comes from a concern raised by Randolph and Puzrin [Randolph MF and Puzrin AM Upper bound limit analysis of circular foundations on clay under general loading. <b>Geotechnique,</b> (2003); 53 (9) : 785 – 796, [5]] about reported instances of under predictions of the collapse loads by finite element analysis [Taiebat HA and Carter JP Numerical studies of the bearing capacity of shallow foundations on cohesive soil subjected to combined loading. <b>Geotechnique,</b> (2000); 50 (4) : 409 – 418, [7]] and [Taiebat HA and Carter JP Bearing capacity of strip and circular foundations on undrained clay subjected to eccentric loads. <b>Geotechnique,</b> (2002); 52 (1) : 61 – 64, [8]], [Gourvenec S and Randolph M Effect of strength non-homogeneity on the shape of failure envelopes for combined loading of strip and circular foundations on clay, <b>Geotechnique,</b> (2003); 53 (6) : 575 – 586, [4]], when it is usually expected that finite element results should overestimate the true collapse loads.

Looking at the discusser’s paper and the paper under discussion (Michalowski 2013), a reader may note that the aim of the two papers is the same, namely, to assess quantitatively the effect of the presence of cracks on the stability of slopes employing the upper bound approach of limit analysis.

40|$|Stability of {{undrained}} shearing in {{a classical}} Cauchy continuum has been first analyzed by Rice (J Geophys Res 80 (11) : 1531 - 1536, 1975) who showed that instability {{occurs when the}} underlying drained deformation becomes unstable (i. e. in the softening regime of the corresponding drained stress-strain curve). However Vardoulakis (Int J Numer Anal Methods Geomech 9 : 339 - 414, 1985; Int J Numer Anal Methods Geomech 10 : 177 - 190, 1986) has shown that Rice's linear stability analysis, if performed {{at the state of}} maximum deviator, leads to a sharp transition from infinitely stable to infinitely unstable behaviour, which indicates that the solution of the considered initial-value problem does not exist and consequently that the corresponding problem is mathematically ill-posed. Vardoulakis (<b>Géotechnique</b> 46 (3) : 441 - 456, 1996; <b>Géotechnique</b> 46 (3) : 457 - 472, 1996) proposed a regularization of the ill-posed problem in the softening regime by resorting to a second grade extension of plasticity theory. In this paper, the kinetics of a granular material is described by a Cosserat continuum as first suggested by Mühlhaus and Vardoulakis (<b>Géotechnique</b> 37 : 271 - 283, 1987) and we incorporate the effect of shear heating due to the dissipation of the frictional work. The undrained adiabatic limit is applicable as soon as the slip event is sufficiently rapid and the shear zone broad enough to effectively preclude heat or fluid transfer as it is the case during an earthquake or a landslide. It is shown that shear heating has a destabilizing effect and that instability can occur in the hardening regime if the amount of dilatant strengthening is not sufficient as compared to the effect of thermal pressurization of the pore fluid. It is shown that the linear stability analysis with macro and micro inertia terms leads to the selection of a preferred wave length of the instability mode corresponding to the instability mode with fastest (but finite) growth coefficient. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

The resulting model is shown to be a multiple-yield-surface generalisation of the model by Mühlhaus and Vardoulakis (<b>Géotechnique</b> 37 (3) : 271 - 283, 1987). By introducing separate and clearly identified rolling- and sliding-resistance parameters, the model allows for separate activation of the respective dissipative mechanisms. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{food and}} {{agricultural}} materials are stored and processed in a particulate form. Cereal grains and rapeseed {{are also important}} raw materials for food in-dustry. Properties of the material serve as parameters for engineers designing storage systems or processing plants. Mechanical properties of grain bedding depend on properties of individual grains, friction between par-ticles, interparticle contact geometry and load history. Recently demand of industrial practice resulted in revi-sion of several silo design codes, which included stan-dardization of methods for determination of mechanical properties of granular materials. European Standard Eu-rocode 1 (1996) and Polish Standard (DYDUCH et al. 2000) recommend to determine properties under load condition which {{are similar to the}} operation loads. Some properties are determined using shear test (Jenike tester or triaxial compression test) other using uniaxial com-pression test. The aim of performed experiments was to evaluate and comprise values of mechanical constants character-izing elastic deformation (modulus of elasticity E and Poisson’s ratio) of rapeseed and wheat bed determined with two methods adopted from <b>geotechnique.</b> First approach used was a method proposed by SAWICKI (1994) who used first phase of unloading in uniaxial compression experiment to determine elastic constants. This type of examination was applied to estimate values of E and ν for wheat and rapeseed beddings for five levels of moisture content ranging from 6 % to 20 %. With the second method values of E were determined based on measurement of shear wave velocity (TIMOSHENKO, GOODIER 1970). Tests were performed for bedding of wheat and rapeseed under equilibrium moisture content. MATERIALS AND METHODS Values of basic mechanical constants character-izing elastic deformation modulus of elasticity E and Poisson’s ratio ν were determined with two methods adopted from <b>geotechnique.</b> First approach used was a method proposed by SAWICKI (1994) who distinguished Determination of elastic parameters of grain with oedometric and acoustic methods M.
