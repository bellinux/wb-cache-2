30|$|The major hazards {{with the}} {{machines}} could be classified into mechanical (e.g. crushing, cutting, trapping, shearing, abrasion, friction), structural (e.g. sharp edges, projections, obstructions, potential to fragment, collapse, overturn), physical (e.g. electricity, pressurized content, noise and vibration, heat, moisture or cold temperatures), chemical (e.g. gases, <b>fumes,</b> <b>liquids,</b> dusts, {{that can cause}} adverse health effects), ergonomic hazards (awkward working positions, manual handling, repetitive movements), and biological (e.g. present of bacteria, molds in materials used or processed in machinery) (Bluff 2014; Poisson and Chinniah 2016). Furthermore, as workers have to use machinery in all phases of its lifecycle from installation, through operation, maintenance, troubleshooting, repairs, adjustments, set-up, production disruptions, to cleaning and dismantling, they get exposed to various hazards (Poisson and Chinniah 2016; Rus et al. 2008). A study based on sixty-six Australian manufacturing firms which produce and supply machinery into local and international markets found that less than one in ten firms comprehensively recognized hazards, used safe place controls as the primary risk control measures, and provided substantial, good quality information to minimize environmental hazards, but the remaining firms did not consider the environmental impacts (Bluff 2014).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{hundred and}} twenty seven men {{with varying degrees of}} {{occupational}} exposure to hydrazine, a weak animal carcinogen, were studied to see if they provided any evidence of carcinogenicity to man.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} brown {{environmental}} {{problems have been}} given scant attention in urban planning and governance in favour of profit-making and industrial development efforts in South Africa, {{at the expense of}} public health. Urban South Africa is plagued by mounting brown environmental problems that arose out of industrialisation and urbanisation. As a result, informal economic activities have mushroomed in urban spaces, which are now synonymous with air pollution, waste and squalid settlement environments. Often the informal economic activities are pigeonholed in high capital intensive industries, mining companies, manufacturing institutions as well as processing and heavy metal companies, amongst others. But the ubiquity of informal business establishments around public transit stations, pavement/walkways and adjacent formal businesses, notwithstanding a myriad of bylaws, have contributed significantly towards emissions of toxins, gases, <b>fumes</b> and <b>liquids</b> into the surroundings with deleterious repercussions on public health. The informal economy is characterised by congestion, street vending and littering, illegal disposal of contaminated liquids and refuse on pavements and sidewalks as well as a series of air polluting activities, which are seemingly ungovernable. This article explores various brown environmental problems that affect urban South Africa in order to highlight the deleterious consequences of lax in urban governance...|$|R
50|$|IOM's {{research}} {{has helped to}} set standards and inform regulatory processes over the years, and this created the opportunity to offer consultancy services to customers in industry and elsewhere, to help them achieve best practice and comply with the law. Over the years, this advice has often been based on knowledge gained during their research work. The IOM have provided consultancies {{to a wide range}} of customers since the mid-1970s. In the beginning, the main impetus for the work came from Jim Dodgson, who built up occupational hygiene and chemical analysis in Edinburgh and in their regional offices (then in South Wales, the Midlands and Tyne and Wear). Then, as now, a substantial proportion of the work was related to asbestos sampling and analysis in buildings, industrial plant and contaminated land. IOM were amongst the first to introduce asbestos clearance indicators in the UK - ahead of the Health and Safety Executive. Thirty years ago IOM were already developing their occupational hygiene business in a variety of other directions. Countless surveys of occupational exposures to hazardous gases, <b>liquids,</b> <b>fumes,</b> dusts and fibres have been undertaken. They have advised on control methods for hazardous agents, from elimination or substitution, to organisational changes or the introduction of personal protective equipment. Through the 1980s the consultancy work developed to include ergonomics and occupational medicine. By the time IOM became independent from British Coal in 1990, the consultancy work accounted for about 45% of the work.|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of silica <b>fume</b> when <b>liquid</b> metal is {{in contact with}} air during refining of metallurgical grade silicon leads to a direct loss of silicon. Apart from this yield loss the associated fume may be harmful to the workers in the plant. During tapping, refining and casting of silicon, the fume formation makes up 40 – 80 % of the fugitive emissions from the plant. In this work, the kinetics and mechanisms of fume formation during refining of metallurgical grade silicon were studied. Active oxidation {{is defined as the}} partial oxidation of Si to the gaseous product SiO. This type of oxidation does not protect the surface from further attack (passivation). When reviewing relevant literature, the majority of the research on active oxidation of silicon is done on solid silicon Research to date on liquid silicon oxidation on the other hand is primarily theoretical. As such, there is a knowledge gap concerning a mechanistic understanding of the active oxidation of liquid silicon. Boundary conditions, rate-controlling factors and flux dependencies on oxygen partial pressure and gas flow rate have not been systematically studied experimentally for active oxidation of liquid silicon. The amount of fume on an industrial scale and the characteristics of the fume such as elemental content, particle size and shape have not been adequately explored. In this project, the active oxidation of liquid silicon was investigated at three different scales; industrial measurements (~ 7 tonne Si); small-scale experiments 10 g Si); and medium-scale induction furnace experiments (1750 g Si). An experimental element distribution analysis of both main and trace-elements in the industrial refining ladle was performed. It was found that the amount of fume formed during industrial refining is in the range 0. 7 – 1. 8 kg of SiO 2 per tonne silicon produced. The main mechanism of SiO 2 -fume formation is oxidation of the surface, so that the exposed surface area is a main parameter controlling the fume formation in the industry. The boundary conditions for the oxidation of a still Si surface were determined from the small-scale experiments. The measurements confirmed an approximated theoretical mass transfer rate of oxygen and a maximum bulk oxygen pressure for active oxidation. From the induction furnace experiments {{it was found that the}} primary factor determining the rate of fume formation is the rate of transport of oxygen to the surface, which in turn is given by the velocity of the gas above the surface. This work is the first qualitative and quantitative study containing experimental investigations from small-scale to industrial scale on the kinetic and mechanistic nature of silicon oxidation. The industrial work has also contributes to a better understanding of distribution of elements in the silicon refining process, and it gives implications for emission estimation of toxic and other trace elements to the environment.
