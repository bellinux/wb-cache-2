2500|$|A {{variety of}} obscure {{literary}} references to same-sex love exist in ancient sources, {{but many of}} these are so subtle as to be unreliable; another consideration is that declarations of affection for friends of the same sex were common. Nevertheless, references do exist, and they become more numerous in the Heian period, roughly the 11th century. In The Tale of Genji, written in the early 11th century, men are frequently moved by the beauty of youths. In one scene the hero is rejected by a lady and instead sleeps with her young brother: [...] "Genji pulled the boy <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> ... Genji, for his part, or so one is informed, found the boy more attractive than his chilly sister." ...|$|E
2500|$|Annett {{followed}} him to the station, sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> and offered some cigarettes. Von Janowski lit the cigarette using the same Belgian matches he had at the hotel. Annett grew even more suspicious and alerted a Quebec Provincial Police constable, who quickly boarded the train as it pulled away from the station and began searching for the stranger. The policeman located von Janowski, who said he was a radio salesman from Toronto. He stuck with this story until the policeman asked to search his bags; the stranger then confessed: [...] "That will not be necessary. I am a German officer who serves his country as you do yourself." [...] Inspection of von Janowski's personal effects upon his arrest revealed that he was carrying a powerful radio transmitter, among other things.|$|E

60|$|He {{presently}} {{stood by}} the side of John. The latter had coiled up the rope, and laid it by him; and had then thrown himself down, and was sobbing bitterly. Jonas sat <b>down</b> quietly <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> till he had recovered his composure.|$|R
60|$|Of the strangers, he took no heed whatever. He {{had seen}} them, but {{appeared}} quite incapable of interest or curiosity. The younger brother stood apart. The bachelor drew a chair towards the old man, and sat <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> After a long silence, he ventured to speak.|$|R
2500|$|Sheldon's {{closest friends}} are Leonard Hofstadter, Howard Wolowitz, and Raj Koothrappali. Of the three, Sheldon is openly dismissive of Howard and {{constantly}} [...] that a master's degree in engineering demonstrates a lesser intellect {{than that of}} the others, who all possess science doctorates. Despite that, Sheldon has referred to Howard as a [...] "treasured acquaintance" [...] and a friend at various points. Sheldon considers Leonard his best friend, as they used to live together and can tolerate each other: in [...] "The Space Probe Disintegration", Sheldon admits to Leonard that he is aware of the way he inconveniences people, and tearfully expresses his gratitude for having Leonard in his life, causing Leonard to break <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> Prady stated that [...] "the fact that, despite everything, Leonard considers Sheldon his best friend reminds us of Sheldon's essential humanity". Sheldon can only handle having a limited number of friends in his life at a time, but later shows flexibility when he accepts Bernadette and Amy as part of the social group. In Season 6, the guys ask if comic book store owner Stuart can be part of the group while Howard is in space.|$|E

60|$|Well, that evening, {{when the}} young man had supped off his {{favourite}} dishes which the princess took care to have specially prepared for him, she sat <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> and began stroking his head. For some time she did not speak, but listened attentively to all the adventures that had befallen him that day.|$|R
60|$|EVE. The new Adams and Eves {{might kill}} us. I shall not make them. [She {{sits on the}} rock and pulls <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> her, {{clasping}} <b>him</b> to her with her right arm].|$|R

60|$|PATRICIA. [With a {{smile of}} perversity.] Well, I {{think this is a}} more {{comfortable}} way. [She sits <b>down</b> suddenly <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> in a sort of domestic way and goes on talking.] Yes. I'll do everything your mother did, not so well, of course; I'll darn that conjurer's hat--does one darn hats?--and cook the Conjurer's dinner. By the way, what is a Conjurer's dinner? There's always the goldfish, of course....|$|R
60|$|Graham {{transferred}} {{his attention}} to Ostrog. He was signalling with his hands, and his attendants busy breaking <b>down</b> the wall <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> In another moment the aeropile came into view again, a little thing far away, coming round in a wide curve and going slower.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth's {{eyes went}} from these {{to the less}} {{assertive}} figures. One seemed exceptionally pitiful to her. It was a woman of perhaps forty-five, with gold-stained hair and a painted face, down which abundant tears had trickled; she had a pinched nose, hungry eyes, lean hands and shoulders, and her dusty worn-out finery {{told the story of}} her life. Another was a grey-bearded old man in the costume of a bishop of one of the high episcopal sects--for religion was now also a business, and had its ups and <b>downs.</b> And <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> a sickly, dissipated-looking boy of perhaps two-and-twenty glared at Fate.|$|R

60|$|The Merman {{with his}} light was ready at the box-door, and other Mermen with other lights were ready {{at many of}} the doors. The Dorrit Merman held his lantern low, to show the steps, and Mr Sparkler put on another heavy set of fetters over his former set, as he watched her radiant feet {{twinkling}} <b>down</b> the stairs <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> Among the loiterers here, was Blandois of Paris. He spoke, and moved forward beside Fanny.|$|R

"Rateau {{is sitting}} down ... {{he has his}} back to the window ... he has put his bundle <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> on the bench ... he can't speak for a minute, for he is {{coughing}} and spluttering like an old walrus.... A wench is bringing him a bottle of wine and a hunk of bread and cheese.... He has started talking ... is talking volubly ... the people are laughing ... some are applauding.... And here comes Jean Victor, the landlord ... you know him, citizen ... a big, hulking fellow, and as good a patriot as I ever wish to see.... He, too, is laughing and talking to Rateau, who is doubled up with another fit of coughing--" ...|$|R
25|$|Earlier, debutant pacer Akshat Pandey and left-arm spinner Ashish Yadav claimed three wickets to keep Karnataka in check. Barring Mayank Agarwal {{the rest}} of the batting line-up {{departed}} for low scores. Manish Pandey returned for two while Stuart Binny was back in the dressing room for 18. Karn Sharma who had claimed two wickets returned to score a valuable 51 to help chase <b>down</b> the target. <b>Besides</b> <b>him,</b> Asadullah Khan and Mahesh Rawat to posted half-centuries that helped Railways seize a victory.|$|R
60|$|The squire dropped <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> on {{his knees}} and kissed his hand, crying like a child.|$|E

60|$|He sat down, {{wondering}} why the deuce he'd stood up, and unhappily realized that Nelly was examining Istra and himself with cool hostility. In a flurry he glowered at Istra as she nonchalantly sat <b>down</b> opposite <b>him,</b> <b>beside</b> Mrs. Arty, and incuriously unfolded her napkin. He thought {{that in her}} cheerful face there was an expression of devilish amusement.|$|R
60|$|Little Dorrit {{opened the}} door from without, and they both entered. He {{was sitting in his}} old grey gown and his old black cap, in the {{sunlight}} by the window, reading his newspaper. His glasses were in his hand, and he had just looked round; surprised at first, no doubt, by her step upon the stairs, not expecting her until night; surprised again, by seeing Arthur Clennam in her company. As they came in, the same unwonted look in both of them which had already caught attention in the yard below, struck him. He did not rise or speak, but laid down his glasses and his newspaper on the table <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> and looked at them with his mouth a little open and his lips trembling. When Arthur put out his hand, he touched it, but not with his usual state; and then he turned to his daughter, who had sat <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> with her hands upon his shoulder, and looked attentively in her face.|$|R
60|$|And so Alaric and {{his wife}} sat down to breakfast on that last morning. She had brought their boy down; but as she {{perceived}} that the child's presence did not please his father, he had been {{sent back to the}} nursery, and they were alone. She poured out his tea for him, put bread upon his plate, and then sat <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> endeavouring to persuade him to eat. She had never yet found fault with him, she had never even ventured to give him counsel, but now she longed to entreat him to collect himself and take a man's part in the coming trial. He sat in the seat prepared for him, but, instead of eating, he thrust his hands after his accustomed manner into his pockets and sat glowering at the teacups.|$|R

5000|$|In his autobiography, King Jr. {{remembered his}} father leaving a shoe shop {{because he and}} his son were asked to change seats. He said, [...] "This {{was the first time}} I had seen Dad so furious. That {{experience}} revealed to me {{at a very early age}} that my father had not adjusted to the system, and he played a great part in shaping my conscience. I still remember walking <b>down</b> the street <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> as he muttered, 'I don't care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} scene, Klaha, in his vampire form, wakes up, {{as if from}} a nightmare, {{suggesting}} that perhaps the whole events which occurred in the film were all inside of Klaha's mind. Cecil (also in her vampire form, but dressed in a white wedding gown and with her hair <b>down)</b> sits up <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> and smiles. The film ends with Klaha walking down the aisle, carrying Cecil in his arms. The final intertitle states their feelings for each other: [...] "The only one I want is you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, {{how much}} better a servant he was {{than any of the}} little girls the bride had refused to bring with her! If she wanted water, she had only to cross the patch of maize behind the hut and seek out the place where the buffalo lay hidden, and put <b>down</b> her pail <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> Then she would sit at her ease while he went to the lake and brought the bucket back brimming over. If she wanted wood, he would break the {{branches}} off the trees and lay them at her feet. And the villagers watched her return laden, and said to each other: ...|$|R
