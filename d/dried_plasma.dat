40|$|Studies are {{difficult}} in areas lacking modern facilities {{due to the}} inability to reliably collect, store, and ship samples. Thus, we sought {{to evaluate the use}} of a <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> collection device for seroepidemiology studies. Plasma was obtained by fingerstick using a commercial <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> collection device (Chemcard Plasma Collection Device) and serum (venipuncture) from individuals in Kazakhstan. Plasma samples were air dried for 15 min and then stored desiccated in foil zip-lock pouches at 4 to 6 °C and subsequently shipped to the United States by air at ambient temperature. Serum samples remained frozen at − 20 °C until assayed. Helicobacter pylori status was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (HM-CAP EIA) for the <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> and the serum samples. The results were concordant in 250 of the 289 cases (86. 5 %). In 25 cases (8. 6 %), the <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> samples gave indeterminate results and could not be retested because only one sample was collected. Five serum samples were positive, and the corresponding <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> samples were negative; one serum sample was negative, and the corresponding plasma sample was positive. The relative sensitivity and specificity of the Chemcard samples to serum were 97. 6 and 97. 9 %, respectively, excluding those with indeterminate results. Repeated freeze-thawing had no adverse effect on the accuracy of the test. We found the <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> collection device to provide an accurate and practical alternative to serum when venipuncture may be difficult or inconvenient and sample storage and handling present difficulties, especially for seroepidemiologic studies in rural areas or developing countries and where freeze-thawing may be unavoidable...|$|R

40|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> {{process has}} been {{demonstrated}} to be useful for the selective modification of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiolates. These SAMs are used, during the fabrication of semiconductor electronic devices, as etch masks on gold layers that are destined to be patterned and incorporated into the devices. The selective modification involves the formation of fluorocarbon films that render the SAMs more effective in protecting the masked areas of the gold against etching by a potassium iodide (KI) solution. This modification can be utilized, {{not only in the}} fabrication of single electronic devices but also in the fabrication of integrated circuits, microelectromechanical systems, and circuit boards. In the steps that precede the <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> process, a silicon mold in the desired pattern is fabricated by standard photolithographic techniques. A stamp is then made by casting polydimethylsiloxane (commonly known as silicone rubber) in the mold. The stamp is coated with an alkanethiol solution, then the stamp is pressed on the gold layer of a device to be fabricated in order to deposit the alkanethiol to form an alkanethiolate SAM in the desired pattern (see figure). Next, the workpiece is exposed to a radio-frequency plasma generated from a mixture of CF 4 and H 2 gases. After this plasma treatment, the SAM is found to be modified, while the exposed areas of gold remain unchanged. This <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> process offers the potential for forming masks superior to those formed in a prior wet etching process. Among the advantages over the wet etching process are greater selectivity, fewer pin holes in the masks, and less nonuniformity of the masks. The fluorocarbon films formed in this way may also be useful as intermediate layers for subsequent fabrication steps and as dielectric layers to be incorporated into finished products...|$|R

Establishment of a calibration curve enabled investigation of: fractionation, matrix effects, mass flow ratios, and the relative merits of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>plasma</b> conditions for laser ablation sampling. It was found that a wet plasma was much more tolerant of increased sample loading without reducing plasma robustness, leading to less severe and more constant mutual matrix effects. These findings indicate that the on-line addition of water is the preferred mode of operation for quantification by LA-ICP-MS. The analytical performance of the method was validated by the analysis of three certified reference materials: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 612 Trace Elements in Glass, European Reference Material (ERM) 681 Trace Elements in Polyethylene and British Chemical Standards (BCS) No. 387 Nimonic 901 Alloy.

40|$|The use {{of growth}} {{promoting}} and therapeutic antibiotics in piglet feed {{has been a}} concerning subject {{over the last few}} decades because of the risk of generating antimicrobial resistance that could be transferred to humans.
