5|$|M.P. Spencer {{showed that}} Doppler {{ultrasonic}} methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and <b>Dr</b> <b>Andrew</b> Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed. The pathophysiology of DCS {{is not yet}} fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Mixed breathing gases are used to reduce {{the effects of the}} hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers.|$|E
