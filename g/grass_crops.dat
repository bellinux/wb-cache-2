5|$|The {{economy of}} Dawson Creek {{is based on}} four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has {{historically}} been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and <b>grass</b> <b>crops,</b> such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and sweet clover. The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, {{where there is no}} provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format chain stores.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{publication}} of 2,4-D's as a selective herbicide" [...] came in 1944. Starting in 1945 the American Chemical Paint Company brought 2,4-D to market as an herbicide called [...] "Weedone". It revolutionized weed control, {{as it was}} the first compound that, at low doses, could selectively control dicots (broadleaf plants), but not most monocots - narrow leaf crops like wheat, maize (corn), rice, and similar cereal <b>grass</b> <b>crops.</b> [...] At a time when labor was scarce and there was a huge need for increased food production, it literally [...] "replaced the hoe".|$|E
5000|$|Phenoxy {{herbicides}} (or [...] "phenoxies") are {{a family}} of chemicals related to the growth hormone indoleacetic acid (IAA). When sprayed on broad-leaf plants they induce rapid, uncontrolled growth ("growing to death"). When sprayed on monocotyledonous (<b>grass)</b> <b>crops</b> such as wheat or corn, they selectively kill broad-leaf weeds, leaving the crops relatively unaffected. The wide variety of phenoxies in use today can be grouped into the phenoxyacetic, phenoxybutyric and phenoxypropionic subtypes, the latter containing the aryloxyphenoxypropionic subtype with {{the greatest number of}} commercial variants. Chemically, they are carboxylic acids, typically applied in an ester or salt form.|$|E
50|$|When 2,4-D was commercially {{released}} in 1946, it triggered a worldwide revolution in agricultural output {{and became the}} first successful selective herbicide. It allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in wheat, maize (corn), rice, and similar cereal <b>grass</b> <b>crops,</b> because it kills dicots (broadleaf plants), but not most monocots (grasses). The low cost of 2,4-D has led to continued usage today, and it {{remains one of the most}} commonly used herbicides in the world. Like other acid herbicides, current formulations use either an amine salt (often trimethylamine) or one of many esters of the parent compound. These are easier to handle than the acid.|$|E

50|$|The {{climate is}} mild and {{temperate}} with moderate rainfall of 1200-1600mm per annum, {{with the higher}} western hills having the most rain. Summers are drier with maximum temperatures of 25-28 degrees Celsius. Summer droughts occur one year in ten. Winter maxima are 12-15 degrees Celsius. The lower areas experience regular morning fog, under anticyclonic conditions, which burns off by late morning to produce many still, clear sunny days. Morning frosts are also common during winter anticyclones. Another distinctive feature is the low average wind speed in the interior basin due to the sheltering influence of the hills and mountains {{to the west and}} south-west. The prevailing winter wind is from the south-west. The Waikato has very high sunshine hours by world standards, averaging 2200 hours per year or about 40% higher than in the UK.

In November of 2005, undisturbed soil samples were collected in the layers of 0 - 7. 5 and 7. 5 - 15 cm of depth. Ten indicators of physical quality of the soil were evaluated. To maintain the physical quality of a very clayey Oxisol, in the depth of 0 - 15 cm, under grazing of oats and rye <b>grass</b> <b>crops</b> in the winter, the grazing height should be maintained to 21 cm.
