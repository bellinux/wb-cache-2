40|$|In this study, the {{separation}} of twelve nucleobases and nucleosides was optimized via chromatogram simulation (i. e., prediction of <b>individual</b> <b>retention</b> times and estimation of the peak widths) {{with the use of}} an empirical (reversed-phase) non-linear model proposed by Neue and Kuss. Retention time prediction errors of less than 2 % were observed for all compounds on different stationary phases. As a single HILIC column could not resolve all peaks, the modeling was extended to coupled-column systems (with different stationary phase chemistries) to increase {{the separation}} efficiency and selectivity. The analytical expressions for the gradient retention factor on a coupled column system were derived and accurate retention time predictions were obtained (< 2 % prediction errors in general). The optimized gradient (predicted by the optimization software) included coupling of an amide and an pentahydroxy functionalized silica stationary phases with a gradient profile from 95 to 85 %ACN in 6. min and resulted in almost baseline separation of the twelve nucleobases and nucleosides in less than 7. min. The final separation was obtained in less than 4. h of instrument time (including equilibration times) and was fully obtained via computer-based optimization. As such, this study provides an example of a case where <b>individual</b> <b>retention</b> modeling {{can be used as a}} way to optimize the gradient conditions in the HILIC mode using a non-linear model such as the Neue and Kuss model. © 2014 Elsevier B.

In Experiment 1, participants either rated their compre-hension or predicted performance for each text, with lower ratings indicating lower confidence either in comprehension or in eventual performance. Judgement magnitude was significantly lower for performance predictions than for comprehension ratings, suggesting that predictions were based partly on retention estimates. In Experiment 2, predictions varied with anticipated test delay (15 min or 2 weeks) whereas comprehension ratings did not, providing further evidence that <b>individuals</b> estimate <b>retention</b> when predicting performance.

The isocratically obtained Neue and Kuss retention parameters enabled the accurate gradient retention modeling for peaks eluting well within the gradient (mean error of 2. 7 %). The prediction errors for peaks eluting {{at the end of}} the gradient could be reduced from 8. 8 to 6. 1 % by implementing the isocratic regime after the gradient into the expression for the gradient retention factor. The prediction of the corresponding peak widths improved significantly for certain compounds and gradient profiles using individual gradient N values for each compound compared to employing a single N value for all compounds and gradient profiles. Two gradient optimization strategies (constructing the Rs map based on <b>individual</b> <b>retention</b> modeling and predictive elution stretching and shifting, PEWS 2) resulted in a reasonable separation of the challenging mixture of 13 isomeric hydroxy- and aminobenzoic acids on the ZIC-HILIC column. Overall, the optimization was limited by the steep decrease in N (dropping to the isocratic N value) and corresponding increase in peak width when increasing the gradient time. The discrimination factors d 0 were used to assess the resolution between peaks varying widely in height. The best separation was found to be obtained via the PEWS 2 approach. Both the <b>individual</b> <b>retention</b> modeling and PEWS 2 strategies corresponded to a total instrument time less than 12 h (including equilibration). Finally, it was found that the salt concentration had a significant effect on both the retention and the peak shape of the compounds, resulting in a small “solution domain” at 10 mM.

RESULTS The overall response rate was 65 percent. Most orthodontists placed a bonded retainer in the upper and lower arch, except when the upper arch was expanded during treatment or when extractions were performed in the upper arch, in which case they placed a combination of fixed and removable retainers.

40|$|Electrical {{gradients}} enhance protein separations in chromatography columns. The {{goal of this}} dissertation was {{to improve}} {{a system in which}} application of an axial electric potential across a liquid chromatography column separates proteins without resorting to a chemical gradient. The research was based on the hypothesis that the size and charge of proteins in a dextran gel column can be moderated using an electric potential so that differences in <b>individual</b> <b>retention,</b> and therefore resolution would be enhanced. Application of a one-dimensional differential material balance that incorporated electrophoretic mobilities predicted protein retention {{as a function of the}} charge/mass ratio of proteins and the pore size of an electrically neutral stationary phase. An energy balance incorporating the thermal properties of dextran and Tris-glycine buffers enabled the calculation of radial temperature profiles. This theoretical analysis led to identification of conditions resulting in stable column operation at electrical potentials of 50 to 125 V/cm. Heat transfer and autothermal effects were controlled and a constant temperature maintained in a 15 mm i. d. column for over four hours. These mechanistic models enable the specification of flowrate, pH, buffer composition, mobile phase temperature, stationary phase porosity; and the polarity, duration, and field strength of the applied electric potential required to achieve protein separations in electrochromatography columns. ...|$|E

Drawing on data from {{the first three years of}} HITS-c and HITS-i, two community-based prospective observational studies, six studies examined the feasibility of conducting efficacy trials of candidate HCV vaccines with people who inject drugs (PWID) in an Australian community-based setting. The first study examined the effectiveness of respondent driven (RDS) and targeted outreach (TOS) sampling in identifying and recruiting anti-HCV negative PWID (n= 156). While RDS resulted in more enrollments, TOS was more efficient in identifying eligible <b>individuals.</b> <b>Retention</b> was high, with 89 % of participants retained at 48 weeks, while the third study found that 76 % of participants were adherent to follow-up protocols, completing at least 75 % of study visits within two weeks of schedule. Hypothetical willingness to participate (WTP) in HCV vaccine trials also provides an indication of future trial viability, and the fourth study found the majority (80 %) of participants indicated WTP. The fifth study documented a significant increase in HCV vaccine clinical trial literacy (CTL) following a brief intervention designed to improve understanding of key HCV vaccine trial concepts. The rate of primary HCV infection was 7. 9 / 100 py, substantially lower than 30. 8 / 100 py observed a decade earlier in a similar Sydney-based cohort, highlighting the need for future trials to be informed by contemporary data. While sample size estimates suggest that a primary infection rate of at least 16 / 100 py would be required for standalone trials of candidates designed to prevent chronic HCV infection, results support the feasibility of Sydney participating in large multi-centre HCV vaccine trials. Results demonstrate it is possible to identify, recruit and retain at-risk PWID who adhere to study protocols. PWID in Sydney indicate high levels of WTP in future trials, with increases in CTL suggesting this group has the capacity to provide truly informed consent. Taken together, findings suggest that the ethical implementation of future HCV vaccine trials is possible in Australia, with demonstration of HCV candidate vaccine effectiveness feasible as part of multi-site trials. Data presented here will inform models of best practice for conducting future prevention trials with PWID...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to design and construct a unique analytical data base {{to be used to}} examine the effects of the military drawdown on the retention of Naval aviators. Past analyses of retention have focused primarily on the <b>individual</b> <b>retention</b> decision. This thesis uses grouped data defined by year of commission, fiscal year, and aviator type. The analysis quantifies the relationship between various downsizing policies and cohort continuation rates while controlling for the effects of time-since-MSR (minimum service requirement) and civilian unemployment. Separate regression models are specified for the jet, prop, and helo pilot communities, and for the jet and prop NFO communities, with the continuation rate as the dependent variable. The models are estimated using weighted OLS. The samples contained observations on a total of 1, 907 cohort continuation rates for each fiscal year between 1977 and 1993. The study found that the percentage of Aviation Continuation Pay bonuses available in a given year is directly related to the grouped continuation rate. The effect of the VSI/SSB and IRAD progrnas was found to be statistically insignificant. Thus, it was concluded that the downsizing policies have had only a minor effect on the underlying, baseline continuation rate. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAviation Career Continuation Pay (ACCP), the retention bonus for Naval Aviators, has historically {{failed to meet}} stated retention goals. For fiscal year 2013 Naval Personnel Command reported that ACCP exceeded retention goals in some communities by more than 60 %, while simultaneously falling over 60 % short of retention objectives in others. We analyze the potential for using auction mechanisms to improve upon these results by controlling cost, quantity, and quality of aviators retained. Using survey data to estimate aviators’ quality and willingness to stay in active duty naval aviation, we compare the results of ACCP against three mechanisms, 1) uniform-price auction, 2) Quality Adjusted Discount (QUAD) auction, and 3) Combinatorial Retention Auction Mechanism (CRAM). We find that by implementing a uniform-price auction naval aviation can exactly meet 100 % of its retention objectives, while reducing costs in some communities by more than $ 2, 200, 000. Additionally, while we find no significant correlation between officer quality and retention costs, we demonstrate the potential for QUAD auctions to improve upon these results by further reducing retention costs and improving {{the overall quality of}} retained aviators.

The ability of a game development company to analyze and derive insights from behavioral telemetry is crucial to the success of these games which rely on in-game purchases and in-game advertising to generate revenue, and for the company to remain competitive in a global marketplace. The ability to model, understand and predict future player behavior has a crucial value, allowing developers to obtain data-driven insights to inform design, development and marketing strategies.

The respondents were gathered via a snowball sample method, due to the hidden nature of delight customers. Their responses were collated into themes in relation to the study’s research question and objectives, where the findings were compared and contrasted with existing literature. Results found indicate that the use of customer delight should be confined as a marketing tool for customer acquisition, rather than as a tool for the development of customer loyalty. These findings suggest that the unique individual reactions the respondents experienced in relation to their delighting encounters suggest that in order to develop customer loyalty, a unique <b>individual</b> <b>retention</b> programme needs to be designed by service providers...|$|E
40|$|Assessing the {{processes}} by which populations are regulated {{is one of the}} most important goals in ecology. The local abundance of "open" marine populations may be regulated by recruitment and/or post-settlement mortality. These demographic rates could be influenced by varying levels of predation, competition and habitat structure, which may interact in complex ways. The relative importance of these factors in determining population size and structure has rarely been estimated. This thesis addresses this goal by focussing on the local dynamics of a coral reef fish Pomacentrus moluccensis at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Fundamental to this, was testing the impact of implant microtags on the growth and survivorship of P. moluccensis. These tags would enable the individual recognition required for mortality, migration and growth studies. Subsequently, the relative importance of recruitment, predation, habitat structure and their interactions in determining these patterns was investigated. These results were evaluated against generalisations emerging from studies on P. moluccensis at other locations on the GBR and other coral reef fishes. The impact of two types of microtag on P. moluccensis were tested: Firstly, visible implant fluorescent (VIF) tags which provided an external marker and secondly, coded wire tags (CWT) which were not visible externally but provided <b>individual</b> codes. <b>Retention</b> rates for both microtags in new recruits of this species (10 - 20 mm SL) were high (100...|$|R
40|$|Using multi-institutional {{data from}} the Cooperative Institutional Research Program’s (CIRP) annual survey of {{entering}} freshmen, the Higher Education Research Institute’s (HERI) Faculty Surveys, campus registrars’ offices, and IPEDS data, we evaluated {{the extent to which}} peer institutional retention climates and faculty perceived campus climates influenced <b>individual</b> 6 -year <b>retention</b> rates. We used hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLM) to examine the extent to which institutional climate (as measured by peer institutional retention climate and faculty perceived climate), net of students’ ability, expectations, and family socioeconomic status, influence students’ persistence behavior. We found that institutional retention climate, as defined by a student body’s aggregated report of withdrawal intentions, did independently determine whether a student would persist or not. While past research has overlooked peer and faculty climates, the results from this work call for the attention of peer institutional retention climates...|$|R

There {{is a high}} {{prevalence}} of homelessness in St. Paul and Minneapolis {{as well as the}} United States. Estimates of the number of homelessness in the United States range up to several million. According to the Wilder Research Foundation, in the Twin Cities metro area over 4, 000 youth and adults are in temporary housing programs and over 600 are unsheltered. “Homeless” for this study is defined as having no regular place to live (i. e. having to stay in a shelter, a hotel paid for with a voucher, a friend’s house, an abandoned building, outdoors or other places not intended for sleeping). Among disadvantaged populations, homeless individuals experience the greatest risk of death, barriers to healthcare and lack of resources and close relationships deemed necessary for appropriate end of life (EOL) care. Homeless individuals also utilize the healthcare system at a significantly higher rate than housed individuals. They are admitted to the emergency room and hospitalized at almost four times the rate of the general population of the United States. This is in a large part a consequence of their inability to access routine health care due to competing needs and lack of adequate health insurance. Although homeless individuals experience such high rates of mortality and hospitalization, their attitudes, values and desires regarding EOL care had yet to be studied. The major objective {{of this study was to}} test an advanced directive (AD) intervention in the homeless population of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Insights from this project will also be significant in the following ways: they will address the EOL concerns of homeless people and provide the basis to test the needs of others who are separated from their loved ones and/or experience fragmented, episodic healthcare. It is evident that homelessness research is particularly needed within the larger body of research on health disparities in disadvantaged populations. However, research on the health disparities of homelessness populations is scarce. This is in a large part due to the intimidating methodological challenges facing those who seek to study homeless populations. The itinerant nature of the homeless population is the greatest challenge that effects the retention rate of studies of homeless <b>individuals.</b> <b>Retention</b> rates in studies of homeless populations range from 30 to 86 percent. Previously used retention strategies included: outreach, phone tracking and gathering of anchoring points (information that will help locate an individual, such as an emergency contact). In this investigation, we employed both traditional and innovative methods to increase retention. We found that the effectiveness of these strategies varied considerably among sites. These findings identify the challenges and innovative methods utilized to study homeless populations and pave the way for further research of disadvantaged populations in the United States...|$|R
