5|$|This was Arsenal's 21st Shield {{appearance}} and Chelsea's 11th. Petr Čech made his competitive debut for Arsenal against his former team, while captain Mikel Arteta and striker Olivier <b>Giroud</b> were named as substitutes. Gary Cahill was passed fit to start for Chelsea alongside captain John Terry, and Loïc Rémy started up-front as Diego Costa was absent.|$|E
5|$|When the teamsheets were released, Wenger's {{selection}} showed Rosický and <b>Giroud</b> {{would start}} the match as substitutes and competitive debuts {{were given to}} Mathieu Debuchy, Calum Chambers and Alexis Sánchez. Arsenal employed a 4–1–4–1 formation to start the game, with a defensive midfielder (Mikel Arteta) sitting between a flat back four and a four-man midfield; Yaya Sanogo led the Arsenal attack as a lone centre-forward.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City were {{predicted}} {{to line up}} in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Nasri and James Milner as wide men. Due to a specified pre-season programme, Pellegrini had agreed to excuse several players from the match, namely Martín Demichelis, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna, Fernandinho, Frank Lampard and Sergio Agüero. Striker Álvaro Negredo was also unavailable for selection because of an injury. Arsenal were expected to line up similarly to Manchester City, with Ramsey as a holding midfielder, and Tomáš Rosický in an advanced role behind Olivier <b>Giroud.</b> Goalkeeper David Ospina was ruled {{out of the game}} with a thigh injury; German internationals Per Mertesacker, Mesut Özil and Lukas Podolski did not feature as they were given extended time off following their national side's success at the World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Radamel Falcao {{replaced}} Rémy {{after the}} break and his long-range shot in the 48th minute was blocked. Although Chelsea started the half well, it was Arsenal who fashioned the notable chances before the hour mark. In the 50th minute Santi Cazorla attempted to thread the ball through Chelsea's defence for Walcott to reach but his pass was cleared. Two minutes later Coquelin over-hit his pass which was directed to Özil, who roamed freely. Chelsea made another change, this time Oscar in place of Ramires in the 53rd minute. Seven minutes later Chelsea came close to scoring when Eden Hazard managed to evade his markers, but through on goal failed to get his shot on target, hitting over. Azpilicueta was shown the game's first yellow card for pulling Oxlade-Chamberlain back; Mourinho {{made the decision to}} substitute him with Kurt Zouma in the 69th minute. <b>Giroud</b> came on for Walcott moments before, and immediately was involved in the action, shooting high and then from long range.|$|E
5|$|Wenger's {{preparations}} for the 2011–12 season were disrupted by player unrest. Though he insisted none of his top players would leave the club, Fàbregas eventually moved to Barcelona, while Gaël Clichy and Samir Nasri joined Manchester City. Suspensions and injuries left Wenger fielding an understrength side against Manchester United on 29 August 2011; Arsenal were trounced 8–2, which represented their worst defeat in 115 years. Needing to address the squad's lack of depth, Wenger completed a series of deals {{in the final days}} of the summer transfer window. He mostly brought in experienced players, such as Yossi Benayoun on loan from Chelsea, Everton's Mikel Arteta and Germany international Per Mertesacker. By October, Arsenal had made their worst start to a season in 58 years, losing four of their opening seven matches. However, the team soon harmonised, and in the same month club captain Robin van Persie scored a hat-trick as Arsenal beat Chelsea 5–3. Despite another season of no silverware, Wenger guided Arsenal to third position in the Premier League, thus qualifying for the Champions League for a 15th successive campaign. Van Persie had scored 37 goals, in his first injury-free season for the club. He, however, grew disillusioned with Arsenal's transfer policy, and decided not to renew his contract, with one year remaining. When Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson learnt of the situation, he called Wenger to push through a deal and Van Persie agreed to join Manchester United in August 2012. The club purchased strikers Olivier <b>Giroud</b> and Lukas Podolski in anticipation of the sale.|$|E

50|$|On 20 February 2011, Belhanda {{assisted}} on Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> {{first goal}} in Montpellier's 2-2 draw with Paris Saint-Germain. A month later, he scored the match-winning goal against the eventual league champions Lille.|$|R
25|$|Olivier <b>Giroud</b> {{was named}} as the Premier League Player of the Month, having scored in all Premier League games held in March, along with Arsène Wenger being named the Premier League Manager of the Month after {{managing}} Arsenal {{to victory in}} all Premier League games in March. On 4 April, Arsenal played at home to Liverpool and convincingly thrashed them 4–1. Goals came from Héctor Bellerín, Mesut Özil, Alexis Sánchez and Player of the Month, <b>Giroud,</b> thus giving Arsenal a very high possibility of finishing in the top four of the league. Then on 11 April, they beat Burnley 1–0 away from home.|$|E
25|$|Arsenal {{began their}} {{season with the}} Community Shield against Manchester City. The Gunners won the match 3–0, with goals from Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier <b>Giroud.</b> The trophy was Arsène Wenger's 13th in 17 years of being in charge of Arsenal.|$|E
25|$|Arsenal {{continued}} their Premier League campaign {{with their first}} away game which was against Everton at Goodison Park, where Arsenal came from 2–0 down to draw 2–2. During the match, Olivier <b>Giroud,</b> who scored in this corresponding match, picked up an injury {{and was forced to}} miss out for approximately four months.|$|E
50|$|In May 2016, Matuidi {{was named}} by {{national}} side manager Deschamps to France's 23-man squad for Euro 2016, hosted on home soil. On 3 July, Matuidi assisted Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> opening {{goal in the}} quarter-finals of the tournament at the Stade de France, as the host nation defeated Iceland 5-2.|$|R
50|$|On {{the opening}} day of the 2013-14 season, Oxlade-Chamberlain {{assisted}} Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> goal in a 3-1 defeat at home to Aston Villa, however he came off injured and it was later revealed he would be out for between six weeks and three months, missing England's remaining World Cup qualifiers against Poland and Montenegro.|$|R
5|$|If Curie's work helped {{overturn}} established {{ideas in}} physics and chemistry, {{it has had}} an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way {{because she was a}} woman. This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in Françoise <b>Giroud's</b> Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|R
25|$|On {{the first}} day of March, Arsenal played against Everton at the Emirates. Arsenal were under {{pressure}} by their fans prior to the match after their miserable Champions League home defeat to Monaco. Nonetheless, Arsenal put their capitulation behind them as they beat Everton 2–0. The first goal came from Olivier <b>Giroud,</b> who struggled badly during their defeat to Monaco, missing every clear chance that came his way, but he managed to score the opening goal which delivered relief to the Arsenal fans. The second goal was scored by Tomáš Rosický after coming off the bench during the match as Arsenal were back in winning form. Three days later, Arsenal travelled to the west of London and won against QPR 2–1 with goals from <b>Giroud</b> and Alexis Sánchez, the latter ending a run of seven games without a goal.|$|E
25|$|Besides this {{industrial}} activity, François de Grossouvre was counsellor {{for foreign}} trade of France (1952–67) and vice-president of the Chambre de commerce franco-sarroise (1955–62). He invested some {{capital in the}} 1953 creation of L'Express magazine, and started a friendship with Françoise <b>Giroud</b> and Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber. In the 1970s he became the largest shareholder of La Montagne and the Journal du Centre regional dailies.|$|E
25|$|Arsenal {{looked like}} the better team for most of extra time, {{creating}} lots of chances. <b>Giroud</b> hit the crossbar after five minutes and Ramsey fired a number of low shots at goal, forcing saves from McGregor. Four minutes into {{the second half of}} extra time, Arsenal took the lead via a low shot from Ramsey to the near corner following a back-heeled pass by <b>Giroud.</b> With four minutes of the game left, Hull had a chance to equalise when Sone Aluko took advantage of a Per Mertesacker slip, went round the onrushing Fabiański, and fired a shot across the Arsenal penalty area from a very tight angle, only for it to go inches wide. Three minutes later, Aluko had another chance when he shot at the corner only for it to be saved just in time by Fabiański. A minute later, Probert blew for full-time with the score at Arsenal 3–2 Hull City, giving Arsenal their first trophy in nine years since beating Manchester United on penalties in the 2005 FA Cup Final.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{the arrival}} of Alexis Sánchez in the 2014 off-season, Monreal took the vacant number 18 {{previously}} worn by Sébastien Squillaci. On 23 August, he assisted Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> late equalizer in a 2-2 draw against Everton; additionally, an injury crisis in the squad saw him being deployed in an unfamiliar central defender role {{in a string of}} games, after Laurent Koscielny was put out of action due to an Achilles tendon injury.|$|R
5000|$|... "I know {{he will be}} {{reminded}} of <b>Giroud’s</b> milestone being his replacement. We’ll {{have to move on}} quickly and erase it. He reminds me of Higuain in the game, the morphology is the same. While his game is different from that of Olivier, I have chosen him because he can adapt to our group. He is a good football player and a good goalscorer. He can blend into our game without completely changing what we’ve done so far." [...] Manager René Girard on Herrera.|$|R
50|$|Özil {{assisted}} Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> second goal in Arsenal's last Premier League {{match of}} the season against Aston Villa in a 4-0 home victory as the Gunners finished second ahead of fierce rivals, Tottenham Hotspur. That was Özil's 19th assist {{of the season}} in the league, a record only beaten by Thierry Henry with 20 in 2002-03 in Premier League history. Özil ended his third season at Arsenal with 8 goals and 20 assists in all club competitions, which won him the Arsenal Player of the Season award.|$|R
25|$|On Boxing Day, Arsenal {{played at}} home against Queens Park Rangers and won 2–1. Alexis Sánchez scored the first goal, despite missing a penalty, and Tomáš Rosický added the second after Olivier <b>Giroud</b> had been sent off after headbutting QPR defender Nedum Onuoha. Two days later, Arsenal ended 2014 with a 2–1 away victory over West Ham United, {{courtesy}} of a Santi Cazorla penalty and Danny Welbeck finish.|$|E
25|$|On 9 March, Arsenal {{travelled}} to Old Trafford to face Manchester United in the FA Cup quarter-finals and Arsenal won 2–1. Danny Welbeck {{scored the}} winning goal {{to knock out}} his former club and send Arsenal into the semi-finals of the FA Cup for a record 28th time. Five days later, Arsenal beat West Ham 3–0 at the Emirates. Goals from Olivier <b>Giroud,</b> Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini were perfect preparation in order to overturn the Champions League 3–1 deficit against Monaco.|$|E
25|$|The {{first day}} of February saw Arsenal {{dispatch}} Aston Villa 5–0 at home with goals from Olivier <b>Giroud,</b> Mesut Özil, Theo Walcott, a penalty from Santi Cazorla and a first goal in professional football from Héctor Bellerín. The overall performance was perfect preparation for their North London Derby league match against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. However, Arsenal then lost in that North London derby match on 7 February. Özil gave Arsenal a 1–0 lead but two goals from Harry Kane turned the match on its head as Tottenham won the London derby 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Alexis Sánchez was one {{of three}} players who made their {{competitive}} debuts for Arsenal in the match; for Manchester City, goalkeeper Willy Caballero was selected ahead of Joe Hart. Arsenal began the game more strongly and took the lead when Santi Cazorla scored in the 22nd minute. Their lead was extended two minutes before half time, as Aaron Ramsey finished off a counter-attacking move. Arsenal scored their third of the match soon after the hour mark; Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> shot from outside the penalty box dipped over Caballero and into his goal.|$|R
50|$|Oxlade-Chamberlain {{started on}} the bench for Arsenal's opening day defeat to Liverpool, however Oxlade-Chamberlain {{replaced}} the injured Alex Iwobi to score Arsenal's second goal in a 3-4 defeat. Oxlade-Chamberlain also created an assist for Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> last minute equalizer at Old Trafford as Arsenal sealed a 1-1 draw with Manchester United. Oxlade-Chamberlain also scored a goal against West Ham United and created an assist for a goal from Alexis Sánchez in Arsenal's first away match at the Olympic Stadium, where they won 5-1. He scored three times in Arsenal's 2016-17 EFL Cup campaign where they reached the quarter-finals of the tournament.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Giroud's</b> work in cinema {{began with}} {{director}} Marc Allégret as a script-girl on his 1932 version of Marcel Pagnol's Fanny. In 1936 {{she worked with}} Jean Renoir {{on the set of}} La Grande Illusion. She later wrote screenplays, eventually completed 30 full-length books (both fiction and non-fiction), and wrote newspaper columns. [...] She was the editor of Elle magazine from 1946 (shortly after it was founded) until 1953, when she and Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber founded the French newsmagazine L'Express. She edited L'Express until 1971, then was its director until 1974, when she was asked to participate in the French national government.|$|R
25|$|On December 9, Arsenal {{bounced back}} with a 4–1 away win against Galatasaray in {{the final game of}} the group stage of the Champions League and during the match, Aaron Ramsey scored a double, {{including}} a tremendous 35-yard left-footed volley in the 29th minute, while Lukas Podolski scored what proved to be his two last goals for the club against the club he'd sign for the following summer. Mathieu Debuchy also returned to the starting line-up after three months out with his injury. Arsenal progressed to the next round of the Champions league as the runners-up of their group, being drawn against Monaco (having faced the French side in the Emirates Cup). On 13 December, Santi Cazorla scored a brace on his 30th birthday as Arsenal recorded a second successive 4-1 win, against Newcastle at Emirates Stadium. Olivier <b>Giroud</b> also scored a brace, showing his full fitness and his form. On 21 December, Arsenal took on Premier League strugglers Liverpool at Anfield. In the match, Philippe Coutinho gave Liverpool the lead but Debuchy's first goal for Arsenal levelled the scoring. In the second half, <b>Giroud</b> gave Arsenal the lead. Fabio Borini was sent off for a high kick on Santi Cazorla (a challenge that tore the Spaniard's shirt), but in the 97th minute of the match, Martin Škrtel gave Liverpool an equaliser, the match ending 2–2.|$|E
25|$|On 10 February, Arsenal beat Leicester City 2–1 at the Emirates. Five days later, Arsenal {{began their}} FA Cup fifth round match {{at home against}} Middlesbrough (who knocked out Manchester City in the fourth round). Arsenal beat Middlesbrough 2–0, with two goals both scored by Olivier <b>Giroud.</b> It was also a match in which Gabriel made his debut for the club. Arsenal {{would go on to}} face Manchester United in the quarter-finals of this FA Cup. In the next {{penultimate}} weekend of league football, Arsenal travelled to the south of London and beat Crystal Palace 2–1.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March, Arsenal {{took a trip}} to Monaco {{for their}} Champions League second leg match and needed to score at least three goals to {{progress}} to the quarter-finals of the European competition. Olivier <b>Giroud</b> scored the first goal of the match and Aaron Ramsey added a second. The Gunners had several other chances but {{could not find a}} third goal as the match ended 2–0, making it 3–3 on aggregate. Monaco went through to the quarter-finals due to the away goals rule as Arsenal were eliminated from the Champions League at this round for the fifth consecutive season. Their final game in March was a 2–1 away victory over Newcastle.|$|E
50|$|Arsenal began October with a 3-1 Premier League {{win against}} West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground. After conceding an early goal from Mohamed Diamé, Arsenal netted late twice, {{including}} Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> first Premier League goal. Following an international break, Arsenal travelled to Carrow Road to face third-bottom Norwich City, and lost 1-0 through a 20-minute Grant Holt goal after a Vito Mannone spill, in an unconcinving display from the Gunners. Their poor form continued in a Champions League clash with Schalke 04, conceding {{twice in a}} 2-0 loss (their first at the Emirates in a European group stage match), putting Arsenal second in Group B with three games to play.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 April, Özil made {{an instant}} impact with a lively display against Hull when he {{returned}} to the Arsenal team in a 3-0 win. He then returned to goalscoring form with Arsenal's second in their 3-0 win over Newcastle United, and then assisted Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> header. Manager Wenger praised Özil's impact upon his return, saying, [...] "Mesut Özil is very important for the team. He's been missed while he's been injured. We've missed some very important players in an important period of the season. We're really pleased to have people like him back in the team and performing at the top level because that's what we need." ...|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the second half, Arsenal came out on top, {{constantly}} pressing for an equaliser. They were denied two penalties by referee Lee Probert before they finally got an equaliser in the 71st minute, with centre-back Laurent Koscielny bundling a header from Bacary Sagna over the line following a corner. Many believed that a goal kick should have been given instead of a corner as it appeared that substitute Yaya Sanogo got the last touch. In the 79th minute, Gibbs had a chance to put Arsenal in front when he had just goalkeeper Allan McGregor to beat, but he could not hit the target, shooting high of the goal. Arsenal had another chance for a winning goal in injury time, but Olivier <b>Giroud's</b> shot was saved by McGregor.|$|R
