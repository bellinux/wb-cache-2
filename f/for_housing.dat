5|$|Kingstonian F.C. {{remained}} at Richmond Road {{for most of}} the 20th Century, it thus being referred to as the club's 'traditional home'. The club's record home attendance of 8,960 was attained there in 1955 in a match against Bishop Auckland F.C. The maintenance of the site increasingly became more than the club's income could support and parts of the site were sold off for redevelopment; the 'Kingstonian petrol station' occupying much of the Richmond Road frontage since 1956, and the former running track and reserve pitch redeveloped <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> in the 1970s. The club eventually sold the site and moved out of Richmond Road in 1988. The stadium was demolished after 1989 and the remainder of the site redeveloped <b>for</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{measures}} for mitigation of Particulate Matter (PM) emissions are needed <b>for</b> poultry <b>houses</b> {{to lower their}} contribution to elevated ambient PM concentrations. In this study, we 1) investigated whether on-farm drying systems (DS) for poultry manure can remove PM from the exhaust air flow, and 2) evaluated the contribution of DS to ammonia emissions. At two layer facilities, a total of twelve 24 -hour measurements were carried out of temperature, relative humidity, ventilation rate, PM and ammonia between December 2009 and February 2010. A substantial removal of inhalable dust (69 % <b>for</b> <b>house</b> 1), PM 10 (83 % <b>for</b> <b>house</b> 1; 33 % <b>for</b> <b>house</b> 2) and PM 2. 5 (57 % <b>for</b> <b>house</b> 1; 32 % <b>for</b> <b>house</b> 2) was found. Concentrations of ammonia however, increased by a factor 5. 0 (house 1) and 3. 6 (house 2) over the manure layer. This study shows that DS for poultry manure show good ability to remove PM, but further research is necessary to avoid problem swapping by elevating emissions of other pollutants...|$|R
