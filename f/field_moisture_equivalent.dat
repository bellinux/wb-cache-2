It is measured by saturating sample of soil 1 cm thick, and subjecting it to a centrifugal force of 1000 times gravity for 30 min.

Field soil deposits generally have much lower gravimetric water content ranging between 9 and 45 %. Given the wide disparity in the solids: water ratio employed in the batch experiment technique and that prevailing in field deposits, this paper examines the lead retention characteristics of soils at <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> contents (6 %, 13 %, and 25 %) using artificially lead-contaminated soil specimens. A residually derived (i. e., formed by in-situ weathering of parent rock) red soil was used to prepare the artificially contaminated soil specimens. The impact of variations in clay content on lead retention was examined by diluting the residual soil with various amounts (0 to 60 %) of river sand. Soil specimens remolded at 6 and 13 % moisture contents produced very stiff to hard soils on compaction, while specimens remolded at 25 % moisture content existed in the slurry state. The soil specimens were contaminated with low (30 mg/kg) to high (2500 mg/kg) concentrations of lead ions by remolding them with 160 ppm to 10, 000 ppm ionic lead solutions. Lead retention by soils at <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> contents was determined by extracting the lead from the soil using a water leach test.

How these soils will respond to changes in their temperature, moisture, and overlying vegetation is uncertain but critical to understand given the large soil C stocks in these regions. We used a laboratory experiment to examine how temperature and moisture control CO 2 and CH 4 emissions from mineral soils sampled {{from the bottom of}} the annual active layer, i. e., directly above permafrost, in an Alaskan boreal forest. Gas emissions from 30 cores, subjected to two temperatures and either <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> conditions or experimental drought, were tracked over a 100 -day incubation; we also measured a variety of physical and chemical characteristics of the cores. Gravimetric water content was 0. 31  ±  0. 12 (unitless) at the beginning of the incubation; cores at <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> were unchanged at the end, but drought cores had declined to 0. 06  ±  0. 04. Daily CO 2 fluxes were positively correlated with incubation chamber temperature, core water content, and percent soil nitrogen. They also had a temperature sensitivity (Q 10) of 1. 3 and 1. 9 for the <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> and drought treatments, respectively. Daily CH 4 emissions were most strongly correlated with percent nitrogen, but neither temperature nor water content was a significant first-order predictor of CH 4 fluxes. The cumulative production of C from CO 2 was over 6 orders of magnitude higher than that from CH 4; cumulative CO 2 was correlated with incubation temperature and moisture treatment, with drought cores producing 52 – 73  % lower C. Cumulative CH 4 production was unaffected by any treatment. These results suggest that deep active-layer soils may be sensitive to changes in soil moisture under aerobic conditions, a critical factor as discontinuous permafrost thaws in interior Alaska.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Soil {{moisture}} in a crop's root zone must be regularly monitored to accurately predict crop water requirements. Most irrigation scheduling services currently use the neutron probe to monitor soil moisture. Unfortunately, {{there is a}} degree of variability associated with use of the neutron probe creating uncertainty in measurements of soil moisture. A {{review of the literature}} reveals there are three major types of error in estimates of average <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> by the probe: instrument error, calibration error, and location error. Instrument error accounts for random neutron emission by the radioactive probe source. Calibration error is introduced by inaccuracies in the calibration curve. Location error is a result of estimating average soil <b>moisture</b> throughout a <b>field</b> using only point estimates. This study attempts to provide the neutron probe user with a quick and easy means to evaluate estimates of soil moisture by the probe and to identify sources of error. A computer program is developed that quickly and easily analyzes field calibration data to evaluate the error in neutron probe measurements. Field data from Colorado are analyzed as a numerical example of applying the mechanics of the computer model. Similar data from several California soils are analyzed using the model to show how the range of moisture content over which the probe is calibrated restricts accurate neutron probe measurements to the range of calibration data. The Colorado data are further analyzed to determine to what extent measurement errors occuring in the calibration process will contribute to calibration error in general. In most cases, neutron probe access tubes are placed at biased locations within a field and not randomly as is assumed in the model. A method is developed to correct estimates of average <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> by taking this discrepancy into account. Given the variability of <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> content, the number of access tubes that must be sampled to achieve a desired level of accuracy may be calculated using the definition of the student's "t" parameter and referring to specific confidence intervals...|$|R

The mechanisms of this control remain unclear. We quantified {{the dependence of}} soil temperature fluctuations under bryophyte mats on the interplay of bryophyte heat conductance traits, mat thickness, density and moisture regimes. For seventeen predominant bryophytes in six typical subarctic ecosystems, we assessed in situ soil temperature dynamics under bryophyte mats in comparison with bryophyte-removal patches and per-species mat <b>field</b> <b>moisture.</b> In a complimentary laboratory investigation, we studied how per-species bryophyte thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity depend on mat density and moisture content. Subsequently, we tested whether heat transfer through bryophyte mats could be modelled {{as a function of}} mat thickness, thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity, the latter two being determined by mat density and <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> content. Laboratory assessment revealed that bryophyte thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity were independent of mat density, and depended linearly on mat moisture content, but the dependencies were not species-specific. In the field, bryophytes reduced amplitudes of soil temperature fluctuations and freeze-thaw frequency during the growing season, but not mean soil temperature. These effects differed between species and between ecosystems, being strongest in Sphagnum fuscum-dominated dry tundra, but were well explained by bryophyte mat thickness and <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> content as affecting thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity. We suggest that reduction in soil temperature amplitudes is a generic feature in (sub) arctic ecosystems and should be considered as an important mechanism of bryophyte control on carbon and nutrient turnover. Although heat transfer through bryophyte mats differs greatly among species and ecosystems, species differences are fully explained by differences in mat thickness and moisture content and generally comply with physical laws, without deviations due to biological processes. These results imply that in global vegetation models of carbon and nutrient cycling, the heat transfer through bryophyte mats can be modelled without taking into consideration bryophyte species composition, but considering bryophyte mat depth and moisture availability only. This will allow us to enhance modelling precision through an improved representation of the soil temperature regime. © 2013 British Ecological Society...|$|R
