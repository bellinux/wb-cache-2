40|$|Research into knots, splices {{and other}} methods of forming an <b>eye</b> <b>termination</b> has been limited, {{despite the fact}} that they are {{essential}} and strongly affect the performance of a rope. The aim of this study was to carry out a comprehensive initial assessment of the breaking strength of <b>eye</b> <b>terminations</b> commonly used in a sailing environment, thereby providing direction for further work in the field. Supports for use in a regular tensile testing machine were specially developed to allow individual testing of each sample and a realistic spread of statistical data to be obtained. Over 180 break tests were carried out on four knots (the bowline, double bowline, figure-of-eight loop and perfection loop) and two splices (three-strand eye splice and braid-on-braid splice). The factors affecting their strength were investigated. A statistical approach to the analysis of the results was adopted. The type of knot was found to have a significant effect on the strength. This same effect was seen in both types of rope construction (three-strand and braid-on-braid). Conclusions were also drawn as to the effect of splice length, eye size, manufacturer and rope diameter on the breaking strength of splices. Areas of development and further investigation were identified...|$|R

To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves were developed during the Renaissance, and these stockings were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a <b>ferrule</b> to <b>secure</b> the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.|$|R

5000|$|The lead of {{the pencil}} {{is a mix of}} finely ground {{graphite}} and clay powders. Before the two substances are mixed, they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes. Once the cakes have fully dried, the graphite and the clay squares are mixed together using water. The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended pencil hardness (lower proportions of clay makes the core softer), and {{the amount of time spent}} on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead. The mixture is then shaped into long spaghetti-like strings, straightened, dried, cut, and then tempered in a kiln. The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax, which seeps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil. A juniper or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a [...] "slat," [...] and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencils, which are then varnished or painted. Many pencils feature an eraser on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point. Each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal <b>ferrule</b> to be <b>secured</b> onto the wood. A rubber plug is then inserted into the ferrule for a functioning eraser on the end of the pencil.|$|R

40|$|The {{migration}} of an encircling silicone band through a rectus muscle {{is a rare}} postoperative complication associated with scleral buckling surgery for retinal detachment. In this present study, we describe what {{we believe to be}} the first reported case of a patient who experienced postoperative {{migration of}} an encircling silicone band through the rectus muscle, despite the band being surgically secured to the sclera in a scleral tunnel. A 58 -year-old man presented with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in his left eye. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed with the placement of an encircling silicone band, and the patient’s retina was successfully reattached. One year postoperatively, the encircling band became exposed on the nasal side of the conjunctiva next to the limbus without any symptoms. Two weeks later, the exposed encircling band was surgically removed without any complications. The findings of this study show that even when an encircling silicone band is surgically <b>secured</b> around the <b>eye,</b> periodic and careful postoperative follow-up examinations should be performed to ensure no migration of the band...|$|R
40|$|As flies {{navigate}} {{their environment}} {{in search of}} food or mates, they execute sharp turns known as saccades that occur faster than the blink of a human eye. These maneuvers are initiated by changes in visual motion detected by the <b>eyes,</b> whereas their <b>termination</b> is under the control of small, dumbbell-shaped structures called halteres. The halteres are located behind the forewings and evolved from the hindwings. These structures oscillate during flight and function as biological gyroscopes; they detect unexpected body rotations during flight and trigger wing reflex maneuvers. Like the wings, the halteres possess a small set of muscles that control the structure’s motion from their base and receive input from the visual system. However, while the critical role of the halteres in stabilizing flight is long known as flies crash catastrophically without them, the role of the haltere and its steering muscles during flight maneuvers remains unclear. Using fluorescence imaging of the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP 6 f, we observed haltere steering muscle activity in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, during a broad array of visual stimuli. We found that these muscles are particularly responsive during voluntary escape maneuvers and are tuned to rotations about the body’s cardinal axes. These results suggest that the visual system is able to activate individual muscles to control haltere motion, and thus mechanosensory input. With this work, we are beginning to understand how hard-wired reflexes may be modified by the nervous system to produce voluntary behaviors...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} leflunomide in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in rats. METHODS: Lewis rats were immunized with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding peptide (IRBP) in order to generate EAU. Rats received three dose of leflunomide through intragastric administration (prevention or treatment protocols) after immunization at three separate doses (3 mg/kg/d; 6 mg/kg/d; 12 mg/kg/d). Cyclosporin A was administered as a positive) control. Rats were euthanized during peak disease activity (day 14 or 15). Treatment effectiveness was evaluated in vivo using clinical EAU scoring (d 14) and histopathological evaluation of enucleated <b>eyes</b> after experimental <b>termination.</b> The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum were quantified by ELISA. Eyeball of rats were harvested and mRNA expression of interleukin 17 (IL 17) and IFN-γ were quantified through RT-PCR. Intracellular expression of interleukin (IL) - 17 in the activated CD 4 (+) T cells was assessed by flow cytometry. The effects of leflunomide inhibition on immune responses in rats were investigated in isolated lymphocytes. RESULTS: Histopathological and clinical data revealed severe intraocular inflammation in the immunized rat. Inflammation reached its peak on day 14 in this EAU model. Treatment with leflunomide significantly prevented and treated EAU-induced ocular inflammation and decreased clinical and pathological scores compared to vehicle-treated eyes. Gene expression of IL 17 and IFN-γ was markedly reduced in leflunomide-treated eyes. Leflunomide significantly decreased the serum levels of IL 17 and IFN-γ. The study of IL 17 + T cells in peripheral blood and spleen by flow cytometry showed a decreased number of Th 17 cell in rats of leflunomide prevented group. Lymphocytes from animals treated with leflunomide had decreased antigen-specific proliferation in vitro compared with lymphocytes from untreated animals. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of leflunomide effectively suppressed IRBP-induced uveitis in rats. These results suggest that leflunomide may be potentially clinical application in uveitis...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the way," [...] {{said the}} little girl; [...] "follow me, gin ye please, sir, but tak tent to your feet;" [...] and, with the daring agility which custom had {{rendered}} easy, she {{vanished from the}} platform on which she stood, and, by notches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into the chasm which it overhung. Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated not to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security, prevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty feet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall, his guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side {{in a situation that}} appeared equally romantic and precarious. They were nearly opposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about one-quarter's depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered, and three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool which received its fall. Both these tremendous points--the first shoot, namely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into which it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole continuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was eddying and boiling in the other. They were so near this grand phenomenon that they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the incessant roar. But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce three yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the chasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully narrow dimensions and uncertain footing. The upper end of the tree rested on the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity extended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was <b>secured,</b> Morton's <b>eye</b> could not discover where. From behind the same projection glimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling water, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange preternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the rising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though even its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth. When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his sleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for hearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his farther passage.|$|R
40|$|Smartphones, {{and other}} similar devices, are ideal for private activities: They are carried on the body and can be {{physically}} <b>secured</b> from prying <b>eyes.</b> They work anywhere. And they are not typically shared among family members or classmates, making them perfect for searching and exploring sensitive information — both via web search or through social information seeking. This paper validates these intuitions empirically, and builds on these observations to investigate the expression of sensitive information needs, such as inquiring about unplanned pregnancies, among users of mobile devices. We examine a large set of queries from the United States (4. 2 million), submitted to Yahoo! Answers, and compare these to the 6. 7 million queries submitted to Yahoo! search. Focusing on community question answering allows much richer analysis of the way information needs are expressed, setting our work apart form previous studies. For the first time, we empirically show that people prefer to express sensitive needs on mobile devices, as this manifests at both the lexical level and the semantic level, using a pre-defined taxonomy of topics. Further, we find that preference for mobile devices for sensitive topics holds true even when controlling for age and gender, which is facilitated by the large sample of users in our study (1. 5 million). In particular, we show that young users, especially females, {{are more likely to}} inquire on sensitive issues, {{and are more likely to}} do this from locations distant from their common place of web access. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date of mobile social information seeking, and is unique in terms of demographic diversity, the granularity of information needs examined, and the analysis of the location-dependence of sensitive information needs...|$|R
60|$|This is a Creature so officious, that 'twill {{be known}} to every one {{at one time}} or other, so busie, and so impudent, that it will be intruding it self in every ones company, and so proud and {{aspiring}} withall, that it fears not to trample on the best, and affects {{nothing so much as a}} Crown; feeds and lives very high, and that makes it so saucy, as to pull any one by the ears that comes in its way, and will never be quiet till it has drawn blood: it is troubled at nothing so much as at a man that scratches his head, as knowing that man is plotting and contriving some mischief against it, and that makes it oftentime sculk into some meaner and lower place, and run behind a mans back, though it go very much against the hair; which ill conditions of it having made it better known then trusted, would exempt me from making any further description of it, did not my faithful Mercury, my Microscope, bring me other information of it. For this has discovered to me, by means of a very bright light cast on it, that it is a Creature of a very odd shape; it has a head shap'd like that exprest in 35. Scheme marked with A, which seems almost Conical, but is a little flatted on the upper and under sides, at the biggest part of which, on either side behind the head (as it were, being the place where other Creatures ears stand) are placed its two black shining goggle eyes BB, looking backwards, and fenced round with several small cilia, or hairs that incompass it, so that it seems this Creature has no very good foresight: It does not seem to have any eye-lids, and therefore perhaps its eyes were so placed, that it might the better cleanse them with its fore-legs; and perhaps this may be the reason, why they so much avoid and run from the light behind them, for being made to live in the shady and dark recesses of the hair, and thence probably their eye having a great aperture, the open and clear light, especially that of the Sun, must needs very much offend them; to <b>secure</b> these <b>eyes</b> from receiving any injury from the hairs through which it passes, it has two horns that grow before it, in the place where one would have thought the eyes should be; each of these CC hath four joynts, which are fringed, as 'twere, with small brisles, from which to the tip of its snout D, the head seems very round and tapering, ending in a very sharp nose D, which seems to have a small hole, and to be the passage through which he sucks the blood. Now whereas if it be plac'd on its back, with its belly upwards, as it is in the 35. Scheme, it seems in several Positions to have a resemblance of chaps, or jaws, as is represented in the Figure by EE, yet in other postures those dark strokes disappear; and having kept several of them in a box for two or three dayes, so that for all that time they had nothing to feed on, I found, upon letting one creep on my hand, that it immediately fell to sucking, and did neither seem to thrust its nose very deep into the skin, nor to open any kind of mouth, but I could plainly perceive a small current of blood, which came directly from its snout, and past into its belly; and about A there seem'd a contrivance, somewhat resembling a Pump, pair of Bellows, or Heart, for by a very swift systole and diastole the blood seem'd drawn from the nose, and forced into the body. It did not seem at all, though I viewed it a good while as it was sucking, to thrust more of its nose into the skin then the very snout D, nor did it cause the least discernable pain, and yet the blood seem'd to run through its head very quick and freely, so that it seems there is no part of the skin but the blood is dispers'd into, nay, even into the cuticula; for had it thrust its whole nose in from D to CC, it would not have amounted to the supposed thickness of that tegument, the length of the nose being not more then a three hundredth part of an inch. It has six legs, covered with a very transparent shell, and joynted exactly like a Crab's, or Lobster's; each leg is divided into six parts by these joynts, and those have here and there several small hairs; and at the end of each leg it has two claws, very properly adapted for its peculiar use, being thereby inabled to walk very securely both on the skin and hair; and indeed this contrivance of the feet is very curious, and could not be made more commodiously and compendiously, for performing both these requisite motions, of walking and climbing up the hair of a mans head, then it is: for, by having the lesser claw (a) set so much short of the bigger (b) when it walks on the skin the shorter touches not, and then the feet are the same with those of a Mite, and several other small Insects, but by means of the small joynts of the longer claw it can bend it round, and so with both claws take hold of a hair, in the manner represented in the Figure, the long transparent Cylinder FFF, being a Man's hair held by it.|$|R
