5|$|Later, in an on-air {{phone call}} from {{his office at the}} CNN New York bureau, CNN {{vice-president}} of finance Sean Murtagh reported that a large passenger commercial jet <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Center. Eventually, other television networks interrupted regular broadcasting with news of the crash. President George W. Bush was arriving at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. Initial news reports speculated that the crash had been an accident until United Airlines Flight 175 was flown into the South Tower 17 minutes after Flight 11 made impact.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, {{two days}} after the cyclone <b>had</b> <b>hit,</b> <b>the</b> Indian Government {{launched}} a massive relief and rescue operation. The Indian Army and Naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone, and also dropped food packets. Although the Indian Government did not request international assistance, the Red Cross provided food, oil, medicines and water tanks for the affected families; the wcc/cicarws issued an appeal for $ (1990USD) so they could provide immediate needs with World Vision providing $ (1990USD) for food blankets and utensils.|$|E
5|$|Brodie joined Southport {{permanently}} on 18 June 2014, being {{signed by}} his former York and Hereford manager Foyle. His first appearance after signing permanently {{came as a}} 62nd-minute substitute for Scott Kay in a 0–0 away draw with Torquay United on 16 August 2014, before starting the following match, a 2–1 home win over Altrincham a week later, scoring Southport's first goal after reacting first to a John Marsden header that <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> post. Brodie was Southport's top scorer in 2014–15 with 14 goals from 41 appearances as Southport finished 19th in the Conference Premier. He signed a new contract with the club in May 2015.|$|E

5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} out for 31 after two hours of batting. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The hosts’ captain packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Barnes reached his half-century after 135 minutes at the crease with a pull for four from Charlie Barnett. The score progressed to 121 before Barnes cut Jim Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. The ball bounced away, but the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Ernest Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball into the ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point {{on the other side}} of the field, before ruling the batsman out. Keith Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to leave Australia's total at 3/121. Australia went on to reach 509 all out on the third day, yielding a 344-run first innings lead.|$|E
5|$|By about 05:00, Dyck's {{ammunition}} {{supplies were}} running low, and the ZIPRA attackers <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> Alamo {{a number of}} times with RPG fire. Nobody inside was killed by these rockets, but when Dyck's dog was wounded, the major flew into a rage and ordered his men to pour more aggressive machine gun fire on the advancing ZIPRA combatants. He requested air support from Brigade HQ {{in the form of a}} Lynx light bomber. The air force turned down the request, but Flight Lieutenant Colin James took off anyway in his Lynx armed with an FN MAG machine gun and SNEB rockets. The ZIPRA cadres concentrated a huge amount of fire on James' aircraft, and hit it several times, but failed to shoot it down; the pilot put in a number of ground attacks before returning to base. He reported afterwards that a bullet had entered through the floor of his cockpit and hit his helmet. The 1RAR officers and men expressed great admiration for James's bravery during this air strike, but his air force superiors were furious that he had gone into the operational area against orders.|$|E
5|$|Rapid, however, appealed, {{citing the}} alleged injury to their player. The initial appeal was {{dismissed}} by UEFA, but a second appeal {{from the club}} was upheld and a replay was ordered to take place at least 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Glasgow. The Celtic board acquiesced to this decision in spite of considered opinion that Celtic should withdraw from the tournament on principle. As such, the match at Parkhead was declared void and a third match was held in Manchester at Old Trafford. Celtic lost 0–1, the goal coming on 18 minutes when after Roy Aitken <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> post with an effort for Celtic, Rapid immediately caught Celtic on the break to score the only goal of the game. Worse, two Celtic fans assaulted Rapid Wien players; one fan running onto the pitch and accosting the goalkeeper during the game, whilst at full-time another Rapid player was kicked by a fan. UEFA fined Celtic and ordered their next home European tie to take place behind closed doors.|$|E

5|$|The score had {{progressed to}} 121 when Barnes {{tried to cut}} Laker, but only edged it onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball into the ground before Evans took the catch, and {{consulted}} with Chester, who had been standing at point {{on the other side}} of the field, before ruling the batsman out. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck in Laker's next over without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which drifted away and went straight on instead of turning inwards, thereby clipping the outside edge of his bat. The ball flew to slip where Edrich completed the catch. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, a position usually occupied by vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, a more sedate batsman, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's {{proposals that}} the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker {{to try the}} fuses {{for a couple of}} months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> stationary wreck, but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E

25|$|The plague theory, which {{suggests}} a severe epidemic outbreak might <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> heavily populated Angkor, {{contributed to the}} fall of the empire, has been reconsidered. By the 14th century, the Black Death had affected Asia, as the plague first appeared in China around 1330 and reached Europe around 1345. Most seaports along the line of travel from China to Europe felt the impact of the disease, which might had a severe impact on life throughout Southeast Asia. Possible disease include bubonic plague, smallpox or malaria.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 2010, the West African {{nation of}} Chad {{was on the}} verge of a {{nationwide}} famine as drought, armed conflict, and an influx of Darfur refugees all contributed to a chronic food shortage that now affects 2,000,000 people (20% of the country's total population). Various aid groups, NGOs and charities said a catastrophic famine could hit the country in the near future if food relief does not arrive soon.

25|$|Many Stanford {{players and}} coaches objected {{immediately}} to the third lateral, from Dwight Garner to Richard Rodgers, asserting that Garner's knee was down moments beforehand. Kevin Lamar, a Stanford player who was in on the tackle, maintains that Garner's knee <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> turf {{while he was still}} in possession of the ball; Garner and Rodgers themselves, however, assert the opposite. TV replays were inconclusive; due to the distance from the camera and the swarm of tacklers, one cannot see the exact moment Garner's knee may have touched.|$|E
