25|$|The Aegis BMD {{uses the}} RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 mid-course interceptors and the RIM-156 Standard Extended Range Block IV (SM-2ER Block IV) terminal-phase interceptors {{developed}} by Raytheon. The Standard Missile 3 is a {{development of the}} SM2ER Block IV, capable of intercepting ballistic missiles above the atmosphere (i.e., exo-atmospheric intercept) during the midcourse phase of a hostile ballistic missile's flight. The missile is launched from the MK 41 vertical launching system (VLS) of the warships. It receives in-flight target updates from the ship. The kinetic warhead (KW) is designed to destroy a ballistic missile's warhead with more than 130 megajoules of kinetic energy by colliding with it. The existing SM-3 Block IA version will be upgraded to SM-3 Block IB, SM-3 Block IIA and SM-3 Block IIB to counter future ballistic missile threats. The SM-2 Block IV can engage the ballistic missiles within the atmosphere (i.e., endoatmospheric intercept) in the terminal phase of a missile's trajectory. The missile carries a blast fragmentation warhead. The SM-2ER Block IV was further developed in a new extended range RIM-174 Standard ERAM (Standard Missile 6), which adds an active radar <b>homing</b> <b>seeker.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Stored {{horizontally}} in a launcher shelter with movable roof, {{the missile}} was erected, fired vertically using rocket boosters to high altitude, and then tipped {{over into a}} horizontal Mach 2.5 cruise powered by ramjet engines. This lofted trajectory allowed the missile to operate at a maximum range as great as [...] Controlled from the ground {{for most of its}} flight, when it reached the target area it was commanded to begin a dive, activating an onboard active radar <b>homing</b> <b>seeker</b> for terminal guidance. A radar proximity fuse detonated the warhead, either a large conventional explosive or the W40 nuclear warhead.|$|E
2500|$|Brimstone is an air-launched {{ground attack}} missile {{developed}} by MBDA for Britain's Royal Air Force. It was originally intended for [...] "fire-and-forget" [...] use against mass formations of enemy armour, using a millimetric wave (mmW) active radar <b>homing</b> <b>seeker</b> to ensure accuracy even against moving targets. Experience in Afghanistan {{led to the}} addition of laser guidance in the dual-mode Brimstone missile, allowing a [...] "spotter" [...] to pick out specific targets when friendly forces or civilians were in the area. The tandem shaped charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM-65G Maverick, while the small blast area minimises collateral damage. Three Brimstones are carried on a launcher that occupies a single weapon station, allowing a single aircraft to carry many missiles.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} {{unconfirmed}} reports of other possible {{versions of the}} missile with both infra-red and semi-active radar terminal <b>homing</b> <b>seekers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The K-33 was {{evaluated}} with the RGS-33 SARH seeker and the TGS-33 IR seeker. Other candidates included active radar homing and dual IR/radar <b>homing</b> <b>seekers.</b> The final {{decision was made}} in favor of semi-active radar homing with an inertial initial stage. The homing device, designated MFBU-410 was developed by B.I.Ermakov {{under the supervision of}} Akopyan.|$|R
2500|$|To ensure {{survivability}} to {{and effectiveness}} against a target, the LRASM {{is equipped with}} a BAE Systems-designed seeker and guidance system, integrating jam-resistant GPS/INS, passive RF and threat warning receiver, an imaging infrared (IIR infrared <b>homing)</b> <b>seeker</b> with automatic scene/target matching recognition, a data-link, and passive Electronic Support Measure (ESM) and radar warning receiver sensors. [...] Artificial intelligence software combines these features to locate enemy ships and avoid neutral shipping in crowded areas. [...] Automatic dissemination of emissions data is classified, located, and identified for path of attack; the data-link allows other assets to feed the missile a real-time electronic picture of the enemy battlespace. [...] Multiple missiles can work together to share data to coordinate an attack in a swarm. [...] Aside from short, low-power data-link transmissions, the LRASM does not emit signals, which combined with the low-RCS JASSM airframe and low IR signature reduces detectability. [...] Unlike previous radar-only seeker-equipped missiles that went on to hit other vessels if diverted or decoyed, the multi-mode seeker ensures the correct target is hit in a specific area of the ship. [...] An LRASM can find its own target autonomously by using its active radar homing to locate ships in an area, then using passive measures once on terminal approach. [...] Like the JASSM, the LRASM is capable of hitting land targets.|$|E

50|$|During the mid-life upgrade of PL-10, the {{semi-active}} radar <b>homing</b> (SARH) <b>seeker</b> {{was replaced}} by active radar <b>homing</b> (ARH) <b>seekers,</b> resulting in two versions, one with a Russian ARH seeker, the other with a domestic Chinese ARH seeker. The K/AAK-10 is the version with an active seeker, but it's not clear {{if it is the}} one with a foreign ARH seeker or a domestic seeker.|$|R
50|$|Soviet {{practice}} was to manufacture most air-to-air missiles with interchangeable IR-homer and semi-active radar <b>homing</b> (SARH) <b>seekers</b> - however, an SARH {{version of the}} R-60 was never contemplated due to {{the small size of}} the missile which makes a radar-homing version with an antenna of reasonable size impractical.|$|R
50|$|The Northrop Grumman Brilliant Anti-Tank (BAT) is a United States {{submunition}} round dispensed from a missile. It {{is capable}} of independently identifying and attacking armored vehicles. The BAT uses acoustic sensors to identify its intended targets, and an infrared <b>homing</b> (IR) terminal <b>seeker</b> to image and aim at the attack target.|$|R

50|$|The K-8's {{development}} {{began in}} 1955, known as R-8 in service. Like most Soviet air-to-air missiles, {{it was made}} {{with a choice of}} semi-active radar <b>homing</b> or infrared <b>seeker</b> heads. The original missile was compatible with the Uragan-5B radar used on the Sukhoi Su-11 and several developmental aircraft from Mikoyan-Gurevich.|$|R
50|$|The {{difficulties}} {{associated with}} beam-riding guidance, {{particularly in a}} single-seat fighter aircraft, were substantial, making the 'Alkali' primarily a short-range anti-bomber missile. Around 1967 the K-5 {{was replaced by the}} K-55 (R-55 in service), which replaced the beam-riding seeker with the semi-active radar <b>homing</b> or infrared <b>seekers</b> of the K-13 (AA-2 'Atoll'). The weapon was 7.8 kg heavier than the K-5, but had a smaller 9.1 kg warhead. The K-55 remained in service through about 1977, probably being retired with the last of the Sukhoi Su-9 interceptors.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a mobile version of the phased array radar {{developed}} in the late 1990s which could provide all-round radar cover with four separate faces but with a much decreased detection range. This version only appeared in public once but was never put into service. The development of Sky Bow 2 started around 1986, this added a tandem boost motor and an active radar <b>homing</b> terminal <b>seeker.</b> Proposals were reported to develop Sky Bow 2 into a surface-to-surface missile; unconfirmed reports suggest that this missile is known as Tien Chi. Modifications {{have been developed for}} Sky Bow 2, changing it into a single-stage rocket and to provide it with a limited capability against shorter-range ballistic missiles; the first test firing against a ballistic missile target was reported in September 2008. Seven batteries of TK-1/2 SAMs are in service and deployed throughout Taiwan, on the Pescadores, and Dong Ying island.|$|R

5000|$|CAMM has {{a minimum}} {{operational}} range {{of less than}} 1 km and a maximum range greater than 25 km, although IHS Jane's reports that trials have a shown a capability of up to 60 km. These ranges are significantly greater than the 1-10 km range of Sea Wolf and other systems CAMM will replace. CAMM is 99 kg in weight, 3.2 m in length, 166 mm diameter and reaches generous supersonic speeds of Mach 3 (or 1,020 meters per second). CAMM is a ship point defence and local area defence missile designed to respond to sophisticated missile attacks and has the capability to defend against saturation attacks of supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles, aircraft and other high-performance targets. It does this via multiple channels of fire, providing 360-degree coverage and high degrees of manoeuvrability. MBDA state that CAMM has a [...] "high rate of fire against multiple simultaneous targets", providing capabilities comparable to the Aster 15 missile. In flight, the missile can receive mid-course guidance via a datalink before the active <b>homing</b> radar <b>seeker</b> takes over for the final approach to target. This does away {{with the need for}} separate tracking radars, making CAMM compatible with any 2D or 3D surveillance radars and allows targets to be hit that are not in line-of-sight.|$|R
50|$|The J-8H {{configuration}} {{features the}} more powerful WP-13B turbojet engines, improved avionics and the improved Type 1471 pulse-doppler fire control radar with look-down/shoot-down capability {{and a range of}} new operating modes. With the radar upgrade comes the ability to fire the PL-11 and the PL-12/SD-10 MRAAM, which employs an Active radar <b>homing</b> (ARH) <b>seeker.</b> The J-8H also is equipped with IFR probe, INS/GPS, HOTAS, and an integrated ECM suite, with twin wing fences {{on each side of the}} wings that greatly increased handling ability. The J-8Ds heavier airframe is used but with modified wing fences. Production of the J-8H and the J-8D it had superseded has now ceased in favor of upgrading earlier J-8D aircraft to J-8H standards. It is uncertain if the older J-8B will be upgraded to J-8H standards given the difference in airframe. The J-8F is the most modern and capable J-8 variant currently in service and has been in production since 2003. The J-8H/F has inherited many of the improvements of the earlier J-8C and F-8IIM, and in some cases, has improved on them. The J-8F features a glass cockpit, a more powerful WP-13BII turbojet engine and enhanced Type 1492 radar for enhanced air-to-air capabilities with the PL-12 active radar homing medium range air-to-air missile, full air-to-ground and air-to-sea capabilities using the AS-17 'Krypton' anti-radar missile, and a variety of Chinese designed precision guided laser and satellite guided bombs, making it the first true Multirole combat aircraft variant of the J-8 series. The J-8F also possesses all the avionic and electronic upgrades the J-8H received. The earlier J-8B/Ds can be easily distinguished from later J-8H/Fs by their dark green radomes, compared to the latter's black radomes. Introduction of {{the more powerful}} WP-14 Kunlun turbojet engine for the J-8 series is planned to go under way in the coming years. The J-8F also serves in the People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force as well. A notable variant of the J-8F is the JZ-8F which has quietly been introduced into the PLAAF in the tactical reconnaissance role. Very little information has been released on the JZ-8F, other than the use of an internal camera compartment which replaces the twin 23 mm cannon, rather than a camera pod as used by the older JZ-8.|$|R
5000|$|The RIM-66M is {{the version}} of the Standard missile two medium-range (SM-2MR) {{currently}} in service with the USN aboard Ticonderoga-class cruisers and s. The missile is specifically designed for the Aegis Combat System and the Mk41 Vertical launch system. The Block III missiles differ from earlier blocks {{by the addition of}} the MK 45 MOD 9 target detecting device, for improved performance against low altitude targets. The Block IIIB missile additionally has a dual semi-active/infrared <b>seeker</b> for terminal <b>homing.</b> The dual <b>seeker</b> is intended for use in high-ECM environments, against targets over the horizon or with a small radar cross section. The seeker was originally developed for the canceled AIM-7R Sparrow air-to-air missile. All USN Block III and IIIA missiles are to be upgraded to Block IIIB. Block IIIA missiles are operated by the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force on its [...] and [...] Aegis destroyers. Aegis equipped vessels in the Spanish and South Korean navies use it as well. The Dutch and German Navies have added it to the Anti-Air Warfare system, which uses the Thales Nederland Active Phased Array Radar and Smart-L radar. South Korean KDX-II destroyers use the block IIIA with a New Threat Upgrade compatible guided missile fire control system. Block III variants for Aegis and arm launchers are designated RIM-66L. Block III missiles for New Threat Upgrade systems are designated RIM-66K. Block IIIB missiles were not produced for the New Threat Upgrade. Blocks IIIA and IIIB are the current production versions. The Thales Nederland STIR 1.8 and 2.4 fire control systems are also supported.|$|R
50|$|The Anza (عنزہ Anza) is {{a series}} of shoulder-fired, man-portable surface-to-air {{missiles}} produced by Pakistan. Guided by an infra-red <b>homing</b> <b>seeker,</b> the Anza is used for low level air defence.|$|E
50|$|The missile {{features}} a highly sensitive infrared <b>homing</b> <b>seeker,</b> which {{is capable of}} identifying targets with an extremely low infrared signature, such as other missiles or UAVs, but also aircraft and helicopters.|$|E
50|$|There are two MICA variants; MICA RF has {{an active}} radar <b>homing</b> <b>seeker</b> and MICA IR has an imaging infra-red <b>homing</b> <b>seeker.</b> Both seekers are {{designed}} to filter out counter-measures such as chaff and decoy flares. A thrust vector control unit fitted to the rocket motor increases the missile’s agility. The missile is capable of lock-on after launch (LOAL) which means {{it is capable of}} engaging targets outside its seeker’s at-launch acquisition range. Mounted on the Rafale, the MICA IR can provide IR imagery to the central data processing system, thus acting as an extra sensor.|$|E
50|$|The R-Darter is a beyond {{visual range}} (BVR) air-to-air missile guided by an active radar <b>homing</b> <b>seeker.</b> It was {{designed}} and manufactured by the South African firm Kentron, now known as Denel Dynamics.|$|E
50|$|The {{final version}} of the missile was to have been the AIM-7R, which added an {{infrared}} <b>homing</b> <b>seeker</b> to an otherwise unchanged AIM-7P Block II. A general wind-down of the budget led to it being cancelled in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|Anza Mk-II - A third {{generation}} MANPADS, {{believed to be}} based on the Chinese QW-1 MANPADS. Uses a dual-band, cross-scan infra-red <b>homing</b> <b>seeker</b> to counter decoy flares.

50|$|The H-4's stated {{range of}} 120 km and its glide bomb design {{has led to}} {{speculation}} {{that it may be}} a copy or a Pakistani variant of the Denel Raptor II glide bomb, which is also guided by an infrared <b>homing</b> <b>seeker</b> and has a range of 120 km.|$|E
50|$|Terminal {{guidance}} {{is provided}} by an active radar <b>homing</b> <b>seeker</b> which is a joint development (June 2003) between MBDA's Seeker Division and Thales Airborne Systems and builds on their co-operation on the AD4A (Active Anti-Air Seeker) family of seekers that equip the MICA and ASTER missiles. Thales produces four sub-assemblies representing approximately 35% of the seeker.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time (middle 1970s) {{aerospike}} was developed in KBM for 9M39 surface-to-air missile of 9K38 Igla MANPADS (in order to diminish heating of infrared <b>homing</b> <b>seeker</b> fairing and reduce wave drag), giving the name to the whole system (игла means 'needle'). Simplified Igla-1 version with {{a different kind of}} target seeker featured a tripod instead of 'needle' for the same purpose.|$|E
50|$|The GBU-44/B Viper Strike glide bomb is a GPS-aided laser-guided {{variant of}} the Northrop Grumman Brilliant Anti-Tank (BAT) munition which {{originally}} had a combination acoustic and infrared <b>homing</b> <b>seeker.</b> The system was initially intended for use from UAVs, and {{it has also been}} integrated with the Lockheed AC-130 gunship, giving that aircraft a precision stand-off capability. The Viper Strike is now produced by MBDA.|$|E
50|$|The H-4 SOW (Stand-Off Weapon) is a precision-guided glide bomb {{manufactured}} by Pakistan and deployed by the Pakistan Air Force, capable of striking targets at stand-off range.
