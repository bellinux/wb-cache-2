5|$|This sparrow feeds {{primarily}} on small grass and forb seeds, fresh grass stems, and tender plant shoots during autumn and winter.

5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer,</b> {{when the light}} was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which {{were given to the}} stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E

Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly, with the approval of Governor Penn, to reintroduce the scalp bounties offered during the French and Indian War, which paid money for every Native killed above the age of ten, including women.|$|E

5|$|River {{dolphins}} are {{not very}} widely distributed; they are all restricted to certain rivers or deltas. This makes them extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction.

Calves are typically born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. River dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{journalist}} Carol Off began {{research to}} write a biography of Louise Arbour. Following input from fellow journalist and author Stevie Cameron, she broadened the book's scope to include profiles of Roméo Dallaire and Lewis MacKenzie. Along with her research assistant Sian Cansfield, they compiled twenty binders of research and conducted over a hundred interviews, including with the three subjects. For the historical background on Rwanda, she consulted the works of Gérard Prunier, Philip Gourevitch, Alison Des Forges, and the Human Rights Watch. For background on the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, she consulted, amongst others, the works of Noel Malcolm, David Rieff, Roy Gutman. Living in Toronto with husband Linden MacIntyre, the 45-year-old author wrote the book <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> of 2000.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, Andronicus tried {{once more}} to strike a decisive blow back at the Turks, this time hiring Catalan mercenaries. Under the {{guidance}} of Michael IX and the leadership of Roger de Flor, the 6,500-strong Catalan Company <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> of 1303 managed to drive back the Turks. The mercenaries' onslaught drove the Turks back from Philadelphia to Cyzicus, in the process causing great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. When they finally left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.|$|E

5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested {{not only that the}} faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> of 1942, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin {{regularly}} toured {{villages in}} the Goražde, Kalinovik and Foča districts, encouraging the local civilians and Chetnik detachments to behave loyally towards the Italians. The Italians were unable to gain German support for their plan to use Chetnik groups as auxiliaries during the joint Italian-German anti-Partisan Operation Trio in April–May. In May, Jevđević met with German intelligence officers in Dubrovnik and was asked whether he would cooperate in the pacification of Bosnia. Mihailović was aware of and condoned the collaborationist arrangements entered into by Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin. Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin frequently met with Chetnik commander Momčilo Đujić in Split, and the three men quarrelled over how to divide the financial assistance they were receiving from the Italians.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises are {{not very}} widespread, with many specialising near the polar regions, usually near the coast. Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid, much {{like the rest of}} the odontocetes.

Calves are typically born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Some porpoises produce a variety of clicks and whistles, which are thought to be primarily for social purposes. A few species, like the harbour porpoise, are highly sociable, but pods generally do not exceed ten individuals for most species.|$|E
