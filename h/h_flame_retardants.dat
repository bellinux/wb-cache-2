Section 3. 2 presents information regarding <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> for polystyrene, Section 3. 3 presents the <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{included in this}} assessment, and Section 3. 4 discusses those <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> that were considered but excluded from the assessment. 3. 1 General Information on <b>Flame</b> <b>Retardants</b> <b>Flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are chemicals used to reduce risk of fire through reducing the ignitability of materials and/or the heat generated from materials. For polymers, the simplest way, in theory, of decreasing flammability is to design the polymer {{so that it is}} thermally stable. Thermally stable polymers are less likely to decompose into combustible gases under heat stress and thus often have higher ignition resistances. Because thermally stable polymers are often difficult and expensive to process, manufacturers use other means, such as adding <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> chemicals, to impart <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> properties to materials. Since there are a large number of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> on the market and they often can be a cost-effective solution for providing fire safety, these chemicals are used in a broad range of products...|$|R

In recent years, organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were used as substitutes for Brominated <b>Flame</b> <b>Retardants.</b> The consume amounts of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in 2001 was about 5 times than that of 2000 in Japan. Recently, several studies have shown the carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> Reducing the risk of fire is the main advantage of using organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> However, there are possible health risks from the toxicity of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> Health and fire risk assessment methods of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were established in this study.

40|$|Brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{have entered}} the human food chain. For the time being the {{occurrence}} of these chemicals in Dutch food does not pose a human health risk. However, this might easily change at increasing contents of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in Dutch food. The monitoring of brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in Dutch food therefore remains necessary. Brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are environmental contaminants which {{have entered the}} human food chain. Next to food these chemicals can also enter the human body by ingestion of house-dust. Due to their persistent behaviour brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> leave the human body very slowly. Brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> therefore have bioaccumulating properties. In {{order to determine the}} health risk of brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> these chemicals have been investigated in Dutch food product and, as a measure of the amount in the body, in Dutch breast milk. In Dutch food twelve <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were found, eleven of which also occurred in breast milk. Contrary to results in Sweden the content of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in Dutch breast milk did not decline between 1998 and 2003. For health risk assessment a maximal allowed intake level is needed. Such an intake level is only available for the <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> PolyBromoDiphenylEther- 99 (PBDE- 99). At the moment the exposure to PBDE- 99 from food equals its maximal intake level. So, though the exposure to PBDE- 99 does not pose an immediate health risk, this may easily change when the content of brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in Dutch food would increase. The continuous monitoring of brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in Dutch food therefore remains necessary...|$|R

50|$|The term <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> subsumes {{a diverse}} group of {{chemicals}} which are added to manufactured materials, such as plastics and textiles, and surface finishes and coatings. <b>Flame</b> <b>retardants</b> inhibit or delay the spread of fire by suppressing the chemical reactions in the flame or by the formation of a protective layer on the surface of a material. They may be mixed with the base material (additive <b>flame</b> <b>retardants)</b> or chemically bonded to it (reactive <b>flame</b> <b>retardants).</b> Mineral <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are typically additive while organohalogen and organophosphorus compounds can be either reactive or additive.|$|R

50|$|Some occupations expose {{workers to}} higher levels of {{halogenated}} <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> and their degradation products.

Workers in electronics recycling plants around the world also have elevated body levels of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> relative to the general population. Environmental controls can substantially reduce this exposure, whereas workers in areas with little oversight can take in very high levels of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> Electronics recyclers in Guiyu, China, have some of the highest human body levels of PBDEs in the world.
