40|$|The {{conventional}} {{interpretation of}} double <b>dissociations</b> {{is that they}} are almost irrefutable evidence of distinctions in both function and type of mental processes, or of separation of cognition into modules. We present a connectionist model that demonstrates apparent double <b>dissociations</b> within a single-route, single-mechanism network and argue that these apparent <b>dissociations</b> are simply the expected tails of a standard bell curve describing network performance. We conclude that within a connectionist model, the appearance of double <b>dissociations</b> may not be evidence for functional or mechanistic separation, and that similar caveats apply to the interpretation of double <b>dissociations</b> in human cognitive behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Masson S. p. A. Category-specific {{disorders}} are perhaps the archetypal example of domain-specificity ??? being typically defined {{by the presence of}} <b>dissociations</b> between living and nonliving naming ability in people following neurological damage. The methods adopted to quantify naming across categories are therefore pivotal since they provide the criterion for defining whether patients have a category effect and necessarily influence the subsequent direction and the interpretation of testing. This paper highlights a series of methodological concerns relating to how we measure and define category (or any) <b>dissociations.</b> These include the common failure to include control data or the use of control data that is inappropriate e. g. at ceiling, unmatched. A review of past cases shows that the overwhelming majority suffers from these problems and therefore challenges conclusions about the purported empirical demonstrations of <b>dissociations</b> and double <b>dissociations</b> in the category specific literature. This is not a refutation of category deficits, but skepticism about the current existence of any convincing empirical demonstrations of category specific double <b>dissociations.</b> As a potential solution, certain minimal criteria are proposed that might aid with the attempt to document category effects that are more methodologically convincing...|$|R

5|$|For {{substances}} in solution the isoelectric point (pI) {{is defined as}} the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species.

5|$|In the gas phase, the {{alkaline}} earth metals do not usually form covalently bonded diatomic molecules like the alkali metals do, since such molecules {{would have the}} same number of electrons in the bonding and antibonding orbitals and would have very low <b>dissociation</b> energies. Thus, the M–M bonding in these molecules is predominantly through van der Waals forces. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Ca2 to Ubn2. On the other hand, their metal–metal bond-dissociation energies generally increase from Ca2 to Ba2 and then drop precipitously to Ubn2, which should be the most weakly bound of all the group 2 homodiatomic molecules. The cause of this trend is the increasing participation of the p3/2 and d electrons as well as the relativistically contracted s orbital. From these M2 <b>dissociation</b> energies, the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) of unbinilium is predicted to be 150kJ·mol−1.|$|E
5|$|Ka is the <b>dissociation</b> {{constant}} of a substituted compound, K is the <b>dissociation</b> constant {{when the}} substituent is hydrogen, ρ is a {{property of the}} unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each substituent. A plot of log(Ka) against σ is a straight line with intercept log(K) and slope ρ. This {{is an example of}} a linear free energy relationship as log(Ka) is proportional to the standard fee energy change. Hammett originally formulated the relationship with data from benzoic acid with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation. This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects.|$|E
40|$|Computer {{modelling}} {{research has}} undermined {{the view that}} double <b>dissociations</b> in behaviour are sufficient to infer separability in the cognitive mechanisms underlying those behaviours. However, all these models employ multi-modal representational schemes, where functional specialisation of processing emerges from the training process. Targeted lesioning of different regions of functional specialisation leads to varied but predictable deficits in model performance. We argue that multi-modal representational schemes are not {{a necessary condition for}} the observation of double <b>dissociations</b> in an information processing system that shares resources across multiple tasks. Using a uni-modal representational system, we demonstrate that double <b>dissociations</b> may also result from stochastic processes. Lesioning experiments on a single-route, uni-modal connectionist model of regular and irregular noun and verb morphology confirm and extend earlier work demonstrating that selective impairment across tasks can result from damage to a distributed information processing system. A systematic investigation {{of the degree to which}} performance deteriorates across different inflectional classes reveals that simple and double <b>dissociations</b> can occur in this single-route, uni-modal model. An important prediction of the model is that double <b>dissociations</b> between regular and irregular inflection, resulting from stochastic processes should be extremely rare. However, they are particularly likely to occur when the researcher uses test batteries consisting of a small number of items. Given that cognitive neuropsychologists rarely provide details about the distribution of performance in a disordered population, it is concluded that a stochastic interpretation of double <b>dissociations</b> may have wider applicability than is normally supposed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to replicate the methods of Anderson, Pellowski, and Conture (2005) to determine whether a different sample of preschool children who stutter (CWS) exhibit more <b>dissociations</b> in speech-language abilities than children who do not stutter (CWNS; Study 1) and to examine the relation between <b>dissociations</b> and specific characteristics of stuttering (e. g., most common disfluency type) using a much larger sample size (Study 2). Participants for Study 1 were 40 CWS and 40 CWNS between the ages of 3; 0 and 5; 11. Participants for Study 2 were the same as for Study 1 plus the 45 CWS and 45 CWNS used by Anderson et al. (2005) for a total of 85 CWS and 85 CWNS. Participants were administered five standardized speech-language (sub) tests and a conversational speech sample was obtained from each participant for the analyses of speech disfluencies/stuttering. Standard scores from the standardized speech-language tests were analyzed using a correlation-based statistical procedure (Bates, Applebaum, Sacedo, Saygin, & Pizzamiglio, 2003) to identify possible <b>dissociations</b> among the speech-language measures. Findings from Study 1 supported Anderson et al. ’s findings that CWS exhibited significantly more speech-language <b>dissociations</b> than CWNS. Results from Study 2 further revealed that CWS who exhibited <b>dissociations</b> were more likely to exhibit non-stuttered (other) disfluencies as their most common disfluency type.

40|$|Introduction Recent work using connectionist models has {{demonstrated}} that double <b>dissociations</b> can arise in non-modular systems. For example, Farah and McClelland (1991) damaged perceptual or functional processing units in a network to produce category specific semantic impairments to biological kinds or artifacts, while Plaut (1995) damaged different banks of connections to produce selective impairments of either abstract or concrete nouns. Both of these models used localized damage to simulate behavioral patterns resulting from focal brain damage. A very different etiology, however, can also produce double <b>dissociations.</b> Gonnerman et al. (in press) reported two Alzheimer's subjects, one with a deficit for natural kinds, the other selectively impaired on artifacts. The present study examines whether {{a model of a}} single processing system without separable components can produce double <b>dissociations</b> even when the damage to the system is progressive and widespread, as it is in A...|$|R
40|$|P. B. Sederberg, M. W. Howard, and M. J. Kahana (see record 2008 - 14936 - 014) have {{proposed}} {{an updated version}} of the temporal-context model (TCM-A).

5|$|Reversible {{inhibition}} can {{be described}} quantitatively {{in terms of the}} inhibitor's binding to the enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex, and its effects on the kinetic constants of the enzyme. In the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme below, an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES. Upon catalysis, this complex breaks down to release product P and free enzyme. The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the <b>dissociation</b> constants Ki or Ki', respectively.|$|E
5|$|Thus, in the {{presence}} of the inhibitor, the enzyme's effective Km and Vmax become (α/α')Km and (1/α')Vmax, respectively. However, the modified Michaelis-Menten equation assumes that binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme has reached equilibrium, which may be a very slow process for inhibitors with sub-nanomolar <b>dissociation</b> constants. In these cases, it is usually more practical to treat the tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate Ki' kinetically if Ki is measured independently.|$|E

40|$|Why {{do people}} {{sometimes}} {{seem to know}} things but fail to act appropriately {{on the basis of}} this knowledge? Such <b>dissociations</b> be-tween knowledge and action often occur in infants and children, and in adults following brain damage. These <b>dissociations</b> have supported in-ferences about the organization of cognitive processes (e. g., separable knowledge and action systems) and their development (e. g., knowledge systems develop before action systems). The current study tested the ba-sis for knowledge-action <b>dissociations</b> in a card-sorting task in which children typically correctly answer questions about sorting rules while sorting cards incorrectly. When questions and sorting measures were more closely equated for the amount of conflict that needed to be re-solved for a correct response, children showed no systematic dissocia-tion between knowledge and action. The results challenge standard interpretations of knowledge-action <b>dissociations</b> and support an alter-native account based on graded knowledge representations. People can appear to know things but fail to act appropriately {{on the basis of this}} knowledge. For example, adults with prefrontal dam-age and children can verbally report new rules they have learned for sorting cards (e. g., sort according to the color of the objects on the cards), but incorrectly sort the cards according to previously learned rules (e. g., sort according to the shape of the objects on the cards; Mil-ner, 1963; Zelazo, Frye, & Rapus, 1996). Similarly, infants can look to a new location where they have watched a toy being hidden, but incor-rectly reach back to an old location where the toy was previously hid-den (Diamond, 1985; Hofstadter & Reznick, 1996; Piaget, 1954). Such compelling <b>dissociations</b> have suggested that knowledge and ac-tion are neurally and psychologically separated, so that action systems may be impaired or underdeveloped while knowledge systems ar...|$|R
