This article provides a critical analysis of the reforms of State aid procedures from a third party perspective. The reforms are disappointing maintaining the bilateral character of State aid procedures between two main parties the Commission and the Member States concerned and leaving third parties with very limited procedural rights. In addition the hard-law reform of the State aid procedures of 2013 increases the procedural duties of third parties without procedural guarantees and extends the investigatory powers of the Commission...|$|E

This bachelor thesis deals with current problems of the building society sector in the Czech Republic and possibilities of future development. The analysis {{has shown that the}} current economic situation in the banking and financial markets has affected disadvantageously both the building society sector and the banking sector as a whole. Period of low mortgage rates together with reducing state aid have caused a decline in clients' interest in construction loans. One of the factors that greatly affects the future of the sector savings is the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> and its amount. Performed analysis of the historical development of building societies as a whole led to the conclusion that a gradual reduction in state aid resulted in the worsening of financial position of each building society, as evidenced by the decline in long-term indicators of return on equity, which, according to my predictions, by the end of 2020, will make up 7. 8 %...|$|E
40|$|International {{headlines}} {{have been}} consumed with {{the proliferation of}} international tax havens and “sweetheart deals” given to multinational companies with the hopes that they would invest in a given country. In response to such concerns, the E. U. Commission has issued a spate of decisions in which it concludes that certain taxation rulings given by State Members to international corporations constitute illegal state aid. These decisions have both befuddled and outraged various parties in the international community, including states and multinational corporations, who claim that the Commission is acting both unilaterally and without precedent. This Comment surveys the applicable case law and analyzes in detail the rationale behind the Commission’s decisions in order to uncover some of the fundamental principles driving the E. U. ’s executive body. This Comment reaches a number of conclusions. One, “selectivity” and “advantage” applied by the Commission in determining the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> is a purposeful conflation by the Commission rather than a brash departure from earlier precedent. The Commission’s rulings also reveal the importance of both the reference system and the use of treaties in purposefully framing any tax rulings that a multinational may receive. Finally, the use of generalized and individualized schemes will have vastly different consequences, given that these two groups of measures are analyzed very differently by the Commission. Case law will also reveal significant flaws in the Commission’s decisions, including the fact that the Commission has applied these terms inconsistently. Additionally, the Commission retains significant power to rule arguendo that a measure has the potential to distort competition and affect intra-state trade. The preceding considerations are important, as they ultimately affect the ex ante planning considerations of the multinationals and states involved. In the era of higher, more rigorous tax scrutiny, multinational corporations and Member States must be more purposeful and vigilant in planning...|$|E

The consequences on the regime of circulation of awards are scrutinized: as for non-ICSID awards, the article advocates a restrictive interpretation of Article V(2) (b) of the New York Convention.

Control <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> is <b>of</b> increasing importance {{in the context of}} European competition policy in order to maintain a fair level of activity of all enterprises participating in the European markets, regardless <b>of</b> the Member <b>State</b> in which they reside. The theoretical fundamentals <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> are important to be studied and applied. Were distinguished and described the main approaches in the evolution of economic theories in the field <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>aid.</b> Criteria were established to determine the government's actions as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> and intervention methods analyzed. It is important to think about the implications <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> at an early stage. Doing so allows assistance to be designed and given more quickly and effectively and avoids potential problems later. A program of assistance that does not follow the rules could be forced to close. Giving <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> illegally could result in the money having to be clawed back with possibly very serious consequences for the recipient. The European Commission monitors and controls <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in the EU by requiring member states to notify the Commission in advance <b>of</b> proposed <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in order to ensure compliance.

40|$|This paper aims {{to achieve}} an {{adequate}} discussion of the concept <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in the European Union, covering its definitional, procedural, case law and wider policy aspects. With regard to the definition <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> this paper concentrates on that employed by the European Commission, and discusses the (lack of) transparency of this definition. In searching for a definition <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> {{that may be used}} in the EU context, the paper goes on to consider the procedural aspects <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> specifically the obligations placed on member states by the EC Treaty and the strategy of the Commission in ensuring that these obligations are met. Following on from this some consideration is given to the case law surrounding <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> in an attempt to shed some light on the EU definition <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> post factum. The policy context <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> is also explored, specifically in relation to the connections between its categorised variously as industrial policy, competition policy and trade policy, which seem to depend on the specific interests involved in the aid. Although the extent to which <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> may be meaningfully classified as competition policy seems limited, increasing globalisation does seem to be leading governments to take greater account of the extra-territorial effects of their aid measures than previously. Following this and still in pursuit of a definition <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> consideration is given to the method employed in relation to aid by both the OECD and GATT/ WTO. Conclusions are drawn which stress the persistent absence of ex ante definitions of aid, and call for future analysis in this area to engage in ‘open exchange’ between the disciplines of law, political science and economics, but also between the spheres of industrial, competition and trade policy...|$|R

On the other hand, for some class of aid objectives and industries, there is a trade-off between duration and the level of budget so as to counter-balance the undesired effects.

The basic premise of the regulation is the circumstance that <b>aid</b> provided by <b>States</b> from public resources to enterprises can distort the competition within the EU and therefore is declared for incompatible with the EU internal market. At the same time we must realise that there are several situations in which a suitably scheduled <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> can act as a positive input to the development of the internal market and therefore a complete prohibition <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> would be rather counter-productive. In several areas of the competition regulation rules and criteria for the admissibility <b>of</b> suitable <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> are formulated by the EU law.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine if the use <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in the EU have {{increased}} or decreased and especially the use <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> to support the manufacturing sector. The development <b>of</b> total <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in relation to GDP and sectoral distribution of total aid are studied. So is <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> to the manufacturing sector and its different objectives and forms, since this sector is granted a large share <b>of</b> total <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in the EU and also have the potential largest impact on trade and competition. There is a downward trend in total <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in relation to GDP, but aid levels to the manufacturing sector have increased, due to elevated levels in five out of fifteen countries. Aid to horizontal objectives is considered being less distortive to competition and the proportion of aid to the manufacturing sector directe...|$|R
40|$|European <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> {{control is}} {{currently}} at a turning point. The European Union and its member states are increasingly recognizing {{the need to}} rethink the balance between the various objectives <b>of</b> <b>state</b> intervention. Constraints on state budgets and concerns about the e¤ectiveness <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> have increased the political pressure toward a more economic e¤ects-based approach in <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> and <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control. Both at national and European level, the political mandate is for ‘‘less and better targeted <b>state</b> <b>aid.</b> ’’ 1 In this chapter we explore how increased reliance on economic insights in <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> con-trol can contribute toward enhancing the e¤ectiveness <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control. The economics <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control is related to several areas of economics: first, to public economics, since <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> {{is a form of}} public intervention in the economy; second, to the economics <b>of</b> com-petition, as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> confers an advantage to some firms and thus has the potential to af-fect the competitive process; and third, to international trade theory, as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> can a¤ect trading conditions. This latter aspect creates incentives for national governments to pursue national economic or political goals, which in turn provides a rationale for supranational (European) <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control...|$|R

The present paper {{explores the}} {{rationale}} behind the legal framework regulating the use <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> by the member-countries of the European Union during the financial crisis. Starting with 2008, the massive interventions in the banking industry of {{the governments of the}} member-countries attempting to eliminate the effects of the crisis fundamentally challenged the core logic of the entire policy regarding the control <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in the European Union. We attempt to underline the extraordinary dimension {{of the impact of the}} financial crisis on <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control and scrutinize whether the underlying principles <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> regime have been changed. We conclude that the special place that the financial industry in general, and the banking industry in particular, enjoys from the point of view of competition policy, is unfounded. European Union is, after the crisis, in the uncomfortable position <b>of</b> re-legitimizing <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control...|$|R
