5|$|The M19 MGMC {{had similar}} {{specifications}} to the M24 Chaffee. It was 17.9ft (5.46m) long, 9.33ft (2.845m) wide, and 9.83ft (2.997m) high. It had a weight of 38,499lb (17,463kg), and was powered with a 220hp (160kW) Twin Cadillac Model 42, V-8 <b>engine</b> <b>installation.</b> It could achieve {{a speed of}} 35mph (56.3km/h), and had a range of 150mi (241km). The vehicle was operated with a crew of six.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight test}} program was {{hampered}} by {{problems with the}} 747's JT9D engines. Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after {{a short period of}} service. The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months; up to 20 aircraft at the Everett plant were stranded while awaiting <b>engine</b> <b>installation.</b> The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal Airport, site of the company's Renton factory. On December 13, 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport's short runway. The 747's right, outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged. However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the public for the first time. The 747 received its FAA airworthiness certificate in December 1969, clearing it for introduction into service.|$|E
25|$|Installation: It is more {{difficult}} to ensure adequate cooling air in a buried <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> or with pusher configurations.|$|E
50|$|A {{scheme for}} unitised <b>engine</b> <b>installations</b> was {{initiated}} by the Air Ministry in 1937 and after consultation with the Society of British Aircraft Constructors (SBAC) a system was devised allowing standardised dimensions and bulkhead fittings for both inline and radial <b>engine</b> <b>installations</b> of similar power.|$|R

50|$|A Volkswagen {{air-cooled}} engine {{was the only}} engine specified for this model, however many examples exist with alternate <b>engine</b> <b>installations.</b>|$|R
25|$|Construction of the {{airframe}} moulds started mid-November 1992, with airframe construction {{beginning in}} April the following year, {{starting with the}} tailplane. The airframe was completed in 1994 and <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> commenced.|$|E
25|$|The O-2Hs were {{an entirely}} new design but {{continued}} the same basic model number. Major differences were heavily staggered wings, a more compact <b>engine</b> <b>installation,</b> and clean landing gear secured to the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The R.XIV closely resembled {{previous}} Zeppelin-Staaken R-planes differing only in <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> and details. The five Maybach MbIV engines {{were arranged}} as push-pull pairs in the nacelles, with the engineer accommodated between the engines, {{and a single}} tractor engine in the nose.|$|E
5000|$|Extended {{fuselage}} {{and larger}} tail surfaces. Multiple <b>engine</b> <b>installations</b> from [...] The [...] Titan Stroker IO-340 powerplant was introduced 2013.|$|R
50|$|Several {{modifications}} and optional fittings {{are also}} available including different <b>engine</b> <b>installations,</b> wingtip tanks, speed brakes, STOL kits and gear door modifications.|$|R
50|$|Note: Some sources {{state that}} seven {{aircraft}} were built, {{but this is}} incorrect, probably brought about by confusion due to the frequent changes in <b>engine</b> <b>installations.</b>|$|R
25|$|While {{unsuitable}} as a fighter, {{the success}} of the <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> of the Jupiter Fighter resulted in the decision to produce an advanced trainer version, to supplement the Siddeley Puma-engined Bristol Tourers already in use in this role. The result of this combination was the Type 89 Trainer, a total of 23 of which were produced.|$|E
25|$|During 1935, {{a second}} machine was ordered, {{designated}} the Type 138B. This {{was to be}} a two-seater aircraft, powered by a Rolls-Royce Kestrel S engine, which would be fitted with a similar two-stage supercharger installation, enabling it to generate 500hp (370kW). In 1937, the airframe was delivered to Farnborough Airfield for completion, but the <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> was never completed. The Type 138B was used as a ground instructional trainer instead, and accordingly never flew.|$|E
25|$|Both engines {{were located}} behind a single very large ventral {{single-sided}} Ferri intake, which featured a prominent, swept-forward lip, a design feature employed on the Republic RF-84F Thunderstreak and later F-105 Thunderchief. The J67 was installed {{just behind the}} intake, angled with its intake below the centerline of the aircraft. The XJ55 was installed inline with the fuselage in the extreme rear, {{as if it were}} the exhaust of a conventional <b>engine</b> <b>installation.</b> There was a significant empty space above the J67 for ducting.|$|E
50|$|In July 2014 {{the company}} {{announced}} an improved version, the SA 60V, with an upgraded <b>engines</b> <b>installation</b> using Austrian, rather than Chinese components and an IFR capable instrument panel.|$|R

50|$|The {{specification}} for {{the aircraft}} required <b>engine</b> <b>installations</b> which permitted the fitting of different air intakes, engines and propelling nozzles. The 188 was {{originally intended to}} have Avon engines but the Gyron Junior was substituted in June 1957.|$|R
25|$|Development of {{the engine}} and engine {{accessories}} was the responsibility of Bristol Siddeley, while BAC {{was responsible for the}} variable intake and overall <b>engine</b> <b>installation,</b> and Snecma the exhaust nozzle/thrust reverser/noise attenuation and the afterburner. Britain was to have a larger share in production of the Olympus 593 as France had a larger share in fuselage production. Ground test running {{of the engine}}s was co-ordinated between Bristol Siddeley, Patchway, the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE), Pystock, UK, and the Centre d'Essais des Propulseurs (CEPr) at Saclay, France.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prolific}} and enduring of the Fairey IIIs {{was the final}} model, the IIIF, {{which was designed to}} meet Air Ministry Specification 19/24 for a three-seat spotter/reconnaissance aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm and a two-seat general purpose aircraft for the Royal Air Force. The IIIF, which first flew on 20 April 1926, had a more streamlined <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> and initially a fuselage of mixed metal and wooden construction, with similar wings to the IIID, although later production aircraft were fitted with an all-metal fuselages and wings.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{difficulties}} with the Atsuta and Ha-40 engines {{eventually led to}} the installation of the more reliable Mitsubishi Kinsei 62 radial engine for the Yokosuka D4Y3 Model 33,> and the Mitsubishi Ha-112 radial air-cooled engine for the IJAAS's Kawasaki Ki-61, which then became known as the Kawasaki Ki-100. Such a modification was not possible for the Aichi M6A1 Seiran as it could only use the liquid-cooled inverted-vee type engine, as it had to fit the submarine's confined hangar, becoming the only Japanese airplane that retained the inverted-vee <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> through {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was powered by three Fiat A.60 inline piston engines, with one {{mounted on the}} fuselage nose {{and the other two}} in wing-mounted nacelles. Variants were also produced with other <b>engine</b> <b>installations.</b> The enclosed cabin had space for six passengers.|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation of}} the drag associated with cooling air flow in contemporary general aviation <b>engine</b> <b>installations</b> is proposed. Theoretical and experimental methods include a state-of-the-art survey, determination of cooling drag by flight tests, and establishment of relative magnitude and components of cooling drag...|$|R
40|$|Some of the {{specific}} areas associated with straight jet and turboprop <b>engine</b> <b>installations</b> are outlined where drag reduction and, thus, improved aircraft system performance is obtained. Specific areas constitute air intake sizing for general aviation aircraft, exhaust duct geometries and cooling system arrangements for propeller powered aircraft...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to a novel hull which let her attain speed at far less power than other big liners, Normandie was filled with technical feats. She had turbo-electric transmission, with turbo-generators and electric propulsion motors built by Alsthom of Belfort. CGT chose turbo-electric transmission for {{the ability to use}} full power in reverse, and because, according to CGT officials, it was quieter and more easily controlled and maintained. The <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> was heavier than conventional turbines and slightly less efficient at high speed but allowed all propellers to operate even if one engine was not running. This system also made it possible to eliminate astern turbines. An early form of radar was installed to prevent collisions.|$|E
500|$|A second {{prototype}} {{was completed}} {{at the end}} of 1940 with a 14-cylinder, 1,268kW (1,700hp) Shvetsov M-82A radial engine. The forward fuselage had to be redesigned to accommodate the slimmer engine and the armament was revised to three synchronized [...] ShVAK cannon. The drawings for this <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> was passed to Lavochkin and Yakovlev where they proved very useful in designing their own fighters using the M-82 engine, notably the Lavochkin La-5. A third prototype was also built that used the larger and heavier Shvetsov M-71 radial engine of 1,492kW (2,000hp). The flight tests of both of the latter versions were interrupted by the German invasion in June 1941 and all three prototypes, along with the entire Polikarpov design bureau, were evacuated to Novosibirsk.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Gulf's {{aviation}} manager, Maj. Alford J. Williams, had the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation construct two modified biplanes, cleaned-up {{versions of the}} Grumman F3F Navy fighter, for promotional use by the company. Wearing Gulf Oil company colors and logos, the Grumman G-22 [...] "Gulfhawk II", registered NR1050, was delivered in December 1936, and in 1938 Maj. Williams flew it {{on a tour of}} Europe. A second scavenger pump and five drain lines were added to the <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> that allowed the aircraft to be flown inverted for up to thirty minutes. This aircraft is now preserved in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. A second airplane, the Grumman G-32 [...] "Gulfhawk III", registered NC1051, was delivered on May 6, 1938. Impressed by the Army Air Force in November 1942 for use as a VIP transport and designated a UC-103, it crashed in the southern Florida Everglades in early 1943.|$|E
25|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>installations</b> {{differed}} {{with each}} aircraft type but generally followed {{the layout of}} a single nose engine, usually driving a two-bladed propeller and with the interwing engine nacelles on either side suspended by struts between the mainplanes each housing two engines in tandem, geared to drive single pusher propellers.|$|R
