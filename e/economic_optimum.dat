50|$|According to Howard Ellis, an anti-trust lawyer {{based in}} the United States, {{economics}} is inherently individualistic, and without the individual's ability to choose freely economics cannot exist. He says that by principle, a monopoly limits the free choice of an individual in the market by controlling both the price and the scarcity of a product. He says that this inability to choose creates an economic environment that is unsuitable for practicing the <b>economic</b> <b>optimum,</b> which describes the best application of limited resources to unlimited wants of consumers. A factor in economic stagnation is brought about by this lack of {{the pursuit of the}} optimum.|$|E

For a broader usage of this complicated theory we started designing an expert system „KAUZA – X“, which will be easy to operate even for non expert. The theoretical bases of a system are: the systems approach (Logistic system is made up of a set of elements and relationships.) and the theory of cauzal position (The cause of the motion of an object lies in the types of its position and in the relationships between them). The properties of the object and its utilization result in individual positions, which form a continual chain in space and are technically and organizationally interrelated. For each of many linkages, there is a process of searching for the rationality of technical – <b>economic</b> <b>optimums...</b>|$|R

5000|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to what}} is an {{economically}} optimal level of leakage [...] or, speaking more broadly, of NRW. From a financial or economic point of view it is not appropriate to try to reduce NRW to the lowest possible level, because the marginal cost of reducing NRW increases once the cheaper options have been exploited. Once the marginal cost of reducing NRW exceeds the marginal benefits or water savings, an <b>economic</b> <b>optimum</b> has been achieved. Benefits should be measured through reduced production costs if reduction of NRW results in lower water production, through the avoided costs of additional supply capacity if the system is close to the limit of its capacity and demand is growing, or through the value of water sold if reduction of NRW results in additional water sales. The latter can be done by valuing water through water tariffs (financial value) or through the willingness to pay by customers (economic value). There are fewer financial incentives for a utility to reduce NRW if water production is cheap, if there is no or little metering (so that revenues thus are independent of actual consumption), or if volumetric tariffs are low.|$|E

40|$|Fire {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe loads for {{concrete}} structures. Consequently, fire resistance is an important consideration during design. However, current design practice is generally governed by prescriptive design rules which are based on experience and do not explicitly take into account e. g. the damage costs due to a fire-induced failure and the probability of fire ignition and successful fire suppression. A more rational approach would be to take into account the characteristics of the structure and to determine the <b>economic</b> <b>optimum</b> fire safety design.

40|$|One {{method for}} {{refining}} nitrogen (N) application in corn is use of in-season crop sensing. To aid producers {{in making decisions}} regarding N rate adjustments, a calibrated relationship between sensor-derived information and expected N application need should be established. Nitrogen rate trials were conducted at multiple sites across Iowa in 2001 - 2003. Nitrogen was applied at or shortly after corn planting. Minolta SI 2 ̆ 7 AD chlorophyll meter (CM) readings were collected at the R 1 growth stage from the ear leaf. The results show a statistically significant quadratic-plateau relationship between relative chlorophyll meter (RCM) values and differential from <b>economic</b> <b>optimum</b> N rate (R 2 ̆ 7 = 0. 69, P 3 ̆c 0. 001). The regression fit resulted in a 0. 97 RCM value at zero differential from <b>economic</b> <b>optimum</b> N. A related study in 2003 at six N rate by crop rotation sites showed RCM values at the V 15 and R 1 growth stages were similar. This indicates adequate time is available to collect readings after significant corn N uptake and before making in-season N adjustments.

The project, led by Tel-Tek, is {{based on the idea that}} cost reduction is possible by capturing only a share of the CO 2 emissions from a given facility, instead of striving for maximized capture rates. This can be done in multiple ways, for instance by capturing only from the largest CO 2 sources at individual multi-stack sites utilising cheap waste heat or adapting the capture volumes to seasonal changes in operations. The main focus of this research is to perform techno-economic analyses for multiple partial CO 2 capture concepts in order to identify <b>economic</b> <b>optimums</b> between cost and volumes captured. In total for four different case studies are developed for cement, iron & steel, pulp & paper and ferroalloys industries.

40|$|The radical {{reform of}} the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the early 1990 ’s {{impacted}} directly and indirectly {{on most of the}} farm enterprises in Ireland. The direct focus of the reform was largely confined to the cereal and beef enterprises. The reforms consisted of: • A phased reduction in the institutional support prices for cereals and beef of the order of 30 per cent • A phased switch to a direct payment system of farm income support to compensate for the product price reductions. Most farms in Ireland have a cattle enterprise, either alone or in combination with other land using enterprises. Therefore, the reforms of the CAP affected almost all the farms in the country either directly or indirectly. For cattle farmers, the potential consequencee of these changes could be far reaching in terms of their magnitude and their permeation into the details of the husbandry practices of the production system(s) themselves. These changes clearly impact on the economic efficiency of beef systems without necessarily affecting technical efficiency of the systems. The <b>economic</b> <b>optimum</b> cattle production systems would thus be achieved by using the best mix of feed resource costs, carcass values and direct payments. The {{purpose of the study was}} to: • determine the economic impact on the cattle enterprise of the switch to: • lower EU prices for beef • lower EU prices for cereals and as a consequence a lower price for concentrate feeds • the direct payment system of income support • identify the <b>economic</b> <b>optimum</b> cattle production system(s) that would arise from these changes • quantify the sensitivity of the <b>economic</b> <b>optimum</b> system to key policy, economic and technical production variables.

Such a measure assumes that variations in capacity utilization (CU), defined as the ratio of actual to optimal output, are the systematic results of rational optimization procedures, depending on price and cost conditions of firms. A comparison of the new series with the conventional engineering measures of CU shows that the widely used ‘installed CU’ figures clearly underestimate the true economic utilization levels, mainly due to definitional problems. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} linear-plateau {{procedure}} to describe the response of an individual in the population has theoretical support, since the maximum potential performance of each individual is genetically determined, and any increment in intake of the limiting nutrient above maintenance {{will result in a}} linear response in output until this genetic potential, and hence requirement, is reached.
