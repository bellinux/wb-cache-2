Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E

25|$|Dental amalgam {{has had a}} {{long history}} and global impact. It was first {{introduced}} in the Chinese materia medica of Su Kung in 659 A.D. during the Tang Dynasty. In Europe, Johannes Stockerus, a municipal physician in Ulm, Germany, recommended amalgam as a <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> as early as 1528. In 1818, Parisian physician Louis Nicolas Regnart added one-tenth by weight of mercury to the fusable metals used as fillings at the time to create a temporarily soft metal alloy at room temperature. Thus, amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal or metals, from the French word amalgame) was invented. This was further perfected in 1826, when Auguste Taveau of Paris used a silver paste made from mixing French silver-tin coins with mercury, which offered more plasticity and a quicker setting time. In Europe, prior to 1818, carious teeth were either filled with a melted metal, usually gold or silver (which would often lead to death of the nerve of the tooth from thermal trauma), or the tooth would be extracted.|$|E

2500|$|In Canada, amalgam use is {{considered}} safe and effective. A 2005 position {{statement from the}} Canadian Dental Association (CDA) states that [...] "current scientific evidence {{on the use of}} dental amalgam supports that amalgam is an effective and safe <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> that provides a long-lasting solution for a broad range of clinical situations. The CDA has established its position based on the current consensus of scientific and clinical experts and on recent extensive reviews of strong evidence by major North American and international organizations, which have satisfactorily countered any safety concerns." [...] Amalgam use is regulated by Health Canada as are all medical treatments and Health Canada has also stated that dental amalgam is not causing illness in the general population. Not all organizations in Canada share this view. In a recent publication, the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors states that [...] "... mercury is the most toxic non-radioactive material on earth, and since it is constantly being released from amalgam, its use should be abandoned. They recommend a gradual detox and chelation therapy over several months to minimize the toxic effects of amalgam fillings.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} persons having problems with dental <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> in a Swedish population, their perceived oral health, and their reception from dental care personnel. The development over time (between 1992 and 2007) has also been studied concerning the presence of problems from dental <b>filling</b> <b>materials.</b> In two counties in Sweden, Orebro and Ostergötland, all persons born in 1942 have been surveyed by mail every fifth year since 1992. In the year 2007, all persons born in 1932 also received the same questionnaire. The total number of respondents in 2007 were 9813 persons (response rate 72. 6 %). Logistic regression models were constructed with those having had problems or not from dental <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> as dependent variable. Multiple regression analysis was done with selfperceived oral health as dependent variable. There were about 10 % (868) reporting problems from dental <b>filling</b> <b>materials.</b> There were clear differences between the two groups, having problems or not. The group reporting problems from dental <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> perceived both their general and oral health as being worse compared with others. More frequently they had asked questions about adverse effects from dental <b>filling</b> <b>materials,</b> had changed dental fillings and crowns, and had amalgam present. They also felt less well treated by dental personnel and were not so pleased with dental care in general as others. In conclusion, there were many persons perceiving problems from dental <b>filling</b> <b>materials.</b> Forthose, both perceived general health and oral health was worse and they were less satisfied with dental care in general. No consistent common characteristic, neither as to socioeconomic nor lifestyle factors, could be shown for those having experienced problems from dental <b>filling</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} how different <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> affect the mobilization of pollution residue in remediated soil. The aim was also to assess criteria that should be fulfilled for the soil properties of these <b>filling</b> <b>materials.</b> The study was partly based on target value calculations where the impact of varied TOC, hydraulic conductivity and porosity affected the mobility of toluene, trichloroethene, benso(a) pyrene and arsenic residue in the soil. An evaluation of the potential mobility of soil pollution residues where <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> had been used was carried out for five different locations in Sweden. Soil samples were collected before remediation of contaminated soil, and afterwards when the fillings were restored. Sample analyzes were made for TOC and soil water. The results from the study show that the TOC and porosity content in <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> has a significant impact on the mobility of soil pollution residues. <b>Filling</b> <b>materials</b> with less TOC than the remediated soil will contribute to an increased mobility of organic pollution residues to the air, surface water and groundwater, whilst lower soil porosity, or rather lower soil water content will contribute to an increased mobility of airborne pollution residues. The results also show that in Sweden the use of <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> with both lower TOC and soil water content is common. To avoid an increased mobilization of pollution residues from remediated soils, <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> should contain TOC and soil water equals the contents in the remediated soil...|$|R

50|$|Composite resin is {{commonly}} used as a <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> due to its aesthetic qualities and ability to effectively bond to tooth structure, especially enamel.

40|$|Due {{to limited}} areas and {{excessive}} cost {{of land for}} projects, backfilling process has become necessary. Also, backfilling will be done to overcome the un-leveling depths or raising levels of site construction, especially near the sea region. Therefore, backfilling soil materials used under the foundation of structures should be investigated regarding its effect on ground motion characteristics, especially at regions subjected to earthquakes. In this research, 60 -meter thickness of sandy <b>fill</b> <b>material</b> was used above a fixed 240 -meter of natural clayey soil underlying by rock formation to predict the modified ground motion characteristics effect at the foundation level. Comparison between the effect of using three different situations of <b>fill</b> <b>material</b> compaction on the recorded earthquake is studied, i. e. peak ground acceleration, time history, and spectra acceleration values.
