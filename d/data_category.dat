30|$|LMF [3] was {{developed}} by the technical committee TC 37 /SC of the ISO. It was conceived as a generic platform for the specification of lexical structures at any level of linguistic description covering monolingual and multilingual lexicons. The specification of LMF follows the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 1 modeling principles defined by the Object Management Group (OMG). 2 It is composed of core meta-model and lexical extensions. The modeling principles allow a lexical database designer to combine any component of the LMF meta-model with <b>data</b> <b>categories</b> to create an appropriate model. These <b>data</b> <b>categories</b> function as UML attribute–value pairs in the diagrams. The core model covers the backbone of a lexical entry. It specifies the basic concepts of vocabulary, word, form and sense. The LMF core model is a hierarchical structure consisting of several components. The lexical entry is one of the components that represents the basic resource in the lexicon.|$|R
