25|$|Every year humans add 25 {{billion tons}} of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and over half of it comes from their {{domestic}} activity. Attenborough introduces the Carbons, a fictional family occupying an average Western suburban house near a city. Their <b>electrical</b> <b>requirements</b> are supplied via fossil fuels. As Attenborough points out, the Carbons are not bad people, but as Westerners, they {{have one of the}} most energy-hungry lifestyles on the planet. They are a two-car household, and each vehicle emits 10 tons of CO2 {{over the course of a}} year. The power used to run the Carbons' home and all its comforts translates into a similar amount. Much of the family's plentiful food supply will have crossed continents by the time it reaches their kitchen, and will have added a tenth to their annual emissions. Yet more are produced by their refuse: buried in a landfill, it heats up as it decomposes and releases greenhouse gases. Mr Carbon's business trips by air contribute to the fastest growing source of CO2. The combined total of the Carbons' yearly air pollution is 45 tons.|$|E
