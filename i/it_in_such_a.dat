5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E

25|$|The five-needle telegraph, {{which was}} mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, {{was similar to}} that of Schilling, and based on the {{principle}} enunciated by André-Marie Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key, and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1917, Werfel left the {{frontline}} for the Military Press Bureau in Vienna, where he joined other notable Austrian writers serving as propagandists, among them Robert Musil, Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Franz Blei. Through the latter, Werfel met {{and fell in love}} with Alma Mahler, widow of Gustav Mahler, the former lover of the painter Oskar Kokoschka, and the wife of the architect Walter Gropius, then serving in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front. Alma, who was also a composer, had already set one of Werfel’s poems to music, reciprocated despite Werfel being much younger, shorter, and having Jewish features that she, being both anti-Semitic and attracted to Jewish men, found initially distasteful. Their love affair culminated in the premature birth of a son, Martin, in August 1918. Martin, who was given the surname of Gropius, died in May of the following year. Despite attempts to save his marriage to Alma, with whom he had a young daughter, Manon, Gropius reluctantly agreed to a divorce in 1920. Ironically, Alma refused to marry Werfel for the next nine years. However, Alma, more so than with her first two husbands and lovers, lent herself to the development of Werfel’s career and influenced <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way that he became an accomplished playwright and novelist as well as poet. They married on 6 July 1929.|$|E

While the award was under this name, it was presented without specifying a work; when it shifted {{to its current}} name in 2002 works were named. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented [...] "to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously recorded material and adds or alters <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way as {{to create a new}} and unique performance".

They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} a role reversal with Dana Scully the believer and Fox Mulder the skeptic, which David Duchovny called [...] "a refreshing change of pace." [...] Nutter said that dealing with faith permitted the show's creators to further delve into Scully's character. The episode {{was the first}} to discuss Scully's faith in-depth. Series creator Chris Carter later emphasized that the theme of the episode was more on personal belief rather than organized religion, noting, [...] " [...] deals with faith, not religion with a capital 'R' or Catholicism with a capital 'C'". The producers for the series were cautious about presenting an overtly religious episode of the series for fear of [...] "pissing certain people off", but, according to Carter, the show [...] "handled <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way as to make it about miracle belief, or lack of belief." ...|$|E
500|$|Occasionally, the {{distinction}} between errors of law and errors of fact can be fuzzy. Where a public authority {{is alleged to have}} committed an error of mixed fact and law, the High Court is more likely to leave the matter to the authority and decline to intervene. This can be the case where a statutory term evaluated by the authority is so general and ambiguous that reasonable people may peg different meanings to <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> situation, it is generally left to the authority to evaluate the meaning of the term. This is illustrated by Puhlhofer v. Hillingdon London Borough Council (1986), which involved a public authority that bore a statutory responsibility for providing homeless people with accommodation. The applicants were a married couple who lived with their two children in a single room in a guest house. Their application for permanent accommodation was rejected because the authority claimed they were not [...] "homeless" [...] within the meaning of the statute. The House of Lords upheld this decision, determining that the issue of whether the applicants had accommodation was a question of fact to be determined by the public authority: ...|$|E

500|$|Even if the {{subject-matter}} {{of a case}} {{is generally}} non-justiciable, there are exceptions where the courts will still review the case.

An example of this was given by Judicial Commissioner Menon in Lee Hsien Loong: [...] "here what appears to raise a question of international law in fact bears on the application of domestic law, that is something the court may well find justiciable." [...] In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the court similarly distinguished a pronouncement on the interpretation of a treaty generally, which is impermissible, from the consideration of [...] "the application of an international treaty by reference to the facts of an individual case" [...] which is allowed. Also, in R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Everett (1988), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales took the view that a decision by the Secretary of State exercised under the royal prerogative to deny a passport to a British citizen residing abroad raised a justiciable issue because it was not a high policy matter involving foreign affairs but [...] "a matter of administrative decision, affecting the rights of individuals and their freedom of travel".|$|E
500|$|The same evidences of {{mourning}} were seen along the levee.

Buchanan and Tunnel sang several beautiful hymns. [...] The funeral address was delivered by Rev. C. T. Phillips, of Princeville, Ill., formerly pastor of the Presbyterian Church here. [...] Mr. Phillips was a close friend of the deceased, and it was the wish of Capt. Halliday that he might assist in the service. [...] Mr. Phillips spoke of the Captain’s kindness and generosity, how he rendered assistance to so many and did <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> delicate way that no sensitive or proud natures were hurt. [...] He spoke of the Captain’s loyalty to Cairo. [...] How he aided the city in its struggle against the great floods; how he instructed the bank to cash all paper issued by the city in those dark days; how his fortune was ready to be used in protecting life and property here, and how his barges were always placed in readiness to be sunk opposite weak places in the levee. [...] He told of a conversation the Captain had with him in the panic days of 1892-’93, when banks were failing everywhere, in which the deceased said his entire fortune was ready to preserve the integrity of the bank here and to protect the businessmen from loss. [...] He told what a kind employer Capt. Halliday was, how a position with him was a life job if the employee did his work faithfully. [...] Mr. Phillips said he had known men at DuQuoin 21 years ago that were still in the service of Capt. Halliday. [...] He told how Capt. Halliday watched the careers of young men who were striving to get ahead in life, and how he helped them to get on by opening the way for them without ever letting them see his hand.
