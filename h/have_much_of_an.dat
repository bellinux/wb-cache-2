5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E

25|$|Gan Eng Seng School {{was founded}} in some shophouses in Telok Ayer Street in 1885 by the philanthropist, Gan Eng Seng and was known as Anglo Chinese Free School. Born in 1844 into a poor family in Melaka, Gan came to Singapore {{at a young age}} to seek his fortune. Since he was unable to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{education}} in his youth, it was his ambition in life to build a school and help those who are poor as he prospered and became wealthy. Gan was far-sighted in placing emphasis on bilingualism in English and Chinese from the start. The school proved to be a success - the enrolment figure reached a record of 167 by 1890, and rose to an all-time high of 94% in 1892.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Minas Gerais {{is the result}} of an intense mixture of peoples, particularly between Black Africans and Portuguese. In colonial Minas Gerais, the population was divided in five different categories: Whites, mostly Portuguese; Africans, who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin (for example Francisca Benguela would refer to Benguela); Crioulos (Black people born in Brazil, usually to both African parents); Mulattoes (people of mixed Black and White ancestry, usually born to a Black mother and a Portuguese father) and Cabras (people of mixed ancestry, usually with high degree of Amerindian admixture). Blacks and Mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization. By the 19th century, however, whites were already the largest single group in the Minas Gerais population. Taking the population as a whole (all groups included), European genes account {{for the majority of the}} Minas Gerais genetic heritage, which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved African population and lower reproductive rate of African slaves (the vast majority of them were males, among other reasons for their lower reproductive success) The Amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the European colonists and they did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact either, especially in Minas Gerais, where European presence and colonization was massive.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Zap2it, Ryan McGee {{characterized}} the episode {{as having a}} [...] "weak backstory with a creeptastic ending," [...] although he enjoyed Locke for being [...] "incredibly sage and incredibly terrifying all at once." [...] In her 2006 work Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide, Nikki Stafford critiqued the writers for having some of the characters act inconsistently with the events of previous episodes, citing Jack and Kate's [...] "jokey and sweet" [...] interactions as an example. Robert Dougherty, author of the 2008 book Lost Episode Guide for Others: An Unofficial Anthology, compared Shannon and Boone's relationship {{to that of a}} soap opera. Other than the revelations surrounding their relationship and Locke's actions however, Dougherty did not think the episode would <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact on the series' overall story.|$|E

500|$|Later in the tournament, on 18 June 2012, Mario Balotelli scored {{his first}} goal {{in a major}} {{international}} tournament in a 2–0 victory against the Republic of Ireland. When he attempted to celebrate this goal, he was immediately halted by teammate Leonardo Bonucci, who covered Balotelli's mouth with his hand for fear that the striker would say something to [...] "get in trouble." [...] Balotelli had been dropped to the bench by Cesare Prandelli prior to the game due to his lack of ability shown in his previous group games, so when he was subbed on against Ireland fans didn't expect him to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact, and his celebration of his goal may have originally been directed towards the naysayers who believe he is bad for the team. Balotelli went on to start against England in the quarter-finals, his performance was described as wasteful but his effort was rated highly in a game where he missed multiple chances. He scored the first penalty taken in the shootout against his Manchester City teammate Joe Hart. On 28 June, Balotelli scored twice within the first 40 minutes in Italy's semi-final clash with Germany, as the Azzurri won 2–1 and progressed to the Euro 2012 final against European and World champions Spain. After scoring the second goal in that semi-final, he ripped off his shirt and stood motionless as he flexed his muscles, developing a famous celebration. Going into the final Balotelli said that, Manchester City's title success meant that failure in the Euros would not signal a personal failure this season. He {{also said that he}} was unfazed by the pressure he supposedly has on his shoulders going into the final, with new high expectations of him from his home supporters after his amazing performance against Germany.|$|E

2500|$|Usually, a high {{prestige}} vessel like Titanic {{could expect}} to be fully booked on its maiden voyage. However, a national coal strike in the UK had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules {{in the spring of}} 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled.

The strike had finished a few days before Titanic sailed; however, that was too late to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> effect.

2500|$|Actress {{and singer}} Paige O'Hara, who voices Belle, {{was among the}} first artists to express {{interest}} in recording the pop version of [...] "Beauty and the Beast", but Disney dismissed her for being [...] "too Broadway". Unable to afford to hire a [...] "big singer" [...] at the time, Disney settled for rising Canadian recording artist Celine Dion. Because she was relatively unknown to American audiences at the time, the studio doubted that Dion would <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact in the United States on her own and subsequently hired the more well-known American singer Peabo Bryson to record the song alongside her as a duet. Disney contacted Dion's manager René Angélil about having his client record [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] while the singer was on tour in England. A fan of Dion's music, Menken personally wrote the singer a letter of approval.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "geometrical" [...] and [...] "arithmetical" [...] ratios {{constitute}} a fallacy, Hazlitt claims; for agricultural crops, like the human population, would grow geometrically {{if there were}} room to contain them.

[...] Hazlitt also notes another fallacy, the idea that [...] "the desire to propagate the [...] species" [...] is as fixed and immutable a law as hunger. That control of [...] "the sexual passion" [...] is possible by [...] "moral restraint" [...] is finally acknowledged by Malthus himself in later editions of his Essay, but inconsistently, so we don't know where he stands.

Unfortunately, because Malthus never fully allowed that [...] "moral restraint" [...] could <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> effect, and laid emphasis on the checks to population of [...] "vice and misery", it led many to suppose that all increase of population is an evil, leading only to [...] "a greater quantity of vice and misery".|$|E

Vasconcelos later said: [...] "I was his second passion. His first passion was racing... There was nothing {{more important in the}} world for him, not family, not wife, nothing." [...] Though he did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> income early in his racing career, Senna insisted on supporting his wife with no help from his father {{out of a sense of}} pride. The marriage ended in divorce. Senna then courted Adriane Yamin, daughter of an entrepreneur from São Paulo, who was 15 years old when they began the relationship in 1985 and often chaperoned by her mother during meetings with Senna. They were briefly engaged, but the relationship was broken off by Senna in late 1988. Senna dated Brazilian TV star Xuxa from late 1988 until 1990. He then dated Christine Ferracciu, who lived with him at his homes in Monaco and Portugal, on and off between 1990 and 1991. Senna also had an affair with American model Carol Alt, and briefly dated models Marjorie Andrade and Elle Macpherson. At the time of his death, Senna was in a relationship with Brazilian model, and later TV personality, Adriane Galisteu.|$|E
