5|$|An origin myth {{from the}} Murri people of Queensland, cited by Andrew Lang, {{describes}} how the Australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage.

The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since.|$|E

All public schools in the area were closed, as well.|$|E
5|$|Several hundred {{homes were}} {{inundated}} by the <b>flood</b> <b>in</b> Fairbanks, Salcha, unincorporated Fairbanks North Star Borough, Nenana, and smaller villages, {{but due to}} early warnings from the National Weather Service, volunteer fire departments, and the borough's emergency contact system, no one was injured. The area affected by the flood was declared a state disaster area, making residents whose homes were flooded eligible for state aid. The long-term effects of the flood, including {{its effect on the}} salmon spawning season, are as yet unknown.|$|E

5|$|Sunnyside walk-in campground, {{better known}} as Camp 4, was built in 1929. Rock climbers, who started to scale the cliffs of Yosemite in the 1950s, camped there.

The Park Service wanted to build dormitories next to Camp 4, but Tom Frost, the American Alpine Club and others succeeded in killing the plan.

5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped {{had been replaced by}} newer, stronger ones. Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor, a bridge railing and new stringers. The bridge was much better cared for this time around, as it also survived a local <b>flood</b> <b>in</b> 1903 and an icestorm in the early months of spring 1904.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Tanana Valley flood or the 2008 Fairbanks flood was a <b>flood</b> <b>in</b> late July {{and early}} August 2008 that {{affected}} several rivers {{in the central}} portion of the American state of Alaska. The city of Fairbanks, Alaska saw high water levels, while the towns of Nenana, Salcha, and Old Minto received heavy damage. The Salcha River and Tanana River reached their second-highest levels since record-keeping began (the highest was during the 1967 Tanana Valley Flood), while the Chena River, which bisects Fairbanks, was kept below flood stage {{by the use of}} the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the {{overview of the}} flood, the time distribution of floods and the overlay combination rule of <b>floods</b> <b>in</b> the lower reaches of the Jialing River since 773 AD, in the method of historical documents and statistical analysis, referring to historical data and measured data of <b>floods</b> <b>in</b> the lower reaches of the Jialing River. Through the analysis, the author finally draws conclusion: 1) there are 11 times of <b>floods</b> <b>in</b> the lower reaches of the Jialing River assured since 1870, among which the <b>floods</b> <b>in</b> 1870, 1903 and 1981 lead the list respectively; 2) The <b>floods</b> <b>in</b> this area have obvious(displays definite) time distribution that the <b>floods</b> occur mainly <b>in</b> June, July, August and September; 3) affected by Fu River, Jialing River and Qu River, the waters of all these three rivers can seriously influence the shape of <b>floods</b> <b>in</b> the lower reaches of the Jialing River. Because of the flourishing economy and densely populated towns, strengthening the regional floods’ research has important practical significance which will offer scientific basis for the flood control and disaster alleviation in the area. ...|$|R
