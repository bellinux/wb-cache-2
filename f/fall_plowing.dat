50|$|The {{plants that}} the {{strawberry}} root weevil feeds on include strawberry, raspberry, rhododendron, grape, and peppermint and they have also been known to feed on grasses. Adults feed nocturnally on leaves and stems, leaving notches and causing slight damage, while the larvae cause significantly more damage by feeding on the roots and crowns of the plant, even as they overwinter, if the temperatures are mild. The plants that are fed upon by the larvae are stunted and have reddish leaves that curl exposing the underside, and the plant wilts as the fruits form, especially in dry weather. The fine roots and sometimes even the hard fibrous roots are destroyed, allowing for the plants to be easily pulled from the soil. These plants have significantly shortened lives, poor yields that result in losses in revenue. Fields with significant damage can be up to 0.2ha. Since adults do not fly, plants bordering older plantings show damage the first season, with damage spreading each year the planting is kept.Controlling the {{strawberry root weevil}} includes {{a wide variety of}} methods {{such as the use of}} insecticides, plowing under old crops and crop rotation, cleaning farm equipment before moving to a new field, and <b>fall</b> <b>plowing</b> infested beds or fields.

The emergence trapping method gave acceptable levels of precision for an intensive sampling program. Although significant differences in emergence were found between tillage systems, numbers of seedcorn maggots present were not a serious problem in any system. Emergence was greatest in the fall chisel-plow system, followed by the till-plant system. Emergence in the no-till and fall moldboard-plow systems was similar. Comparisons of emergence between within-row and between-row areas in these systems suggested that germinating soybeans were not attractive for oviposition under field conditions. Surface corn residue and soil moisture were not significant factors influencing oviposition and development;Part II. Interactive damage effects of stand loss and plumule abscission from seedcorn maggot on soybean (var. Amsoy 71) growth and yield were investigated using actual- and simulated-damage methods. Stand reduction affected seed yield more than did the presence of surviving seedlings without plumules. Over all years, seed yields were greatest at 29. 7 plants per 1 -m row. At all plant stands, the seedlings without plumules were shorter and produced less leaf area, fewer flowers, and fewer pods than did normal plants. This retarded growth reduced leaf area index, flowers per unit area, and pods per unit area. The decrease in pods per unit area was accompanied {{by an increase in}} beans per pod. When some of the surviving seedlings lacked plumules, seed yields were reduced at poor plant stands in some years. Plant-growth characteristics were very similar for actual and simulated damage.

In Part II, consumption patterns of soybean leaf tissue by N. rileyi-infected larvae, up to the times of their deaths, were very similar to those of healthy larvae. The annual occurrence of N. rileyi-infected larvae and data presented in Part III suggested that N. rileyi conidia and stroma survive Iowa winters to initiate mycoses in host larvae the next season;Part IV compared GCW larval populations and incidences of biotic mortality agents in alfalfa and soybean habitats. In central Iowa, alfalfa fields may act as 2 ̆ 2 nurseries 2 ̆ 2 for biotic mortality agents. Early-season N. rileyi infections of alfalfa GCW larvae may supply inocula for infections of soybean GCW larvae later in the season. In Part V, analyses of 10 years of GCW collections in soybean provided several quantitative expressions that help explain GCW population dynamics in Iowa. The dates of first N. rileyi occurrence may be predicted by regression equations that use the accumulated number of larva-days during the season and the accumulated precipitation from 1 June as independent variables. Also, the seasonal increase in rate of N. rileyi-caused mortality in outbreak GCW populations is described as a function of the number of days after the date of initial detection of infected larvae.

40|$|The {{public and}} the {{agricultural}} community {{are concerned with the}} impact of agrichemical use on the environment. Of particular concern is the impact of pesticides and nitrogen on the quality of surface and ground waters (Nielson and Lee 1987). Although a national effort is under way to address agricultural contributions to water contamination, lack of data is hindering progress. Data are needed to characterize agrichemical use and its subsequent fate and transport throughout the ecosystem. Reliable data are vital for informed policy decisions weighing the potential risks and benefits (Delwiche 1970). In the absence of that data about total amounts of agrichemicals being used on crops and the rates and methods of application, it is difficult to describe the link between agricultural porduction practices and environmental quality, or to assess the impacts of programs and policies addressing water quality. This report documents the 1989 Recommended Pesticide and Nitrogen Use Survey. The survey was conducted to alleviate part of the data deficiency by collecting detailed information on recommended pesticide and nitrogen uses and application practices in 48 states. Information on usage was obtained by crop, tillage practice, and soil texture. Crops covered in the survey included alfalfa, barley, corn grain, corn silage, cotton oats, pasture, other hay, peanuts, sorghum grain, sorghum silage, soybeans, spring and winter wheat, and sunflowers. Tillage practices included spring and <b>fall</b> <b>plow</b> conventional tillage, conservation tillage, ridge tillage, and no tillage. By providing detailed information on the rate and total amount of agrichemicals applied to the soil surface, the survey provides data for investigating the behavioral and economic links between environmental quality and decision making within agricultural production.

40|$|This {{investigation}} involved three tillage treatments, <b>fall</b> <b>plowed</b> (conventional) (moldboard IS-centimeter depth), fall chiseled (ripped) (25 -centimeter depth), and no-tillage (zero tillage) replicated {{four times}} on an established alfalfa field. Rye was {{planted in the}} fall and harvested prior to planting the corn. Soil samples contained an average of 5. 9 ppm phosphorus in the 0 - 30 centimeter soil layer, indicating the need for additional phosphorus. Within each tillage treatment, six rows received 11 kilograms/hectare phosphorus with the seed and 34 kilograms/hectare phosphorus side-dressed. Six rows received 45 kilograms/hectare phosphorus side-dressed, and four rows received 0 phosphorus. All 16 rows received 64 kilograms/hectare of nitrogen to ensure it was a non-limiting factor. Yields were significantly higher in every tillage plot that received phosphorus compared to the 0 kilograms phosphorus/hectare treatments in the plots. There was a trend of higher yields with the treatments of 11 kilograms/hectare + 34 kilograms/hectare side-dressed compared to the 45 kilograms/ hectare phosphorus side-dressed treatments. However, these were not significantly higher. The no-till plots yielded higher than the ripped or plowed in each tillage treatment. The differences between the no-till and ripped plots were not significant. However, the no-till plots yielded significantly higher than the plowed plot. The no-till 11 kilograms phosphorus + 34 kilograms phosphorus plots averaged 3. 1 Megegrams/hectare higher silage yield than the plowed 11 kilograms phosphorus + 34 kilograms phosphorus plots and 2. 5 Megegrams/hectare higher in the 45 kilograms phosphorus side -dressed plots. Phosphorus uptake was measured by leaf sampling and found to be significantly higher in the no-till plots compared to the ripped and plowed plots.

Nitrogen- 15 depleted NH 4 NO 3 (AN) was hand-injected beside individual plants at the V 1, V 5, and/or V 9 growth stages at rates of 50, 100, and/or 200 kg N ha− 1 with <b>fall</b> moldboard <b>plow</b> (MP), <b>fall</b> chisel <b>plow</b> (CP), and ridge-till (RT) systems. While MP had the highest grain and total dry matter production (but with the lowest N concentrations in those materials), tillage was not a significant factor in either the percentage of the total plant N derived from labeled AN (NF) or its recovery (NR) for any stage sampled. Generally the year (i. e. different environmental conditions) and application timing or a timing-by-year interaction had the greatest influence on NF and NR. Although plants sampled at the V 9 stage on the average recovered more N from the V 1 application (39 %) vs the V 5 application (27 %), at maturity NR values for grain (35 %) and total dry matter (47 %) were the same for both V 1 or V 5 applications (when only two applications were made). However when three applications were made (at the V 1, V 5, and V 9 stages), NR values decreased with time of application for both grain (38, 31, and 26 %, respectively) and total dry matter (53, 43, and 33 %, respectively). Across application timing, grain NR values were 34 and 31 %, respectively, for MP and RT.

40|$|Field, growth-chamber, and constant-temperature room {{experiments}} were conducted {{over three years}} to determine if corn residue exerts toxic effects on corn growth and yield. All three experiments showed that corn residues are toxic, and that this toxicity varies depending on the residue type and the corn genotype grown. Each experiment tested eight genotypes for residue tolerance. In the field studies, some genotypes, such as B 73 and A 632 x H 99, had reduced yields when grown in no-till fields that retained residue. These yield reductions, however, were quite variable depending {{not only on the}} residue in the fields, but on all the other environmental conditions influencing crop growth. More detrimental than no-tillage was the effect of corn residue in a continuous-cropping system. When corn was grown every year in a field, drastic yield reductions occurred. Fields cropped to B 73 x LH 38 showed yield decreases when B 73 x LH 38, B 73, or LH 38 were grown the next year. Corn grown in plots that were continuously cropped and no-tilled had shorter plant heights, fewer leaves, less leaf area, higher field moistures, less dry matter accumulation, slower silking and tasseling, lower plant populations, fewer ears, and less yield than plots that were <b>fall</b> <b>plowed</b> and previously fallowed.

40|$|Selecting a tillage {{system that}} is best suited to a {{particular}} farming situation is an important management decision. In the past, a crop producer 2 ̆ 7 s primary concerns were field capacity {{and the costs of}} owning and operating equipment. However, with rapidly increasing energy costs, alternative tillage systems are being carefully evaluated and selected by more producers. Previously, the most common tillage system included a moldboard plow to turn residue under either in the fall or spring. Following plowing, spring tillage normally included one or more shallow diskings to kill weeds, incorporate fertilizer and pesticides, and provide loose soil for seed. Other light tillage operations, including field cultivation and harrowing, were also conducted to provide a finely pulverized, weed free, seedbed. Today, preplant tillage operations are being reduced on many farms. Labor, fuel and equipment costs, better erosion control, moisture conservation, and more timely planting are all reasons for the trend toward reduced tillage operations. The wide array of tillage and planting systems available today provides an opportunity to match the tillage system to specific soil and cropping conditions. Six different tillage systems are described here to aid in tillage system selection. Tillage System Descriptions Moldboard Plowing. Fall or spring moldboard plowing has been an accepted tillage operation primarily because of soil pulverization and nearly complete residue incorporation (Figure 1). When followed by one or two spring diskings, moldboard plowing provides an excellent seedbed and allows fertilizer and pesticide incorporation before planting. Even though the moldboard plow buries weed seeds, postemergent cultivation for weed control is often needed. <b>Fall</b> <b>plowing</b> also speeds up soil drying and warming in the spring, thus avoiding delays in spring tillage and planting on soils that dry slowly. Fall moldboard plowing has often been used {{to reduce the number of}} spring tillage operations. Poor weather conditions in the spring may cause crops to be planted late because of insufficient time to plow and prepare the seedbed. The primary disadvantage of <b>fall</b> <b>plowing,</b> however, is the potential for soil erosion throughout the winter and early spring because no surface residue is available to protect the soil. Spring plowing not only reduces the potential for wind and water erosion, but also provides winter grazing for livestock. Spring labor and time shortages, however, often offset these advantages. Furthermore, spring plowing may produce clods, which require an extra, unplanned tillage operation to develop a desirable seedbed. Excessive soil moisture loss, especially during dry years, is another disadvantage with spring plowing...|$|E

Economic efficiency was established by calculating the following economic indicators: production per hectare achieved, value of trading, average price recovery, cost of production, cost per unit of product, taxable profit, net income + grants, rate is expressed as %, net profit + subsidy rate. From the cultivars studied, the highest net profit was obtained in cultivation Unirea (8, 976 lei/ha), followed by far by the Purple (6, 745 lei/ha). The main driver of profit was due to the production of plant material. From the three agrofunds, the ones fertilized with 40 t / ha manure {{turned out to be the}} most economically efficient of all cultivars due to higher production per hectare...|$|E
40|$|Water {{conservation}} {{impact on}} wheat yield was evaluated during {{four years of}} study in semi-arid areas of Morocco. ^ The absence of any data on water availability to the crop in a continuous cropping system compared to wheat after fallow led to this research. The ability of the soils to store water during fallow and stored water effectiveness on yield was studied. ^ No-tillage management yielded more in continuous wheat and wheat after fallow. In a very dry year, grain yield in a no-tillage system was 100 % and 72 % higher than the conventional management and <b>fall</b> chisel <b>plowing,</b> respectively in continuous and wheat after fallow. ^ In areas averaging 240 to 300 mm annual rainfall, wheat after fallow used water as efficiently as continuous wheat. No-till management and no soil disturbance in the dry period after harvest was a requirement for successful fallow. ...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) is {{essential}} for sustaining soil health and crop productivity. However, changes in SOM stocks in response to agronomic practices are slow and show years later when {{it is too late}} for adjustments in management. Identifying early indicators of SOM dynamics will allow early management decisions and quick remedial action. The objectives of this study were to evaluate long-term effects of tillage intensity and timing on SOM pools and determine the most responsive SOM pools to tillage practice. Soil from a long-term (53 years) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) -spring pea (Pisum sativum L.) rotation and undisturbed grass pasture (GP) in inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW) was sampled to evaluate the effect of four tillage systems [no-till (NT), disk/chisel (DT/CT), spring <b>plow</b> (SP), and <b>fall</b> <b>plow</b> (FP) ] on soil organic carbon (SOC, proxy for SOM), total nitrogen (TN), particulate organic matter carbon (POM-C) and nitrogen (POM-N), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), water extractable organic carbon (WEOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), KCl-extractable nitrogen (KEN), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), basal respiration (BR), carbon mineralization (Cmin), and metabolic quotient (qCO 2). GP had higher levels of SOC pools than cultivated treatments. On average, tillage significantly decreased SOC and TN by 28 and 26 %, respectively, compared to GP. Among the cultivated soils, tillage had no significant effect on SOC and TN, except for DT/CT that had slightly higher SOC than FP (P = 0. 08). On the contrary, NT and DT/CT significantly (P < 0. 05) increased levels of POM-C, POM-N, POXC, WEOC, MBC, BR, Cmin, and qCO 2 over FP or SP. However, tillage did not affect TDN, MBN, and KEN. The C-pools (POM-C, POXC, MBC, WEOC, BR, and Cmin) were more strongly correlated with SOM than the N-pools (TDN, MBN, and KEN), with an exception to POM-N. Under wheat-pea rotation in the iPNW, reduced tillage systems (NT and DT/CT) have a potential to maintain or increase SOM, which can be assessed early through its physical (POM), chemical (POXC, WEOC), and microbiological (MBC, BR, Cmin) indicators. POXC and WEOC were the most sensitive indicators of tillage-induced changes in SOM dynamics...|$|R
50|$|On the Little Yoho Valley approach, {{the road}} to Takakkaw <b>Falls</b> is not <b>plowed</b> in winter, and must be skied. The first 5 km are {{normally}} trackset. After arriving at the Takakkaw Falls, the route follows the one taken in summer. The ascent from the highway to the hut is approximately 700 m (2,200 ft) over 23 km. Allow a full day for this approach - longer if you are breaking trail. Many people split the trip into two days, with a bivouac at the campground cook shelter just past Takakkaw Falls. There are no amenities at the shelter.|$|R
