5|$|<b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> {{used oil}} shale as a fuel since prehistoric times, since it {{generally}} burns without any processing.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have the}} second largest encephalization levels of any mammal on Earth (<b>humans</b> <b>have</b> the largest), sharing close ratios with those of humans and other great apes, which more than likely contributes to their incredibly high intelligence and emotional intelligence.|$|E

50|$|Every <b>human</b> <b>has</b> {{a unique}} way of {{reacting}} to motives. This is called a character. It {{is the nature of}} the individual will. <b>Human</b> character <b>has</b> four attributes.|$|R
50|$|Thirdly, despite {{accepting}} that modern <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> emerged by evolution, many anthropologists {{believed that the}} genus Homo had split from the great apes as long as 30 million years ago and so felt uneasy about {{accepting that}} <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> a small-brained, ape-like ancestor, like Australopithecus africanus, only two million years ago.|$|R
5|$|<b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> kept {{honey bee}} colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> long {{made use}} of deserts as places to live, and more {{recently}} have started to exploit them for minerals and energy capture. Deserts {{play a significant role}} in human culture with an extensive literature.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds and <b>humans</b> <b>have</b> a {{long history}} together: they have {{provided}} food to hunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land. Many species are currently threatened by human activities, and conservation efforts are under way.|$|E

5|$|Two {{thousand}} years later, <b>humans</b> <b>have</b> become extinct and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced, intelligent, silicon-based form. They find David and Teddy and discover they are original Mecha that knew living humans, making them special.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI. She defends the {{distinction}} between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea that <b>humans</b> <b>have</b> different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach {{is the fact that}} humans are causally responsible for the hardship faced by some animals, but not the hardship faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy in a number of imagined cases in which <b>humans</b> <b>have</b> varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves.|$|E
5|$|<b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> {{lived in}} the {{vicinity}} of Roxy Ann Peak for the past 8,000 to 10,000 years. The first inhabitants were semi-nomadic, most likely living off edible bulbs and large mammals such as mastodons and giant bison. Within the last millennium, the region became home to the Latgawa Native American tribe, who called the peak Al-wiya. They probably used the mountain for gathering acorns and hunting black-tailed deer and small birds, animals which are still abundant there.|$|E

5000|$|One {{million years}} after the events of Babylon 5, the <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> become like the Vorlons. The <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> left the solar system for a planet called [...] "New Earth". J. Michael Straczynski {{indicated}} that New Earth {{was in fact the}} old Vorlon homeworld in the DVD commentary for the episode [...] "The Deconstruction of Falling Stars".|$|R

5|$|<b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> {{lived in}} what is today South Dakota for several {{thousand}} years. The first inhabitants were Paleoindian hunter-gatherers, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC. Between 500AD and 800AD, a semi-nomadic people known as the Mound Builders lived {{in central and eastern}} South Dakota. In the 14th century, the Crow Creek Massacre occurred, in which several hundred men, women, and children were killed near the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|<b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> used {{compasses}} for direction finding {{since the}} 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century. Although the magnetic declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for navigation. Using magnetoception various other organisms, ranging from {{some types of}} bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.|$|E
5|$|Hybridization {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} by human impact on the environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. Such impacts {{make it difficult to}} conserve the genetics of populations undergoing introgressive hybridization. <b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.|$|E
50|$|The C21orf62 {{protein in}} <b>humans</b> <b>has</b> a {{sequence}} that is 219 amino acids in length. The primary sequence of C21orf62 in <b>humans</b> <b>has</b> a molecular weight of 24.9 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8. When it's cleavable signal peptide, which spans amino acids 1-19, is removed, {{it has a}} molecular weight of 22.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.8.|$|R

5|$|In 2154, <b>humans</b> <b>have</b> {{depleted}} Earth's natural resources, {{leading to}} a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — unobtanium — on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting the gas giant Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, a species of , blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature and worship a mother goddess named Eywa.|$|E
5|$|Many procellariids have {{breeding}} {{populations of}} over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. <b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> traditionally exploited {{several species of}} fulmar and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today. Several species are threatened by introduced species attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by long-line fisheries.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{widespread}} groups of mammals, rodents {{can be found on}} every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention. <b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the Polynesian rat). Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold tundra (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, {{until the}} 1940s, most anthropologists {{believed}} that <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> evolved in Asia, not in Africa.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of Parkinson's disease (PD) in <b>humans</b> <b>has</b> {{been linked to}} genetic and environmental factors for many years. However, finding common single insults which can produce pathology in <b>humans</b> <b>has</b> proved difficult. Exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) or traumatic brain injury (TBI) {{has been shown to}} be linked to PD and it has also been proposed that multiple insults may be needed for disease development...|$|R
5|$|Some {{substances}} {{which are}} toxic to <b>humans</b> <b>have</b> {{no effect on}} bees. If bees obtain their nectar from certain flowers, the resulting honey can be psychoactive, or even toxic to humans, but innocuous to bees and their larvae. Poisoning from this honey is called mad honey disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. In total, about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit , and, of these, twelve have {{walked on the}} Moon. Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually {{replaced}} every six months. The farthest that <b>humans</b> <b>have</b> traveled from Earth is 400,171km, achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} has many {{properties}} {{that are common}} to all vertebrate brains, and shares many features common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex {{and a set of}} associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala. The cortex is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans than many other animals. <b>Humans</b> <b>have</b> more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat and the cat.|$|E
