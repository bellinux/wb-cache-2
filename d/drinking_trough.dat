500|$|When Burnside bequeathed {{the money}} for the fountain, she asked that it be {{designed}} for use as a <b>drinking</b> <b>trough</b> for horses and also for dogs. The commission was originally intended for Daniel Chester French, but, according to a paper by Zelotes W. Coombs, French turned down the commission due to [...] "pressure of other engagements, however... he did supervise the work." [...] French assigned the design of the basin to Henry Bacon, who would later work with French on the Lincoln Memorial. The sculpture was assigned to Charles Y. Harvey, a graduate of the American Academy in Rome, who had worked with Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial in Boston.|$|E
500|$|BLM {{began its}} roundup of feral horses on the Pryor Mountains range in early September 2009. After several days, 130 of 188 feral horses were rounded up. Forty-six horses were {{put up for}} adoption, while the freed mares were given a {{contraceptive}} vaccine {{to help keep the}} herd population down. Also in 2009, BLM also placed [...] "guzzlers" [...] on the range. [...] A guzzler is a precipitation (usually rainwater) collection device which traps water in a storage tank ranging in size from a few to several thousand gallons. The storage tank can be above-ground, partially buried, or below-ground. A mechanical valve releases water into a <b>drinking</b> <b>trough</b> from the storage tanks, allowing animals access to the water. When the valve senses that the water level in the trough is low, it opens and allows more water into the drinking area. Five guzzlers were placed in undergrazed areas to encourage the horses to better utilize this forage.|$|E
500|$|Another local legend arose about a stone coffin that {{supposedly}} held Richard's remains, which Speed wrote was [...] "now made a <b>drinking</b> <b>trough</b> for horses at a common Inn". A coffin certainly {{seems to have}} existed; John Evelyn recorded it on a visit in 1654, and Celia Fiennes wrote in 1700 {{that she had seen}} [...] "a piece of his tombstone [...] he lay in, which was cut out in exact form for his body to lie in; {{it remains to be seen}} at ye Greyhound [...] in Leicester but is partly broken." [...] William Hutton found in 1758 that the coffin, which had [...] "not withstood the ravages of time", was kept at the White Horse Inn on Gallowtree Gate. Although the coffin's location is no longer known, its description does not match the style of late 15th-century coffins, and it is unlikely to have had any connection with Richard. It is more likely that it was salvaged from one of the religious establishments demolished following the Dissolution.|$|E

40|$|The {{density of}} {{deposits}} of dung of indigenous large herbivores {{was measured in}} transects starting at <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs</b> in the Kruger National Park. The aim was to test whether a relationship exists between intensity of (large indigenous) herbivore use and distance from <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs.</b> There was a significant positive relationship between intensity of herbivore use and'distance from the troughs. The variance was too high, however, to detect relationships at individual transects or to warrant further modelling of the relationship. It was {{concluded that there was}} indeed a slight concentration of large herbivore rangeland use around the troughs...|$|R

2500|$|At this time, BLM also placed [...] "guzzlers" [...] on the range. [...] A guzzler is a {{precipitation}} (usually rainwater) {{collection device}} which traps {{water in a}} storage tank (ranging in size from a few to several thousand gallons/liters).

40|$|The study {{describes}} the aquatic habitats {{and distribution of}} Triturus alpestris veluchiensis Wolterstorff 1935, T. carnifex macedonicus (Karaman, 1922), T. vulgaris graecus (Wolterstorff, 1905) and Bombina variegata scabra (Küster, 1843) in the district (“nomos”) of Ioannina, Northern Greece. Bombina variegata {{was found to be}} the most common species, followed by T. alpestris and T. carnifex while T. vulgaris seemed to be rare. The four taxa differed in habitat use and geographic distribution. Records of T. alpestris were limited to the highest sites in the north and east of the district. This species inhabited alpine lakes, but also smaller habitats such as <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs</b> and ponds. Four populations contained paedomorphic individuals. Triturus vulgaris appeared to be restricted to low altitude sites in the centre of the district where it lived in reservoirs, watering basins and <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs.</b> Triturus carnifex and B. variegata had a wider distribution and occupied a broader spectrum of habitats. Bombina variegata was the only species studied which lived in running waters (small brooks). Neither newts nor yellow-bellied toads were found in large rivers and lakes. In the district of Ioannina both habitat variety and distribution range of newts and Yellow-bellied Toads turned out to be greater than previously known. Alpine lakes containing very large populations of paedomorphic individuals should be protected given the rarity of the phenomenon. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The feather {{adaption}} {{that allows}} silent flight means that barn owl feathers are not waterproof. To retain the softness and silent flight, the barn owl cannot use the preen oil or powder dust that other species use for waterproofing. In wet weather, they cannot hunt {{and this may}} be disastrous during the breeding season. Barn owls are frequently found drowned in cattle <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs,</b> since they land to drink and bathe, but are unable to climb out. Owls can struggle to keep warm, because of their lack of waterproofing, so large numbers of downy feathers help them to retain body heat.|$|R

50|$|Various of the {{sandstone}} beds of the Millstone Grit have been quarried for building stone, paving flags and roofing material. Its {{use in the}} construction of dry stone walls across the areas where it outcrops is considerable. In neighbouring limestone areas, gritstone has often been preferred in the past for use as gateposts and lintels. The very name of the rock derives from its widespread use within cornmills where it proved suitable for grinding stones. It also found agricultural use as <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs</b> for animals. The majority of the quarrying for such use took place along the eastern edges of the Peak District. Millstone Edge was a significant source whilst abandoned millstones can be seen below the edges at Stanage, Froggatt and Baslow.|$|R

The base is in granite with alternating pink and grey bands, while the upper parts are in sandstone ashlar with red and grey bands. At the front and back, above the spouts, are panels flanked by buttresses, surmounted by crocketted gables and finials. On each side are disused gas mantles. At the top is an octagonal pinnacle over which is a crocketted spire with a wrought iron cross finial. The memorial includes two inscriptions: one refers to the donor, while the other is taken from St John's Gospel.|$|R

It was designed by Colonel John T. Jones in 1828. The oldest parts are of plain yellow stock brick with some stone detailing. The later additions are of red brick and feature three large windows on each side and a clock at the top of its south-facing gable. The gate has three openings which are currently closed off by iron fences. The gatehouse is flanked by two original pavilions, both adorned with recessed rectangular panels and surmounted by brass mortars. An 1859 western annex features a bell tower.

The second faucet is linked to the feed (5) through a bypass around the filter in the interior of the housing, which is at least partially defined by one side of the filter where the untreated water flows past. As the water is taken from the pump it flows along the untreated water side of the filter. The filter is a ceramic micro-filter. USE - The pump is for use with water from wells, cisterns or lakes/ponds and the like, to be used as potable water. ADVANTAGE - The structure allows untreated water to be drawn off e. g. for animal <b>drinking</b> <b>troughs</b> or cleaning, and also provides treated potable water. Drawing off the untreated water has a cleaning action on the filter, increasing the intervals before a filter has to be replaced...|$|R
