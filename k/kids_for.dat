5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young <b>kids</b> <b>for</b> the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|By morning, the UFO {{crash site}} has been sealed {{off by the}} government, who has put out a cover-story that claims a Taco Bell is being built. Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth <b>kids</b> <b>for</b> their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting {{to blow up the}} town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E
5|$|Gifford arrives, {{and most}} of the town attends the celebratory event, where Chef sings a song to seduce her. Mr. Garrison takes his {{position}} in a tall book depository, but he is frustrated to see that Gifford is hidden behind a bulletproof glass bubble. Wendy and Stan arrive and try unsuccessfully to stop Mr. Garrison, saying that they understand his pain, but when Stan accidentally reignites Garrison's anger, he decides to go through with the assassination. Just as he's about to fire, Cartman's new immense weight causes the stage to collapse, catapulting Gifford off it, and causing the bullet to hit Kenny in the head. Kenny is propelled through the air and impaled on a flagpole. Gifford's bodyguards whisk Gifford away, costing a disappointed Cartman his chance to be on television. Wendy takes to the stage and reveals that Cartman cheated on his essay, but the townspeople are too upset about Gifford's departure to care. Mr. Garrison is taken to a mental hospital, where Mr. Hat is placed into a straitjacket. Mr. Garrison apologizes to the <b>kids</b> <b>for</b> costing the town a chance to be on television, although Kyle explains to him that Cartman is now appearing on talk show Geraldo because of his tremendous obesity. The episode ends with Chef having sex with Gifford while watching Geraldo.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>Kids</b> <b>for</b> cash scandal, judge Mark Ciavarella, who {{promoted}} {{a platform of}} zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders, and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Walmart. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offences are normalized. The documentary <b>Kids</b> <b>for</b> Cash interviews experts on adolescent behaviour, who argue that the zero tolerance model has become a dominant approach to policing juvenile offences after the Columbine shooting.|$|E

25|$|Private {{companies}} {{which provide}} services to prisons combine in the American Correctional Association, a 501(c)3 which advocates legislation favorable to the industry. Such private companies comprise what has been termed the prison–industrial complex.

It is possible that the Momotarō being a fine boy version is more famous to give lessons to children. Nowadays, Momotarō {{is one of the most}} famous characters in Japan, as an ideal model for young <b>kids</b> <b>for</b> his kind-heartedness, bravery, power, and care for his parents.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} {{of the success of the}} Cabbage Patch Kids series of dolls, Spiegelman created the card series Garbage Pail <b>Kids</b> <b>for</b> Topps in 1985. [...] Similar to the Wacky Packages series, the gross-out factor of the cards was {{controversial}} with parent groups, and its popularity started a gross-out fad among children. [...] Spiegelman called Topps his [...] "Medici" [...] for the autonomy and financial freedom working for the company had given him. [...] The relationship was nevertheless strained over issues of credit and ownership of the original artwork. [...] In 1989 Topps auctioned off pieces of art Spiegelman had created rather than returning them to him, and Spiegelman broke the relation.|$|E

500|$|Murphy was {{responsible}} for selecting all of the songs covered on the album, and strove to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits.

[...] "Take a Bow" [...] was offered for use at a reduced licensing rate, which surprised Murphy, who had believed {{he would not be able}} to afford the rights given that it had been a number one hit for Rihanna. Neil Diamond had some reluctance over licensing [...] "Sweet Caroline" [...] to the show, and retracted clearance after it had already been recorded.

[...] A minority of those approached refused to allow their music to be used, including Bryan Adams, Guns N' Roses and Coldplay; however, in June 2010, Coldplay reversed their decision, allowing Glee the rights to their catalog.
