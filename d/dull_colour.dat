60|$|What {{the reason}} of colour {{seems to be}} in such thin plated bodies, I have {{elsewhere}} shewn. But how water cast upon those threads destroys their colours, I suppose to be perform'd thus; The water falling upon these plated bodies from its having a greater congruity to Feathers then the Air, insinuates it self between those Plates, and so extrudes the strong reflecting Air, whence both these parts grow more transparent, as the Microscope informs, and colourless also, at best retaining a very faint and <b>dull</b> <b>colour.</b> But this wet being wasted away by the continual evaporations and steams that pass through them from the Peacock, whil'st that Bird is yet alive, the colours again appear in their former luster, the interstitia of these Plates being fill'd with the strongly reflecting Air.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Walter Crane, who has {{illustrated}} so many {{fairy tales}} for children, sends an ambitious work called the Renaissance of Venus, {{which in the}} <b>dull</b> <b>colour</b> of its 'sunless dawn,' and in its general want of all the glow and beauty and passion that one associates with this scene reminds one of Botticelli's picture of the same subject. After Mr. Swinburne's superb description of the sea-birth of the goddess in his Hymn to Proserpine, it is very strange to find a cultured artist of feeling producing such a vapid Venus as this. The best thing in it is the painting of an apple tree: {{the time of year}} is spring, and the leaves have not yet come, but the tree is laden with pink and white blossoms, which stand out in beautiful relief against the pale blue of the sky, and are very true to nature.|$|E
50|$|Millerite is {{a nickel}} sulfide mineral, NiS. It is brassy in colour {{and has an}} {{acicular}} habit, often forming radiating masses and furry aggregates. It can be distinguished from pentlandite by crystal habit, its <b>duller</b> <b>colour,</b> and general lack of association with pyrite or pyrrhotite.|$|R
50|$|Ephemera vulgata {{can be told}} in both {{adult and}} subimago stages from the rather similar green drake (Ephemera danica) by its <b>duller</b> <b>colour</b> and {{slightly}} smaller size. The wings are more heavily veined and the upper side of the abdomen has pairs of dark lateral markings on each segment.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, {{with the}} threat of war looming, new {{markings}} colours were introduced along with camouflage. The Blue was darker, becoming similar to FS 595 25050 while the Red became a slightly brownish brick-red, about FS 595 20109. The Trainer Yellow stayed the same shade but all colours were now matt. These colours remained standard for another eight years. To further complicate matters, old stocks continued to be used up - a series of colour photos of a Miles Master show wing and fuselage roundels (C & C1) in <b>dull</b> <b>colours,</b> while the fin flash remains in the bright pre-war colours, albeit with the later proportions. Other colour photos show a mixture of bright and <b>dull</b> <b>colours</b> being used on the same insignia - though all instances found have been of trainers.|$|R
6000|$|The {{fruit of}} the Melon is greatly {{influenced}} by slight differences in culture and climate. Hence it is generally a better plan, according to Naudin, to improve an old kind than to introduce a new one into any locality. The seed of the Persian Melon produces near Paris fruit inferior to the poorest market kinds, but at Bordeaux yields delicious fruit. (23/13. Naudin 'Annales des Sc. Nat.' 4th series, Bot. tome 11 1859 page 81. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1859 page 464.) Seed is annually brought from Thibet to Kashmir (23/14. Moorcroft 'Travels' etc. volume 2 page 143.) and produces fruit weighing from four to ten pounds, but plants raised next year from seed saved in Kashmir give fruit weighing only from two to three pounds. It {{is well known that}} American varieties of the Apple produce in their native land magnificent and brightly- coloured fruit, but these in England are of poor quality and a <b>dull</b> <b>colour.</b> In Hungary there are many varieties of the kidney-bean, remarkable for the beauty of their seeds, but the Rev. M.J. Berkeley (23/15. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page 1113.) found that their beauty could hardly ever be preserved in England, and in some cases the colour was greatly changed. We have seen in the ninth chapter, with respect to wheat, what a remarkable effect transportal from the north to the south of France, and conversely, produced on the weight of the grain.] ...|$|E

50|$|It breeds {{in shallow}} marshes and {{possibly}} well vegetated ponds. Its <b>dull</b> <b>colours</b> may render it very inconspicuous, {{so that it}} can be easily overlooked. The longitudinally bicolor pterostigma, the small black nodal point on the costa, and the characteristically broad right-angled anal appendages easily serve to distinguish it from other species.|$|R
50|$|The white-backed swallow has {{a deeply}} forked tail, with curved and pointed wings. The short bill is black; {{the legs and}} feet are grey. They have a slender, {{streamlined}} body. Their eyes consist of a prominent, dark iris. The sexes have similar colouring but during adolescence the white-backed swallow has <b>duller</b> <b>colours.</b>|$|R
50|$|These are {{medium-sized}} {{to large}} (10-13 cm) hummingbirds with shortish slightly curved black bills.

50|$|The stamens are {{attached}} to the tube of the perianth in a helmet-like manner and, with the flat-topped stigma lobes, may form an insect trap; a sweet musky odour has been detected from these flowers and this may attract flies as pollinators. After pollination, the scape bends over and the developing fruits rest on the ground. The fleshy fruits are a <b>dull</b> <b>colour</b> with soft jelly-like pulp, and {{it is possible that the}} seeds are dispersed by rodents and other small mammals as they feed on the fruits.|$|E

50|$|Some of the {{characteristics}} of the flowers of midge orchids, such as small size, <b>dull</b> <b>colours</b> and hairy parts waving in a breeze, suggest pollination by small flies. Some studies have suggested that the flowers are pollinated exclusively by flies of the Superfamily Chloropoidea (now in the Family Milichiidae). A few species, such as the New Zealand G. nudum appear to exclusively self-pollinate.|$|R
50|$|This swallow averages 13.5 cm {{long and}} weighs about 20 g. The bill is tiny. The adult tree swallow has {{iridescent}} blue-green upperparts, white underparts, {{and a very}} slightly forked tail. The female usually has <b>duller</b> <b>colours</b> than the male, often more greenish than the more bluish male. The juvenile plumage is dull grey-brown above and may have hint of a grey breast band.|$|R
50|$|They appear stocky {{with a short}} neck, short thick {{bill and}} buff-brown back. In summer, adults have long neck feathers. Its {{appearance}} is transformed from their <b>dull</b> <b>colours</b> when they take to flight, when {{the white of the}} wings makes them very prominent. It is very similar to the squacco heron, Ardeola ralloides, but is darker-backed. To the east of its range, it is replaced by the Chinese pond heron, Ardeola bacchus.|$|R
50|$|The Imperial Russian Army fought {{mostly in}} white or in dark green colours (introduced by Peter the Great in 1700), even if several regiments (Life Guards regiments, Cavalry Guards, Dragoons and Uhlans regiments) dressed in {{distinctive}} and colourful attire. Cossack regiments {{were reported to}} use basic camouflage patterns and techniques during the Crimean War. <b>Duller</b> <b>colours</b> were used unofficially in the 1880s and again in 1905.

5000|$|Hume's leaf warbler {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} [...] "Old World warblers". Like most other leaf warblers, it has greenish upperparts and off-white underparts. With its long supercilium, crown stripe and yellow-margined tertial remiges, it is very similar to the yellow-browed warbler (P. inornatus). However, it has only one prominent light wing bar, just a faint vestige of the second shorter wing bar, and overall <b>duller</b> <b>colours.</b> It also has a dark lower mandible and legs.|$|R
50|$|The Atherton antechinus is a <b>dull</b> brown <b>colour,</b> and {{is among}} {{the largest of the}} antechinuses. The species has an almost naked tail.|$|R
5|$|The female is {{very similar}} to the male but the upper parts are {{somewhat}} more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes. The throat and breast are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak is similar to the male's winter beak. The juvenile are a <b>duller</b> <b>colour</b> than the adults with pale coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult. The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn.|$|R
50|$|The Weddell seal grows a thin {{fur coat}} around its whole body except for small {{areas around the}} flippers. The colour and pattern of the coat varies, often fading to a <b>duller</b> <b>colour</b> as the seal ages. This coat moults around the {{beginning}} of summer. Adults are generally brown, with lighter ventral (belly) pelage. They are mottled with large darker and lighter patches, those on the belly being silvery white. Adult males usually bear scars, most of them around the genital region.|$|R
