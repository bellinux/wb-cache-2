5|$|Marguerite Louise's caprices lead to sour {{relations}} with the family.

5|$|While Article 34 of the {{constitution}} of Luxembourg formerly required the <b>grand</b> <b>duke</b> or duchess to sanction and promulgate a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> Henri informed his prime minister {{that he could not}} in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only promulgation (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.|$|E

5|$|Báthory's {{position}} {{was at first}} extremely difficult, as there was still some opposition to his election. Emperor Maximilian, insisting on his earlier election, fostered internal opposition and prepared to enforce his claim by military action. At first {{the representatives of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize Báthory as <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke,</b> and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June Báthory was recognized as <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> of Lithuania, Duke of Ruthenia and Samogitia.|$|E

The {{secretary of the}} French embassy was also concerned with his well being. Some of the grand dukes' relatives made frantic efforts to obtain their release through Maxim Gorky who was sympathetic and asked Lenin to set them free. Gorky ultimately obtained Lenin's signature for the <b>grand</b> <b>duke's</b> release. He rushed to return to Petrograd to have them freed. On the platform however, {{he picked up a}} newspaper whose headline rang out, [...] "Romanovs Shot!". [...] Brummer, who had heard rumors that the <b>grand</b> <b>dukes</b> had been condemned to death, only learned the tale of the <b>grand</b> <b>duke's</b> murder years later.

5|$|Cosimo III de' Medici (14 August 1642 – 31 October 1723) was the {{penultimate}} (sixth) Medici <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> of Tuscany. He reigned from 1670 to 1723, and was {{the elder}} son of <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> Ferdinando II. Cosimo's 53-year-long reign, the longest in Tuscan history, was marked {{by a series of}} ultra-reactionary laws which regulated prostitution and banned May celebrations. His reign also witnessed Tuscany's deterioration to previously unknown economic lows. He was succeeded by his elder surviving son, Gian Gastone, when he died, in 1723.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo de' Medici {{was born}} on 14 August 1642, the eldest {{surviving}} son of Vittoria della Rovere of Urbino, and Ferdinando II de' Medici, <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> of Tuscany. Their previous two children had died shortly after birth. <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> Ferdinando wished to give his son the finest scientific education available, but the pious Grand Duchess Vittoria opposed. The latter got her way. Volunnio Bandinelli, a Sienese theologian, was appointed Cosimo's tutor. His character was analogous to the Grand Duchess's.|$|E
5|$|Cracks in the {{cooperation}} between Poland and Lithuania {{after the death}} of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. Władysław supported his brother Švitrigaila as <b>grand</b> <b>duke</b> of Lithuania, but when Švitrigaila, {{with the support of the}} Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles, rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków, occupied Podolia, which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and Volhynia. In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas's brother Žygimantas as <b>grand</b> <b>duke,</b> leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław's death.|$|E

5|$|<b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> Vytenis' origins are {{relatively}} well-established; {{he was the}} son of Butvydas, who was <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have been related by blood, and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> Constantine Nikolaievich was {{appointed}} viceroy of Russian Poland {{by his brother}} and moved to Warsaw {{with his wife and}} children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke,</b> who was the victim of a nationalist assassination attempt the day after his arrival in the Polish capital. Although Constantine embarked on a program of liberalization and re-instated Polish as an official language, Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August. Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.|$|E
5|$|The Lithuanian Civil War of 1389–92 was {{the second}} civil {{conflict}} between Jogaila, King of Poland and <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> of Lithuania, and his cousin Vytautas. At issue was control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Jogaila had been crowned King of Poland in 1386; he installed his brother Skirgaila as ruler of Lithuania. Skirgaila proved unpopular and Vytautas attempted to depose him. When his first attempt to take {{the capital city of}} Vilnius failed, Vytautas forged an alliance with the Teutonic Knights, their common enemy – just as both cousins had done during the Lithuanian Civil War between 1381 and 1384. Vytautas and the Knights unsuccessfully besieged Vilnius in 1390. Over the next two years it became clear that neither side could achieve a quick victory, and Jogaila proposed a compromise: Vytautas would become <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> and Jogaila would remain Superior Duke. This proposal was formalized in the Ostrów Agreement of 1392, and Vytautas turned against the Knights. He went on to reign as <b>Grand</b> <b>Duke</b> of Lithuania for 38 years, and the cousins remained at peace.|$|E
