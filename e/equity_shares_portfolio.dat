40|$|What does {{financial}} globalization imply for {{the design}} of monetary policy? Does the case for price stability change in an environment of large cross country gross asset holdings?. This paper is concerned with the effects of monetary policy under endogenous international portfolio choice and incomplete markets. With endogenous portfolios, monetary policy takes on new importance due to its impact on the distribution of returns on nominal assets. Surprisingly, we find an even stronger case for price stability in this environment. Even without nominal rigidities, price stability has a welfare benefit by enhancing the risk sharing capacity of nominal bond returns.

40|$|Management of {{the coastal}} zone often focuses on "islands" of high value ecosystems, in terms of {{economic}} value or conservation. However, integrated management requires landscape-level analysis of all ecosystem values. The biodiversity portfolio analysis (BPA) method is derived from the logic used in <b>share</b> (<b>equity)</b> <b>portfolio</b> management in terms of balancing within a portfolio the returns with the risks. Optimising the returns from a <b>share</b> <b>portfolio,</b> or a suite of ecosystems in a landscape, is dependent on the relationship between the units in terms of risk and return. Three case studies are then presented to test the applicability of the BPA method at the international (North West Europe), regional (Durham Heritage Coast, UK) and local (part of South Uist, Outer Hebrides, UK) spatial scale. The Biodiversity Portfolio Analysis for NW Europe showed that risk and return were highly correlated in the studied Member States. The ranking of risk and return, with the highest first, was Ireland > UK > France=Netherlands > Belgium. For these Member States the risks to ecosystem service provision were positively correlated with GNI (r= 0. 97, PIntegrated Coastal Zone Management Coastal management Environmental economics Stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how different asset allocation strategies {{over the course}} of a worker’s career affect the distribution of retirement wealth and the expected utility of wealth at retirement. It considers both rules that allocate a constant portfolio fraction to various assets at all ages, as well as “lifecycle ” rules that vary the mix of portfolio assets as the worker ages. The analysis simulates retirement wealth using asset returns that are drawn from the historical return distribution. The results suggest that the distribution of retirement wealth associated with typical lifecycle investment strategies is similar to that from age-invariant asset allocation strategies that set the <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> of the <b>portfolio</b> equal to the average <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> in the lifecycle strategies. There is substantial variation across workers with different characteristics in the expected utility from following different asset allocation strategies. The expected utility associated with different 401 (k) asset allocation strategies, and the ranking of these strategies, is very sensitive to three parameters: the expected return on corporate stock, the worker’s relative risk aversion, and the amount of non- 401 (k) wealth that the worker will have available at retirement. At modest levels of risk aversion, or in the presence of substantial non- 401 (k) wealth at retirement, the historical pattern of stock and bond returns implies that the expecte...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} settlement-date {{accounting}} for <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> options {{can be seen}} as an accounting method which implements a shareholder focused residually rewarded partners’ equity view. This equity view represents a simple, natural extension of the shareholder proprietary view. It implicates an <b>equity</b> and income <b>sharing</b> model for accounting which is characterized by specification of both shareholders’ and non-shareholders’ parts of total equity and income. When using this <b>equity</b> and income <b>sharing</b> model, the remeasurements of <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> option obligations made by settlement-date accounting are fully conceptually valid. They represent measurements of one partner group’s <b>share</b> of total <b>equity</b> with effect for another group’s <b>share</b> of total <b>equity</b> and income: the shareholders’ part. Partially, this <b>equity</b> and income <b>sharing</b> model is already the basis for existing accounting standards. It is shown that an intriguing implication of the <b>equity</b> and income <b>sharing</b> model is the fact that treasury shares can hedge present shareholders’ share price risk from the obligation to holders of <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> options. A special hedge accounting construct is needed to account for this hedge effect, and the construct of this model is shown. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the long run expense effects for shareholders from <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> options by settlement-date accounting both when the expense effects are unhedged and when they are hedged with treasury share holdings. The results demonstrate that the expenses resulting from settlement-date accounting for <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> option awards are significantly higher on average than the expenses resulting from grant-date accounting. And they show that the cost of <b>equity,</b> the <b>share</b> price volatility and the lifetime of the <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> options are important determinants for the size of the differences in total expenses, which in a long run perspective is to be expected from the use of these two alternative accounting models for <b>equity</b> <b>share</b> options. The simulation results demonstrate that hedging with treasury share holdings is very effective to stabilize expenses resulting from options granted to employeesNo keywords;...|$|R
