5|$|Force H was {{recalled}} to the United Kingdom in January and Argus loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron {{for her own}} protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some Supermarine Spitfire {{fighters and}} returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to Eagle and embarked nine Fairey Fulmar fighters of 807 Squadron. The plan for Operation Spotter <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> Argus to provide fighter cover for Eagle as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7 March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off. During Operation Picket I, nine more Spitfires were flown off by Eagle on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane IIBs from 804 Squadron provided air cover from Argus. The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when Eagle flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from Argus. The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well, but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly-off was cancelled.|$|E

500|$|In 1844 Helm {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate, where he served until 1848. That year he was the Whig {{candidate}} for lieutenant governor on a ticket with John J. Crittenden. Helm defeated Democrat John Preston Martin in the general election. The major political question in the state during Helm's time as lieutenant governor was whether to adopt a new state constitution. As a state senator in 1848, Helm had voted to allow the state's citizens to decide the matter in a referendum, but after seeing the document produced by the constitutional convention, he opposed its ratification. In an address to the state senate in 1850 he declared, [...] "I was for reform, and not for revolution. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> amending the Constitution, and not for obliterating every vital principle in contained." [...] He especially opposed creating an elective judiciary. His antagonism to the constitution put him at odds with his father-in-law, Benjamin Hardin. The two did not reconcile until 1852, as Hardin lay on his deathbed. The new constitution was adopted in 1850, and in June of that year Helm encouraged the people to accept it.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{happily married}} to a Jewish man, Woolf often wrote of Jewish {{characters}} in stereotypical archetypes and generalisations, including describing some of her Jewish characters as physically repulsive and dirty. For example, while travelling on a cruise to Portugal she protests at finding [...] "a great many Portuguese Jews on board, and other repulsive objects, but we keep clear of them". Furthermore, she wrote in her diary: [...] "I {{do not like the}} Jewish voice; I do not like the Jewish laugh." [...] In a 1930 letter to the composer Ethel Smyth, quoted in Nigel Nicolson's biography Virginia Woolf, she recollects her boasts of Leonard's Jewishness confirming her snobbish tendencies, [...] "How I hated marrying a Jew—What a snob <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>for</b> they have immense vitality." ...|$|E
