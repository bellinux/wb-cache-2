2500|$|This is {{the most}} common type of ozone {{generator}} for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the [...] "hot spark" [...] coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a corona discharge tube. They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3â€“6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce nitrogen oxides as a by-product. Use of an air <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an oxygen concentrator can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.|$|E

50|$|Brief Introduction Rotary dryer is {{suitable}} to dry metallic and nonmetallic mineral, clay in cement industrial and coal slime in coal mine,etc. Rotary <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be widely used to dry various materials, {{and it is}} simple to be operated.|$|E
50|$|Towel <b>dryers</b> <b>can</b> be {{made from}} {{different}} metals such as steel, stainless steel, or aluminum. In some types brass or copper is used. The finish can be in chrome plating, polished steel or lacquer. <b>Dryers</b> <b>can</b> be heated electrically (heating cartridge or heating cable) or by circulating hot water (connected to the central heating). Often {{a combination of the}} methods is used. In these cases the dryer is heated by hot water in winter time and by electricity in the summer. A towel dryer, with high output, can also serve as a radiator in a small bathroom.|$|R

50|$|Clothes <b>dryers</b> <b>can</b> cause static cling, {{through the}} triboelectric effect. This {{can be a}} minor nuisance, and is often a symptom of over-drying {{textiles}} to an extremely low humidity level. Fabric conditioners and dryer sheets are marketed to correct this condition.|$|R
50|$|Many dryers {{also have}} {{attachments}} for drying shoes or boots, or air pouches {{which can be}} folded to dry clothes {{in place of a}} clothes dryer. The <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be run for under an hour to warm the futon without completely drying it, or over an hour to reduce the population of mites.|$|E
50|$|The {{versatility}} of {{the rolling}} bed dryer is based on its simple idea of product circulation. The biomass processed through the rolling bed <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be not only efficiently dried but also has the option of being cleaned simultaneously. This provides for efficiency and conservation in energy which results in lower production costs. Biomass is being increasingly used as an alternative fuel source. Providing for this demands innovative solutions.|$|E
50|$|These {{centrifuge}} machines simply spin their drums {{much faster}} than a typical washer could, in order to extract additional water from the load. They may remove more water in two minutes than a heated tumbler <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> in twenty, thus saving significant amounts of time and energy. Although spinning alone will not completely dry clothing, this additional step saves a worthwhile {{amount of time and}} energy for large laundry operations such as those of hospitals.|$|E
50|$|Hair <b>dryers</b> <b>can</b> {{also be used}} as a tool {{to sculpt}} the hair to a very slight degree. Proper {{technique}} involves aiming the dryer such that the air does not blow onto the face or scalp, which can cause burns.|$|R
50|$|Spray <b>dryers</b> <b>can</b> dry {{a product}} very quickly {{compared}} to other methods of drying. They also turn a solution, or slurry into a dried powder in a single step, which can be advantageous as it simplifies the process and improves profit margins.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum coaters {{are capable}} of {{applying}} various types of coatings on metal, glass, plastic or ceramic surfaces, providing high quality and uniform thickness and color. Vacuum <b>dryers</b> <b>can</b> be used for delicate materials and save significant quantities of energy due to lower drying temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Grain drying is {{an active}} area of {{manufacturing}} and research. The performance of a <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be simulated with computer programs based on mathematical models that represent the phenomena involved in drying: physics, physical chemistry, thermodynamics and heat and mass transfer. Most recently computer models {{have been used to}} predict product quality by achieving a compromise between drying rate, energy consumption, and grain quality. A typical quality parameter in wheat drying is breadmaking quality and germination percentage whose reductions in drying are somewhat related.|$|E
50|$|A rotary <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> {{consist of}} a single shell or many, though any more than three drums is not usually necessary. Multiple drums can {{reduce the amount of}} space that the {{equipment}} consumes. Multi-shell dryers consist of several concentric tubes. Multiple shells allow the dryer to be utilized in a more compact space. The drums are often heated directly by oil or gas burners. The addition of a combustion chamber on the entry end helps ensure efficient fuel usage, and that homogenous drying air temperatures. As the material moves through the rotating drum is heated and moisture released. Some dryers also offer the option to cool, clean, shred, and/or separate the dried material.|$|E
50|$|A futon {{must be kept}} dry because human {{sweat and}} body heat create a warm, moist {{environment}} which is amenable to mites. Traditionally futons are kept dry by hanging them out on a balcony in the sun to dry in the open air, but some people are too busy to do this since they must be hung during daylight hours and brought in before sunset, when the temperature drops and moisture condenses inside the futon. Finding time to hang a futon may also be difficult {{during the rainy season}} in Japan, since there are few sunny days and there are frequent and sudden periods of rain so a futon <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> fulfill the function of keeping the futon dry and keeping the level of mites living in the futon down without needing to hang it out.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{temperature}} is considered {{as the most}} important factor in drying processes, and most of the drying processes are governed by temperature control. This study, mainly, focuses on the other two factors, humidity and air flow. The humidity in a <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be controlled by the change of exhaust air rate to the dryer. The humidity within the <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be held constant through the control of the recirculation rate using a proportional value. The air flow can be changed by fruit packing or dryer structure design. The air speed in laminar flow dryers relies on the fruit spacing to achieve the required air speed. This dependence can be removed through designing dryers that use 'turbulent flow'. Our simulation study shows that a dryer with such a control system can produce fruit that has super quality at a lower cost in a known time frame...|$|E

40|$|Early season maize is {{harvested}} {{with high}} moisture content {{that makes it}} impossible to store. The sale of early season maize in green form is uneconomical to the farmer. Experience had shown that farmers could hardly make the cost of production from their sales. Also, grain losses are high when maize is harvested green. To minimize grain losses and thereby increase value and the profit margin of the farmer, a grain dryer is necessary for wet grains. Therefore, this paper presents the design and development of a batch in-bin maize grain dryer. Some properties of maize such as moisture content and bulk density were determined to get information required for design of the dryer. The dimension of drying chamber, amount of moisture to be removed in a batch, quantity of air required to effect drying, volume of air required to effect drying, blower capacity, quantity of heat required to effect drying and actual heat used to effect drying were all designed for. A maize dryer was developed with a batch size of 100 kg of threshed wet maize. The <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be used in laboratory for experimental purpose {{as well as on the}} farm for commercial purposes. The <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be used to measure drying rates of maize at different initial moisture contents, drying air temperatures, drying air velocities and grain beds.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} methodology {{was developed}} to improve the energy design of paddle dryers for sewage sludges. A laboratory batch dryer with a vertical agitator has been especially designed and instrumented to determine the heat flux densities. To determine the drying kinetic and the evaporating flow rates, the specific heat and the total heat of desorption of the sludge were measured using calorimetric devices. The evaporating flow rates recorded during the pasty and granular phases were then used in a simple model of the paddle dryer. The good agreement between the computed drying kinetics and the experimental ones measured in an industrial paddle dryer shows that the batch <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be used to classify the sludges according to their capacity to be dried in a paddle dryer...|$|E

The characteristics of biomass feedstocks and IGBP's of relevance to the drying process are then discussed. Suitable dryer types for an IGBP are then identified and described in detail, with performance data for the drying of biomass feedbacks provided where available. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSludge drying is an {{important}} intermediate process for sewage sludge treatment, usage, and disposal. A series of drying experiments were conducted in a continuous paddle dryer {{in order to have}} a better understanding of the sludge drying mechanism. The couple model of penetration model and Markov chain was used to simulate the drying kinetics in a continuous paddle dryer. The drying process has been compared in experimental and theoretical results, which show good agreement. The sewage sludge drying process in a continuous paddle <b>dryer</b> <b>can</b> be divided into three stages: the pasty phase, the sticky phase, and the complete-granular phase. The influences of the drying parameters on the sludge drying kinetics in a continuous paddle dryer were investigated.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} with {{experimental study of}} deep-bed grain drying in a 0. 75 meter diameter dryer-column. The experimental work were {{carried out in the}} range of drying conditions such as drying air flow rate (0. 08 - 0. 12 m/s), drying air temperature (50 - 70 oC), and thickness of bed layer (2. 5 - 5 cm). The experimental data presents the dynamic of moisture content of corn grain corresponding with drying condition. The dynamic of moisture content has been analyzed for the variable condition to carry out drying of corn grain. The drying-rate curve was shown at the various drying-air temperatures. Furthermore, the experimental data will be used to validate the developed model. For the dry grain load of 12 kg, we need about 2. 25, 2. 8 and 4. 2 hours of drying time for drying air temperature 70, 60, and 50 oC respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Unbalance in <b>dryer</b> <b>cans</b> {{will result}} in high {{structural}} vibrations throughout the dryer section. As the machine operating speed increases, unbalance forces increase dramatically, leading to reliability and product quality problems. Correcting dryer unbalance presents significant technical challenges, due to slow turning speeds, and phase influence of nearby dryers. Traditional correction methods have included extended shutdowns, resulting in significant lost production costs. A revolutionary new technique has been developed, using regular maintenance shutdowns as the opportunity for incremental corrections. The new approach {{has proven to be}} especially valuable during speed-up projects. This paper describes the challenges, solutions, and benefits of the In-Situ Roll Balancing technique.
