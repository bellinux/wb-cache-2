50|$|The 1947 Act, in effect, nationalised {{the right}} to develop land. It {{required}} all proposals, with a few exceptions, to secure planning permission from the local authority, with provision to appeal against refusal. It introduced a <b>development</b> <b>charge</b> to capture the planning gain which arises when permission to develop land is granted. This was abolished by the 1954 Town and Country Planning Act passed under subsequent Conservative government. Green belts were added in 1955 via a government circular. Furthermore, the 1947 Act introduced a requirement, which still exists, on local authorities to develop forward looking policy documents such as Local Plans or Unitary Development Plans to outline what kind of development is permitted where, and to mark special areas on Local Plan Maps (today referred to as policies map).

40|$|This report {{responds}} to a complaint filed pursuant to Section 20 of the Development Charges Act, 1997 relating to a proposed residential {{land development project}} consisting of 134 townhouse units located at 351 Wallace Avenue. The two issues raised in the complaint relate to the rate {{that ought to be}} applied in calculating the <b>development</b> <b>charge.</b> The complainant’s position is that the rates in effect when the building permit was submitted (December 31, 2004) should be applied in determining the <b>development</b> <b>charge</b> instead of the rate in effect at the time of permit issuance (November 24, 2009). In addition, the complainant argues that the <b>development</b> <b>charge</b> rate for "apartment units " should be applied in the calculation of the charge rather than the "multiple unit " rate that was applied. Staff is of the opinion that the development charges were properly calculated and collected. In accordance with the City's <b>development</b> <b>charge</b> bylaw, the charges are calculated and become due and payable based on the rates in effect at the time of building permit issuance. Also, the residential units in the project do not meet the definition of "apartment unit", as defined in the bylaw, and the "multiple dwelling unit " rates apply.

40|$|Summary. This article {{attempts}} to determ ine how {{the interplay of}} stakeholders in a larger economic and political context in ¯ uences the design of <b>development</b> <b>charge</b> regim es in particu lar jurisdictions. As a vehicle for this exploration, the authors pose the question: Why do so many municipalities adopt average cost approaches to calcu lating development charges when it is widely assumed that a marginal cost approach is superior from an infrastru cture and land-use ef ® ciency perspective? The question is addressed through a case study method, which focuses {{on the creation of}} <b>development</b> <b>charge</b> regim es in Ontario, Canada, and in particu lar on eight `focus ’ municipalities within the Greater Toronto Area. The article begins by presen ting the `pragmatic ’ explanations for adopting an average cost approach offered by ® nance of ® cials and consultants. These explanations presen t the average cost method as the outcome of the deliberate application of basic principles of ef ® ciency, equity, administrative simplicity and public accep t-ability. We proceed by showing that such explanations are incomplete or incoherent in important ways and turn to more `critical ’ explanation s, which require an understan ding of developer± municipal con ¯ ict over the principles involved in the design of development charges. This lead s us to an account of the emergence of development charges in Ontario and the evolvin g debate between municipalities and developers over who should pay for the infrastru cture needed to support growth. This account reveals {{that there has been a}} gradual shift in municipal infrastru c-ture ® nancing practices from a marginal cost or `site-sp eci ® c ’ approach, favoured by developers, to an average cost or `municipality-w ide ’ approach, favoured by municipalities. Associated with this trend has been an evolu tion from negotiated charges to formulaic charges. In the conclusion s, a number of factors underlying this evolu tion are identi ® ed...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{dynamics}} {{of land use}} in the State of Oregon are simulated on a digital computer. The introductory chapter outlines the complex nature of the problems facing the post-industrial society and argues that the scientific and professional estates share in the responsibility for public policy formulation. The second chapter. presents an historical perspective of land use in Oregon, from the indigenous Indians {{of the eighteenth century}} to the present-day Land Conservation and Development Commission. Chapter three outlines in detail the systems simulation methodology employed in the formulation and testing of the Oregon State Simulation Model (OSSIM). The development of the OSSIM, a large scale socio-economic model of Oregon, was one element of an interdisciplinary project sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation entitled "Man's Activities as related to Environmental Quality. " Systems simulation is viewed as an iterative problem investigation process that includes problem definition, simulation model development and testing, and application of the results in a policy setting. The chapter concludes with {{a brief description of the}} seven OSSIM components: Demographic; Economic; Land Use; Transportation; Energy; Pollution; and Government Revenue. In chapter four, the structure and {{dynamics of}} the land use component of OSSIM are presented. The land in each of three regions of Oregon (the Willamette Valley, the coastal region and eastern Oregon) is assigned to one of eight use categories: residential, further disaggregated into three household density classes; agricultural; forest; industrial/commercial; open space/wilderness; and unused land (a residual). The demand for housing (and residential land) is driven by the demographic component of OSSIM. Housing stock is updated to keep pace with the changing demand, the land being supplied from the agricultural and forest use categories. Agricultural land is treated as a factor of production in the agricultural sector model. Speculation in the land market is modeled in detail, with the rising speculative value of agricultural land augmenting farm capital formation. Zoning, land taxation and the systems <b>development</b> <b>charge</b> are typical policy variables. Verification, validation and sensitivity testing of the land use model is discussed in chapter five. Chapter six presents conclusions drawn from the work as a whole, including those relevant to: the utility of large scale simulations of socio-economic systems; land use policy in Oregon; interdisciplinary research...|$|E

The optimal pH conditions for hydrolysis precipitates formation for AlCl 3, PAC(A 113) and PAC(A 130) were 6. 5 - 7. 5, 8. 5 - 9. 5, and 7. 5 - 9. 5, respectively. The precipitates' formation rate increased {{with the increase in}} dosage, and the relative rates were AlCl 3 >> PAC(A 130) > PACA 113. The precipitates' size increased when the dosage increased from 50 mu M to 200 mu M, but it decreased when the dosage increased to 800 AM. The Zeta potential of coagulant hydrolysis precipitates decreased with the increase in pH for the three coagulants. The isoelectric points of the freshly formed precipitates for AlCl 3, PAC(A 113) and PAC(A 130) were 7. 3, 9. 6 and 9. 2, respectively. The Zeta potentials of AlCl 3 hydrolysis precipitates were lower than those of PAC(A 113) and PAC(A 130) when pH > 5. 0. The Zeta potential of PAC(A 130) hydrolysis precipitates was higher than that of PACA 113 at the acidic side, but lower at the alkaline side. The dosage had no obvious effect on the Zeta potential of hydrolysis precipitates under fixed pH conditions. The increase in Zeta potential with the increase in dosage under uncontrolled pH conditions was due to the pH depression caused by coagulant addition. Al-Ferron research indicated that the hydrolysis precipitates of AlCl 3 were composed of amorphous AI(OH) 3 precipitates, but those of PACA 113 and PACA 130 were composed of aggregates of Al- 13 and Al- 30, respectively. Al 3 + was the most un-stable species in coagulants, and its hydrolysis was remarkably influenced by solution pH. Al- 13 and Al- 30 species were very stable, and solution pH and aging had little effect on the chemical species of their hydrolysis products. The research method involving coagulant hydrolysis precipitates based on Al-Ferron reaction kinetics was studied in detail. The Al species classification based on complex reaction kinetic of hydrolysis precipitates and Ferron reagent was different from that measured in a conventional coagulant assay using the Al [...] Ferron method. The chemical composition of Al-a, Al-b and Al-c depended on coagulant and solution pH. The Al-b measured in the current case was different from Keggin Al- 13, and the high Alb content in the AlCl 3 hydrolysis precipitates could not used as testimony that most of the Al 3 + Was converted to highly charged Al- 13 species during AlCl 3 coagulation.
