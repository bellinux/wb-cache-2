40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{described}} that <b>hospitalizations</b> for atrial fibrillation (AF) {{are continuing to}} increase. Given that <b>hospitalizations</b> are {{responsible for most of}} the economic burden associated with AF, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the impact of age and how changing procedural practices may be contributing to the increasing rates of AF <b>hospitalizations.</b> The annual age- and gender-specific incidence of <b>hospitalizations</b> for AF, electrical cardioversions, electrophysiologic studies, and radiofrequency ablation procedures in Australia were determined from 1993 to 2007 inclusive. Over this 15 -year follow-up period spanning almost 300 million person-years, a total of 473, 501 <b>hospitalizations</b> for AF were identified. There was a relative increase in AF <b>hospitalizations</b> of 203 % over the study period, in contrast to an increase for all <b>hospitalizations</b> of only 71 %. Whereas the gender-specific incidence of <b>hospitalizations</b> remained stable, the age-specific incidence increased significantly over the study period, particularly in older age groups. AF <b>hospitalizations</b> associated with electrical cardioversions decreased from 27 % to 14 % over the study period. Electrophysiologic studies and radiofrequency ablation procedures contributed minimally to the overall increase in AF <b>hospitalizations</b> observed. In conclusion, in addition to the growing prevalence of AF because of the aging population, there is an increasing age-specific incidence of <b>hospitalizations</b> for AF, particularly in older age groups. In contrast, changing procedural trends have contributed minimally to the increasing number of AF-associated <b>hospitalizations.</b> Greater attention to older patients with AF is required to develop strategies to prevent <b>hospitalizations</b> and contain the growing burden on health care systems.

40|$|Context: Respiratory viral {{infections are}} {{responsible}} for {{a large number of}} <b>hospitalizations</b> in the United States each year. Objective: To estimate annual influenza-associated <b>hospitalizations</b> in the United States by hospital discharge category, discharge type, and age group. Design, Setting, and Participants: National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) data and World Health Organization Collaborating Laboratories influenza surveillance data were used to estimate annual average numbers of <b>hospitalizations</b> associated with the circulation of influenza viruses from the 1979 - 1980 through the 2000 - 2001 seasons in the United States using age-specific Poisson regression models. Main Outcome Measures: We estimated influenza-associated <b>hospitalizations</b> for primary and any listed pneumonia and influenza and respiratory and circulatory <b>hospitalizations.</b> Results: Annual averages of 94735 (range, 18908 - 193561) primary and 133900 (range, 30 757 - 271 529) any listed pneumonia and influenza <b>hospitalizations</b> were associated with influenza virus infections. Annual averages of 226054 (range, 54523 - 430960) primary and 294128 (range, 86494 - 544909) any listed respiratory and circulatory <b>hospitalizations</b> were associated with influenza virus infections. Persons 85 years or older had the highest rates of influenza-associated primary respiratory and circulatory <b>hospitalizations</b> (1194. 9 per 100 000 persons). Children younger than 5 years (107. 9 primary respiratory and circulatory <b>hospitalizations</b> per 100 000 persons) had rates similar to persons aged 50 through 64 years. Estimated rates of influenza-associated <b>hospitalizations</b> were highest during seasons in which A(H 3 N 2) viruses predominated, followed by B and A(H 1 N 1) seasons. After adjusting for the length of each influenza season, influenza-associated primary pneumonia and influenza <b>hospitalizations</b> increased over time among the elderly. There were no significant increases in influenza-associated primary respiratory and circulatory <b>hospitalizations</b> after adjusting for the length of the influenza season. Conclusions: Significant numbers of influenza-associated <b>hospitalizations</b> in the United States occur among the elderly, and the numbers of these <b>hospitalizations</b> have increased substantially over the last 2 decades {{due in part to the}} aging of the population. Children younger than 5 years had rates of influenza-associated <b>hospitalizations</b> similar to those among individuals aged 50 through 64 years. These findings highlight the need for improved influenza prevention efforts for both young and older US residents. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The exception to this was mental health <b>hospitalizations,</b> which saw a lower percentage increase of 1.2%, and was projected to increase only 0.9% through 2013. Despite the rising aggregate costs and costs per discharge, <b>hospitalizations</b> (except for mental health <b>hospitalizations)</b> for children aged 0-17 decreased over the same time, and were projected to continue decreasing.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Identify and {{evaluate}} the rate of <b>hospitalizations</b> for heart failure in the Public Health System in Brazil of patients over 30 years of age between July 2014 and July 2016. Methods: Observational study with a cross-sectional design and a quantitative approach. The study evaluates the prevalence of <b>hospitalizations</b> of patients over 30 years of age hospitalized for heart failure from July 2014 to July 2016. It has a national coverage, {{taking into account the}} data provided by DATASUS. Results: Among <b>hospitalizations</b> for diseases of the circulatory system, heart failure accounted for 19 % of all <b>hospitalizations.</b> The periods of greatest number of <b>hospitalizations</b> were July and August of 2014 and July and August of 2015. The age group with the highest prevalence of <b>hospitalizations</b> was 70 - 79 years old, responsible for 27 % of the cases, followed by the age group of 60 - 69 years Responsible for 25 % of all <b>hospitalizations.</b> Males accounted for the largest number of <b>hospitalizations,</b> accounting for 51 % of the total. Conclusion: Heart failure demands a series of restrictions and special care by the patient.

40|$|Background. Rotavirus causes {{approximately}} one-third to one-half (55, 000 – 70, 000 <b>hospitalizations</b> per year) of <b>hospitalizations</b> for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among US children! 5 {{years of}} age. We forecasted the potential {{reduction in the}} number of <b>hospitalizations</b> for rotavirus disease and AGE in US children during 2006 – 2015 as a result of the new rotavirus vaccine introduced in 2006. Methods. The mean number of <b>hospitalizations</b> for AGE by calendar month among US children was determined using the National Hospital Discharge Survey from the period 1993 – 2005. From these baseline prevaccine estimates, we forecasted the effect of vaccine in reducing the number of <b>hospitalizations</b> for rotavirus disease and AGE during 2006 – 2015 with use of estimates of vaccine effectiveness and uptake. Results. During 2006 – 2015, ∼ 313, 000 (45 %) of an estimated 703, 190 <b>hospitalizations</b> for rotavirus disease would be directly prevented by vaccination. A significant {{reduction in the number}} of <b>hospitalizations</b> for AGE should be detectable among infants aged 0 – 11 months during the first quarter of 2009, followed by children aged 12 – 23 months during 2010, and all children! 5 years of age during 2011. Conclusions. Vaccination is expected to substantially reduce the health burden of <b>hospitalizations</b> for rotavirus disease among US children during 2006 – 2015, and the impact of vaccination based on direct protective effects alone was expected to first occur for <b>hospitalizations</b> for AGE among infants during winter 2009...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite {{advances}} in pharmacologic therapy and devices, patients with heart failure (HF) {{continue to have}} significant rehospitalization rates and risk prediction remains challenging. We sought to explore {{the value of a}} multi-biomarker panel (including NT-proBNP, hs-TnT, and ST 2) on top of clinical assessment for long-term prediction of recurrent <b>hospitalizations</b> in HF. Methods and Results: NT-proBNP, hs-TnT, and ST 2 levels were measured in 891 consecutive ambulatory HF patients. The independent association between the multi-biomarker panel and recurrent <b>hospitalizations</b> was assessed through a multivariable negative binomial regression and expressed as incidence rates ratios. McFadden pseudoR 2 and goodness-of-fit measures were also used. The total number of unplanned <b>hospitalizations</b> (all-cause, cardiovascular CV-, and HF-related) were selected as the primary endpoints. At a mean follow-up of 4. 2 ± 2. 1 years, 1623 all-cause <b>hospitalizations</b> in 498 patients (55. 9 %), 710 CV-related <b>hospitalizations</b> in 331 patients (37. 2 %), and 444 HF-related <b>hospitalizations</b> in 214 patients (24. 1 %) were registered. The crude incidence of all-cause, CV-, and HF-related recurrent <b>hospitalizations</b> was significantly higher for patients with the multi-biomarker panel above the cut-point (hs-TnT> 14 ng/L, NT-proBNP> 1000 ng/L, and ST 2 > 35 ng/mL) (all P< 0. 001). For all-cause, CV-, and HF-related recurrent <b>hospitalizations,</b> the McFadden R 2, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion supported the superiority of incorporating the multi-biomarker panel into a clinical predictive model.

This has considerable financial cost, along with social cost. A study to identify the role of this exposure in relation to hospital admissions due to pneumonia among children up to 10 years of age was conducted. DESIGN AND SETTING: Ecological time series study using data from São José dos Campos, Brazil. METHODS: Daily data on <b>hospitalizations</b> due to pneumonia and on the pollutants CO, O 3, PM 10 and SO 2, temperature and humidity in São José dos Campos, in 2012, were analyzed. A generalized additive model of Poisson's regression was used. Relative risks for <b>hospitalizations</b> due to pneumonia, according to lags of 0 - 5 days, were estimated. The population-attributable fraction, number of avoidable <b>hospitalizations</b> and cost savings from avoidable <b>hospitalizations</b> were calculated. RESULTS: There were 539 admissions. Exposure to CO and O 3 was seen to be associated with <b>hospitalizations,</b> with risks of 1. 10 and 1. 15 on the third day after exposure to increased CO concentration of 200 ppb and ozone concentration of 20 µg/m 3.
