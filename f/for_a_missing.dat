5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E

This is, however, a coincidence, as one of the marks stems from a small r-like mark and the other from an a-like one. In later texts, it became a diaeresis (two dots), or a broken line.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, Sam Amirante, one of Gacy's two defense {{attorneys}} at his 1980 trial, authored procedures that were incorporated by the Illinois General Assembly into the Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984. Amirante has since {{stated that the}} primary inspiration for this legislation {{was the fact that}} at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> child. The Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency—commonly known today as an Amber Alert.|$|E

Tensing fired after DuBose started his car. Tensing stated that DuBose {{had begun to}} drive off {{and that he was}} being dragged because his arm was caught in the car. Prosecutors alleged that footage from Tensing's bodycam showed that he was not dragged and a grand jury indicted him on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter. He was then fired from the police department. He was released on bond before trial. A November 2016 trial ended in mistrial after the jury became deadlocked. A retrial begun in May 2017 also ended in a hung jury. The charges against Tensing were later dismissed with prejudice.|$|E
25|$|Martin Sinfield (2132) was {{appointed}} deputy chief judge by Francisco in 2131, in which capacity he assigned Judge Dredd {{to supervise the}} mutant townships being built in the Cursed Earth, and attempted to control Francisco (largely unsuccessfully). Sinfield became acting chief judge in 2132 when Francisco resigned, and immediately set about instituting even harsher new anti-mutant policies and causing great damage to the Justice Department. When Sinfield prematurely called off a search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> judge in the Cursed Earth, endangering his life, Dredd lodged a formal complaint against Sinfield with the Council of Five. When the Council dismissed Dredd's claim, Dredd decided to stand for election for chief judge himself. However the election was cancelled after Sinfield was arrested when evidence came to light that he had used illegal means to force Judge Francisco to resign. He was sentenced to 20 years hard labour on Titan.|$|E

In September it was announced that Irvine would move to the Jaguar team, which had purchased Stewart Grand Prix in June, and would be partnered by Johnny Herbert.

40|$|Background. The {{detection}} of a morbidly adherent placenta (MAP) {{in the first}} trimester is rare. Risk factors such as multiparity, advanced maternal age, prior cesarean delivery, prior myomectomy, placenta previa, or previous uterine evacuation place patients at <b>a</b> higher risk <b>for</b> having abnormal placental implantation. If these patients have <b>a</b> first trimester <b>missed</b> abortion and fail medical management, {{it is important that}} providers have <b>a</b> heightened suspicion <b>for</b> <b>a</b> MAP. Case. A 24 -year-old G 4 P 3003 with 3 prior cesarean deliveries underwent multiple rounds of failed medical management <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> abortion. She had a dilation and curettage that was complicated by a significant hemorrhage and ultimately required an urgent hysterectomy. Conclusion. When patients fail medical management <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> abortion, providers need to assess the patient’s risk factors <b>for</b> <b>a</b> MAP. If risk factors are present, a series of specific evaluations should be triggered to rule out a MAP and help further guide management. Early diagnosis of a MAP allows providers to coordinate a multidisciplinary treatment approach and thoroughly counsel patients. Ensuring adequate resources and personnel at a tertiary hospital is essential to provide the highest quality of care and improve outcomes...|$|R
