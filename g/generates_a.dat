5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> faster airflow moving over the wing. This <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The metal-rich {{white dwarf}} WD 1145+017 {{is the first}} white dwarf {{observed}} with a disintegrating minor planet which transits the star. The disintegration of the planetesimal <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> debris cloud which passes {{in front of the}} star every 4.5 hours, causing a 5-minute-long fade in the star's optical brightness. The depth of the transit is highly variable.|$|E

5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Because of its rarity, it {{is among}} the most {{expensive}} elements. Price for pure scandium fluctuates between 4 000 and 20 000 US dollars per kilogram. Meanwhile, the limited market <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> variety of prices at any given time. In 2010, {{at the peak of the}} rare-earths shortage, the price of scandium rose to over 15,000 US dollars per kilogram, and the widely commercially used scandium oxide (Sc2O3) was selling above 7 000 US dollars per kilogram. Since then the limited demand coupled with steady production keeps the price at its 20-year average.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E
5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{recovering}} unknown aberrations in an optical system includes collecting intensity data {{produced by the}} optical system, <b>generating</b> <b>an</b> initial estimate of a phase of the optical system, iteratively performing a phase retrieval on the intensity data to <b>generate</b> <b>a</b> phase estimate using an initial diversity function corresponding to the intensity data, <b>generating</b> <b>a</b> phase map from the phase retrieval phase estimate, decomposing the phase map to <b>generate</b> <b>a</b> decomposition vector, <b>generating</b> <b>an</b> updated diversity function by combining the initial diversity function with the decomposition vector, <b>generating</b> <b>an</b> updated estimate of the phase of the optical system by removing the initial diversity function from the phase map. The method may further include repeating the process beginning with iteratively performing a phase retrieval on the intensity data using the updated estimate of the phase of the optical system {{in place of the}} initial estimate of the phase of the optical system, and using the updated diversity function in place of the initial diversity function, until a predetermined convergence is achieved...|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the classical Nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by Shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below. Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> pentadienyl cation, which undergoes a thermally allowed 4π conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the Woodward-Hoffman rules. This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β-hydrogen. Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product.|$|E

The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for {{a certain amount of}} time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time.
