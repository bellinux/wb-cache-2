5|$|Australias keel {{was laid}} at John Brown & Company's Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was {{assigned}} the yard number 402. The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, {{in a ceremony}} which received extensive media coverage. Australias design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the newly developed nickel-steel armour plate. While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had {{to be used in}} some sections: the delay <b>in</b> <b>sourcing</b> the older armour plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown & Company delivered the ship £295,000 under budget.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the early}} {{problems}} for the Unit was the difficulty <b>in</b> <b>sourcing</b> film stock. At the time, the only wildlife cameramen were amateurs, and the footage wasn't always good enough for broadcast. The embryo unit's first film camera, a clockwork Bolex, was bought from a Bristol camera shop with petty cash by Desmond's assistant, Tony Soper. Some of Scott's own expedition films were used for early episodes of Look. One particularly outstanding film from 1955, shot by Heinz Sielmann, showed woodpeckers inside a nest hole.|$|E

First it is aimed to finding out {{the types of}} theme in every clause <b>in</b> <b>source</b> text and target text. Second it is aimed to finding out employment of theme and rheme <b>in</b> <b>source</b> text and <b>in</b> target text. This research used descriptive qualitative analysis. The data {{of this study were}} analyzed by using three steps: analyzing every clause <b>in</b> <b>source</b> text and <b>in</b> target text, grouping the types of theme <b>in</b> <b>source</b> text and target text into table based on the data, and providing description and arguments of the result of data analysis. In this research, the researcher found that there were the differences about theme <b>in</b> <b>source</b> text and theme in target text. And the researcher also found that the number of dissimilar theme was less than the similar one, because this story was pointed and consumed by the children. The number of Ideational, Interpersonal and Textual themes <b>in</b> <b>source</b> text and target text is different because the translator emphasizes something that does not become the theme <b>in</b> <b>source</b> text.

25|$|Murphy sold some {{properties}} {{she owned}} in San Patricio County {{and used the}} funds to purchase space on the East Side of San Antonio {{to be used as}} a school for African Americans. The lot itself was purchased on October 14, 1887 for the price of $2,800. There was opposition from residents of the area, which was at the time white only. In addition, difficult laws demanding strict segregation of white and black people obstructed progress <b>in</b> <b>sourcing</b> supplies to build the school. San Antonio already had a reputation for aggressively opposing schools for black children. However, Murphy was determined to force San Antonians to pay attention to racial issues, which is why she chose the white neighborhood for the school.|$|E
25|$|It is {{her first}} voyage for the EIC, {{under the command of}} Captain William Wilson, that is of the {{greatest}} significance. Wilson sailed Pitt to China via a route between Java and New Guinea. The EIC had avoided sailing through the East Indies since the 1623 Amboyna massacre. The Dutch East India Company was hostile towards the EIC, fearing that the EIC would compete with them <b>in</b> <b>sourcing</b> pepper and spices. Throughout his voyage via the East Indies, Wilson kept extensive notes, made charts, and on them corrected the location of several islands and other geographical features. When he arrived in Canton, he had two sets of his charts prepared, one for the EIC governor at Madras and one that the EIC representatives at Canton could copy for their vessels.|$|E

These aircraft used 22 different engines, four different machine guns and two models of aircraft cannon. This made the training, supply and maintenance of the VVKJ quite problematic. The VVKJ was organised into a headquarters, four air brigades and one naval brigade. Its order of battle on 6 April 1941 is detailed below as provided by Shores, Cull and Malizia, the most detailed work available on the subject.|$|E

He came to London in 1856 {{and worked as a}} {{salesman}} for Peter Robinson, an Oxford Street draper, rising to be his silk buyer. In 1864, he turned down Robinson's offer of a partnership, and rented his own premises {{on the north side of}} Oxford Street, on part of the site now occupied by the department store which bears his name. There he sold silk and woollen cloth and haberdashery. His retailing philosophy was to buy good quality merchandise and sell it at a modest 'mark up'. Although he carried a wide range of merchandise, he didn’t bother much about displaying it, and never advertised. His skill lay <b>in</b> <b>sourcing</b> the goods he sold, and most mornings he would go to the City, accompanied by a man with a hand barrow. Later he would make trips to Paris to buy silks.|$|E
