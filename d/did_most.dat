5|$|James L. Quinn: November 1952– August 1958. From May 1953 to March 1954, Larry T. Shaw was Associate Editor; {{he wrote}} editorials {{for at least}} three issues, {{beginning}} with September 1953, and generally <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the editorial work.|$|E

5|$|Hitchcock <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the {{promotion}} on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins {{to make the}} usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of their revealing the plot. Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews, certainly preserved the secret.|$|E

5|$|The 1895 {{dispute between}} the United States and Britain over Venezuela was peacefully {{resolved}} through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. American secretary of state Richard Olney in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat Julian Pauncefote. President William McKinley supported the treaty, as <b>did</b> <b>most</b> opinion leaders, academics, and leading newspapers. The main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of its treatment of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{black workers}} <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the post-hurricane cleanup work, {{and the few}} caskets {{available}} for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites. Additionally, the white victims received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in downtown West Palm Beach, which was the only mass gravesite to receive a timely memorial.|$|E
5|$|Daman <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of its damages on Cikobia island, {{which has}} a {{population}} of around 120. Damage on Cikobia included extensive damages to houses, school buildings, crops, fruitbearing trees and foliage. Water pipes were damaged by fallen trees as a result of high winds from the storm. Despite initial fears of there being some fatalities on Cikobia, no loss of life was recorded due to the storm. This was because the islands 120 residents had evacuated to caves on Cikobia. The Fijian Dependency of Rotuma experienced a significant amount of rainfall from December 5 until December 7, when Cyclone Daman was located near Rotuma.|$|E

5|$|Ensemble Studios worked {{together}} with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires IIIs second expansion. This {{was the first}} joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and had control over the final product. Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.|$|E
5|$|Having {{sold his}} {{personal}} library to Academia Mihăileană, Kogălniceanu was in Paris and other Western European cities from 1845 to 1847, joining the Romanian student association (Societatea Studenților Români) that included Ghica, Bălcescu, and Rosetti and was {{presided over by}} the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine. He also frequented La Bibliothèque roumaine ("The Romanian Library"), while affiliating to the Freemasonry and joining the Lodge known as L'Athénée des étrangers ("Foreigners' Atheneum"), as <b>did</b> <b>most</b> other reform-minded Romanians in Paris. In 1846, he visited Spain, wishing to witness the wedding of Isabella II and the Duke of Cádiz, {{but he was also}} curious to assess developments in Spanish culture. Upon the end of his trip, he authored Notes sur l'Espagne ("Notes on Spain"), a French-language volume combining memoir, travel writing and historiographic record.|$|E
5|$|Howard went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy, {{where he}} went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball. Vocational had an {{unheated}} gym and no locker rooms, which required that the team dress for games in a history classroom. Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by Parade magazine and won McDonald's All American honors. He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational's homecoming king. During recruiting visits by college coaches such as Illinois' Lou Henson, DePaul's Joey Meyer and Michigan's Steve Fisher, Jannie Mae Howard <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the questioning.|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Scott {{traveled}} to Philadelphia to help clarify service records {{that would determine}} the final pay {{of the men who}} served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the First Party System, he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as <b>did</b> <b>most</b> Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a presidential elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace. Scott and his fellow electors all cast their votes for the ticket of Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} battles {{during the first}} two weeks of September, the South Korean troops, {{demoralized}} though they were, <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the ground fighting. American tanks, artillery, and ground units supported them. Uncontested UN aerial supremacy and naval gunfire from offshore also supported the South Korean troops, and probably were the factors that tipped the scales in their favor. After the initial phase of their September offensive, the North Koreans labored under what proved to be insurmountable difficulties in supplying their forward units. The North Korean system of supply could not resolve the problems of logistics and communication necessary to support and exploit an offensive operation in this sector of the front. Nevertheless, the breakthrough was severe enough that the Eighth Army considered pulling back for several days, eventually deciding to stand its ground.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson Davis {{served in}} many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful. As a politician, {{he served as}} a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, {{although}} he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of his peers in the South, and supported slavery. As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would have been a great challenge for any leader, Davis's performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.|$|E

5|$|Parker {{published}} in 1572 a work entitled De Antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae & Priuilegiis Ecclesiae Canuariensis, cum Archiepiscopis eiusdem 70, {{which is the}} first privately printed work to appear in English. Although Parker claimed in a letter that he was the author, it is likely that at the very least Joscelyn <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the research, and the manuscript of the work, which is now Vitellius E xiv, is largely in his handwriting. Further, Parker's son, after the archbishop's death, noted beside the bequest notation for Joscelyn's brother Thomas that John Joscelyn was the author of the work.|$|E
5|$|Ring <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of {{his work}} in the non-Test {{first-class}} matches, in which he sent down 3,088deliveries. This was second only to Johnston, who bowled 3,251. In contrast, Lindwall and Miller sent down only 2,105 and 1,749deliveries outside the Tests respectively, as Bradman sought to preserve them for hostile bursts with the new ball against England. Along with Lindwall, Ring was the equal third highest wicket-taker in first-class matches excluding the Tests, with 59 scalps, doing {{a large part of the}} work in the county matches so that the leading bowlers could conserve energy for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home. Before {{the invention of the}} steam laundry machine in the mid-19thcentury, women <b>did</b> <b>most</b> domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines. Steam-driven washing machines, and equipment for starching, ironing, and related tasks made industrial laundries feasible {{by the turn of the}} century.|$|E

5|$|The {{avalanche}} {{scenes were}} due to be filmed in co-operation with the Swiss army who annually used explosions to prevent snow build-up by causing avalanches, but the area chosen naturally avalanched just before filming. The final result {{was a combination of}} a man-made avalanche at an isolated Swiss location shot by the second unit, stock footage, and images created by the special effects crew with salt. The stuntmen were filmed later, added by optical effects. For the scene where Bond and Tracy crash into a car race while being pursued, an ice rink was constructed over an unused aeroplane track, with water and snow sprayed on it constantly. Lazenby and Rigg <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the driving due to the high number of close-ups.|$|E
5|$|The stunt {{crew was}} the same one used in Cruise's Mission: Impossible 2, and was {{responsible}} for complex action scenes. These included the auto factory chase scene, filmed in a real facility using props such as a welding robot, and the fight between Anderton and the jetpack-clad officers, filmed in an alley set built on the Warner Bros. studio lot. Industrial Light & Magic <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the special effects, and DreamWorks-owned PDI {{was responsible for the}} Spyder robots. The company Pixel Liberation Front did previsualization animatics. The holographic projections and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors, and the scene where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the Maglev vehicles was filmed on stationary props, which were later replaced by computer-generated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|When Frank Sels {{left the}} Studio in 1967, Karel Biddeloo took {{over most of}} the {{realistic}} series of Vandersteen. He made Karl May from 1967 until 1969, when the Bessy-studio took over the job. He also took over Biggles, which ended in 1969, when it was replaced by the jungle series Safari, inspired by Daktari. At the start of the series, Vandersteen <b>did</b> <b>most</b> of the creative work, but after a few albums he left most of the work to Biddeloo. The series ended in 1974. Biddeloo then devoted most of his time to De Rode Ridder, where he started inking the stories by Vandersteen in 1967 and took completely over in 1969, when Vandersteen lost his interest. He continued working on it until his death in 2004.|$|E
