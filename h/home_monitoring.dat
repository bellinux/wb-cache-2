Elgato said the product won't be available until the HomeKit software, {{which is expected}} to come with Apple iOS 8, is released. It also introduced smart light bulbs, which communicate with iOS devices through Bluetooth and allow users to adjust home lighting from their mobile device.|$|E

In 2014, it {{introduced a}} <b>home</b> <b>monitoring</b> system called Eve, which provides alerts to users regarding things like air pressure, temperature and water use. Elgato also developed light bulbs that can respond to programming on a mobile device and respond to commands over Bluetooth and it produces two Thunderbolt products: a dock for MacBooks and an external hard drive.|$|E
500|$|Patients {{are making}} {{increasing}} use of self-testing and <b>home</b> <b>monitoring</b> of oral anticoagulation. International guidelines on home testing were published in 2005. The guidelines stated: [...] "The consensus agrees that patient self-testing and patient self-management are effective methods of monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy, providing outcomes at least as good as, and possibly better than, those achieved with an anticoagulation clinic. All patients must be appropriately selected and trained. Currently available self-testing/self-management devices give INR results that are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing." [...] A 2006 systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials showed home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications (thrombosis and major bleeding) and improved {{the time in the}} therapeutic range.|$|E
40|$|Polysomnographic {{findings}} {{were compared with}} data obtained subsequently from <b>home</b> documented <b>monitoring</b> in order to study the diagnostic value of both techniques. Polysomnography was performed in 1274 infants born prematurely and in 422 patients admitted because of apparent life threatening events (ALTEs). In 72 of the infants, <b>home</b> documented <b>monitoring</b> of the cardiorespiratory pattern, including QRS complexes, was performed. Subsequent documented episodes of heart rate < 50 beats/min were considered as "serious life threatening events". It was confirmed that polysomnographic findings correlated well with subsequent events as registered by <b>home</b> documented <b>monitoring.</b> Especially in the ALTE group where both infants with and without abnormal polysomnography were <b>home</b> <b>monitored,</b> the single polysomnography significantly predicted subsequent life threatening events. <b>Home</b> documented <b>monitoring</b> of the cardiorespiratory pattern has a distinctive advantage over simple cardiorespiratory monitoring {{as a means to}} identify and document life threatening events, in addition to its value as a rescue device. ...|$|R
40|$|Out {{of office}} blood {{pressure}} measurements, using either <b>home</b> <b>monitors</b> or 24 hour ambulatory monitoring, is widely recommended for management of hypertension. Though validation protocols, {{meant to be}} used by manufacturers, exist for blood pressure monitors, there is scant data in the literature about the accuracy of <b>home</b> blood pressure <b>monitors</b> in actual clinical practice. We performed a chart review in the blood pressure assessment clinic at a tertiary care centre. We assessed the accuracy of <b>home</b> blood pressure <b>monitors</b> used by patients seen in the nephrology clinic in Ottawa between the years 2011 to 2014. We recorded patient demographics and clinical data, including the blood pressure measurements, arm circumference and the manufacturer of the <b>home</b> blood pressure <b>monitor.</b> The average of BP measurements performed with the <b>home</b> blood pressure <b>monitor,</b> were compared to those with the mercury sphygmomanometer. We defined accuracy based on a difference of 5 mm Hg in the blood pressure values between the <b>home</b> <b>monitor</b> and mercury sphygmomanometer readings. The two methods were compared using a Bland-Altman plot and a student's t-test. The study included 210 patients. The mean age of the study population was 67 years and 61 % was men. The average mid-arm circumference was 32. 2 cms. 30 % and 32 % of the <b>home</b> BP <b>monitors</b> reported a mean systolic and diastolic BP values, respectively, different from the mercury measurements by 5 mm Hg or more. There {{was no significant difference between}} the monitors that were accurate versus those that were not when grouped according to the patient characteristics, cuff size or the brand of the <b>home</b> <b>monitor.</b> An important proportion of <b>home</b> blood pressure <b>monitors</b> used by patients seen in our nephrology clinic were inaccurate. A re-validation of the accuracy and safety of the devices already in use is prudent before relying on these measurements for clinical decisions...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Untreated sleep {{disorders}} can increase driver crash risk {{by up to}} 7 fold, and truck drivers {{have a variety of}} risk factors for {{sleep disorders}}. Measures currently used to identify drivers at risk depend predominantly on the ability of the driver to identify and report themselves as sleepy. Methods: This case report presents a 54 year old long distance truck driver who participated in a case-control study, underwent at <b>home</b> breathing <b>monitoring</b> and was followed up with an in-depth interview. Results: Self-reported measures did not identify this driver as at risk of sleepiness or sleep apnea; yet he was subsequently diagnosed with severe sleep apnea using an at <b>home</b> <b>monitor</b> and polysomnography. Conclusions: Self-assessment of risk factors is insufficient as a screen for sleep apnea. General practitioners are in an ideal position to identify potential sleep apnea sufferers and can initiate the enquiry process that leads to diagnostic testing. 5 page(s...|$|R

A critique of these studies, using the eight components of the STIN framework, illustrated very clearly the different assumptions made about the purpose of <b>home</b> uterine <b>monitoring,</b> and helped to explain the different outcomes. The final mapping stage suggested that systems architecture choices included that of the role of monitoring support, to complement patient education or to enhance education for provider and patient.
