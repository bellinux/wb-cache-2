He had initially recruited 9th Wonder for the album. He even appeared on 9th's documentary The Wonder Year and expressed his desire to make a number one hit with him, however, in an interview about a month prior to the slated release date, 9th said that he was not on the album. 9th states that {{was a part of the}} reason, because he was going through an A and playing beats for them as opposed to the artist himself, which he is opposed to. Drake had also been planning on having Q-Tip, DJ Premier, and The Neptunes as producers on the album, but those projects fell through as well. Several artists were confirmed as collaborators with Drake on Take Care consist of Stevie Wonder, Kendrick Lamar, Chantal Kreviazuk, André 3000, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna. He had initially reached out to Phonte of the former group Little Brother (who is a major influence on his career). The track was made for Take Care, but did not make it for the album, due to an issue he had with the producer. Drake admits in an interview to [...] "dropping the ball" [...] on the project and is optimistic about a future collaboration with Phonte.

We argue that creative planning processes are grounded in practical considerations of sociocultural activity, in a wedding of imagination and pragmatics. Original, workable ideas evolve from a process that is the synthesis of spontaneous improvisation and organized, directed activity, as individuals participate with others in sociocultural activities. We examine how a collaborative interactional system develops in the process of planning, and how this social organization is essential to the planning process, as a group of young children plan a play.

Prima facie, an autonomy arrangement has the potential to address many of the grievances of the Malay-Muslim community in the Patani region. There are also now some positive Southeast Asian examples of autonomy solutions made under similar circumstances, particularly Aceh and Mindanao.

5000|$|Motion City Soundtrack {{frontman}} Justin Pierre penned {{the song}} as {{a summary of}} his OCD (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) tendencies. He intended to utilize his social anxiety and fears in the song's form, which he has since employed in numerous other compositions. [...] "I don’t think the phrase [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] is correct, but it’s something where the verses are one thing and then the chorus is another, but it's sort of like giving yourself a pep talk," [...] said Pierre. The song's lyrics include hating such mundane things as [...] "theme parks, flying, strangers, and waiting in line," [...] things that Pierre genuinely disliked {{at the time of}} the song's writing. Incorporating his deepest feelings into the song was inspired by advice given by a screenwriting professor during his tenure at the Minneapolis Community Technical College in the mid-1990s. He instructed the students, who were [...] "trying to make Pulp Fiction II or Goodfellas II," [...] to simply write what they know; Pierre took the advice literally and began writing autobiographical screenplays that feature protagonists with asthma, unable to talk to women. You kind of have to look at yourself in the mirror and repeat the words to yourself until one day, eventually, you're okay. Justin Pierre The song was one of the last written for Commit This to Memory, when the band arrived in Los Angeles in the winter of 2004-05. The song was recorded largely at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a suburban home converted into a studio in the city's Valley Village region. Pierre's most prominent memory of recording the song, told to Alternative Press writer Jason Pettigrew in 2013, was a moment in which he attempted to impress a friend. He returned the studio at one in the morning with the friend, where the band was still recording. The members were in the process of crafting the song's intro, which features [...] "far away sounding" [...] drums and guitar, and half of the song's chorus. [...] "I said, 'Let's just <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Play it and I’ll sing it in the middle of the room with the mic in the back room picking me up,'" [...] recalled Pierre. [...] "We did it in one take and I was really proud. I just know that I liked how [...] "in-the-moment" [...] that was and how scary it was. I knew that if I didn't nail it I would look like an idiot, but I came in real cocky. I think my friend was impressed a little bit." ...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{reality in}} 2002 facing {{those of us}} who want to take {{legislative}} initiatives to protect unborn children from abortion is that the Supreme Court has left us little space in which to act. In a line of decisions that reached full definition in Webster and Casey and consistent application through Stenberg, the Court has painted in big red letters that states, and by implication Congress, cannot pass laws that prevent an adult woman from having her pre-viable unborn child aborted. Once her child reaches the point of viability, the situation changes dramatically. States can then adopt laws that directly protect the child from abortion. We may not like this division of a child’s life into protectible and non-protectible zones, but there is nothing we can <b>do</b> about <b>it</b> legislatively <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> If we do not keep that fact at the center of our attention, we will burn up our available energy, time and talent for nothing, because each time the Supreme Court will throw our work into the shredder. Of course, we all hope that the Supreme Court will get new pro-life members and that a new majority will re-extend the zone of protectibility to all of a child’s life. But that Court majority does not yet exist, and it may not exist for some time, after which other years may pass before it fully corrects the errors of 1973. So, we should look now at what the Court has given us to work with and use it to extend legal protection to those we can protect. While we are waiting for the new pro-life majority on the Court, we should use the time to fill up the space the present Court has given us to work with. This means two things. First, before viability we continue to push women’s right to know laws, public funding cutoffs, and the like. Second, and thi...|$|R
40|$|Income {{inequality}} in China is severe; {{measured by the}} Gini-coefficient it amounted to 0. 46 in 2011; wealth distribution is even worse with 0. 61. These disparities led to {{a major shift in}} emphasis of politics in general and of the Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development by the National People´s Congress in particular. While previously the strategy of the Five-Year Plans had been “Making the nation [our emphasis] rich as top priority”, this was changed to “Making people [our emphasis] rich as top priority” in the 12 th Five-Year Plan (2011 - 2015), enacted in March 2011. The strategic change from “nation” to “people” indicates that the political decision-makers in China accepted the aim of a fair income distribution as a political issue of great importance. In this paper, richness is defined in the political-philosophical tradition as the right measure for one’s own needs and wants; only its environmental aspect is focused on in this study. The development of the Chinese environmental conditions is compared with the German ones and the former’s future outlook is judged optimistically because of the achievements in the last five years. However, the complexity and fragility of the environmental system will within a decade confront Chinese politicians with the same problems as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> in Germany. In order to provide a solution addressing this development, this paper analyzes what Karl Marx had to say on the long-run dynamics of the economic system. He saw poverty as a necessary yet unintended consequence of the capitalistic system and used this insight as a “precision tool for the study of social change” (Elster 1986), which can also be employed to examine the unintended repercussions of economic activity on nature. Marx, who studied environmental and resource issues in detail, thought that the inventiveness of the capitalistic system would finally overcome all of them in the course of time. In {{view of the fact that}} three billion people on earth still have a backlog demand to satisfy basic needs and in addition a further three billion are expected to be born until 2050, the future of the natural environmental conditions looks somber. If it is not possible to decouple economic growth from ensuing environmental strain, Marx may well be right after all in his prediction that the capitalistic system will collapse, although in quite a different manner than he thought. This being the case we take recourse to the thoughts of one of the influential intellectual German figures, to Romano Guardini. He foresaw changes in the self-perception of humankind and in the comprehension of nature. These imply a shift in the ethos of government as well, which would in turn pose three great challenges to politics: (i) understanding nature in a new light, (ii) listening to what drives human hearts, and (iii) governing according to law...|$|R
