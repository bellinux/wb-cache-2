40|$|The flatheads, toadfishes, and {{goosefishes}} {{discussed here}} hold certain features in common. All are bottom-living forms with depressed <b>head</b> <b>areas</b> and broad gapes, and all eat large food items: fishes and/or crabs. All have developed structural specializations {{in association with}} this diet. The three groups are at most distantly related, and their feeding specializations are different and have evolved from different bases. In flatheads the combination of large food items and depressed head regions seems to {{have led to the}} separation of the two halves of the pelvic girdle, a feature in which they differ from their scorpaenoid relatives. Toadfish peculiarities associated with feeding are various but most notable in those that pass crabs they eat through the gape and into the mouth. Goosefish feeding is centered around the use of a lure to attract prey to within striking distance. The three fish groups are discussed separately, but their feeding structures are compared to one another in the final section of the paper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyses}} regional Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Thailand. Its determinants {{are identified}} using a unique assembled panel dataset comprising all 76 Thai provinces {{during the period}} 1985 – 2005. The work is premised on the view that foreign investors consider various determinants of location choices in each province (including labour costs, Gross Provincial Products (GPP) per <b>head,</b> <b>areas</b> of industrial estates, communication and transportation issues, population characteristics, educational attainment, population density and distance from the centre of town to the main ports of Thailand) as well as government incentives, before deciding to undertake FDI in a given region. Our econometric model estimates suggest that government regional policy, {{and the effect of}} zoning in particular, however, has a significant and positive effect on regional FDI, drawing FDI to those zones where the greatest incentives are on offer. The other possible determinants of FDI amongst regions are largely shown to be insignificant. Multinational Firms, Asia, Regional Economic Development, F 23, O 53, R 11,...|$|E

40|$|Diets for tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, were {{supplemented}} with astaxanthin, paprika, or capsicum {{to determine their}} effects on growth performance and pigmentation. Seven isonitrogenous (37 % crude protein) and isoenergetic (18 kJ/g) diets were formulated to contain 40 or 60 mg carotenoid per kg diet. Triplicate groups of 210 fish were stocked in 21 -l plastic boxes and fed {{one of the three}} experimental diets or the control diet for 45 days. Significantly better final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, and food conversion ratio were obtained with the diets containing 40 or 60 mg/kg paprika than with control diet (p< 0. 05). In general, the carotenoid-supplemented diets significantly increased the values of redness (a*), yellowness (b*), and chroma (C*), and decreased the values of lightness (L*) and hue (Hoab) on the tail, body, and <b>head</b> <b>areas</b> (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Quantitative {{sampling}} of fish {{was performed in}} five headwater riffles of the Illinois River System, Washington County, Arkansas during low flow conditions. This study revealed differing fish species composition, biomass and feeding guild segregation between head and tail riffle reaches in 1 st through 3 rd order. Thirty species representing 10 families were identified. Of this number, darters (Percidae), sculpins (Cottidae), madtoms (Ictaluridae), and central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) (Cyprinidae) comprised 67 to 98 percent of riffle head populations. Fish biomass was greater for riffle <b>head</b> <b>areas</b> (0. 58 - 6. 6 / 0. 28 - 2. 0 g/m 2) within sectivores and herbivores dominating. Total fish numbers decreased from riffleheads to tails, while number of species increased. Dominant fish groups in tail areas were minnows (Cyprinidae), darters (Percidae), and sunfishes (Centrarchidae). Feeding guild fish groups in tail areas were predominately insectivore and insectivore-piscivore. Stomach analysis of Cottus carolinae, the dominant headwater riffle predator, indicated selective feeding of macrobenthic invertebrates and fish based on size class. Abundance of herbivore and insectivore fishes in riffles, particularly head reaches, suggests a correlation with positive rheotaxic behavior, microhabitat preference or abundance of macrobenthic invertebrate populations...|$|E
