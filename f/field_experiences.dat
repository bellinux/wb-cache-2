5|$|The {{concept of}} {{electric}} potential is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric <b>field</b> <b>experiences</b> a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E

A charged particle moving through a magnetic <b>field</b> <b>experiences</b> a force perpendicular to the direction of travel, resulting in centripetal acceleration, thereby confining it to move in a circle or helix around the lines of magnetic flux.|$|E

The paradigm is suggested {{as a model for}} <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> participants and their supervisors.

The application of the paradigm may vary for different situations. Practical implications – The paradigm is expected to be useful for supervisors and students of <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> programs. Originality/value – This paradigm stems from the participation of the authors as a <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> supervisor and student.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated volumes on shanties {{produced}} in the 20th century is Stan Hugill's Shanties from the Seven Seas (1961). It is the largest of its kind, owing to Hugill's methodology and chronological position. With respect to methodology, Hugill aimed to be as inclusive as possible—to account for and to present, if sometimes only in fragments, any and all items of shanty repertoire that he was currently able to find. Any song that he had heard or read being attested as having been ever [...] "used as shanty" [...] was included—regardless of whether that song was not generally known as a shanty or if its use as a shanty was rare and incidental. The result is a varied portrait of the genre, highlighting its maximum diversity without, however, giving a focused sense of what songs were most common during the heyday of shanties or in latter eras. Hugill readily included more recently popular songs—those that evidently were not sung until after the shanty genre was experiencing decline, but which were extant when Hugill sailed (1920s–40s). He also culled from the major collections of non-English-language sailor work songs. Hugill's practice of liberally culling from all major prior works, in combination with original material from his own <b>field</b> <b>experiences,</b> makes it a handy sourcebook for performers, but a difficult work to assess in terms of historical accuracy.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the impact of a <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> in problem-based (PBL) and {{project-based}} learning (PjBL) on pre-service and in-service teachers’ conceptions of experiential learning. In our study, participants had been enrolled in a hybrid class that included an online component in which they learned about PBL and PjBL and an experiential component in which they facilitated PBL and PjBL with children in grades 1 - 9 during a one-week <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> on a university campus. The goal of the <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> is for teachers to change their practice from didactic to inquiry and to promote critical and creative thinking in their students. We used a case study method that involved data derived from six different sources: online structured interviews, follow-up telephone interviews, discussion board posts, reflections, course feedback, and observations. The main theme that emerged from the data analysis was the critical role the <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> played in applying theory to practice. Sub-themes included understanding the process of implementing PBL and PjBL, mastering the logistics of PBL and PjBL, becoming facilitators, and collaborating with partners.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{researchers}} reported that effective ICT integration requires teachers to acquire knowledge of technology, content, pedagogy and {{the intersection of}} these, known as TPACK (Mishra & Koehler, 2006; Archambault, & Crippen, 2009). This study specifically sought to answer: 1) What are pre-service teachers’ perceptions of their TPACK mastery level before and after field experience; and, 2) Is there a significant difference of TPACK after <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> in schools? The TPACK survey instrument was adapted from Schmidt et al. (2009) and Archambault and Crippen (2009) and administered before and after their <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> to 107 pre-service teachers in a research intensive university programme in New Zealand. In addition, three student teachers were interviewed before and after <b>field</b> <b>experience.</b> These pre-service teachers scored highest in Content Knowledge (CK) and lowest in Technology Knowledge (TK) domains within TPACK at {{both before and after}} <b>field</b> <b>experience.</b> Paired-sample t-tests showed significant increases in most TPACK domains, namely, TK, PK, PCK, TCK and TPACK. Interviews and observations of three students clarified complex changes in knowledge of TPACK that linked to their experience in schools. The study continues to support the need for <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> while also adding caution to the interpretation of TPACK survey evidence given the strength of the student teachers’ perceived knowledge before <b>field</b> <b>experience.</b> Further research is underway with a comparative survey in a programme that prepares teachers for secondary schools in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A basic {{condition}} for teachers developing their personal theory about teaching and utilising their knowledge {{in practice and}} perceiving and managing {{the complexity of the}} teaching process, is their ability to analyse the teaching process and to reflect on it. The research data presented in this article comes from research carried out, during which the role of <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> in teachers training was examined, and in particular to what extent and under what conditions <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> contributes to developing the ability of teachers to analyse and evaluate the teaching process. To answer those questions, information was primarily obtained from reflection reports prepared by trainee teachers (N= 68) after they had completed their <b>field</b> <b>experience.</b> One initial conclusion arising from the research is that trainee teachers find it difficult during their <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> to reflect on their teaching and when they do so, their reflection focuses on very specific topics, and is primarily technocratic in nature.
