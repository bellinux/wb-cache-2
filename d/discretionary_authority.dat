25|$|On 15 March 1943, the Prime Minister {{disclosed}} {{in the floor}} of the Assembly that on several occasions, under the guise of <b>discretionary</b> <b>authority,</b> the governor disregarded the advice tendered by the ministry and listed those occasions. The governor did not take those allegations kindly, and, largely due to his initiative, no-confidence motions were voted in the assembly on March 24 and March 27. On both occasions the motions were defeated, although by narrow margins. To enforce his writ, the governor asked Huq to sign a prepared letter of resignation on 28 March 1943 and assigned himself the responsibility of administering the province under the provision of Section 93 of the constitution. A month later a League dominated ministry was commissioned with Nazimuddin as the Prime Minister. Huq’s party won much fewer seats during the Indian provincial elections, 1946.|$|E

In a closed-door meeting with Assembly delegates attending the 1956 Democratic National Convention, Stanley again insisted on the authority to withhold state funds from any school district which integrated. But Delegate Delamater Davis of Norfolk (the state's largest city) said his city would likely operate its schools without state funds if ordered to integrate. By mid-August, 18 local school districts had placed their budgets on a month-to-month basis so they could close schools on short notice if ordered to desegregate. But wealthy districts such as Arlington and Norfolk {{let it be known that}} they would defy state control and integrate. Outside of the Southside, there seemed little support for Stanley's plan.

However, {{it is hard for}} an agency as an expert to have monopolistic status in any policy area, due to the growth of interest groups. Delegation in recent decades depends not only on its expertise, but also on the other bureaucratic capability to affect the behaviors of the outside experts. Even the most expert agencies cannot maintain their <b>discretionary</b> <b>authorities</b> without sufficient political capacities to affect the behaviors of interest groups. In particular, "brokerage capacity" that allows agencies to link interest groups and to resolve their interest conflicts, has become important in bureaucratic discretion.

2500|$|President Eisenhower's staff quickly {{selected}} Farmer as Herzog's replacement. Publicly, Farmer {{was portrayed}} as a political independent. He had few personal associations with management and his professional contacts were perceived as legal and contractual rather than ideological. But privately, Farmer was well known as a strong conservative, an avid proponent of states' rights, and an early and avid political backer of Eisenhower. By June 21, Farmer {{was reported to be}} Eisenhower's only choice as Herzog's replacement. However, Eisenhower also informed his cabinet that all agency appointments should be cleared with the Republican National Committee (RNC), which was known to be much more conservative on labor issues than the administration. The RNC {{went so far as to}} advocate that all Roosevelt and Truman administration appointees to the NLRB be fired, no matter how competent. Farmer's views of federal labor law were strongly conservative. Farmer thought the federal role in labor relations should be delegated to the states. [...] "...I favor as much decentralization as possible; and as much as possible should be done with the board's <b>discretionary</b> <b>authority,</b> which has some limits on it now, to cede to the states by agreement." [...] Farmer advocated wholesale re-examination of the major decision of the Herzog board, especially in those areas restricting employer freedom of speech, permitting bargaining during the contract, and giving unions preferential treatment in captive audience meetings. [...] Farmer was also a vigorous anti-communist, which further heightened his appeal as chairman. He believed that communists had infiltrated not only American labor unions but the staff of the NLRB itself (some at the highest levels of the Board), and that it was his duty to purge the NLRB of these individuals.|$|E

60|$|It is {{no part of}} {{the present}} essay to attempt to detail the {{particulars}} of a code of social legislation. That must depend in every case upon the particular circumstances of the community concerned. But some indication may be given here of the kind of legislation that may serve to render the conditions of industry more in conformity with social justice. Let us take, as a conspicuous example, the case of the Minimum wage law. Here is a thing sternly condemned in the older thought as an economic impossibility. It was claimed, as we have seen, that under free contract a man was paid what he earned and no law could make it more. But the older theory was wrong. The minimum wage law ought to form, in one fashion or another, a part of the code of every community. It may be applied by specific legislation from a central power, or it may be applied by the <b>discretionary</b> <b>authority</b> of district boards, or it may be regulated,--as it has been in some of the beginnings already made,--within the compass of each industry or trade.

GAO also found that multiple factors, such as data limitations and lack of transparency, impeded agencies' reviews. GAO made 7 recommendations in 2007 to improve the effectiveness and transparency of retrospective regulatory reviews. Among GAO's recommendations were: minimum standards for documenting and reporting completed review results; including public input as a factor in regulatory review decisions; and consideration of how agencies will measure the performance of new regulations. In 2011 and 2012, the administration issued new directives to agencies on how they should plan and conduct analyses of existing regulations that addressed each of GAO's recommendations. ...|$|R
