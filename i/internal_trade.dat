5|$|Edward's {{difficulties}} were {{exacerbated by}} prolonged problems in English agriculture, {{part of a}} wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting {{in a string of}} bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both <b>internal</b> <b>trade</b> and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and <b>Internal</b> <b>Trade</b> from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade of}} the Madras Presidency {{comprised}} that {{of both the}} Presidency with other Provinces and its overseas trade. External trade made up 93 {{percent of the total}} with <b>internal</b> <b>trade</b> making up the remainder. Foreign trade accounted for 70 percent of the total while 23 percent was inter-provincial. In 1900–01, imports from other provinces of British India amounted to 13.43 crores while exports to other provinces amounted to 11.52 crores. During the same year, exports to other countries reached 11.74 crores while imports were valued at 66.2million. At the time of India's independence, imports of the Presidency amounted to 71.32 crores a year while exports were valued at 645.1million. Trade with the United Kingdom made up 31.54% of the total trade of the Presidency with Madras the chief port accounting for 49% of the total trade.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} with internal markets and different degrees of <b>internal</b> <b>trading</b> of services and supplies in the Norwegian Armed Forces. Different degrees of <b>internal</b> <b>trading</b> in armed forces relate mainly to the grade of internal pricing and centralised versus decentralised management of <b>internal</b> <b>trading.</b> The policy of internal pricing is common, but the level of management of internal markets varies between military capabilities and services. Overall, the support side, consisting of the Norwegian Defence Logistic Organisation and Norwegian Defence Estates Agency, seem to have advantages with this model, independent from degree of <b>internal</b> <b>trading.</b> On the other side, the operational side seems generally to have disadvantages with the internal markets. Furthermore, significant disadvantages were discovered for the units that have decentralised management. Additionally the organisation model derived {{by the process of}} creating internal markets seems to have some negative effects on the efficiency of the operational capabilities. The recommendation is to compensate the internal markets with more vertical management and less internal pricing. In addition, a restrictive policy of decentralised organisation of the internal markets seems to mitigate the negative effects...|$|R

After Congress tabled the measure, the debate in South Carolina resumed between those who wanted state investment and those who wanted to work to get Congress' support. The debate demonstrated that a significant minority of the state did have an interest in Clay’s American System. The effect of the Webster–Hayne debate was to energize the radicals, and some moderates started to move in their direction.|$|E

25|$|Internal and {{external}} trade was well organised and active. Evidence from both archaeology and literature {{speaks of a}} flourishing foreign trade with the Yavanas (Greeks). The port city of Puhar {{on the east coast}} and Muziris on the west coast of south India were emporia of foreign trade, where huge ships moored, offloading precious merchandise. This trade started to decline after the 2nd century CE and the direct contact between the Roman empire and the ancient Tamil country was replaced by trade with the Arabs and the Auxumites of East Africa. <b>Internal</b> <b>trade</b> was also brisk and goods were sold and bartered. Agriculture was the main profession of a vast majority of the populace.|$|E

This failure to reform the Jagirs-based taxation system and economy, in part led to a succession power struggle {{and a series of}} threats, internal divisions among Sikhs, major assassinations and coups in the Sikh Empire in the years immediately after the death of Ranjit Singh; an easy annexation of the remains of the Sikh Empire into British India followed, with the colonial officials offering the Jagirs better terms and the right to keep the system intact.|$|E
25|$|King Edward III (1327–1377) succeeded {{his father}} {{at the age of}} 14. His reign was a period of {{conflict}} with Scotland and France, which is reflected in his coins. In the first part of Edwards' reign only a small quantity of pennies was produced, in a similar style to those of his father. New gold coins – the noble, half noble, and the quarter noble – were introduced, followed later by the silver groat or fourpence which became very popular and eventually superseded the penny in importance, together with the half groat which was also popular. Together with the production of half pennies and farthings, England had at last an adequate supply of varying denominations which benefited both <b>internal</b> <b>trade</b> and trade with other countries in Europe where English coins were readily acceptable.|$|E

There was also <b>internal</b> <b>trade</b> through the Punalur Pass connecting the ancient town to Tamil Nadu. The overland trade in pepper by bullock cart and the trade over the waterways connecting Allepey and Cochin established trade linkages that enabled it to grow {{into one of the}} earliest Indian industrial townships.

25|$|By the 1500s, the Indian subcontinent {{benefited from}} {{extensive}} external and <b>internal</b> <b>trade.</b> Its agriculture was highly efficient {{as well as}} its industry. For economic historian Irfan Habib, however, this was not sufficient to later lead to an important capitalistic development. Unlike China, Japan and western and central Europe, India did not experience extensive deforestation until the 19th and 20th centuries. It thus had no pressure to move to coal as a source of energy. From the 17th century, cotton textiles from Mughal India became popular in Europe, with some governments banning them to protect their wool industries. In the 18th century, India were the most important manufacturers in world trade, producing about 25% of the world's industrial output in 1750, with Mughal Bengal in particular being globally dominant in industries such as textile manufacturing and shipbuilding.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time in South Asia, {{political}} unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural productivity. The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the Arthashastra. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while <b>internal</b> <b>trade</b> in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} taxes, {{infrastructure}} improvement, and <b>internal</b> <b>trade</b> policy were defined independently by each territory, leading to many internal customs barriers and tolls, and conflicting policies {{even within the}} Habsburg domains. Charles I and Philip II {{had been able to}} master the various courts through their impressive political energy, but the much weaker Philip III and IV allowed it to decay, and Charles II was incapable of controlling anything at all. The development of Spain itself was hampered by the fact that Charles I and Philip II spent most of their time abroad; for most of the 16th century, Spain was administrated from Brussels and Antwerp, and it was only during the Dutch Revolt that Philip returned to Spain, where {{he spent most of his}} time in the seclusion of the monastic palace of El Escorial. The empire, held together by a determined king keeping the bureaucracy together, experienced a setback when a less-trusting ruler came to the throne. Philip II distrusted the nobility and discouraged any independent initiative among them. While writers of the time offered novel solutions to Spain's problems such as using irrigation in agriculture and encouragement of economic activity, the nobility never really produced anyone that could bring about serious reforms.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{economy was}} large and prosperous under the Mughal Empire, up until the 18th century. Sean Harkin {{estimates}} China and India may have accounted for 60 to 70 percent of world GDP in the 17th century. The Mughal economy functioned on an elaborate system of coined currency, land revenue and trade. Gold, silver and copper coins were issued by the royal mints which functioned {{on the basis of}} free coinage. The political stability and uniform revenue policy resulting from a centralised administration under the Mughals, coupled with a well-developed <b>internal</b> <b>trade</b> network, ensured that India–before the arrival of the British–was to a large extent economically unified, despite having a traditional agrarian economy characterised by a predominance of subsistence agriculture, with 64% of the workforce in the primary sector (including agriculture), but with 36% of the workforce also in the secondary and tertiary sectors, higher than in Europe, where 65–90% of its workforce were in agriculture in 1700 and 65–75% were in agriculture in 1750. Agricultural production increased under Mughal agrarian reforms, with Indian agriculture being advanced compared to Europe at the time, such as the widespread use of the seed drill among Indian peasants before its adoption in European agriculture, and higher per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption.|$|E
