30|$|A 1 : 9 {{dilution}} {{was first}} prepared with 25  g of soft tissue and <b>intervalvular</b> <b>liquid</b> in 225  mL of Alkaline peptone water (APW) (Yeast extract 3  g, peptone 10  g, sodium chloride 20  g/L and distilled water 1  L at pH  8.6). The mix was homogenized and incubated at 42 [*]°C for 18  h for its enrichment and cell growth. An aliquot was innocullated in Thiosulfate citrate bile sacharose agar (TCBS) (Scharlau Chimie, Spain) and CHROMagar Vibrio chromogenic medium (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany). These media were then incubated at 37 °C for 18 – 24  h. A minimum of five typical colonies were picked and cultured on Marine agar {{to determine their}} purity (ZoBell 1941). The pure cultures of isolated colonies were subjected to a battery of tests for morphological and biochemical identification. Strains were identified by Gram staining and cytochrome oxidase activity. Only Gram-negative, oxidase-positive colonies were selected for biochemical tests, following classical procedures. The API 20 E system, and culture in 0 %, 3 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 % NaCl peptone water were used to identify the Vibrio species (Hara-Kudo et al. 2001). Serotyping strains of V. cholerae consisted of a slide agglutination test with a 24  hour culture on Marine Agar (MA), a test in physiological saline was performed to verify that the strains were not autoagglutinables. The Suspected colonies resembling V. cholerae were tested by slide agglutination with polyvalent anti-O 1 and anti-O 139 sera.|$|E
