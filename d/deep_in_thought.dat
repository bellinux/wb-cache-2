5|$|Ivan ends {{his story}} <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> as Vasilisa {{begins to cry}} and Lukerya looks on in pain. He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and awe at life itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought,</b> with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E
25|$|The final daily {{original}} Peanuts {{comic strip}} was published on Monday, January 3, 2000. The strip contained {{a note to}} the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his doghouse <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought.</b> Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected {{to pick it up}} (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that were to run past January 3, he had drawn five extra Sunday strips and these had yet to run. The first of these strips appeared six days after the last daily on January 9.|$|E

25|$|Bellini {{used this}} same form, known as Sacred conversations, {{in several of}} his later altarpieces such as that for the Venetian church of San Zaccaria. It is a masterful {{composition}} which extends the real architecture of the building into the illusionistic architecture of the painting, making the niche a sort of loggia opened up to the landscape and to daylight which streams across the figures of the Virgin and Child, the two female saints and the little angel who plays a viola making them brighter than the two elderly male saints who stand to the fore in the picture, Peter <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> and Jerome immersed in a book.|$|E

In 2007 the university held the Irish Student Drama Association Festival. It runs the Queen's Film Theatre, which {{has been described as}} Northern Ireland's leading independent cinema, the Brian Friel Theatre and an art gallery, the Naughton Gallery at Queen's, which is a registered museum. In 2008 the Naughton Gallery was awarded the Times Higher Award for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts.

500|$|Django {{arrives with}} the rest of the clan, {{offering}} to help after seeing his son's determination. Remy has the rats cook, while Linguini waits tables. For Ego and Skinner, Remy and Colette create a variation of ratatouille, which reminds an astonished Ego of his mother's cooking. During the meal, the rats are forced to tie up Skinner and a health inspector to prevent them from revealing the rats' involvement in the cooking. When Ego requests to see the chef, Linguini and Colette make him wait until the rest of the diners have left before introducing Remy. Ego is stunned and leaves the restaurant, <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought.</b> He writes a positive and thoughtful review for the newspaper the next day, stating that Gusteau's chef (Remy) is [...] "nothing less than the finest chef in France." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Magic Alex" [...] (Greek-born Alex Mardas, who {{controlled}} Apple Electronics) arrived later, smuggling in alcohol {{from the nearest}} village as it was not allowed in the ashram. After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone, but walked down to the local post office every morning to see if he had received a telegram from Ono, who sent one almost daily. Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: [...] "I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of our marriage – but in reality it just presaged the end". Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, showing Lennon <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought,</b> and Cynthia's confused expression. Despite the alienation from Lennon, she later spoke about her time there, saying: [...] "I loved being away from the fans, hordes of people, deadlines, demands and flashing cameras".|$|E

500|$|The primary {{composition}} of the painting is in {{the contrast between the}} solemn jester (Stańczyk)– obviously the focus of the painting– and the lively ball going on in the background. Stańczyk is shown sitting alone in a dark room, while a ball, hosted by the royal family, is in full swing in the neighbouring hall. His appearance is unlike that one would expect in a jester– gloomy, <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought.</b> His seriousness is reinforced by his accessories: his marotte lies discarded on the floor, whereas a holy medallion of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa can be seen on his torso. The wrinkled carpet at Stanczyk's feet could have been formed by his collapsing heavily into the chair upon reading the letter, or through a nervous shifting of the feet thereafter. On the table lies a letter likely announcing that Poland has lost Smolensk (now in Russia) to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, causing Stańczyk's sorrow and reflection on his fatherland's fate. The letter seems to have been discarded by some official, and only the jester realizes its significance– while the rulers are partying, celebrating the recent victory at the battle of Orsha, disregarding the bad news about Smolensk. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} the letter bears the year 1533 (A.d. MDXXXIII) and the name [...] "Samogitia", a province of the Commonwealth. [...] The note is incongruent with the actual date of the fall of Smolensk in 1514, and is a matter of ongoing debate, with an outright mistake by the meticulous Matejko, known for use of symbolism and iconography, being unlikely. [...] Another symbol, a lute, symbol of glory, is being carried by a midget, stereotyped as a person of low stature and morale in Matejko's time; this suggests a decline of the Jagiellon dynasty's fortunes. The window is thrown - or was blown - open, ruffling the tablecloth and alluding to an upset of the present order. [...] Through the open window, the darkened profile of Wawel Cathedral in Krakow is visible - the site of the coronation of Polish kings. [...] Next to it, a comet is seen– a portent of ill fortune. [...] The imagery of downfall is completed with the inclusion of the three stars of Orion's Belt seen above and to the left of the cathedral spire. [...] In Greek mythology, Orion was a powerful hunter blinded by ego and his own greatness, but was ultimately brought down by the pinprick of a scorpion's sting.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{background of the}} Galician clergy contributed to a strong hostility and rivalry towards Poles, {{as well as a}} fierce sense of loyalty to Austria and the Habsburg dynasty by most Galician clerics. These attitudes were transmitted to their parishioners and thus reflected in Ukrainian society as a whole, earning western Ukrainians the nickname [...] "Tyroleans of the East" [...] for their loyalty to Austria. In the words of Ukrainian Catholic pilgrims visiting the tombs of the first two Austrian rulers to rule Ukraine, [...] "lost <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought,</b> we gazed at the coffins of Maria Theresa and her son Joseph, whose names are written in golden letters in our people's history." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{crash site}} and body of Yamamoto were found {{the next day}} in the jungle of the island of Bougainville by a Japanese search and rescue party, led by army {{engineer}} Lieutenant Hamasuna. According to Hamasuna, Yamamoto had been thrown clear of the plane's wreckage, his white-gloved hand grasping the hilt of his katana, still upright in his seat under a tree. Hamasuna said Yamamoto was instantly recognizable, head dipped down as if <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought.</b> A post-mortem of the body disclosed that Yamamoto had received two 0.50-caliber bullet wounds, one {{to the back of his}} left shoulder and another to his left lower jaw that exited above his right eye. The Japanese navy doctor examining the body determined that the head wound killed Yamamoto. The more violent details of Yamamoto's death were hidden from the Japanese public. The medical report was whitewashed, changed [...] "on orders from above", according to biographer Hiroyuki Agawa.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Good for You" [...] {{was directed by}} Sophie Muller. In the video, Gomez wanted to represent her journey to womanhood and to promote female empowerment — which she felt strongly about and wanted to depict in a raw and vulnerable way. With the clip, she wanted to prove that young women should not be self-conscious of their sex appeal or be obliged to wear lingerie to feel attractive. [...] "I feel like people here, especially guys are like, 'Ah, lingerie and sexy.' I think being sexy {{as a young woman}} or girl, is not caring what other people think, wearing like casual things, feeling sexy". The singer felt it was important to collaborate with a female director as a means of female empowerment and wanted the visual to be raw and vulnerable. She was also drawn to jeans and T-shirt attire and believed it would prove to women that they need not dress in lingerie to feel attractive. She chose the video to be specifically about her, absent of a love interest or men, to reflect the song's meaning of female self-empowerment. She later said Muller [...] "created a beautiful and intimate visual representation" [...] of [...] "Good for You". Speaking of the music video's theme, Gomez stated, [...] "It's very jeans and a T-shirt, moments where a woman is <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought,</b> or in a moment where she's in this crazy little rage. It just captures real things that women do. There {{are a lot of things}} that women do that are sexy that aren't just the typical, cheap way of being sexy." ...|$|E
