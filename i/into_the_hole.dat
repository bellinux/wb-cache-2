5|$|Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse {{proposed}} fothering the ship, as he {{had previously}} been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> in the hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop {{two of the three}} pumps.|$|E
5|$|Max {{leaves the}} house when Ray reappears and Tim accuses Ray of ruining his night. Lee and Ben {{make their way to}} the beach and share a kiss. Tim returns to the {{backyard}} and uncovers a ring and what appears to be a human hand before he decides to stop digging. He throws everything he has found back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> he has dug before starting to fill it in. He walks back up to the house and, finding Lee waiting for him, kisses her. The next morning, they pack up their belongings and go to pick up Jude.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May 2012, a 20-year-old man {{climbed over}} safety fences and {{accessed}} the underground ride area. He reportedly dropped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> {{from which the}} roller coaster track re-emerges from the underground tunnel, walked through the underground section and emerged on a ledge where the track enters the ground. Neither he nor any guests on the ride were harmed following the ride cars being held at the boarding station. He was arrested for a public order offence, and the ride returned to normal operation the following day.|$|E

5|$|The female {{relies on}} her hind feet for digging. She may {{accumulate}} so much sand and mud {{on her feet}} that her mobility is reduced, making her vulnerable to predators. To lighten her labors, she lubricates the area with her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> The freshly laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female's work may take fourhours. Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.|$|E
5|$|To this dreadful monster the effluvium of {{the weasel}} is fatal, {{a thing that}} has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature {{that there should be}} nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this {{struggle}} of nature against its own self.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{dominance}} among ants, {{a number}} of animals are known to prey on meat ants. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is a prominent predator of the meat ant, mostly due to the high fat levels (up to 47%) in virgin queens. These queens can almost contain 47% fat, and when no queens are available after an attack, an echidna may stop attacking the nest. However, these ants are normally consumed either in low numbers or avoided entirely. Attacking echidnas burrow down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> they have made and consume them while handling the bites from the ants, as they frequently scratch themselves {{on the head and}} chest. The echidna does not consume meat ants throughout the whole year; instead, echidnas only attack meat ant nests from August to October, which is when nuptial flight (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) occurs. This time period makes it much easier for echidnas to prey on the winged females since they are directly above on the nest. Despite attacks, colony growth is not affected by echidnas.|$|E
50|$|Near <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in <b>the</b> top {{and bottom}} of the door, some {{restraining}} device is provided for the rods to pass through, to prevent them from falling away entirely when in the unlocked position, and thus not inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in <b>the</b> door. This consists of either a rubber or plastic gasket fitted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in <b>the</b> door and protruding up or down a short distance, or else a small metal plate with a hole in it welded {{to the inside of the}} door through which the rod extends in any position.|$|R

5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster would go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would {{fall to the ground}} and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E
5|$|Viking raids {{took place}} for {{instance}} in 987 and 997 at Watchet and the Battle of Cynwit. King Alfred was driven to seek refuge from the Danes at Athelney before defeating them at the Battle of Ethandun in 878, usually considered to be near Edington, Wiltshire, but possibly the village of Edington in Somerset. Alfred established a series of forts and lookout posts linked by a military road, or Herepath, so his army could cover Viking movements at sea. The Herepath has a characteristic form which is familiar on the Quantocks: a regulation 20m wide track between avenues of trees growing from hedge laying embankments. The Herepath ran from the ford on the River Parrett at Combwich, past Cannington hill fort to Over Stowey, where it climbed the Quantocks {{along the line of}} the current Stowey road, to Crowcombe Park Gate. Then it went south along the ridge, to Triscombe Stone. One branch may have led past Lydeard Hill and Buncombe Hill, back to Alfred's base at Athelney. The main branch descended the hills at Triscombe, then along the avenue to Red Post Cross, and west to the Brendon Hills and Exmoor. A peace treaty with the Danes was signed at Wedmore and the Danish king Guthrum the Old was baptised at Aller. Burhs (fortified places) had been set up by 919, such as Lyng. The Alfred Jewel, an object about 2.5inch long, made of filigree gold, cloisonné-enamelled and with a rock crystal covering, was found in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton. Believed to have been owned by Alfred the Great it is thought to have been the handle for a pointer that would have fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> at its base and been used while reading a book.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} for bowlers, {{particularly}} those with fingertip style drillings, to place inserts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> rather than grip <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> directly. This {{can be done to}} vary the texture and shape of each hole to match a bowler's preferences.|$|R

25|$|A {{glory hole}} (also spelled gloryhole and glory-hole) is {{a hole in}} a wall, or other partition, often between public {{lavatory}} stalls or adult video arcade booths, for people to engage in sexual activity or observe {{the person in the}} next cubicle while one or both parties masturbate. In addition to the penis, fingers or the tongue may be inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
25|$|The epoxy/core test, detects voids by {{visual and}} {{mechanical}} methods. It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter {{hole through the}} pavement into the sub-base with a dry-bit roto-hammer. Next, a two-part epoxy is poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> – dyed for visual clarity. Once the epoxy hardens, technicians drill through the hole. If a void is present, the epoxy will stick to the core and provide physical evidence.|$|E
25|$|The {{holographic}} principle {{was inspired by}} black hole thermodynamics, which conjectures that the maximal entropy in any region scales with the radius squared, and not cubed as might be expected. In {{the case of a}} black hole, the insight was that the informational content of all the objects that have fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> might be entirely contained in surface fluctuations of the event horizon. The {{holographic principle}} resolves the black hole information paradox within the framework of string theory.|$|E
50|$|External wire {{connections}} to the board are made either by soldering the wires through <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> or, for wires too thick to pass through <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> by soldering them to specially made pins called Veropins which fit tightly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> Alternatively, some types of connectors have a suitable pin spacing to be inserted directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> board.|$|R

25|$|In some cases, {{the lead}} would be {{cast in a}} simple open mould made by pushing a finger or thumb into sand and pouring molten metal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> However, sling-bullets were more {{frequently}} cast in two part moulds. Such sling-bullets come {{in a number of}} shapes including an ellipsoidal form closely resembling an acorn – this could be the origin of the Latin word for a leaden sling-bullet: glandes plumbeae (literally leaden acorns) or simply glandes (meaning acorns, singular glans).|$|E
25|$|A basic {{pit latrine}} can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> and a reinforcement of {{the upper part of the}} pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|E
25|$|Cin'aq (Yukon, Hooper Bay and Chevak, Lake Iliamna, and Nunivak) is cheese-like fish aged in a pit. This fish {{is usually}} dog (chum) or king (chinook) salmon. The salmon whole (except the guts) aged {{through the process}} of burying them into the marshy, muddy lowland (maraq). The hole is dug until the {{permafrost}} is exposed. The bottom of the hole is then covered with dry grass, moss, and cardboard. Then several salmon are placed in. The top of the salmon is again covered with grass, moss and or cardboard, then the remaining dug up groung is placed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> tightly covering the contents. The aged salmon fish are usually dug out during the early winter, and eaten as a delicacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{settlement}} was surrounded on the north, west, and south sides by a palisade, {{a wall of}} logs set vertically <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. Narrow <b>holes</b> were dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground, then the posts were lifted into position and set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> <b>The</b> stockade was finished by people weaving flexible willow branches through the posts, and plastering the whole {{with a mixture of}} clay and grass to fill in the gaps, a technique similar to wattle and daub.|$|R

50|$|In festivals such as Holi, colours {{are added}} to the water. Small cloth pouches with organic colours were {{manually}} inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in <b>the</b> reservoir wall.

25|$|H. pomatia eggs measure about 3mm in {{diameter}} and have a calcareous shell and a high yolk content. H. pomatia lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> or may crawl in until only {{the top of the}} shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is glycoprotein similar to eggwhite.|$|E
25|$|In {{some regions}} of the country milk is offered along with {{crystallized}} sugar, rice pudding (kheer in local parlance). A special feature is of offering a lotus flower which is placed in a silver bowl. In front of this bowl, a rangoli (coloured design pattern) of snake is created on the floor with a brush made of wood or clay or silver or gold with sandalwood or turmeric paste as the paint. The design pattern will resemble a five hooded snake. Devotees then offer worship to this image on the floor. In villages, the anthills where the snakes are thought to reside, are searched. Incense is offered to the anthill as prayer along with milk (a myth of folk lore to feed milk to the snakes) to ensnare snakes {{to come out of the}} anthill. After this, milk is poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> in the anthill as a libation to the snake god.|$|E
25|$|Also spelled langsuir or lang suyar, {{it is said}} to be {{the ghost}} of a woman who died while giving birth to a {{stillborn}} child which turns into a pontianak, or during pregnancy before the forty days of uncleanness have expired. The mother's grief changes her into a type of flying banshee. To prevent a pregnant woman's corpse from becoming a lang suir, glass beads are placed into the mouth, an egg is placed in each armpit, and needles are placed in the hands. The lang suir can appear as a beautiful woman with long nails (a traditional mark of beauty), ankle-length hair and dressed in green. They also have the ability to take the form of an owl with long talons. Being fond of eating fish, they usually haunt coastal areas and attack pregnant women out of jealousy. It is possible to tame a lang suir by cutting off her long nails and stuffing the hair <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> at the back of her neck.|$|E
50|$|The root {{work around}} {{walls and ceiling}} was riddled with worm.
