Periodicities in the <b>geological</b> <b>climate</b> record with cycles of 100, 41, and 23 kyr have been linked with changes in obliquity, eccentricity, and precession of the equinoxes. The effect of variations of eccentricity during a 100 kyr period is weak relative to the signals from obliquity and precession variations and it may therefore be expected that the 100 kyr signal in the climate record would be of low intensity.

40|$|Geological {{evidence}} from the Late Cretaceous continental interior of the Vilui Basin, Siberia suggests a far wetter, warmer, and more equable annual climate than General Circulation Models (GCMs) can reproduce.

40|$|The {{southern}} Levant has a {{long history}} of human habitation and it has been previously suggested that climatic changes during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene stimulated changes in human behaviour and society. In order to evaluate such linkages, it is necessary to have a detailed understanding of the climate record. We have conducted an extensive and up-to-date review of terrestrial and marine climatic conditions in the Levant and Eastern Mediterranean during the last 25, 000 years. We firstly present data from general circulation models (GCMs) simulating the climate for the last glacial maximum (LGM), and evaluate the output of the model by reference to <b>geological</b> <b>climate</b> proxy data. We consider the types of climate data available from different environments and proxies and then present the spatial climatic "picture" for key climatic events. This exercise suggests that the major Northern Hemisphere climatic fluctuations of the last 25, 000 years are recorded in the Eastern Mediterranean and Levantine region.

40|$|In this contribution, we {{continue}} our exploration of the factors defining the Mesozoic climatic history. We improve the Earth system model GEOCLIM designed for long term climate and geochemical reconstructions by adding the explicit calculation of the biome dynamics using the LPJ model. The coupled GEOCLIM-LPJ model thus allows the simultaneous calculation of the climate with a 2 -D spatial resolution, the coeval atmospheric CO 2, and the continental biome distribution. We found that accounting for the climatic role of the continental vegetation dynamics (albedo change, water cycle and surface roughness modulations) strongly affects the reconstructed <b>geological</b> <b>climate.</b> Indeed the calculated partial pressure of atmospheric CO 2 over the Mesozoic is twice the value calculated when assuming a uniform constant vegetation. This increase in CO 2 is triggered by a global cooling of the continents, itself triggered by a general increase in continental albedo owing {{to the development of}} desertic surfaces. This cooling reduces the CO 2 consumption through silicate weathering, and hence results in a compensating increase in the atmospheric CO 2 pressure. This study demonstrates that the impact of land plants on climate and hence on atmospheric CO 2 is as important as their geochemical effect through the enhancement of chemical weathering of the continental surface. Our GEOCLIM-LPJ simulations also define a climatic baseline for the Mesozoic, around which exceptionally cool and warm events can be identified...|$|E
6000|$|General View of <b>Geological</b> <b>Climates</b> as {{dependent}} on the Physical Features of the Earth's Surface.--In the preceding chapters I have earnestly endeavoured to arrive at an explanation of <b>geological</b> <b>climates</b> in the temperate and Arctic zones, which should be {{in harmony with the}} great body of geological facts now available for their elucidation. If my conclusions as here set forth diverge considerably from those of Dr. Croll, it is not from any want of appreciation of his facts and arguments, since for many years I have upheld and enforced his views {{to the best of my}} ability. But a careful re-examination of the whole question has now convinced me that an error has been made in estimating the comparative effect of geographical and astronomical causes on changes of climate, and that, while the latter have undoubtedly played an important part in bringing about the glacial epoch, it is to the former that the mild climates of the Arctic regions are almost entirely due. If I have now succeeded in approaching to a true solution of this difficult problem, I owe it mainly to the study of Dr. Croll's writings, since my theory is entirely based on the facts and principles so clearly set forth in his admirable papers on [...] "Ocean Currents in relation to the Distribution of Heat over the Globe."

As the years march onward, conditions in Palestine continue to degrade. Palestinians face many problems with respect to humanitarian and developmental aid. Conditions are harsh, both because of the extreme weather and continued conflict with the Israeli military and diplomatic policies. Lack of communication and travel abilities between Gaza and the West Bank, and even between neighboring villages in each region, continue to lead to wider disparity between the two geographic regions creating dramatically different levels of need depending upon location.

This simulation has been run in-tandem with a lower temporally resolved six-year climatological run. The {{purpose of the study}} is to determine: (1) whether examination of higher-resolution simulations, on both spatial and temporal scales, can enhance paleometeorological inferences based previously on monthly statistics of model output and (2) whether certain synoptic-scale events, which may have only a modest impact on seasonal statistics, might exert a disproportionate impact on <b>geological</b> <b>climate</b> records. Analysis is focused on changes in wind flow, no analogue climate “states”, synoptic scale events including Northern Hemisphere cyclogenesis, and gust events over glacial dust source regions. Results show a decrease in North Atlantic and increase in North Pacific cyclogenesis during the LGM. Storm trajectories react to the mechanical forcing of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, with Pacific storms tracking over middle Alaska and northern Canada and terminate in the Labrador Sea. The latter result supports observations and other model runs showing a significant reduction in Greenland winter precipitation. The modified Pacific track results in increased precipitation and the delivery of warmer air along the west coast of North America. This could explain “early” glacial warming inferred in this region from proxy climate records, potentially representing instead a natural regional response to ice age boundary conditions. Results also indicate a low variability, “no analogue” region just south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet margin which has appropriate conditions to harbour temperature-sensitive trees west of the Appalachian Mountains. Combined with pollen data, this lends valuable insight into the known disagreement between modern seed dispersal experiments and calculated migration rates. Finally, hourly-scale gust events over dust source regions during the LGM are two to five times greater than the modern, providing a mechanism to help explain the increased glacial dust load seen in the ice cores. Backwards air-parcel trajectories from Antarctic ice core locations show air sources over Patagonia and the Altiplano with some inputs from South Africa agreeing with recent isotopic tracer analyses. Results demonstrate that high temporal and spatial resolution simulations can provide valuable insight to add to the cornucopia of information already available from lower-resolution runs. They can also enhance our interpretation of geological records, which have been previously assumed to record longer time-scale climatological mean-states and thus ignoring any extreme synoptic events which may actually have had a disproportionate impact on their preservation...|$|E

40|$|Understanding and {{predicting}} climate variability {{is a major}} scientific challenge, {{especially as}} climate-induced environmental change will impact on human society. In order to constrain {{the magnitude of this}} impact, models to predict future climates are increasingly complex, and partly based on what is known of the climate in the past, both from the recent instrumental and historical records as well as from <b>geological</b> <b>climate</b> archives. The Siberian mainland is a region that is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it contains a vast amount of frozen permafrost. The current and accelerating rise in the concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, that cause the warming of the globe, can lead to the mobilization of this stock of fossil organic carbon. In a warmer climate, large changes in the export of water and organic carbon to the Arctic Ocean are to be expected. The Yenisei River is the largest river of the Siberian mainland, draining the Mongolian steppe and highlands and vast areas of Siberian temperate forests and taiga, before flowing into the Kara Sea, a shallow shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. To estimate past air temperatures and soil pH of the Siberian mainland and the amount of terrigenous organic matter delivered to the Kara Sea by the Yenisei River, the quantity and distributions of bacterial branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (brGDGTs) was studied. They have been used previously for palaeoclimate reconstructions in palaeosoils, lake and marine sediments. We made analytical developments that allowed quantifying six new brGDGT compounds with a methylation on the 6 and/ or ω- 6 position, and are therefore referred to as 6 -methyl brGDGTs. Their separate quantification allowed performing brGDGT-based palaeoclimate reconstructions with improved accuracy. However, the source of brGDGTs encountered in river fan sediments was shown to be a complex mixture of riverine, marine and soil-derived brGDGTs. In modern sediments, their relative abundance can be influenced by degradation of bacterial organic matter. On geological timescales, changes in sea level affect the importance of marine in-situ produced brGDGTs. The provenance of terrigenous brGDGTs delivered to and stored in the marine sediments can be modified by changes in the erosion of watershed soils, by the presence of large lakes in the flowpath of the river, and by preferential degradation of more labile brGDGT pools. BrGDGT-based palaeoclimate reconstructions thus have to be performed taking these processes in mind. Overall, the work presented in this thesis has implications for brGDGT-based palaeoclimate reconstructions, not only in Siberian river systems, but also for brGDGTs encountered in river fan sediments worldwide...|$|E

In order to constrainthe magnitude of this impact, models to predict future climates are increasingly complex, andpartly based on what is known of the climate in the past, both from the recent instrumental andhistorical records {{as well as from}} <b>geological</b> <b>climate</b> archives. In this thesis so-called proxiesare used to estimate past air temperatures, soil pH, and the amount of terrigenous organicmatter delivered to the marine system by rivers. To reconstruct these changes, the quantity anddistributions of two groups of lipids is studied; bacterial branched glycerol dialkyl glyceroltetraether lipids (brGDGTs) and bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs). BrGDGTs are membrane-spanning lipids that are produced most likely by Acidobacteria. These ubiquitous bacteria occur in soil, peat bogs, and lake and coastal marine sedimentsand the water column. In soils, the number of methyl groups on the alkyl chains was shownto depend on the mean annual air temperature (MAT) and soil pH, while the number ofcyclopentane moieties correlates with soil pH. Based on this observation, the methylation indexof branched tetraethers (MBT) and the cyclisation index of branched tetraethers (CBT) wereintroduced to reconstruct MAT and soil pH. As brGDGTs are found in large quantities in soiland peat, it was assumed that their presence in freshwater and marine environments followedsoil erosion and transport through river systems. Hence, changes in the brGDGT compositionin river fan sediments, were assumed to reflect fluctuations in the past MAT and soil pH ofthe drainage basin of a river system. Furthermore, their presence allows reconstructing therelative contribution of soil-derived organic matter in the marine system, using the branchedand isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index. A second group of lipids studied are BHPs, lipids thatare produced by a variety of (cyano) bacteria. The relative concentration of a set of soil-markerBHPs, expressed as the R’soil index, allows tracing the delivery of terrigenous organic matter tothe marine system. Furthermore, the presence of some BHPs can imply a more or less specificchemotaxonomic source. Previous studies of brGDGTs, described the abundance of only 9 brGDGT compounds, the 5 -methyl brGDGTs, where the penta- and hexamethylated brGDGTs have a methylation on the 5 and/ or ?- 5 position. In this thesis, the abundance of 15 brGDGT compounds is described,including 6 compounds that were previously partially or fully co-eluting with these 5 -methylcompounds. The chemical structure of these novel compounds was determined, following theisolation of penta- and hexamethylated brGDGTs from a Siberian peat. They were describedto contain a methylation on the 6 and/ or ?- 6 position, and are therefore referred to as 6 -methylbrGDGTs. Using improved chromatography, these 6 -methyl compounds were shown to beReferences, summary and acknowledgments 245 abundant in soils globally, where their relative concentration was strongly related to the soilpH. Their presence has an impact on the interpretation of currently used brGDGT palaeoclimateproxies, as their separate quantification results in a significantly improved soil pH proxy, and apH-independent temperature proxy. The Siberian mainland, a region that is particularly vulnerable to climate change, containsa vast amount of frozen permafrost. The current and accelerating rise in the concentration ofgreenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, that cause the warming of the globe, can lead to themobilization of this stock of fossil organic carbon. In a warmer climate, large changes in theexport of water and organic carbon to the Arctic Ocean are to be expected. The Yenisei Riveris the largest river of the Siberian mainland, draining the Mongolian steppe and highlandsand vast areas of Siberian temperate forests and taiga, before flowing into the Kara Sea, ashallow shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. To perform informed palaeoclimate reconstructions ofthe Yenisei River watershed in particular, but also of Siberian watersheds in general, the source(i. e. soil-derived, riverine or marine) of the bacterial organic matter was determined in themodern Yenisei River and its outflow in the Kara Sea. Although the Yenisei River crosses several climatic zones, the brGDGTs suspended inthe water column of the Yenisei River show very little variation downstream the river. Thereconstructed temperature and pH using brGDGTs was distinct from the air temperature andsoil pH. The strong temperature gradient imposed on the watershed soils was thus not reflectedin the riverine brGDGT distribution. However, the reconstructed water temperature and pHapproached those of the Yenisei River water, indicating that the Yenisei River brGDGTs aredominated by riverine in-situ produced lipids. The prevalent assumption that the riverine brGDGT signal delivered to the ocean representsan average of the watershed was challenged by a study performed on Lake Baikal. Here, itis described how the contrasting brGDGT distribution of its main inflowing river, SelengaRiver, is strikingly different compared to that from the lake. A detailed study of this outflowsystem indicates that degradation or in-situ production of brGDGTs takes place. However, thebrGDGTs exported from the lake do not contribute to the brGDGT signal encountered in theYenisei River. Consequently, the watershed of Lake Baikal does not seem to contribute GDGTsto the marine system. Following up on this, the fate of riverine brGDGTs after their introduction in the marineenvironment was reconstructed. Moving downstream in the Yenisei River outflow, a strongshift is observed in the brGDGT distribution. It is postulated that this can be explained bydegradation, which will affect different brGDGT pools to a different extent. The performanceof the BIT index as a tracer for terrigenous and riverine bacterial organic matter was also tested. Although the contribution of the different brGDGT pools present (soil-derived, coastal cliffderivedand produced in-situ in the river) is unknown, the BIT-index performs well in the KaraSea system. These findings were compared with an independent set of bacteriohopanepolyolslipids. Six BHPs that are generally enriched in soils, i. e. the so-called soil-marker BHPs, areencountered both in the Yenisei River as its outflow. Both pools of bacterial OM show the samedecrease in concentration in the marine system. 246 Although in-situ production of brGDGTs only affects the modern sediments to a minorextent, it clearly influences downcore sediments, as was shown in the Kara Sea Trough. Here,sediments deposited since the deglaciation of this site (13 ka), illustrate that in-situ productionof marine brGDGTs can strongly influence their distribution. The shift from a system in frontof the river outflow to a system dominated by marine brGDGTs resulting from the substantialrise in sealevel since the last Glacial is also evident from the BIT index record. During this shiftsubstantial changes in the terrigenous sources of brGDGTs have occurred, resulting in changingbrGDGT distributions. Both processes strongly influence brGDGT-based palaeoclimatereconstructions. Overall, the work presented in this thesis has implications for brGDGT-based palaeoclimatereconstructions, not only in Siberian river systems, but also for brGDGTs encountered inriver fan sediments worldwide. Analytical developments allow performing palaeoclimatereconstructions with improved accuracy. However, the source of brGDGTs encountered inriver fan sediments was shown to be a complex mixture of riverine, marine and soil-derivedbrGDGTs.

Information on the <b>geological,</b> geomorphological <b>climate</b> and soil type distributions were available from previous work. Topographic data from the Shuttle Radar topographic mission waas interpreted in order to stratify the land into slope classes. China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite data was classified and interpreted to produce a land cover map os the study site. All environmental data were weighted accordingly to a scale based on the Ecodinamica concepts and integrated in order to produce a soil vulnerability map. Pages: 3997 - 400...|$|R
