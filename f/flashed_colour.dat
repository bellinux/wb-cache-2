50|$|A <b>Flash</b> Flood of <b>Colour</b> World Tour was {{a concert}} tour by rock band Enter Shikari, {{which took place}} through 2012 and 2013, {{in support of the}} band's third studio album A <b>Flash</b> Flood of <b>Colour,</b> {{released}} on 16 January 2012. The tour supersedes the world tour that the band embarked on to support Common Dreads throughout 2009 and 2010. A <b>Flash</b> Flood of <b>Colour</b> was recorded in Bangkok, Thailand, between 8 May - 14 June 2011.|$|R

50|$|The stage show {{featured}} Nadav Guedj {{dressed in}} a black and white suit with golden shoes, performing a choreographed routine together with his five supporting performers. Guedj was joined by two backing vocalists, Hananel Edri and Imri Ziv, and three backing dancers, Dor Raybi, Tomer Tenenboim and Adam Cohen. The performance began in muted dark blue lighting which transitioned to yellow and red <b>flashing</b> <b>colours</b> as the song progressed. The background LED screens displayed Asian inspired window panes that also changed colours throughout the performance.|$|R
60|$|A change--{{like the}} <b>flashing</b> <b>colours</b> of a kaleidoscope; like the phantoms of a dream! Red River {{settlement}} is dry again, or drying; but ah! what {{a scene of}} wreck and ruin! It {{looks as if the}} settlement had been devastated by fire and sword as well as water. Broken-down houses, uprooted fences and trees, piles of debris, beds and boxes, billets of wood and blankets, habiliments and hay, carioles and cordage and carcasses of cattle, all mixed up more or less, and cemented together with mud. Nearly every house in the settlement had been destroyed.|$|R

5|$|A <b>Flash</b> Flood of <b>Colour</b> {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics {{and an average}} Metacritic score of 75 out of 100. It debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart after a band-led campaign to get the album to number one, and appeared on several album-of-the-year lists. To promote the album, Enter Shikari made A <b>Flash</b> Flood of <b>Colour</b> World Tour.|$|R

500|$|Enter Shikari {{released}} two non-album singles, [...] "Destabilise" [...] and [...] "Quelle Surprise", before A <b>Flash</b> Flood of <b>Colours</b> release. Although [...] "Quelle Surprise" [...] (released on 19 May 2011) {{was intended}} as the first single from the new album, it was later decided that it (like [...] "Destabilise") would be a stand-alone track. They were included as bonus tracks on selected versions of A <b>Flash</b> Flood of <b>Colour.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Modes 0 to 6 (the 'ASCII' modes) could {{display colours}} from a logical palette of sixteen: the eight basic colours at the {{vertices}} of the RGB colour cube and eight <b>flashing</b> <b>colours</b> made by alternating the basic colour with its inverse. [...] The palette could be freely reprogrammed without touching display memory. Modes 3 and 6 were special text-only modes that used less RAM {{by reducing the}} number of text rows and inserting blank scan lines below each row. Mode 6 was the smallest, allocating 8 KB as video memory. Modes 0 to 6 could show diacritics and other user defined characters. All modes except 7 supported bitmapped graphics, but graphics commands such as DRAW and PLOT had no effect in the text-only modes.|$|R

5000|$|Opening up in {{monochrome}} {{but with}} occasional <b>flashes</b> of <b>colour,</b> the first action scene is a disorientating strobe-like affair. From there the movie proceeds in color, with many innovative editing techniques, including slow-motion, jump cut, step-printed slow motion, [...] "jump dissolves," [...] still frames, and layering images {{on top of}} one another.|$|R
60|$|The large flock {{that had}} so {{suddenly}} come on our friends while taking their siesta had turned off thus with a horrible scream, and revealed their gay breasts, on which the sun chanced to shine at the moment with great power, thus producing, as we have said, a splendid <b>flash</b> of <b>colour.</b>|$|R

50|$|A related {{effect is}} sensory deprivation, {{although}} {{in this case}} a stimulus is minimized rather than unstructured. Hallucinations that appear under prolonged sensory deprivation are similar to elementary percepts caused by luminous ganzfeld, and include transient sensations of light <b>flashes</b> or <b>colours.</b> Hallucinations caused by sensory deprivation can, like ganzfeld-induced hallucinations, turn into complex scenes.|$|R

50|$|One couple {{after another}} {{moves through the}} gardens with the same aimlessness. Woolf's {{narrative}} now dissolves the snatches of conversation into <b>flashes</b> of <b>colour,</b> shape and movement, wordless voices of contentment, passion, and desire. Children's voices echo freshness and surprise. Finally the focus pulls out beyond the gardens, contrasting the murmur of the city with the voices and colour of the gardens.|$|R
5000|$|The title {{screen of}} the game {{features}} either the text [...] "Crazy Kong" [...] or [...] "Monkey Donkey" [...] written in girders dependent upon which version is running. There is no copyright or graphic of Kong on the main screen, just the year '1981'. The girder text does not <b>flash</b> different <b>colours</b> {{for a few seconds}} before stopping, as in Donkey Kong.|$|R
50|$|A lightly {{coloured}} molten gather is {{dipped into}} {{a pot of}} molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above. Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well. A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or abraded to reveal the clear or tinted glass below. The method allows rich detailing and patterns to be achieved without needing to add more lead-lines, giving artists greater freedom in their designs. A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them. For instance, 16th-century heraldic windows relied heavily {{on a variety of}} <b>flashed</b> <b>colours</b> for their intricate crests and creatures. In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, hydrofluoric acid was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePlanet Earth {{is covered}} by very common Terrestrial (not submersed), Histic (peats) and Aqueous (tidal) humipedons. Beside these typical topsoils there are other more {{discrete}} humipedons, generated by the interaction of mineral matter with microorganisms, fungi and small plants (algae, lichens and mosses). In some cases roots and their symbionts can be a driving force of litter biotransformation, in other cases {{a large amount of}} decaying wood accommodates particular organisms which interfere with and change the normal process of litter decomposition. Particular microorganisms inhabit submerged sediments or extreme environments and can generate specialised humipedons with grey-black or even astonishingly <b>flashing</b> <b>colours.</b> We describe all these common but still unknown humipedons, defining diagnostic horizons and proposing a first morpho-functional classification, which still has to be improved. At the end of the article, the hypothesis of evolving and interconnected Cosmo, Aero, Hydro, Humi, Co, Litho and Geopedons (related to the microbiota) is formulated as a speculative curiosity...|$|R

Above ground, along an internal 40 meter long curved wall of the concourse, Lothar Goetz orchestrated his palette of colours into a rhythmic pattern of vertical bands, reflecting {{the degree to which}} each colour is used below ground...|$|R

5000|$|The first one, {{released}} on 8 April 2014 and dubbed [...] "Street Video", includes footage {{of thousands of}} people attending an DJ event featuring Alle Farben (Frans Zimmer) on the tarmac of the phased out Berlin Tempelhof Airport, dancing to his tunes while <b>flashes</b> of <b>colour</b> are splashed all across the screen, a tribute to his name meaning [...] "all colours" [...] and as a reference to the debut Synesthesia album (full title Synesthesia - I Think in Colours).|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I {{shall be}} long," [...] murmured Ermine, a vivid <b>colour</b> <b>flashing</b> forth upon her cheek, and leading the {{question}} from herself. [...] "Just suppose you did {{carry out this}} fierce act of self-abnegation, {{what do you think}} could come next?" ...|$|R
5000|$|As the {{red underwing}} moth takes off, the sudden <b>flash</b> of <b>colour</b> may confuse the attacker, {{and when it}} lands and {{immediately}} closes its wings it may seem to disappear as the colour is [...] "switched off". It is also thought that the symmetrical patterned orange sections on the rear wings form the illusion of another smaller creature (butterfly), so the attacker will go for the colourful [...] "small illusive" [...] rear safe region on {{the main body of}} this red underwing moth species.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{keep all}} together," [...] said Mrs. Bowen, {{as they passed}} through the inner door of the vestibule, and the brilliantly lighted theatre <b>flashed</b> its <b>colours</b> and splendours upon them. The floor of the pit had been {{levelled}} {{to that of the}} stage, which, stripped of the scenic apparatus, opened vaster spaces for the motley crew already eddying over it in the waltz. The boxes, tier over tier, blazed with the light of candelabra which added their sparkle to that of the gas jets.|$|R
