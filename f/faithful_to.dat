5|$|Various {{changes to}} {{characters}} such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Arwen, Denethor, Faramir, Gimli, and Frodo, when considered together, were {{seen by some}} to alter the tone and themes found in the books.

5|$|Although largely <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> a {{selection}} of historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events {{in order to increase}} dramatic potential. For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. Fellowes told BBC Radio 4's Film Programme that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection, and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by the bullet in the film was added to best show his bravery and devotion as he tried to stop Queen Victoria from being shot.|$|E

5|$|As the fog lifted, Castañeda sent Smither {{to request}} a meeting between the two commanders. Smither was {{promptly}} arrested by the Texians, who were suspicious of his presence among the Mexican soldiers. Nevertheless, Moore agreed to meet Castañeda.

Castañeda revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, {{but that he was}} honor-bound to follow orders.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, Alsace {{was one of}} {{the main}} battlefields of the Thirty Years War. Sélestat was seized by the Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege.

The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France. Sélestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674. The Treaties of Nijmegen (1679) that ended the war also abolished the Decapolis.|$|E

5|$|Eventually she {{revealed}} {{herself to}} him, {{and they began}} a correspondence that lasted for fifteen years. Although she remained <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> her husband Wacław, Mme.

They wed {{in the town of}} Berdychiv on 14 March 1850, five months before he died.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{influence}}, {{which had}} {{made its way}} to Phoenicia during the Persian period, now became stronger. Figurines found in Kharayeb show Aegean influence on local craftsmen.

5|$|Horton Hatches the Egg {{has been}} used in discussions {{on a wide variety of}} topics e.g., economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption.
