50|$|Megaloptera is {{an order}} of insects. It {{contains}} the alderflies, <b>dobsonflies</b> and fishflies, and there are about 300 known species.|$|R
5000|$|Fishflies {{are members}} of the {{subfamily}} Chauliodinae, belonging to the megalopteran family Corydalidae. They are most easily distinguished from their closest relatives, <b>dobsonflies,</b> by the jaws (mandibles) and antennae. In contrast to the large jaws (especially in males) of <b>dobsonflies,</b> fishfly mandibles are not particularly noticeable or distinctive, and the males have feathery antennae similar to many large moths. Chauliodes pectinicornis, the [...] "summer fishfly", is a well-known species in North America.|$|R

50|$|The <b>dobsonfly</b> {{is found}} in most of eastern North America. It is usually found near the swift flowing, unpolluted streams in which its larvae develop.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dobsonfly</b> may be {{attracted}} by mercaptan, an indicator additive in {{natural gas and}} propane, and may behave as an animal sentinel {{in the presence of}} these gasses.|$|E
50|$|Nevromus is a genus <b>dobsonfly</b> or Corydalidae {{family of}} Megalopteran insects. They {{are found in}} Asia and are among the few Asian Corydalines that are found on islands {{including}} Borneo, Java and Sumatra.|$|E
50|$|This {{relatively}} small insect order includes some rather large species, {{many of which}} are noticeable for their elongated, imposing mandibles. The <b>dobsonflies</b> reach the greatest sizes of the order and can range up to 12.5 cm in length.|$|R
50|$|Queen bees have mandibles {{with sharp}} cutting teeth unlike worker bees, who have toothless jaws. Male <b>dobsonflies</b> have slender mandibles up to 2.5 cm long, half {{as long as}} the insect's main body. Potter wasps use their mandibles to mix {{droplets}} of water with clay while constructing a nest.|$|R
25|$|The insect order Neuroptera, or net-winged insects, {{includes}} the lacewings, mantidflies, antlions, and their relatives. The order consists of some 6,000 species. The group was {{once known as}} Planipennia, {{and at that time}} also included alderflies, fishflies, <b>dobsonflies,</b> and snakeflies, but these are now separate orders (the Megaloptera and Raphidioptera).|$|R
50|$|Prey of {{this species}} {{includes}} the tiger mosquito, giant willow aphid, fungus gnats, crane flies, large diving beetles, eastern <b>dobsonfly,</b> water fleas, green darner, aquatic oligochaetes, caddisflies, rotifers, copepods, amphipods, dogwood borer, six-spotted tiger beetle, freshwater triclads, and green hydra.|$|E
50|$|The eastern <b>dobsonfly,</b> Corydalus cornutus, {{is a large}} insect in the Corydalidae family. It {{is found}} in eastern North America in regions with fast-flowing streams where its aquatic larvae develop. These are known as hellgrammites and are among the top {{invertebrate}} predators in the streams in which they live. They are used by anglers as bait.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{original}} Woolly Bugger pattern {{was believed to}} have been created by Pennsylvania fly tyer Russell Blessing as early as 1967 to resemble a hellgrammite, or <b>dobsonfly</b> nymph, its precise origin is unknown, but is clearly an evolution of the Woolly Worm fly, which itself is a variation—intentional or not—of the British palmer fly, which dates back to Walton and beyond.|$|E
50|$|Within the Neuropterida, {{adults have}} chewing mouthparts, but the mandibles of male <b>dobsonflies</b> are {{non-functional}} in feeding. The larvae in many lineages are predatory, with mandibles modified with grooves along which digestive saliva flows, while the larvae {{of the family}} Sisyridae have the mouthparts developed into a sucking tube which they use to feed on the liquid tissues of freshwater sponges.|$|R
50|$|Larvae of <b>dobsonflies</b> {{differ from}} those of their sister clade, the alderflies, in that they bear eight pairs of lateral {{processes}} as well as anal prolegs with a pair of terminal hooks used to hold themselves to substrate, and also in that they lack a terminal filament. At the end of the abdomen is a pair of claw-like structures. Body color is black or dark brown.|$|R
50|$|Alderflies are megalopteran insects of {{the family}} Sialidae. They {{are closely related to}} the <b>dobsonflies</b> and fishflies {{as well as to the}} prehistoric Euchauliodidae. All living alderflies - about 66 species {{altogether}} - are part of the subfamily Sialinae, which contains between one and seven extant genera according to different scientists' views. But in most classifications, all or almost all of these are treated as subgenera of Sialis.|$|R
50|$|Predators of this {{damselfly}} include birds such as {{the great}} crested flycatcher, American robin, mallard, red-winged blackbird, and blue jay, reptiles and amphibians {{such as the}} eastern painted turtle, common snapping turtle, and southern leopard frog, fish such as the bluegill, largemouth bass, yellow perch, creek chub, channel catfish, common carp, and northern hogsucker, mammals such as the big brown bat, and insects such as the green darner, large diving beetles, eastern <b>dobsonfly,</b> and common water strider.|$|E
5000|$|Archichauliodes diversus is {{an insect}} in the {{subfamily}} Chauliodinae - the fishflies, {{though it is}} often referred to as [...] "The New Zealand Dobsonfly", despite not being a true <b>dobsonfly.</b> In its larval form It is commonly known by the name toe-biter, and its Maori name is puene. The species is native to New Zealand. Although there are many other species of fishfly in other parts of the world, Archichauliodes diversus is the only species of fishfly in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>dobsonfly</b> {{is a large}} insect up to 140 millimetres {{long with}} a {{wingspan}} of up to 125 millimetres. The female has short powerful mandibles of a similar size {{to those of the}} larva while the mandibles of the male are sickle-shaped and up to 40 millimetres long, half as long as the body. The antennae are long and segmented and the greyish translucent, many veined wings are often mottled with white dots. When at rest the wings are folded flat over the insect's back and extend beyond the abdomen.|$|E
50|$|Corydalus is a genus {{of large}} flying insects in the Corydalidae family, {{commonly}} known as <b>dobsonflies.</b> They are endemic to North, Central and South America and there are about 35 known species. Members of the genus have wing lengths of up to 85 millimetres. They are sexually dimorphic, with the males having large mandibles used to grasp the females during mating while the females have smaller jaws. The larvae are known as hellgrammites and are aquatic predators.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae of <b>dobsonflies</b> live {{along the}} rocky bottoms of streams. Chiefly active during the night, they ambush prey {{in the middle}} of riffles which supply plenty of oxygen and stir up prey. They are generalist predators; dissections have {{revealed}} that they primarily eat aquatic immatures of mayflies, caddisflies, stoneflies, and chironomid midges. Although the larvae spend most of their lives under rocks below water, locals along Virginia and Pennsylvania rivers have reported emergences, known as [...] "hellgrammite crawlings," [...] during thunderstorms.|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>dobsonflies</b> {{are some}} of the largest non-Lepidopteran insects of {{temperate}} zones such as the United States and Canada, with a wingspan of up to 180 mm in some species of Corydalus. A species in China has been reported with a wingspan of 21 cm. The wings vary from a grayish to translucent shade, depending on the species, and the anal region of the hindwing is wide and folded at rest. Despite the large wings, adults are weak, fluttery fliers. The body is soft and reaches up to 75 mm in length, and coloration varies from yellow to dark shades of brown.|$|R
50|$|They are {{sizeable}} Megaloptera, {{with a body}} usually {{larger than}} 25 mm (1 inch). They often have long filamentous antennae, though in male fishflies they are characteristically feathered. Ocelli are present; the fourth tarsal segment is cylinder-shaped. The four large wings are translucent, smoky grey, or mixed, and the anterior pair is slightly longer than the posterior one. The eastern <b>dobsonfly,</b> Corydalus cornutus, is the most well-known North American species among the dobsonflies. These genera have distinctive elongated mandibles in males and form the subfamily Corydalinae. The genera in which the males have normal mandibles, called fishflies, form the subfamily Chauliodinae. The summer fishfly, Chauliodes pectinicornis, is perhaps the best-known of these in North America; its immense mating swarms in the Upper Mississippi River region fill the air on a few summer nights each year much like mayflies in certain regions of Europe, leaving millions of carcasses to be cleaned up the next day.|$|E
5000|$|The order's {{name comes}} from Ancient Greek, from mega- (μέγα-) [...] "large" [...] + pteryx (πτέρυξ) [...] "wing", in {{reference}} to the large, clumsy wings of these insects. Megaloptera are relatively unknown insects across much of their range, due to the adults' short lives, the aquatic larvae's often-high tolerance of pollution (so they are not often encountered by swimmers etc.), and the generally crepuscular or nocturnal habits. However, in the Americas the dobsonflies are rather well-known, as their males have tusk-like mandibles. These, while formidable in appearance, are relatively harmless to humans and other animals; much like a peacock's feathers, they serve mainly to impress females. However, the mandibles are also used to hold females during mating, and some male dobsonflies spar with each other in courtship displays, trying to flip each other over with their long mandibles. <b>Dobsonfly</b> larvae, commonly called hellgrammites, are often used for angling bait in North America.|$|E
5000|$|Small {{colonies of}} the {{freshwater}} entoproct Urnatella gracilis {{have been found}} living on the aquatic larvae of the <b>dobsonfly</b> Corydalus cornutus. The ectoprocts gain a means of dispersal, protection from predators and possibly a source of water that is rich in oxygen and nutrients, as colonies often live next to the gills of the larval flies. In the White Sea, the non-colonial entoproct Loxosomella nordgaardi prefers to live attached to bryozoan (ectoproct) colonies, mainly {{on the edges of}} colonies or in the [...] "chimneys", gaps by which large bryozoan colonies expel water from which they have sieved food. Observation suggests that both the entoprocts and the bryozoans benefit from the association: each enhances the water flow that the other needs for feeding; and the longer cilia of the entoprocts may help them to capture different food from that caught by the bryozoans, so that the animals do not compete for the same food.|$|E
5000|$|The {{metamorphosis}} from larva {{to adult}} in <b>dobsonflies</b> {{is one of}} the simplest of the holometabolous orders, yet the life cycle begins with an intriguing ritualized courtship display (most of the following comes from Simonsen et al. 2008 [...] and all pertains to Corydalus; other courtship rituals remain unknown). Males compete with each other for females, aggressively fluttering the wings and trying to place their long mandibles underneath the body of the opponent in order to flip him into the air. Afterwards, the male approaches a female from the side and touches her with his antennae. At first the female reacts with somewhat aggressively, moving the {{head from side to side}} with mandibles wide apart. However, she then allows the male to come closer and place his mandibles over her wings in a perpendicular position, a position he holds until the female signals reception to mating.|$|R
25|$|These birds patrol open {{areas or}} scan for prey from a perch; {{they may also}} catch insects in flight. They take {{advantage}} of insects turned up by farm equipment or driven out by fire. A hunting Swainson's hawk will use several strategies. It hunts insects such as dragonflies or <b>dobsonflies</b> while in flight, flapping little as it rides a wind current and stoops upon a fly, grabbing it with its foot and immediately transferring the prey to its bill. It uses a similar strategy to grab individual free-tailed bats from flying streams of bats. Also, when dragonfly hordes are grounded by weather, Swainson's hawk will stand near groups sheltering from the wind and pluck at individual insects. Swainson's hawk closely follows both tractors and wild fires for injured or fleeing food. It will also run down insect prey on the ground. Occasionally a hawk will stand still on a dirt bank or elevated mound waiting for prey to appear. It commonly hunts from elevated perches such as telephone poles, stooping on prey when it is sighted.|$|R
40|$|Neuropterida {{comprise}} the holometabolan orders Neuroptera (lacewings, antlions and relatives), Megaloptera (alderflies, <b>dobsonflies)</b> and Raphidioptera (snakeflies) as a monophyletic group sister to Coleoptera (beetles). The higher-level phylogenetic relationships among these groups, {{as well as}} the family-level hierarchy of Neuroptera, have to date proved difficult to reconstruct. We used morphological data and multi-locus DNA sequence data to infer Neuropterida relationships. Nucleotide sequences were obtained for fragments of two nuclear genes (CAD, 18 S rDNA) and two mitochondrial genes (COI, 16 S rDNA) for 69 exemplars representing all recently recognized families of Neuropterida as well as outgroup exemplars from Coleoptera. The joint posterior probability of phylogeny and divergence times was estimated using a Bayesian relaxed-clock inference method to establish a temporal sequence of cladogenesis for the group over geological time. Megaloptera were found to be paraphyletic with respect to the rest of Neuropterida, calling into question the validity of the ordinal status for Megaloptera as presently defined. Ordinal relationships were weakly supported, and monophyly of Megaloptera was not recovered in any total-evidence analysis; Corydalidae were frequently recovered as sister to Raphidioptera. Only in relaxed-clock inferences were Raphidioptera and a paraphyletic Megaloptera recovered with strong support as a monophyletic group sister to Neuroptera. A monophyletic Neuroptera diverged from a common Raphidioptera + ‘Megaloptera’ ancestor during the Late Carboniferous. Contrary to some previous hypotheses, Coniopterygidae, not Nevrorthidae, were recovered as sister to the rest of Neuroptera, with Nevrorthidae recovered with Osmylidae and Sisyridae. The monophyly of the universally recognized Myrmeleontiformia was confirmed, with an origin in the mid-Triassic, but a monophyletic Hemerobiiformia was not recovered in any analysis. Dilaridae were not closely related to the clade comprising Mantispidae and Berothidae, and diverged earlier than proposed previously. The phylogenetic status and taxonomic composition of Polystoechotidae and Ithonidae are in need of re-evaluation, as Oliarces Carpenter (presently Ithonidae) was placed well within the present circumscription of Polystoechotida...|$|R
