5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all. Iodates {{are by far the}} most important of these compounds, which can be made by oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. <b>Iodic</b> <b>acid</b> is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E
5|$|Iodine oxides are {{the most}} stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds {{resulting}} from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, {{and they have been}} known for the longest time. The stable, white, hygroscopic iodine pentoxide (I2O5) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of <b>iodic</b> <b>acid</b> (HIO3), which it is the anhydride of. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, ethylene, and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride (S2O6F2) to form salts of the iodyl cation, +, and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving +. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, or chloryl fluoride, resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF3. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I4O9 and I2O4; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are IIII(IVO3)3 and +− respectively.|$|E

60|$|Many acids, {{though much}} diluted, are poisonous; and though, {{as will be}} shown in the eighth chapter, they cause the tentacles to bend, they do not excite true aggregation. Thus leaves were placed in a {{solution}} of one part of benzoic acid to 437 of water; and in 15 m. the purple fluid within the cells had shrunk a little from the walls, yet when carefully examined after 1 hr. 20 m., there was no true aggregation; and after 24 hrs. the leaf was evidently dead. Other leaves in <b>iodic</b> <b>acid,</b> diluted to the same degree, showed after 2 hrs. 15 m. the same shrunken appearance of the purple fluid within the cells; and these, after 6 hrs. 15 m., were seen under a high power {{to be filled with}} excessively minute spheres of dull reddish protoplasm, [page 51] which by the next morning, after 24 hrs., had almost disappeared, the leaf being evidently dead. Nor was there any true aggregation in leaves immersed in propionic acid of the same strength; but in this case the protoplasm was collected in irregular masses towards the bases of the lower cells of the tentacles.|$|E

Under some special conditions (very low pH and high concentration of chloride ion, e.g. in concentrated hydrochloric acid), <b>iodic</b> <b>acid</b> is reduced to iodine trichloride, a golden yellow compound in solution and no further reduction occurs.

There he worked on three major problems: (i) relation between the melting point and molecular weight, (ii) effect of crystallinity on the optical rotation and (iii) change in weight during chemical reactions. The negative result for the last experiments was regarded as an accurate experimental confirmation of the conservation laws of mass and energy.|$|E

40|$|Iodine oxide {{particles}} {{are known to}} nucleate in the marine boundary layer where gas phase molecular iodine and organoiodine species are produced by macroalgae. There has been some debate over the chemical identity of these particles. Hygroscopic measurements {{have been used to}} infer that they are composed of insoluble I 2 O 4 , while elemental analysis of laboratory generated particles suggests soluble I 2 O 5 or its hydrated form <b>iodic</b> <b>acid,</b> HIO 3 (I 2 O 5 · H 2 O). In this paper we explore the response of super-micron sized aqueous <b>iodic</b> <b>acid</b> solution droplets to varying humidity using both Raman microscopy and single particle electrodynamic traps. These measurements reveal that the propensity of an <b>iodic</b> <b>acid</b> solution droplet to crystallise is negligible on drying to ~ 0 % relative humidity (RH). On applying mechanical pressure to these droplets they shatter {{in a manner consistent with}} an ultra-viscous liquid or a brittle glass, but subsequent water uptake between 10 and 20 % RH causes their viscosity to reduce sufficiently that the cracked droplets flow and merge. The persistence of <b>iodic</b> <b>acid</b> solution in an amorphous state, rather than a crystalline state, suggests they will more readily accommodate other condensable material and are therefore more likely to grow to sizes where they may serve as cloud condensation nuclei. On increasing the humidity to ~ 90 % the mass of the droplets only increases by ~ 20 % with a corresponding increase in radius of only ~ 6 %, which is remarkably small for a highly soluble material. We suggest that the small growth factor of aqueous <b>iodic</b> <b>acid</b> solution droplets is consistent with the small aerosol growth factors observed in field experiments...|$|E
