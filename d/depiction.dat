5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a <b>depiction</b> of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from the <b>depiction</b> of the graphical <b>depiction</b> of the spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|E

The series has also been praised for its <b>depiction</b> of anxiety, and also raised a brief controversy concerning a similar figure skating-based title to be released in the United States in 2017.|$|E

Hrapp plunders a seated <b>depiction</b> of Þorgerðr; he takes a large gold ring from her plus the linen hood she is wearing. Next, Hrapp spots a <b>depiction</b> of Thor and Thor's wain. He takes a gold ring from the <b>depiction</b> of Thor too, and, thirdly, he takes a ring from a <b>depiction</b> of Irpa there. Hrapp takes all of the images from the temple, strips them of their items, and then burns the temple until leaving at dawn.|$|E

It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic <b>depiction</b> of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting.

5|$|The {{theme of}} {{swimming}} through flames {{is connected to}} the <b>depiction</b> of Guido Guinizelli, a poet who influenced Dante, seeking such a state in Purgatorio XXVI. However, the <b>depiction</b> of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing, an act that appears throughout Yeats's poetry, within purgatorial flames. The critic Dominic Manganiello suggests that, in combining the image of dancing with purgation, Eliot merges Dante's and Yeats's poetic themes.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 117 - 123. Introduction [...] Chapter One. Methodologies {{and sources}} [...] Chapter Two. The {{boundaries}} of magical iconography [...] Chapter Three. The {{functions of the}} figural <b>depictions</b> in the belief and practice of Graeco-Egyptian magic [...] Conclusion. The aim of this thesis is {{to demonstrate that the}} figural <b>depictions</b> in the magical papyri formed part of a conceptualised system of magical imagery. Rather than being haphazard sketches, it will be argued that the figural <b>depictions</b> were meaningful images, whose execution and use in rites and spells reflect considered ritualistic actions. Using PGM XXXVI as a case study, it will be established that the <b>depictions</b> were governed by a strict set of iconographic regulations. Specific terminology, uniform compositional placement, a desire to execute the <b>depictions</b> accurately, as well as recurring pictorial motifs, suggest that the images existed within a pre-established iconographic system. In addition, the <b>depictions</b> appear to have retained specific functions within the magical papyri. These functions were accordingly fluid and changed relative to the context of the depictions' use (whether in applied magic or magical handbooks). As such, the <b>depictions</b> were utilised as part of the materiality of magic praxis. Finally, it will be demonstrated that the figural <b>depictions</b> were considered significant in the belief and practice of Graeco-Egyptian magic. This is indicated by the images' complex relationship with magical practitioners, wherein they enacted as intermediaries between the mundane and supernatural worlds. Moreover, the ritual act of drawing the <b>depictions</b> in magical praxis suggests that they were fundamental elements in the enactment of particular rites and spells.

5000|$|Some early Christian authors opposed {{representational}} art, and {{statues and}} portraits and sculptures are crude and stylised. According to Robin Lane Fox: [...] "Only {{one group of}} early Christians, the heretical Carpocratians, {{are known to have}} owned portraits of Christ". However, early Christian art from the early third century depicting Jesus is widespread and cannot be limited only to the Carpocratians. Furthermore, the fact that <b>depictions</b> of Jesus are mentioned by multiple early Christian authors, whether in a positive or negative manner, is an indication that these <b>depictions</b> were popular enough to be noticed and must have received the acceptance of some Christian authorities. Moreover, early Christianity was heavily influenced by Judaism, which generally forbids religious <b>depictions,</b> and the reluctance of some authors to accept <b>depictions</b> of Jesus could be ascribed to Jewish influences rather than to Christian doctrine. Lastly, <b>depictions</b> of Jesus and obvious Christian <b>depictions</b> in general were risky and discouraged given the fact that Christians were being persecuted by the Roman authorities; early Christians from the second century used the Ichtys, a fish symbol, to refer to Jesus indirectly; if early Christians did not approve of <b>depictions</b> of Jesus, would they have associated Jesus with the image of a fish? ...|$|R
