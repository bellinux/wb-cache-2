5|$|The first Tintin {{postage stamp}} was an eight-franc stamp issued by Belgian Post for the 50th {{anniversary of the}} {{publication}} of Tintin's first adventure on 29 September 1979, featuring Tintin and Snowy looking through a magnifying <b>glass</b> <b>at</b> several stamps.|$|E
5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to <b>glass</b> <b>at</b> all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E
5|$|Kotarou invites {{three other}} girls into the occult {{research}} society {{who are also}} heroines in the game. One is Kotori Kanbe, Kotarou's childhood friend in his class who has few friends and starts attending school regularly after joining the club. She has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth, which is actually a familiar created by Kotori {{from the body of}} her dead pet dog Pero. However, she is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars. Another heroine is first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips. She has heterochromia, though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as she is very self-conscious about it; her left eye is blue. Sizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia. Sizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, another heroine and the class representative of Kotarou's class. Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her. She is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves. Like Sizuru, Lucia is a member of Guardian and has the ability to produces poisonous miasma and pus {{as a result of an}} experiment by Guardian, which she takes medication for to suppress. She can also create vibrations within the objects she touches and break <b>glass</b> <b>at</b> a distance. Both Lucia and Sizuru have superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes in addition to their other abilities.|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of intracellular glass may help protect embryos from damage due to desiccation. Soluble sugars {{similar to those}} found in desiccation tolerant embryos were studied with differential scanning calorimetry. Those sugars from desiccation tolerant embryos can form <b>glasses</b> <b>at</b> ambient temperatures, whereas those from embryos that do not tolerate desiccation only form <b>glasses</b> <b>at</b> subzero temperatures. It is concluded that tolerant embryo cells probably contain sugar <b>glasses</b> <b>at</b> storage temperatures and water contents, but intolerant embryo cells probably do not...|$|R

5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often {{directly}} inspired by the Sex Pistols. In London, women were {{near the center of}} the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors. Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, Wire, The Stranglers, the Subversives, the aptly named London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's big three and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a <b>glass</b> <b>at</b> the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.|$|E

25|$|The {{museum is}} located at the {{northeast}} corner of 165th Street and the Grand Concourse in the Concourse neighborhood of the South Bronx, slightly northeast of Yankee Stadium. The building was originally the Young Israel Synagogue, or Young Israel of the Concourse, constructed from 1959 to 1961 and designed by Ukrainian-born Simon B. Zelnick. The building was converted into a museum space in the early 1980s using concrete, steel and <b>glass,</b> <b>at</b> the cost of $2 million.|$|E

25|$|The first {{sales were}} at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886. It was {{initially}} {{sold as a}} patent medicine for five cents a <b>glass</b> <b>at</b> soda fountains, which were popular in the United States at the time due {{to the belief that}} carbonated water was good for the health. Pemberton claimed Coca-Cola cured many diseases, including morphine addiction, indigestion, nerve disorders, headaches, and impotence. Pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on May 29 of the same year in the Atlanta Journal.|$|E
25|$|In archaeological surveys {{performed}} between 1995 and 2001 {{from the}} lower levels of occupation (600-1000 AD), 2800 beads were collected from the site with the vast majority being of the Zhizo tradition and the discovery of a new typology, named the Chibuene series. The Zhizo beads were made of plant-ash glass which suggests a Near Eastern origin, as only sites west of the Euphrates utilized plant-ash <b>glass</b> <b>at</b> this time, but the beads were manufactured with South Asian technology, making the place of manufacture difficult to ascertain.|$|E
25|$|A {{catastrophic failure}} is one which {{suddenly}} makes the vacuum tube unusable. A {{crack in the}} glass envelope will allow air into the tube and destroy it. Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent pins or impacts; tube sockets must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the <b>glass</b> <b>at</b> the pins. Stress may accumulate if a metal shield or other object presses on the tube envelope and causes differential heating of the glass. Glass may also be damaged by high-voltage arcing.|$|E

No officers were hit. Soon afterward, Auvinen walked into the corridor next to the canteen and shot himself in the head, ending the shooting.|$|E
25|$|The Seder {{table is}} {{traditionally}} set with the finest place settings and silverware, {{and family members}} {{come to the table}} dressed in their holiday clothes. There is a tradition for the person leading the Seder to wear a white robe called a kittel. For {{the first half of the}} Seder, each participant will only need a plate and a wine <b>glass.</b> <b>At</b> the head of the table is a Seder plate containing various symbolic foods that will be eaten or pointed out during the course of the Seder. Placed nearby is a plate with three matzot and dishes of salt water for dipping.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{since the}} {{limiting}} resolution is usually {{defined as the}} point at which the MTF is three percent or less, this would also be the maximum resolution of the tube. The MTF is affected by every part of an image intensifier tube's operation and on a complete system is also affected by the quality of the optics involved. Factors that affect the MTF include transition through any fiber plate or <b>glass,</b> <b>at</b> the screen and the photocathode and also through the tube and the microchannel plate itself. The higher the MTF at a given resolution, the better.|$|E

25|$|The Norman conquest {{introduced}} northern French artistic styles, {{particular in}} illuminated manuscripts and murals, {{and reduced the}} demand for carvings.

Stained glass had been introduced into Anglo-Saxon England.
