The farmers used every means they could, including bait, nets, and even sledgehammers, to catch enough to make sure their families <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> eat whatever the outcome of their harvests. By the 1840s the Esopus's trout fishery was beginning to attract anglers from outside the region. Many stayed at Milo Barber's Inn in Shandaken.|$|E
500|$|After {{departing from}} Suzhou and {{continuing}} up the Grand Canal, Choe's party reached the Lüliang Rapids on April 13, which interrupted canal {{traffic in the}} northern part of South Zhili. He wrote that a teams of ten oxen were used to pull their boats through the rapids, while teams of 100 men were used at the next stage of river rapids, the Xuzhou Rapids. He noted the pound locks here that controlled water levels in sections of the canal for safe passage of ships. He described the bustling cities of Linqing and Dezhou in the northern province of Shandong, although he stated that the merchant activity and sizes of these two cities did not match the grandeur of Hangzhou and Suzhou in the south. In fact, Choe remarked that only these two and a handful of other cities in northern China matched the prosperity of southern China, stating that the north was quite poverty-stricken and underdeveloped compared with the south. He also believed that southern Chinese displayed a finer degree of cultivation, social order, literacy, and industriousness than those from the north. Choe wrote that while people of the south were well-dressed and <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> spare, people in the north often lacked supplies of everything and feared bandits.

2500|$|Throughout his riverboat experience, Armstrong's musicianship {{began to}} mature and expand. At twenty, {{he could read}} music and started to be {{featured}} in extended trumpet solos, {{one of the first}} jazz men to do this, injecting his own personality and style into his solo turns. He had learned how to create a unique sound and also started using singing and patter in his performances. In 1922, Armstrong joined the exodus to Chicago, where he had been invited by his mentor, Joe [...] "King" [...] Oliver, to join his Creole Jazz Band and where he could make a sufficient income so that he no longer needed to supplement his music with day labor jobs. It was a boom time in Chicago and though race relations were poor, the city was teeming with jobs available for black people, who were making good wages in factories and <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> spend on entertainment.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{not being}} {{named to the}} Supreme Court, Judge Allen <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> occupy her time. [...] On the Circuit Court, Sixth Circuit, she heard cases from Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee. [...] In 1940, she wrote This Constitution of Ours. Even after World War II broke out, Allen {{remained}} steadfast in her determination to work for peace. [...] She continued speaking and gave talks both in person and on radio. In 1944, the National Association of Women lawyers put her name forth as someone who {{should be involved in}} international peace negotiations. When the war ended, she continued to speak to civic groups, especially women's clubs. Her message was that relying on the United Nations would not prevent the next war. [...] It was essential for individual citizens to keep demanding that each country—whether large or small—have respect for the rule of law. [...] "To secure peace, there must be justice," [...] she told 3,000 attendees at a conference of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. [...] "There cannot be justice unless there is a rebirth of moral principle among the nations. [...] There cannot be a rebirth of moral principle unless the conscience of the peoples becomes articulate." [...] Allen herself remained a very articulate spokeswoman on the issues she cared about. [...] She was regarded as such a credible figure that in 1947, the American Academy of Political and Social Science asked her to do a study of women's voting patterns, to offer her assessment of whether women were in fact using the franchise, and whether they were active in the political process. [...] In later talks, Allen expressed the opinion that while many women were in fact voting and speaking out on issues, there was a generational shift taking place. [...] The dynamic women leaders who had fought for suffrage and brought about greater participation for women in other areas of public life were now deceased, and they had not yet been replaced. [...] She expressed concern about this lack of new and dynamic leadership, and hoped new leaders would emerge.|$|E
