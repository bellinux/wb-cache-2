5|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army, needing transports to get its men and materiel to France, had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping. The committee selected El Occidente and thirteen other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their s for transatlantic crossings, and, most importantly, were in port or not <b>far</b> <b>at</b> sea. After El Occidente discharged her last load of passengers and cargo, she was officially {{handed over to the}} Army on 30 May.|$|E

5|$|Olds, whose B-17s were {{deployed}} to Olmsted Field in Harrisburg, {{was given the}} assignment of locating the Rex as <b>far</b> <b>at</b> sea as possible, and assigned Major Vincent J. Meloy, the commanding officer of the 20th Bomb Squadron, to act as nominal head of the Black Force. Olds selected three aircraft from the 49th Bomb Squadron for the mission.

5|$|Scores {{of three}} not out, 28, 27, 35 and four {{followed}} before his next significant score, 52, against Queensland on 12 February 1937. He ended {{the season with}} 336runs, one century, and an average of 30.54. He then suffered his worst period of form thus <b>far</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of the}} 193738 season, failing to reach double figures from 17 December 1937 until early January 1938, when he scored 64 in the second innings, against Victoria. He followed this with 49 against New South Wales, and ended his third season with 283runs at an average of 21.76. He did not play another cricket match until 16 December 1938 {{at the start of the}} next season, however he returned with a score of 90 against New South Wales, and followed that up two matches later with 84 against Victoria. He narrowly missed out on his third century in November 1939 when he was caught by Morris Sievers for 99 against Victoria. He scored 41, 12, 6 and 20 to see out the rest of the year, ending with 239runs at an average of 47.80, his most successful full season thus far.|$|E
5|$|The final {{practice}} session occurred in sunny weather conditions. Timo Bernhard set the fastest timed lap {{of the weekend}} so <b>far</b> <b>at</b> one minute and 56.456 seconds in the No. 1 Porsche, 1.6 seconds faster than the second quickest car driven by team-mate Jani. Loïc Duval made contact with Christian Ried's No. 78 Proton Porsche 911 RSR driving into the Bus Stop chicane in the session's halfway period, damaging his vehicle's front-left quarter, but managed {{to return to his}} garage where it remained until the end of practice for repairs to its bodywork. René Rast was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 26 G-Drive Oreca with a time of two minutes and 7.341 seconds, four-tenths of a second quicker than Nelson Panciatici's No. 35 Signatech Alpine Oreca. Gianmaria Bruni recorded the quickest LMGTE Pro time ahead of AF Corse team-mate Davide Rigon while Paolo Ruberti, driving the No. 50 Larbre Competition Chevrolet, was the fastest driver in LMGTE Am.|$|E

5|$|The final {{practice}} {{was held on}} a dry race track which allowed for faster lap times. Lotterer set the quickest time of the weekend so <b>far</b> <b>at</b> 1:57.368 recorded in the session's final minute, and was 0.011 seconds faster than the second-fastest car of Hülkenberg. Jani was a further five-tenths of a second behind in third place, and was narrowly faster than teammate Hartley in fourth. Sam Bird was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 26 G-Drive Racing car {{with a time of}} 2:08.415, four-tenths ahead of Matthew Howson's KCMG Oreca. Toni Vilander recorded the quickest LMGTE Pro time ahead of Fernando Rees in the No. 97 Aston Martin, while Pedro Lamy, driving the British marque's No. 98 car, was the fastest driver in LMGTE Am. A brief full course yellow flag was displayed when Bachler's back-end collided with the Pouhon corner tyre barrier, while Turner avoided going into the Les Combes wall and was temporarily beached in the turn's gravel trap. Both drivers returned to the track and continued.|$|E
5|$|Transformation, unlike {{transduction}} or conjugation, {{depends on}} numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process. In {{order for a}} bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence). In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required {{for the development of}} competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus <b>far</b> <b>at</b> least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{shape of}} the JT-split APES has specific consequences for the nuclear dynamics, here considered in the fully quantum sense.

25|$|After 1636, however, Olivares {{halted the}} advance, fearful of {{provoking}} another crown bankruptcy. The hesitation in pressing home the advantage proved fateful: French forces regrouped {{and pushed the}} Spanish back towards the border. The Spanish army would never again penetrate so <b>far.</b> <b>At</b> the Battle of the Downs in 1639 a Spanish fleet carrying troops was destroyed by the Dutch navy, and the Spanish found themselves unable to supply and reinforce their forces adequately in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Other Kalapuyan tribes {{occupied}} {{villages that}} are also now within Eugene city limits. Pee-you or Mohawk Calapooians, Winefelly or Pleasant Hill Calapooians, and the Lungtum or Long Tom.
