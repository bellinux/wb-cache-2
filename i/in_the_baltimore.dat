5|$|The 6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia was a peacetime {{infantry}} regiment {{that was}} activated for federal {{service in the}} Union army for three separate terms during the American Civil War.

5|$|A MD 30 bypass of Hampstead {{has been}} {{contemplated}} since the 1940s and planned {{since at least}} 1960. The heavy traffic along the highway consisted of three types of highway users: local traffic made up {{of people who had}} moved to Hampstead or Manchester for the municipalities' small-town charm; regional traffic comprising people who had moved to Pennsylvania for cheaper housing and lower taxes but continued to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltimore</b> area; and truck traffic serving local industry and making connections between Baltimore and Hanover. The increase in congestion on MD 30 accelerated with the completion of I-795 in 1987. By the early 1990s, it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of the towns during rush hour; an average of 20,000 to 25,000 motorists used the highway through Hampstead each day by 2001. Progress toward construction of the bypass was continually delayed. The bypass was removed from MDSHA plans by 1979. The Hampstead Bypass had returned to state plans by 1990, when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992. However, in 1991, the bypass was shelved for six years for lack of funding.|$|E

5|$|Netflix {{had ordered}} two seasons of 13 episodes when {{it made its}} {{original}} commitment to the series in 2011. According to Governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley, production of the first season brought $140 million {{in the form of}} 2,200 jobs and transactions with 1,800 vendors to the Baltimore metropolitan area economy and the Maryland General Assembly expanded its Film Production Tax Credit so that season two could have similar impact over the course of 150 days of filming. Like the first season, the second season was largely filmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltimore</b> area. Although production was publicized as being in Baltimore, Season 1 had based production in Harford County, Maryland, and season 2 also had its production office in Edgewood and a Joppa sound stage. The April 27, 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner spoofed House of Cards from the Maryland set prior {{to the beginning of the}} filming of season 2. Filming began on Monday April 29, 2013, which was just a few weeks later in the year than season 1 had started. On May 14, O'Malley visited the set to publicize the success of the tax incentives.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was again}} activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven {{of the ten}} original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was {{necessary in order to}} fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was different than the 90-day term. To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term. Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltimore</b> Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at Camp Henry Wilson in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship Plymouth Rock. Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city.|$|E
