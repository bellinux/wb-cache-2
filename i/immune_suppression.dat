5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from <b>immune</b> <b>suppression.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). <b>Immune</b> <b>suppression</b> tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} possible mechanisms underlying <b>immune</b> complex <b>suppression</b> {{of resistance to}} Listeria monocytogenes. Inhibition of resistance was found when immune complexes were formed in vivo in immune mice or in nonimmune mice adoptively transferred with specific antibody. Suppression was also found when nonimmune mice were injected with immune complexes preformed in vitro. We investigated the role of complement by decomplementing mice with cobra venom factor purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Complete depletion of serum C 3 did not eliminate <b>immune</b> complex <b>suppression</b> of resistance to L. monocytogenes, suggesting that complement activation is not required for <b>immune</b> complex <b>suppression.</b> Infection-induced changes in the surface phenotype and functional properties of macrophages from normal and immune complex-suppressed mice were also investigated. Macrophage expression of both H- 2 K and Ia molecules increased during the response of normal mice to L. monocytogenes. However, these changes were not found in immune complex-suppressed mice. In contrast, membrane interleukin 1 expression was increased in macrophages from suppressed mice compared with macrophages from normal mice. Macrophages from L. monocytogenes-infected normal and immune complex-suppressed mice expressed cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro. We conclude that immune complexes do not inhibit resistance to L. monocytogenes by activation of complement or decreasing macrophage cytotoxic activity. Rather, defects in Ia expression by macrophages from suppressed mice might be one component responsible for <b>immune</b> complex <b>suppression</b> of resistance to L. monocytogenes...|$|R

50|$|The acute form of {{the disease}} is {{manifested}} by lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea. Due to the severe <b>immune</b> system <b>suppression,</b> multiple secondary infections develop, causing death within two to four weeks.

30|$|Cortisol is a {{glucocorticoid}} class {{hormone that}} is secreted by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal glands [1]. Its involvement in many physiological functions, such as amino acid and fat mobilization for metabolism, electrolyte balance, anti-inflammatory effects, and <b>immune</b> system <b>suppression,</b> {{makes it a}} useful biomarker for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics and health monitoring [2]. In addition to these functions, cortisol’s role in human cognitive behavior, such as working memory, sleep patterns, and mood, further demonstrates the complex functions of the hormone [1].|$|R
50|$|Pur-alpha {{participates in}} {{development}} of {{progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy}} (PML), a loss of the nerve sheath formed by oligodendroglial cells. Although HIV-1 is not usually found in these glial cells, HIV-1 proteins can pass through cell membranes to enter them. JCV is considered the causative agent of PML. JCV is activated in the glial cells by certain states of <b>immune</b> system <b>suppression,</b> including HIV-1 infection. There is a documented interaction between Pur-alpha, the HIV-1 protein, Tat, and a Pur-alpha-binding regulatory sequence in JCV DNA. Pur-alpha acts by altering both replication and gene expression of JCV.|$|R
25|$|Normally, a {{low level}} of these glycoproteins is {{detected}} in the maternal serum during the early stages of pregnancy. It appears that the effects of these eu-FEDS associated glycoproteins are manifested only during implantation and the very early development of the embryo. In humans, the expression of such glycoproteins greatly decreases {{toward the end of the}} first trimester. Therefore, more highly targeted mechanisms of <b>immune</b> <b>suppression</b> (such as the expression of the enzyme indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO)) are likely employed by the fetus during the subsequent stages of development. One potential reason for early inactivation of the system is that the immunosuppressive effect of these glycoproteins may be so complete that their continued leakage into the circulatory system could lead to a global suppression of the maternal immune response, compromising the mother's ability to carry the fetus to term.|$|E
25|$|Thyroid {{transplantation}} {{became the}} model for a whole new therapeutic strategy: organ transplantation. After {{the example of the}} thyroid, other organs were transplanted in the decades around 1900. Some of these transplants were done in animals for purposes of research, where organ removal and transplantation became a successful strategy of investigating the function of organs. Kocher was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1909 for the discovery of the function of the thyroid gland. At the same time, organs were also transplanted for treating diseases in humans. The thyroid gland became {{the model for}} transplants of adrenal and parathyroid glands, pancreas, ovary, testicles and kidney. By 1900, the idea that one can successfully treat internal diseases by replacing a failed organ through transplantation had been generally accepted. Pioneering work in the surgical technique of transplantation was made in the early 1900s by the French surgeon Alexis Carrel, with Charles Guthrie, with the transplantation of arteries or veins. Their skillful anastomosis operations and the new suturing techniques laid the groundwork for later transplant surgery and won Carrel the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. From 1902, Carrel performed transplant experiments on dogs. Surgically successful in moving kidneys, hearts, and spleens, {{he was one of the}} first to identify the problem of rejection, which remained insurmountable for decades. The discovery of transplant immunity by the German surgeon Georg Schöne, various strategies of matching donor and recipient, and the use of different agents for <b>immune</b> <b>suppression</b> did not result in substantial improvement so that organ transplantation was largely abandoned after WWI.|$|E
500|$|A {{conference of}} public health {{officials}} including representatives of the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization was held in Bangui in October 1985. The conference evolved a diagnostic definition of AIDS which {{came to be known}} as the Bangui definition for AIDS. The conference defined symptoms of AIDS in Africa as [...] "prolonged fever for a month or more, weight loss of over 10% and prolonged diarrhea". The Bangui definition proved problematic as <b>immune</b> <b>suppression</b> can also be caused by malnutrition.|$|E
50|$|Mammals are {{affected}} by oil spills {{in many of the}} same ways birds are, including organ damage, <b>immune</b> system <b>suppression,</b> skin irritation, and behavioral changes. Oil toxicity generally affects terrestrial mammals that feed on other affected animals that are directly exposed to oil. This includes scavengers, such as raccoons and skunks. Oil toxicity affects a variety of marine mammals, including sea otters (Enhydra lutris), whales (Order: Cetacea), dolphins (Suborder: Odontoceti), seals (Clade: Pinnipedia), and manatees (Trichechus spp.). Sea otters are among the most susceptible of marine mammals, because the oil interrupts their ability to trap air within their fur for insulation.|$|R
