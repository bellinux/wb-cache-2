25|$|Many {{hearing aids}} now have both an {{omnidirectional}} and a <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> mode. This {{is because the}} wearer may not need or desire the noise-reducing properties of the <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> in a given situation. Typically, the omnidirectional microphone mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas the <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant). The microphone mode is typically selected manually by the wearer. Some hearing aids automatically switch the microphone mode.|$|E
25|$|Most older {{hearing aids}} have only an {{omnidirectional}} microphone. An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating {{from the direction}} the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives {{from the direction of}} steering and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> provides a better signal to noise ratio. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones {{have been found to be}} the second best method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).|$|E
25|$|These 'hearing glasses' {{incorporate}} a <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> capability: four microphones {{on each side}} of the frame effectively work as two directional microphones, which are able to discern between sound coming from the front and sound coming from the sides or back of the user. This improves the signal-to-noise ratio by allowing for amplification of the sound coming from the front, the direction in which the user is looking, and active noise control for sounds coming from the sides or behind.|$|E

50|$|<b>Directional</b> <b>microphones</b> {{are used}} in live sound to {{maximize}} GBF. <b>Directional</b> <b>microphones</b> with cardioid and hypercardioid pickup patterns are designed with reduced sensitivity to the rear (cardioid) or to an angle between the side and the rear (hypercardioid). Such microphones are aimed such that their pickup pattern is weakest {{in the direction of}} the loudspeakers. This is especially useful in the presence of foldback monitors (stage wedges). Directional loudspeaker systems may also be used to increase GBF.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Although <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> on {{a hearing}} aid provide a {{signal-to-noise}} ratio benefit in a noisy background, the amount of benefit is dependent on how close the signal of interest is {{to the front of}} the user. It is assumed that when the signal of interest is off-axis, users can reorient themselves to the signal to make use of the <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> to improve signal-to-noise ratio. The present study tested this assumption by measuring the head-orienting behavior of bilaterally fit hearing-impaired individuals with their microphones set to omnidirectional and directional modes. The authors hypothesized that listeners using <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> would have greater difficulty in rapidly and accurately orienting to off-axis signals than they would when using omnidirectional microphones. Design: The authors instructed hearing-impaired individuals to turn and face a female talker in simultaneous surrounding male-talker babble. Participants pressed a button when they felt they were accurately oriented in the direction of the female talker. Participants completed three blocks of trials with their hearing aids in omnidirectional mode and three blocks in directional mode, with mode order randomized. Using a Vicon motion tracking system, the authors measured head position and computed fixation error, fixation latency, trajectory complexity, and proportion of misorientations. Results: Results showed that for larger off-axis target angles, listeners using <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> took longer to reach their targets than they did when using omnidirectional microphones, although they were just as accurate. They also used more complex movements and frequently made initial turns in the wrong direction. For smaller off-axis target angles, this pattern was reversed, and listeners using <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> oriented more quickly and smoothly to the targets than when using omnidirectional microphones. Conclusions: The authors argue that an increase in movement complexity indicates a switch from a simple orienting movement to a search behavior. For the most off-axis target angles, listeners using <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> appear to not know which direction to turn, so they pick a direction at random and simply rotate their heads until the signal becomes more audible. The changes in fixation latency and head orientation trajectories suggest that the decrease in off-axis audibility is a primary concern in the use of <b>directional</b> <b>microphones,</b> and listeners could experience a loss of initial target speech while turning toward a new signal of interest. If hearing-aid users are to receive maximum directional benefit in noisy environments, both adaptive directionality in hearing aids and clinical advice on using <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> should take head movement and orientation behavior into account...|$|R
25|$|Mini in canal (MIC) or {{completely}} in canal (CIC) aids {{are generally not}} visible unless the viewer looks directly into the wearer's ear. These aids are intended for mild to moderately severe losses. CICs are usually not recommended for people with good low-frequency hearing, as the occlusion effect is much more noticeable. Completely-in-the-canal hearing aids fit tightly deep in the ear. It barely visible. Being small, it {{will not have a}} <b>directional</b> <b>microphone,</b> and its small batteries will have a short life, and the batteries and controls may be difficult to manage. Its position in the ear prevents wind noise and makes it easier to use phones without feedback. In-the-canal hearing aids are placed deep in the ear canal. They are barely visible. Larger versions of these can have directional microphones. Being in the canal, {{they are less likely to}} cause a plugged feeling. These models are easier to manipulate than the smaller completely in-the-canal models but still have the drawbacks of being rather small.|$|E
2500|$|Lecture {{halls and}} conference rooms pose the {{challenge}} of reproducing speech clearly to a large hall, which may have reflective, echo-producing surfaces. One issue with reproducing speech is that the microphone used {{to pick up the}} sound of an individual's voice may also pick up unwanted sounds, such as the rustling of papers on a podium. A more tightly <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> may help to reduce unwanted background noises.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} for effectively using a microphone in less-than-ideal acoustic spaces, which often suffer from excessive reflections from {{one or more of the}} surfaces (boundaries) that make up the space. If the microphone is placed in, or very close to, one of these boundaries, the reflections from that surface have the same timing as the direct sound, thus giving the microphone a hemispherical polar pattern and improved intelligibility. Initially this was done by placing an ordinary microphone adjacent to the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam. Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Wickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to and facing the boundary. While the patent has expired, [...] "Pressure Zone Microphone" [...] and [...] "PZM" [...] are still active trademarks of Crown International, and the generic term [...] "boundary microphone" [...] is preferred. While a boundary microphone was initially implemented using an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to mount a <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> close enough to the surface to gain some of the benefits of this technique while retaining the directional properties of the element. Crown's trademark on this approach is [...] "Phase Coherent Cardioid" [...] or [...] "PCC," [...] but there are other makers who employ this technique as well.|$|E

Coincident placement give a wider stereo image than spaced pairs, and some engineers prefer it for this reason.|$|R

50|$|To {{explain how}} the {{proximity}} effect arises in directional microphones, {{it is first necessary}} to briefly describe how a <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> works. A microphone is constructed with a diaphragm whose mechanical movement is converted to electrical signals (via a magnetic coil, for example). The movement of the diaphragm {{is a function of the}} air pressure difference across the diaphragm arising from incident sound waves. In a <b>directional</b> <b>microphone,</b> sound reflected from surfaces behind the diaphragm is permitted to impinge on the rear side of the diaphragm. Since the sound reaching the rear of the diaphragm travels slightly farther than the sound at the front, it is slightly out of phase. The greater this phase difference, the greater the pressure difference and the greater the diaphragm movement. As the sound source moves off the diaphragm axis, this phase difference decreases due to decreasing path length difference. This is what gives a <b>directional</b> <b>microphone</b> its directivity.|$|E
2500|$|Adaptive <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> {{automatically}} {{vary the}} direction of maximum amplification or rejection (to reduce an interfering directional sound source). The direction of amplification or rejection is varied by the hearing aid processor. The processor attempts to provide maximum amplification in {{the direction of}} the desired speech signal source or rejection {{in the direction of}} the interfering signal source. Unless the user manually temporarily switches to a [...] "restaurant program, forward only mode" [...] adaptive <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> frequently amplify the speech of other talkers in a cocktail party type environments, such as restaurants or coffee shops. The presence of multiple speech signals makes it difficult for the processor to correctly select the desired speech signal. Another disadvantage is that some noises often contain characteristics similar to speech, making it difficult for the hearing aid processor to distinguish the speech from the noise. Despite the disadvantages, adaptive <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> can provide improved speech recognition in noise ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} in spatial sound recording and processing model the sound scene as a sum of directional and diffuse sound components. The power ratio between both components, i. e., the signal-to-diffuse ratio (SDR), represents an important measure for algorithms which aim at performing robustly in reverberant environments. This contribution discusses the SDR estimation from the spatial coherence between two arbitrary first-order <b>directional</b> <b>microphones.</b> First, the spatial coherence is expressed as {{function of the}} SDR. For most microphone setups, the spatial coherence is a complex function where both the absolute value and phase contain relevant information on the SDR. Secondly, the SDR estimator {{is derived from the}} spatial coherence function. The estimator is discussed for different practical microphone setups including coincident setups of arbitrary first-order <b>directional</b> <b>microphones</b> and spaced setups of identical first-order <b>directional</b> <b>microphones.</b> An unbiased SDR estimation requires noiseless coherence estimates as well as information on the direction-of-arrival of the directional sound, which usually has to be estimated. Nevertheless, measurement results verify that the proposed estimator is applicable in practice and provides accurate results...|$|R

40|$|The signal-to-diffuse ratio (SDR), which {{describes}} the power ratio between {{the direct and}} diffuse component of a sound field, is an important parameter in many applications. This paper proposes a power-based SDR estimator which considers the auto power spectral densities obtained by noisy <b>directional</b> <b>microphones.</b> Compared to recently proposed estimators that exploit the spatial coherence between two microphones, the power-based estimator is more robust at lower frequencies given that the microphone directivities are known with sufficiently high accuracy. The proposed estimator can incorporate more than two microphones and can therefore provide accurate SDR estimates independently of the direction-of-arrival of the direct sound. We further propose a method to determine the optimal microphone orientations for a given set of <b>directional</b> <b>microphones.</b> Simulations show the practical applicability...|$|R
