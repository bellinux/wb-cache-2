In {{an effort to}} enable these modes of resource pooling while minimizing negative impact on collaborating providers, we developed a transport-layer approach that would enable IoT nodes to opportunistically scavenge for idle bandwidth across multiple paths. Our approach combines multipath techniques with less-than-best effort (LBE) congestion control methods. Initial tests using the TCP-LP and LEDBAT LBE algorithms on scavenging secondary flows show that this desired functionality can be achieved.
