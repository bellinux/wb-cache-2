5|$|Rauws and Tytgat {{describe}} cure of {{duodenal ulcer}} by <b>eradication</b> of H. pylori using Borody's triple therapy combination. Triple-therapy, modernized to a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics, soon becomes first line therapy for <b>eradication.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Malaria <b>Eradication</b> Research Agenda (malERA) {{initiative}} was a consultative process {{to identify which}} areas {{of research and development}} (R) needed to be addressed for the worldwide <b>eradication</b> of malaria.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the World Health Organization (WHO) {{launched}} an antimalarial program {{in parts of}} Liberia as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria <b>eradication</b> in tropical Africa. However, these projects encountered difficulties that foreshadowed the general retreat from malaria <b>eradication</b> efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>eradication</b> {{milestones}} {{have already been}} reached, and several {{regions of the world}} have been certified polio-free.|$|E

5|$|Surviving paralytic polio {{can be a}} life-changing experience. Individuals may be {{permanently}} physically disabled to varying degrees. Others remember the fear and isolation. Some continue to campaign for polio <b>eradication</b> or disability rights.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease <b>eradication,</b> is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the <b>eradication</b> of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic. The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E
5|$|The first hemisphere-wide {{effort to}} {{eradicate}} smallpox {{was made in}} 1950 by the Pan American Health Organization. The campaign was successful in eliminating smallpox from all American countries except Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. In 1958 Professor Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox. The proposal (Resolution WHA11.54) was accepted in 1959. At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year. Overall, however, the progress towards <b>eradication</b> was disappointing, especially in Africa and in the Indian subcontinent. In 1966 an international team, the Smallpox <b>Eradication</b> Unit, was formed {{under the leadership of}} an American, Donald Henderson. In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox <b>eradication</b> by contributing $2.4 million annually to the effort, and adopted the new disease surveillance method promoted by Czech epidemiologist Karel Raška.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no known}} {{effective}} control measures for invasive Caprellamutica populations as of 2012. It {{has been suggested}} that the seasonal population fluctuations may be taken advantage of. <b>Eradication</b> efforts done during the winter months when C.mutica populations are dormant and at their lowest numbers, are potentially more effective in preventing their recovery during the summer months. Because of the great difficulty in detecting and removing them, however, control methods will likely focus on preserving native species populations rather than the <b>eradication</b> of established C. mutica.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is endemic, {{the species is}} {{considered}} not threatened, but in Western Australia, the twenty-eight subspecies (B. z. semitorquatus) gets locally displaced by the introduced rainbow lorikeets that aggressively compete for nesting places. The rainbow lorikeet is considered a pest species in Western Australia and is subject to <b>eradication</b> in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Atangana lobbied in {{his later}} life for public health causes, such as the <b>eradication</b> of {{sleeping}} sickness. He never supported the expansion of Cameroun's public school system, since he believed that educated subjects might one day challenge his rule. Atangana's health began to fail him beginning in August 1943. On 1 September, he died in Mvolyé, Yaoundé.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata {{has shown}} a {{variable}} susceptibility to dieback from the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, the plants in sandier soils showing more resistance than those in heavier soils. Plants from Wilsons Promontory were sensitive. The resistance of plants from Flinders Island is unknown. The small size of the stand renders it vulnerable to <b>eradication.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1950 and 1952, {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in Tanganyika, at Kikore and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and endothall (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952–53, the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 2,4,5-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the <b>eradication</b> of tsetse fly.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an <b>eradication</b> program for the tree. It can be very {{difficult}} to eradicate, however. Means of <b>eradication</b> can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|In the Vaikom Satyagraha of 1924, Periyar and Gandhi both cooperated and confronted {{each other}} in socio-political action. Periyar and his {{followers}} emphasised the difference in point of view between Gandhi and himself on the social issues, such as fighting the Untouchability Laws and <b>eradication</b> of the caste system.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{has been}} {{successfully}} eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, {{in conjunction with the}} monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods, {{and the use of the}} pesticide DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s as part of the National Malaria <b>Eradication</b> Program. Bill Gates has said that he thinks global <b>eradication</b> is possible by 2040.|$|E
5|$|On 27 March 2014 the WHO {{announced}} the <b>eradication</b> of poliomyelitis in the South-East Asia Region, which includes eleven countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, North Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste. With {{the addition of}} this region, 80 per cent of the world population lives in polio-free regions.|$|E
5|$|P.Sampath, {{president}} of the Tamil Nadu Untouchability <b>Eradication</b> Front (TNUEF) and an office-bearer politician from the Tamil Nadu unit of Communist Party of India (Marxist) (known as CPI (M)), calls the Chidambaram fire-trail as Brahmin propaganda to conceal the truth that Nandanar was burnt at the stake.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{diseases}} currently the subject of a global <b>eradication</b> program, the other being Guinea worm disease. So far, the only diseases completely eradicated by humankind are smallpox, declared so, in 1980, and rinderpest, likewise, in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Lagomorph Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources {{proposed}} {{a plan of}} conservation in 1990. In Amami-Oshima Island, the Amami Wildlife Conservation Center of the Ministry of the Environment was established in 1999. It restarted a mongoose <b>eradication</b> program in 2005 and designated the Amami rabbit as endangered in 2004 for Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{literacy}} {{in the last}} decade of the twentieth century was particularly remarkable with special emphasis on the <b>eradication</b> of illiteracy. While it is feared that Birbhum may not be able to fulfill the national objective of sending all children in the age group 6–14 years to school by 2010, efforts are on in that direction.|$|E
5|$|The species also occurs {{outside its}} natural range in Australia, {{where it can}} be found in the warm {{effluent}} of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. It has also been captured in Perth, Western Australia, although this initial capture also resulted in its <b>eradication.</b> In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to Réunion, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, Taiwan, and the USA.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The <b>eradication</b> of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|All species {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were {{too low to}} hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and <b>eradication</b> by fishermen. Monk seals have developed a fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E
5|$|At Mare Island, Comfort had her boilers {{replaced}} and {{the electrical}} system was revamped, which entailed replacing all temporary wiring with permanent wiring and watertight fixtures. The crew {{quarters of the}} ship had also become infested with bedbugs from older German-style hospital bedding and remedies and <b>eradication</b> were performed. But Comfort had seen {{the end of her}} Navy service; she was decommissioned 5 August 1921, and was sold at Mare Island 1 April 1925.|$|E
5|$|Child labour is {{a complex}} problem that is {{basically}} rooted in poverty. The Indian government is implementing the world's largest child labour elimination program, with primary education targeted for ~250million. Numerous non-governmental and voluntary organisations are also involved. Special investigation cells {{have been set up}} in states to enforce existing laws banning employment of children (under 14) in hazardous industries. The allocation of the Government of India for the <b>eradication</b> of child labour was 10million in 1995–96 and 16million in 1996–97. The allocation for 2007 is 21million.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Morrow retired to Somerset {{where he became}} active in the Watchmen of the Republic, an {{organization}} devoted to the <b>eradication</b> of prejudice {{and the promotion of}} tolerance. He served on the United States Railroad Labor Board from 1923 to 1926 and its successor, the Railway Mediation Board, from 1926 to 1934. He resigned to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives representing the Ninth District, but lost his party's nomination to John M. Robsion.|$|E
5|$|His cricket {{career was}} {{interrupted}} several times {{due to his}} obligations as a farmer, first growing wheat in South Australia, and later as a wool-grower in Tasmania. He {{was a member of}} several bodies dedicated to agriculture in Tasmania, including the responsible authority for the Royal Hobart Show. He was a pioneer in activities such as rabbit <b>eradication</b> and pasture improvement. He entered politics in 1921, standing as an independent in the Tasmanian Legislative Council, where he was a forceful speaker. He retained his seat in the Tasmanian Parliament until his death following a gall bladder operation in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Dr. Carlos Finlay, a Scottish {{physician}} practising in Havana, {{theorized that}} yellow fever was transmitted by a specific mosquito, later designated Aedes aegypti. The theory remained controversial {{for twenty years}} until confirmed in 1901 by Walter Reed. This was the first scientific proof of a disease being transmitted exclusively by an insect vector, and demonstrated that control of such diseases necessarily entailed control or <b>eradication</b> of its insect vector.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Enugu {{introduced}} a taxi job scheme under 'Coal City Cabs' {{to help in}} the <b>eradication</b> of poverty in the city. 200 registered Nissan Sunny taxis, provided by the state government; and 200 registered Suzuki taxis, provided by the Umuchinemere Pro-Credit Micro Finance Bank, were given out on loan to unemployed citizens in the city who will operate as taxi drivers and will own the vehicles after payments are completed. 20 buses with the capacity for 82 passengers seated and standing were {{introduced a}}s Coal City Shuttle buses on 13 March 2009 to run as public transport for Enugu urban.|$|E
