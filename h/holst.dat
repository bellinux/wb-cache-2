5|$|<b>Holst</b> {{was born}} in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the elder of the two {{children}} of Adolph von <b>Holst,</b> a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, née Lediard. She was of mostly British descent, daughter of a respected Cirencester solicitor; the <b>Holst</b> {{side of the family}} was of mixed Swedish, Latvian and German ancestry, with at least one professional musician in each of the previous three generations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Holst</b> died in London on 25 May 1934, {{at the age}} of 59, {{of heart}} failure {{following}} an operation on his ulcer. His ashes were interred at Chichester Cathedral in Sussex, close to the memorial to Thomas Weelkes, his favourite Tudor composer. Bishop George Bell gave the memorial oration at the funeral, and Vaughan Williams conducted music by <b>Holst</b> and himself.|$|E

40|$|We {{make two}} {{observations}} about <b>Holst’s</b> derivation of Barbero’s Hamiltonian formulation from a covariant Lagrangian. While <b>Holst’s</b> derivation {{does appear to}} be correct, there are two points in the derivation which may be worth clarifying. These concern the choice of time gauge {{and the manner in which}} the Hamiltonian variables are defined in terms of the covariant ones. We emphasize that our observations in no way affect the validity of <b>Holst’s</b> result...|$|R
25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made, {{for a variety of}} reasons, to append further music to <b>Holst's</b> suite, though by far the most common presentation of the music in the concert hall and on record remains <b>Holst's</b> original seven-movement version.|$|R
50|$|The {{album is}} subtitled Songs And Planets and {{features}} {{some parts of}} Gustav <b>Holst's</b> Planets Suite. It represents the completion of an original project started back in 1973, which planned to use <b>Holst's</b> work as a basis. This was ultimately shelved because the band were unable to obtain formal permission from <b>Holst's</b> estate, {{although some of the}} idea of a concept album dealing with the solar system could be seen on the band's 1973 album Solar Fire.|$|R
5|$|Imogen <b>Holst</b> {{also wrote}} {{numerous}} articles, pamphlets, essays, introductions and programme notes {{during the period}} 1935–1984.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School {{opened a}} new music wing, and <b>Holst</b> {{composed}} St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. <b>Holst</b> and {{his family moved to}} a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, <b>Holst</b> and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s Vaughan Williams {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a leading figure in British music, particularly after the deaths of Elgar, Delius and <b>Holst</b> in 1934. Holst's death was a severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams; the two had been each other's closest friends and musical advisers since their college days. After Holst's death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi, but his relationship with <b>Holst</b> was irreplaceable.|$|E

5|$|Gustav Theodore <b>Holst</b> (born Gustavus Theodore von Holst; 21 September 1874– 25 May 1934) was an English composer, {{arranger}} and teacher. Best {{known for}} his orchestral suite The Planets, he composed {{a large number of}} other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as Maurice Ravel, led <b>Holst</b> to develop and refine an individual style.|$|E

5|$|In 1892 <b>Holst</b> {{wrote the}} music for an {{operetta}} {{in the style of}} Gilbert and Sullivan, Lansdown Castle, or The Sorcerer of Tewkesbury. The piece was performed at Cheltenham Corn Exchange in February 1893; it was well received and its success encouraged him to persevere with composing. He applied for a scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London, but the composition scholarship for that year was won by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. <b>Holst</b> was accepted as a non-scholarship student, and Adolph borrowed £100 to cover the first year's expenses. <b>Holst</b> left Cheltenham for London in May 1893. Money was tight, and partly from frugality and partly from his own inclination he became a vegetarian and a teetotaller. Two years later he was finally granted a scholarship, which slightly eased his financial difficulties, but he retained his austere personal regime.|$|E

5|$|Jane Marian Joseph (31 May 1894– 9 March 1929) was an English composer, {{arranger}} {{and music}} teacher. She was a pupil and later associate {{of the composer}} Gustav <b>Holst,</b> and was closely concerned in the organisation and management of various of the music festivals which <b>Holst</b> sponsored. Many of her works were composed for performance at these festivals and similar occasions. Her early death, which prevented the full realisation of her talents, was considered by her contemporaries as a considerable loss to English music.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood {{and most of}} the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when <b>Holst</b> was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; <b>Holst</b> sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered <b>Holst</b> a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but <b>Holst</b> was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E

5|$|Holst's {{comic opera}} The Perfect Fool (1923) was {{widely seen as}} a satire of Parsifal, though <b>Holst</b> firmly denied it. The piece, with Maggie Teyte in the leading soprano role and Eugene Goossens conducting, was enthusiastically {{received}} at its premiere in the Royal Opera House. At a concert in Reading in 1923, <b>Holst</b> slipped and fell, suffering concussion. He seemed {{to make a good}} recovery, and he felt up to accepting an invitation to the US, lecturing and conducting at the University of Michigan. After he returned he found himself more and more in demand, to conduct, prepare his earlier works for publication, and, as before, to teach. The strain caused by these demands on him was too great; on doctor's orders he cancelled all professional engagements during 1924, and retreated to Thaxted. In 1925 he resumed his work at St Paul's Girls' School, but did not return to any of his other posts.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1918 <b>Holst</b> {{had asked}} Joseph to provide a {{libretto}} for his opera The Perfect Fool, feeling that she might possess the required light touch that he thought his own writing lacked. It {{is not clear whether}} she declined, or whether <b>Holst</b> changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself. Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music The Sneezing Charm; the ballet, entitled A Magic Hour, was performed at Morley in October 1920. Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her Mirage cycle, in January 1920, and some of her settings of Walter de la Mare poems in December.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions of Imogen as a {{small child}} {{indicate}} that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, {{at the age of}} five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Holidays were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav <b>Holst</b> began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.|$|E

5|$|In April 1979 Imogen {{was present}} when the Queen Mother opened the new Britten–Pears School {{building}} in Snape. The building included a new library—the Gustav <b>Holst</b> Library—to which Imogen had donated {{a large amount}} of material, including books which her father had used in his own teaching career. She had intended that, after 1977, her retirement from the Aldeburgh Festival would be total, but she made an exception in 1980 when she organised a 70th birthday celebration concert for Pears.|$|E
5|$|Other composers {{who have}} used the organ {{prominently}} in orchestral music include Gustav <b>Holst,</b> Richard Strauss, Ottorino Respighi, Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Because these concert hall instruments could approximate the sounds of symphony orchestras, transcriptions of orchestral works found {{a place in the}} organ repertoire. As silent films became popular, theatre organs were installed in theatres to provide accompaniment for the films.|$|E
