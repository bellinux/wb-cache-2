25|$|Depending on the {{relational}} bond {{between parents and}} children, a child coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender can be positive or negative. Strong, loving relationships between {{children and their parents}} may be strengthened but if a relationship is already strained, those relationships may be further damaged or destroyed by the child coming out. If people coming out are accepted by their parents, this allows open discussions of dating and relationships and allows parents to <b>help</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> with coping with discrimination and to make healthier decisions regarding HIV/AIDS.|$|E
25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to <b>help</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E

[...] "As an intellectual feminist," [...] Weiss-Rosmarin promoted the study of the liturgy, learning the meaning and history of the prayers, [...] "to stimulate attendance of women at synagogue."

The sample consisted of ten Black parents who had moved to this college town from a United States (U. S) urban community with a population size of at least 100, 000 persons. The results indicated that parents perceived <b>their</b> role in <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> adapt to this new environment as important. However, they all described their role differently. Furthermore, the results suggested that all parents in the study moved out of their home towns to escape violence and crime and to pursue an overall better quality of life for themselves and their families.
