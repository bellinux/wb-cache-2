40|$|Business {{corporations}} seek profit. That is, after subtracting cost, they maximize net revenue. Spillovers (both {{costs and}} benefits) involve trade-offs <b>governing</b> <b>boards</b> should make. Spillovers, especially when coupled with clumsy applications of discounted present value, distort a business' perception of profit. Today, businesses are buffeted {{by the old}} risks of recession and the new risks of terrorism.

Accordingly, <b>governing</b> <b>boards</b> must propel businesses towards a paradigm of genuine profit. <b>Governing</b> <b>boards</b> must insist that their businesses prospect for positive feedback loops and implement a sustainable profit stream.

50|$|In {{reaction}} to a growing movement to establish an independent university board, the Oregon Legislature in 2013 passed SB 270, requiring local <b>governing</b> <b>boards</b> for the state's three largest institutions. Effective July 1, 2014, the University of Oregon became an independent public body <b>governed</b> by the <b>Board</b> of Trustees of the University of Oregon. Proponents of local <b>governing</b> <b>boards</b> believe an independent board will give the university more autonomy, and free it from relying on inadequate state funding.|$|R

5|$|By September 1943, {{the values}} of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion {{reaction}} could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was sufficiently optimistic about the Super, and sufficiently concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the <b>Governing</b> <b>Board</b> to raise its priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one person could be spared to work on it full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would {{spend the rest of the}} war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the inverse Compton cooling, while Roberg worked out the ignition temperature of T-D mixtures. Maria Goeppert joined the group in February 1945.|$|E

5|$|In June 1919, {{soon after}} the passage of Education Act 1918, the school {{successfully}} applied for grant-earning status and became partly state-funded. As a consequence, it became necessary to introduce a composite <b>governing</b> <b>board</b> (including public representatives) and to offer free places, equal to 25 percent of the normal number of admissions. In 1925, the school saw its first students enter the Oxbridge universities and changed its name to simply The Judd School. Evans retired in 1928 and was replaced by Welshman Cecil Lloyd Morgan who beat 164other applicants to a job which carried an annual salary of £650. He oversaw a change in the curriculum such that each form was divided into two streams, of which one took Latin, the other more vocational subjects. Morgan continued as many of the Judd customs as long as he could, including the tradition of donating £20 per year to send a Barnardo boy to Australia or Canada.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, {{together}} with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the {{co-director of the}} Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the <b>governing</b> <b>board</b> of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including The Heiress, Home at Seven, and Three Sisters. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death {{at the age of}} eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays.|$|E
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory had a <b>governing</b> <b>board,</b> {{the members}} of which were Oppenheimer, Bacher, Bethe, Kennedy, D. L. Hughes (Personnel Director), D. P. Mitchell (Procurement Director) and Deak Parsons. McMillan, George Kistiakowsky and Kenneth Bainbridge were later added. The {{laboratory}} was organized into five divisions: Administration (A), Theoretical (T) under Bethe, Experimental Physics (P) under Bacher, Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) under Kennedy, and Ordnance and Engineering (E) under Parsons. All the divisions expanded during 1943 and 1944, but T Division, despite trebling in size, remained the smallest, while E Division grew to be the largest. Security clearance was a problem. Scientists (including, at first, Oppenheimer) had to be given access to the Technical Area without proper clearance. In the interest of efficiency, Groves approved an abbreviated process by which Oppenheimer vouched for senior scientists, and three other employees were sufficient to vouch for a junior scientist or technician.|$|E
