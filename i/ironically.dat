5|$|<b>Ironically</b> in the 1935 Max Reinhardt film, he {{was played}} by the chubby, jovial Otis Harlan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ironically,</b> Bawdsey {{was ignored}} by the Germans for the entire war, while St Athan was {{attacked}} by a Junkers Ju 88 only weeks after the team arrived. The single bomb struck the runway directly, but failed to explode.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ironically,</b> {{given the}} Yankees' celebrated history, {{none of the}} eleven {{pitchers}} who tossed no-hitters for the franchise is in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Ryan made a cameo {{appearance}} in the Adam Sandler film That's My Boy, which was released on June 15, 2012. <b>Ironically,</b> his character was {{a fan of the}} Jets' rival, the New England Patriots.|$|E
5|$|After {{striking}} the Philippines, the storm caused widespread damage while becoming the strongest storm {{to affect the}} archipelago since 1970, which was also <b>ironically</b> also named Irma. The hardest hit was the province of Camarines Norte along the eastern portion of the island of Luzon.|$|E
5|$|At the 1962 Varna Olympiad, Fischer {{predicted}} {{that he would}} defeat Argentinian GM Miguel Najdorf in 25 moves. Fischer actually did it in 24, becoming the only player to beat Najdorf in the tournament. <b>Ironically,</b> Najdorf lost the game whilst employing the very opening variation named after him: the Sicilian Najdorf.|$|E
5|$|Bailey left Charlton {{to replace}} Alan Mullery as Brighton & Hove Albion manager, and the Charlton board <b>ironically</b> decided to name Mullery as Bailey's successor. Charlton {{finished}} the 1981–82 season in 13th place, and Walsh scored 15 goals in total. He performed well against divisional champions Luton Town, giving captain Mal Donaghy a difficult afternoon, which {{was enough to}} win him a move to his next club.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 Olivia {{seems to}} have {{realised}} that Dorothy was determined to marry Pound, and finally consented; <b>ironically</b> Pound was then earning less than he had in 1911. Hope Shakespear relented when the couple agreed to a church wedding rather than a civil ceremony, which took place on 20April 1914. Olivia gave them two early circus drawings by Pablo Picasso.|$|E
5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's {{never been on}} a ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The {{dialogue}} they exchange is taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. <b>Ironically,</b> in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.|$|E
5|$|Gorgias, in Plato's homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as {{an example}} of {{powerful}} oratory. In Menexenus, however, Socrates (through Plato) casts aspersions on Pericles' rhetorical fame, claiming <b>ironically</b> that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be superior in rhetoric to someone educated by Antiphon. He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles.|$|E
5|$|In a world {{historically}} {{receptive to}} any anti-Semitic argument, however crude, {{to put in}} Hitler's mouth a powerful rationale for blaming the Jews, however <b>ironically,</b> was feeding the same fires that sent Jews up the chimneys of the death camps.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ironically,</b> at {{the draw}} for the {{qualifying}} {{competition for the}} 1986 World Cup, {{which took place in}} Zurich on 7 December 1983 (six days before Harry Cavan's words were published), the four Home Nations were drawn against each other, with England and Northern Ireland in Group 3, and Scotland and Wales in Group 7.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ironically,</b> {{given its}} {{conservation}} status, Kingsley Dixon of Kings Park and Botanic Garden {{suggested that it}} may have weed potential: the species was trialled as a cut flower crop on land north of Moore River, and seedlings were noted afterwards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ironically,</b> some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had {{enormous}} difficulties being accepted as registrable purebred Arabians {{because many of}} the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper to verify the purity of their horses. However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007.|$|E
5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, <b>ironically,</b> to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 111 was a severe blow to Swissair. <b>Ironically,</b> the IFE {{system on the}} {{aircraft}} that was blamed for causing the accident was installed by Swissair to attract more passengers in order to ease the airline's financial difficulties. Swissair finally went bankrupt shortly after the 9/11 attack in 2001, which caused a powerful disruption to the aviation transportation industry.|$|E
5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} <b>ironically</b> great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus Candide derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events {{with no apparent}} redeeming qualities.|$|E
5|$|After the victory, a {{prize crew}} was put aboard Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had {{a good deal of}} trouble from the restive Americans, who outnumbered his own men. He had some {{of the leaders of the}} unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, <b>ironically,</b> been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (holes) in the maindeck through which two 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E
5|$|Benchley's drinking, {{already a}} problem, worsened {{and he was}} {{diagnosed}} with cirrhosis of the liver. (<b>Ironically,</b> when younger, he had been an adamant teetotaler.) While he completed his year's work, his condition continued to deteriorate, and Benchley died in a New York hospital on November 21, 1945. His family opted for a private funeral service, and his body was cremated and interred in a family plot on the island of Nantucket.|$|E
5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat <b>ironically,</b> Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's {{two films}} of 1938, Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces, both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former had Cagney {{in a comedy}} role, and {{received}} mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but was keen {{to get him back}} to playing tough guys, which was more lucrative. <b>Ironically,</b> the script for Angels was one that Cagney had hoped to do while with Grand National, but the studio had been unable to secure funding.|$|E
5|$|Daoism and Buddhism {{were the}} {{dominant}} religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply impacting many beliefs {{and principles of}} Neo-Confucianism throughout the dynasty. <b>Ironically,</b> Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time. Older beliefs in ancient Chinese mythology, folk religion, and ancestor worship also played a large part in people's daily lives, as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm.|$|E
5|$|Duke of York was {{the third}} ship in the King George V class, and was laid down at John Brown & Company's {{shipyard}} in Clydebank, Scotland, on 5 May 1937. <b>Ironically,</b> the title of Duke of York was in abeyance at that time, having been that held by King George VI prior to his succession to the throne in December 1936. The battleship was launched on 28 February 1940, and was completed on 4 November 1941. After this, the ship joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|Finding {{themselves}} with no record label again, TISM returned to touring. In late 2003, a special one-off concert was filmed and released on DVD as The White Albun (2004) by Madman Entertainment. A documentary and full length album were also included, {{making it a}} 3-disc set which received good reviews; however, the release was not eligible for ARIA chart tracking. The concert DVD {{is presented as a}} telethon at which TISM breaks up. <b>Ironically,</b> TISM performed after that concert in order to promote the set.|$|E
5|$|Hoping to {{establish}} his credentials {{once and for all}} as an expert field naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton spent several years of the controversy working diligently on his two-volume work Life-Histories of Northern Animals, which was published in 1909. After an enlarged edition of the book was published as Lives of Game Animals, Seton was <b>ironically</b> awarded the Burroughs Medal in 1927, a prize named after the venerable naturalist who had once so criticized Seton's work.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, {{the thirty}} year old {{must have been}} feeling {{confident}} about his future prospects when he suffered two major interruptions to his life. First, Leuven was besieged by the troops of the Duke of Cleves, a Lutheran sympathiser who, with French support, was set on exploiting unrest in the Low Countries to his own ends. <b>Ironically</b> it was this same Duke to whom Mercator would turn ten years hence. The siege was lifted but the financial losses to the town and its traders, including Mercator, were great. The second interruption was potentially deadly: the Inquisition called.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Asaph Hall adopted this {{approach}} of modifying the exponent in the inverse-square law slightly to explain an anomalous orbital precession {{of the planet}} Mercury, which had been observed in 1859 by Urbain Le Verrier. <b>Ironically,</b> Hall's theory was ruled out by careful astronomical observations of the Moon. The currently accepted explanation for this precession involves the theory of general relativity, which (to first approximation) adds an inverse-quartic force, i.e., one that varies as the inverse fourth power of distance.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Naismith {{became the}} first {{basketball}} coach of the University of Kansas. He compiled a record of 55–60 and is <b>ironically</b> the only losing coach in Kansas history. Naismith is {{at the beginning of}} massive and prestigious coaching tree, as he coached Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen, who himself coached Hall of Fame coaches Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, and Ralph Miller who all coached future coaches as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Shaughnessy {{was rumored}} as a {{candidate}} for the vacant Washington Redskins head coaching job, but nothing came of it. From 1951 to 1962, Shaughnessy served {{on the staff of the}} Chicago Bears as a technical advisor, vice president, and defensive specialist. Halas retained responsibility for the offense, including the Bears' T formation. <b>Ironically,</b> Shaughnessy was tasked with developing a defense to counter the T formation. One of his solutions was the 5–3–3 defense, which left outside linebackers available to defend against end runs and passes in the flat.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the eight-team Atlantic Coast Conference added Florida State to the league, {{creating}} a new nine-team ACC. Though Florida State was the only school added to the conference, some league officials discussed offering one or more other schools—Navy, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, South Carolina, Miami, West Virginia, Boston College, Rutgers, or Virginia Tech—an offer to join the league. For various reasons, however, no other team was extended an offer. Throughout the 1990s, the Atlantic Coast Conference remained at nine members. <b>Ironically,</b> South Carolina was a charter member of the ACC that left in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Radcliffe portrayed Manny, a talkative corpse, in the indie film Swiss Army Man. That same year, he also starred as Walter Mabry in {{the action}} {{adventure}} film Now You See Me 2, <b>ironically</b> playing a technological prodigy who resents magic. He also starred off-Broadway at The Public Theater in a documentary theatre piece called Privacy, {{playing the role of}} The Writer. He starred in the 2016 release Imperium playing Nate Foster, an idealistic FBI agent who goes undercover to take down a radical white supremacy group.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{offered the}} United States {{access to its}} {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British nuclear weapons developments. He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts, ostensibly over concerns about American security. <b>Ironically,</b> it was the British project {{that had already been}} penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to winning more Super Rugby titles {{than any other}} team, the franchise also holds several competition records, including most points in a game and most tries in a game, both achieved in their 96–19 victory over the Waratahs in 2002. <b>Ironically</b> the Crusaders also hold {{the record for the}} least points scored in a game when they were defeated by the Highlanders 6–0 in 2009. They have also scored the most points (541) and most tries (71) in one season, both achieved in 2005.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ironically,</b> in {{the next}} year, the Great Fire of London (1666) was to be of benefit to him, when he {{received}} one of the City of London's first new artistic commissions to paint twenty-two full length portraits of the so-called 'Fire Judges' (those appointed to assess the property disputes arising from the fire). These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ironically,</b> the Grimaldi {{fortunes}} were restored when {{descendants of}} both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini {{had been the}} heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ironically,</b> {{the success}} of Rossini's Semiramide earlier the same season was what allowed A Life to be staged at all, with {{virtually}} all the cast from Semiramide retained for A Life. Despite A Life's success, the furor over Semiramide aroused an overwhelming demand for Italian opera. This proved a setback for Russian opera in general and particularly for Glinka's next opera, Ruslan and Lyudmila when it was produced in 1842. Its failure prompted Glinka to leave Russia; he died in exile.|$|E
