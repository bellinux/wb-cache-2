25|$|Wishing {{to open up}} the square, Piermarini first {{demolished}} one of the old wings before {{concentrating on}} the renovation of the building's exterior. The result is a sober two-storey facade. The first floor contains windows with small stone cornices and a small bugnato ashlar socle while the other two have pilasters along the full length of the facade with tympanum windows, alternatingly triangular and curved. The interiors were then completely renewed. The entrance leads into the courtyard with its monumental Baroque staircase. To complete this part of the palace, the facade of the Church of San Gottardo in Corte had to be demolished while use was also made of the adjoining square. The most renowned artists, decorators and cabinet makers of the period were called upon to design the furniture and decorations. The <b>external</b> <b>structure</b> was completed in 1778 but work on the interior continued for several years.|$|E

25|$|The site {{on which}} the Potala Palace rises is built over a palace erected by Songtsen Gampo on the Red Hill. The Potala {{contains}} two chapels on its northwest corner that conserve parts of the original building. One is the Phakpa Lhakhang, the other the Chogyel Drupuk, a recessed cavern identified as Songtsen Gampo's meditation cave. Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, started {{the construction of the}} modern Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (died 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. The <b>external</b> <b>structure</b> was built in 3 years, while the interior, together with its furnishings, took 45 years to complete. The Dalai Lama and his government moved into the Potrang Karpo ('White Palace') in 1649. Construction lasted until 1694, some twelve years after his death. The Potala was used as a winter palace by the Dalai Lama from that time. The Potrang Marpo ('Red Palace') was added between 1690 and 1694.|$|E
500|$|In November 2000, Rosaviakosmos {{decided to}} deorbit Mir, {{and the next}} month Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov signed an order to do so. By this stage Mir was well past {{the end of its}} design life, and Rosaviakosmos General Director Yuri Koptev {{believed}} that [...] "any of its systems could well fail at any time". Therefore, it was decided to deorbit it whilst it was still functioning, rather than risk it falling back to Earth out of control, like Skylab in 1979 and Salyut 7 in 1991, potentially dropping debris over a populated area. At the time, Mir was the largest spacecraft ever to reenter the Earth's atmosphere, and there were concerns that sizeable pieces of debris, particularly from the docking assemblies, gyrodynes and <b>external</b> <b>structure,</b> could survive reentry.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{sound source}} {{localization}} in three-dimensional space {{is essential for}} an animal’s orientation and survival. While the horizontal position can be determined by interaural time and intensity differences, localization in elevation was thought to require <b>external</b> <b>structures</b> that modify sound before it reaches the tympanum. Here we show that in birds even without <b>external</b> <b>structures</b> like pinnae or feather ruffs, the simple shape of their head induces sound modifications that depend on the elevation of the source. Based on a model of localization errors, we show that these cues are sufficient to locate sounds in the vertical plane.

While the character is typically cheerful and flamboyant, Pee-wee has indeed displayed an aggressive side, including his vicious pool battle with Francis in Pee-wee's Big Adventure. He also played vengeful tricks in the aforementioned film and occasionally threw childish tantrums on Pee-wee's Playhouse.

60|$|So {{much for}} the <b>external</b> <b>structure.</b> Internally {{the lower part of}} the utricle is covered with spherical papillae, formed of four cells (sometimes eight {{according}} to Dr. Warming), which evidently answer to the quadrifid processes within the bladders of Utricularia. [page 448] These papillae extend a little way up the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the utricle; and a few, according to Warming, may be found in the upper part. This upper region is covered by many transverse rows, one above the other, of short, closely approximate hairs, pointing downwards. These hairs have broad bases, and their tips are formed by a separate cell. They are absent in {{the lower part of the}} utricle where the papillae abound.|$|E
60|$|Ophidia.—I {{have little}} to say about Snakes. Dr. Günther informs me that the males are always smaller than the females, and {{generally}} have longer and slenderer tails; but he knows of no other difference in <b>external</b> <b>structure.</b> In regard to colour, Dr. Günther can almost always distinguish the male from the female by his more strongly-pronounced tints; thus the black zigzag band {{on the back of}} the male English viper is more distinctly defined than in the female. The difference is much plainer in the Rattle-snakes of N. America, the male of which, as the keeper in the Zoological Gardens shewed me, can instantly be distinguished from the female by having more lurid yellow about its whole body. In S. Africa the Bucephalus capensis presents an analogous difference, for the female “is never so fully variegated with yellow on the sides, as the male.”[49] The male of the Indian Dipsas cynodon, on the other hand, is blackish-brown, with the belly partly black, whilst the female is reddish or yellowish-olive with the belly either uniform yellowish or marbled with black.|$|E
