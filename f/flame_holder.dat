40|$|Abstract — The {{proposal}} of supersonic combustion has become inevitable to fly at hypersonic speeds, {{but the problem}} of efficient mixing, flame holding and flame stabilization in supersonic combustors {{is yet to be}} overcome. Cavity based <b>flame</b> <b>holders,</b> which was used in subsonic combustors earlier is now extensively studied as supersonic combustor <b>flame</b> <b>holders.</b> The mixing characteristics of supersonic cavity <b>flame</b> <b>holders</b> depend on the formation of subsonic recirculation zone inside it. In this paper, open and closed single cavities with and without aft wall angle are analyzed to find out the optimum cavity configuration among them. The geometry was designed in ANSYS Design Modeler and the numerical analysis was done in ANSYS FLUENT 13. 0 using the two dimensional density based energy equation and the turbulent characteristics are modeled using standard k-ε turbulence model. The contours of static pressure, static temperature, turbulence kinetic energy, total pressure and x-velocity were taken along the model length for comparison. From the results obtained, it is observed that cavity with L/D= 10 and 45 ° aft wall angle showed better performance in terms of mixing characteristics and flame holding capability with no significant increase in total pressure loss compared to the other models. Single cavities with L/D= 10 as well as cavities with aft wall angle showed better performance compared to single cavities with L/D= 5 and with no aft wall angle respectively.

50|$|Rocket engines, being a non 'duct engine' {{have quite}} {{different}} combustor systems, and the mixture ratio is usually {{much closer to}} being stoichiometric in the main chamber. These engines generally lack <b>flame</b> <b>holders</b> and combustion occurs at much higher temperatures, there being no turbine downstream. However, liquid rocket engines frequently employ separate burners to power turbopumps, and these burners usually run far off stoichiometric so as to lower turbine temperatures in the pump.|$|R
50|$|All {{scramjet}} engines have an intake which compresses {{the incoming}} air, fuel injectors, a combustion chamber, and a divergent thrust nozzle. Sometimes engines {{also include a}} region which acts as a <b>flame</b> <b>holder,</b> although the high stagnation temperatures mean that an area of focused waves may be used, rather than a discrete engine part as seen in turbine engines. Other engines use pyrophoric fuel additives, such as silane, to avoid flameout. An isolator between the inlet and combustion chamber is often included to improve the homogeneity of the flow in the combustor and to extend the operating range of the engine.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the isothermal wake-flow characteristics of several flame-holder shapes {{was carried out in}} a 4 - by 4 -inch flow chamber. The effects of flame-holder-shape changes on the characteristics of the Karman vortices and thus on the recirculation zones to which experimenters have related the combustion process were obtained for several <b>flame</b> <b>holders.</b> The results may furnish a basis of correlation, of combustion efficiency and stability for similarly shaped <b>flame</b> <b>holders</b> in combustion studies. Values of the spacing ratio-(ratio of lateral spacing to longitudinal spacing of vortices] obtained for the various shapes approximated the theoretical value of 0. 36 given by the Karman stability analysis. Variations in vortex strength of more than 200 percent and in frequency of more than 60 percent were accomplished by varying flame-holder shape. A maximum increase in the recirculation parameter of 56 percent over that for a conventional V-gutter was also obtained. Varying flameholder shape and size enables the designer to select many schedules of variations in vortex strength and frequency- not obtainable by changing size only and may make it possible to approach theoretical maximum vortex strength for any given frequency...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{observations}} and numerical simulation {{were conducted to}} study the flame characteristics and flame stabilization mechanism in a supersonic combustor with hydrogen injection upstream of cavity <b>flame</b> <b>holders.</b> OH radical distribution of the reacting flowfield was obtained using OH spontaneous emission and OH-PLIF (planar laser-induced fluorescence). The supersonic combustion flowfield with L/D = 7 cavity was calculated by large eddy simulation. The turbulence-combustion interaction model {{was based on a}} partially premixed flamelet model with a level-set approach. The results showed that hydrogen fuels were transported into the cavity shear; lean mixture and rich mixture were produced in the internal cavity and the declining jet, respectively. An approximately steady partially premixed flame front exists in the cavity shear layer. The flame front propagates and extends to the region around the fuel jet due to the interaction of counter-rotating vortices induced by the jet with the cavity shear layer. The flame front sustained in the shear layer likely penetrates the jet core and ignites the whole jet. Behind the flame front, most of the jet beam is burned as diffusion flames. The physical process of the flame stabilization demonstrated the similarity with triple flame characteristics, which indicted that triple flame theory might be the basic flame stabilization mechanism of the cavity <b>flame</b> <b>holders...</b>|$|R

50|$|Two major efforts {{occurred}} in the 1950s. One of these efforts was by G. Moore and K. Berman at General Electric. The duo used 90% H2O2 (high test peroxide, known as HTP) and polyethylene in a rod and tube grain design. They drew several significant conclusions from their work. The fuel grain had uniform burning. Grain cracks did not affect combustion, like it does with solid rocket motors. No hard starts were observed (a hard start is a pressure spike seen close {{to the time of}} ignition, typical of liquid rocket engines). The fuel surface acted as a <b>flame</b> <b>holder,</b> which encouraged stable combustion. The oxidizer could be throttled with one valve, and a high oxidizer to fuel ratio helped simplify combustion. The negative observations were low burning rates and that the thermal instability of peroxide was problematic for safety reasons. Another effort that {{occurred in}} the 1950s was development of a reverse hybrid. In a standard hybrid rocket motor, the solid material is the fuel. In a reverse hybrid rocket motor, the oxidizer is solid. William Avery of the Applied Physics Laboratory used JP and ammonium nitrate, selected for their low cost. His O/F ratio was 0.035, which was 200 times smaller than the ratio used by Moore and Berman.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The flame {{stability}} limit, which was involving the critical flow condition, lift off and blow out, {{could be affected}} by the burner geometry in the combustion system installation. Consequently a <b>flame</b> <b>holder</b> should be put in, to hold the flame as big as possible on a stable condition. The <b>flame</b> <b>holder</b> itself, is a device to hold the flame, whereas the <b>flame</b> <b>holder</b> could disturb the air and fuel flow. The fluid flow will be disturbed if the forces work on the fluid flow will be interrupting their stability. The fluid flow blockage by the <b>flame</b> <b>holder</b> will generate vortex and this vortex will end up with a turbulence condition. This turbulence condition will shift the critical stability limit and will produce a perfect combustion. In this research a concentric jet flow burner was implemented and the fluid flow speed and air speed was variated. To achive a perfect result, it is necessary to visualize the flow pattern using a schlieren photograph system. A thermocouple was introduce to measure the flame temperature and to know the temperature distribution. It is recocnized that a <b>flame</b> <b>holder</b> could be able to increase the {{flame stability}} zone.

50|$|Since {{there is}} no {{downstream}} turbine, a ramjet combustor can safely operate at stoichiometric fuel:air ratios, which implies a combustor exit stagnation temperature {{of the order of}} 2400 K for kerosene. Normally, the combustor must be capable of operating over a wide range of throttle settings, for a range of flight speeds/altitudes. Usually, a sheltered pilot region enables combustion to continue when the vehicle intake undergoes high yaw/pitch during turns. Other flame stabilization techniques make use of <b>flame</b> <b>holders,</b> which vary in design from combustor cans to simple flat plates, to shelter the flame and improve fuel mixing. Overfuelling the combustor can cause the normal shock within a supersonic intake system to be pushed forward beyond the intake lip, resulting in a substantial drop in engine airflow and net thrust.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effectiveness}} of perforated liner with bias flow {{on the control}} of combustion instability is investigated. Combustion instabilities result from the coupling between acoustic waves and unsteady combustion heat release.

Passive methods, such as perforated liner, are often used to suppress such instabilities in application. In this article, first, a burner testbed is built in order to study the characteristic of this phenomenon. The unstable frequencies and unstable area are investigated experimentally.

Fuel mixing studies with Vortex Generators and bluff body <b>flame</b> <b>holders</b> illuminated the importance of increasing the shear-layer area and spreading angle to augment flame volume. Evaluation of flame-holding configurations (with variable fuel injection methods) concluded that the heat release zone, and therefore combustion efficiency, could be manipulated by judicious selection of bluff body geometry, and is less influenced by fuel injection distribution. Air film cooling studies demonstrated that acceptable combustor life could be achieved with optimized air film distribution patterns and thermal barrier coatings...|$|R
