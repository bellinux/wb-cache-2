5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E
5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E

40|$|Three {{species of}} bamboo‐eating lemurs {{were found to}} be {{sympatric}} in the southeastern rain forests of Madagascar. Sympatric species generally differ in habitat utilization or diet, but these three closely related bamboo lemurs lived in the same habitat and all ate bamboo. Behavioral observation revealed that they did select different parts of the bamboo, and chemical analyses confirmed that there was a difference in the secondary compound content present in those selections. The growing tips of Cephalostachyum ef uiguieri selected by the golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemuraureus) contained 15 mg of cyanide per 100 g fresh weight bamboo while the leaves of C. perrieri selected by the <b>gentle</b> bamboo <b>lemur</b> (H. griseus) and the mature culms of C. cf uiguieri selected by the greater bamboolemur (H. simus) did not contain cyanide. Since each individual golden bamboo lemur ate about 500 g of bamboo per day, they daily ingestedabout 12 times the lethal dose of cyanide. The mechanism by which this small primate avoids the acute and chronic symptoms of cyanide poisioning is unknown. Copyright © 1989 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Compan...|$|R

Body weights of the same individual adultP. d. edwardsi changed over the three years, suggesting variation in food availability. Although there was no difference in body weight among adult males of two groups ofP. d. edwardsi, one male in each group had a testicular volume four times larger than that of other males, even though these measurements were taken five months after the breeding season. These data suggest that only one adult male mates in each group. Testicular size of the polygynousE. f. rufus males was significantly larger than that of the monogamousE. rubriventer. © 1992 Academic Press Limited...|$|R

5000|$|The Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis), {{also known}} as the Lac Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> Alaotran bamboo lemur, Alaotran <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> or locally as the , is a bamboo lemur. It is endemic to the reed beds in and around Lac Alaotra, in {{northeast}} Madagascar. It is about 40 cm long, with a similar length tail, and is a brownish-gray colour. It is the only bamboo lemur to live in and feed on papyrus reeds, and other reeds and grasses, and some authorities argue that it should be regarded as a subspecies of the eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus). The population of this lemur has been declining because of habitat destruction and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being [...] "critically endangered".|$|E

50|$|The fertile plain {{surrounding}} Lake Alaotra is Madagascar's {{most important}} rice-producing region. The hills surrounding the lake were formerly forested, but have mostly been cleared for farmland in past decades. Severe erosion on these vulnerable hill slopes has caused considerable sedimentation of the lake, which is fast disappearing; {{the lake is}} now only 60 cm deep during the dry season. Pressure to create more rice fields has also led locals to burn the reedbeds surrounding the lake. These reedbeds provide the sole habitat of the endemic Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> (Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis). The Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> is now limited to only 220 km2 of remaining reedbeds, and in recent years, its population rapidly declined by 60%, from about 7,500 individuals in 1994 to 3,000 in 2001, mostly from habitat loss, but also from hunting by local villagers.|$|E
50|$|The Forest Station {{is home to}} {{an extreme}} variety of biodiversity. There are at least seven groups of Indri indri within the reserve, {{two of which are}} habituated to people and are {{commonly}} seen by tourists. There are also mouse lemurs, hairy-eared dwarf lemurs, dwarf lemurs, aye-aye, common brown lemurs, gray <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> and small-toothed sportive lemurs.|$|E
50|$|Bamboo lemurs prefer damp forests where bamboo grows. Although {{they can}} be active {{any time of the}} day, they are often active just after dawn. Though {{primarily}} arboreal, they sometimes come down to the ground. The Lac Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> or bandro (Hapalemur alaotrensis), which lives in the reed beds of Lac Alaotra, spends much of its time in water and can swim well, unlike other lemur species, which only venture to water to drink.|$|E
50|$|The eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus), {{also known}} as the gray bamboo lemur and the gray <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> is a small lemur endemic to Madagascar, with three known subspecies.

50|$|Measuring 19-27 cm in {{body length}} with a tail about 16-17 cm, they {{are larger than}} the mouse lemur but smaller than the <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur.</b> Their heads are {{globular}} compared to the fox-like heads of the lemurs, but their muzzles are more pointed {{than those of the}} hapalemurs. Their hind limbs are slightly longer than their forelimbs, but not as elongated as in lepilemurs or indriids. Dwarf lemurs have an intermembral index of 71 on average. In contrast to most other primates, their grip {{is similar to that of}} South American monkeys with objects picked up and branches grasped between the second and third fingers, rather than between the thumb and index finger.

50|$|The eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus griseus), {{also known}} as the gray bamboo lemur, eastern gray bamboo lemur, or gray <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> was the {{original}} species described in 1795 by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link. It is grey in colour, sometimes with a red patch on its head. It averages 284 mm in length with a tail of 37 mm. Based on data from more than one hundred transect surveys which took place between 2004 and 2009, the population is estimated to be declining. There is an estimated 818 individuals in Ranomafana National Park and the decline in numbers is due to hunting and habitat loss. It is listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) on Appendix 1 and the IUCN considers it to be vulnerable.|$|E
5000|$|Gilbert's bamboo lemur (H. g. gilberti), {{also known}} as Gilbert's <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> or Beanamalao bamboo lemur, was {{described}} as a subspecies in 2007, but was raised to species status in 2008. [...] In 2010, it was returned to subspecies status. Its exact distribution is not certain but it is known from a small area of east-central Madagascar from its type locality of Beanamalao, from a small area north of the Nesivolo river and possibly from an area south of the Mangoro River and Onive River. This subspecies lives in dense bamboo stands and areas of bamboo vines and is threatened by habitat loss and degradation.

5000|$|The greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus), {{also known}} as the broad-nosed bamboo lemur and the broad-nosed <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> is the largest bamboo lemur, at over five pounds or nearly 2.5 kilograms. It has greyish brown fur and white ear tufts, and has a head-body length of around one and a half feet, or forty to fifty centimeters. They have {{relatively}} long tails and long back legs for leaping vertically amongst the trees of their forest habitat [...] It feeds almost exclusively on the bamboo species of Cathariostachys madagascariensis, preferring the shoots but also eating the pith and leaves. It is unknown how their metabolism deals with the cyanide found in the shoots. The typical daily dose would be enough to kill humans. Greater bamboo lemurs occasionally consume fungi, flowers, and fruit. Its only confirmed predator is the fossa, but raptors are also suspected. Its current range is restricted to southeastern Madagascar, although fossils indicate its former range extended across bigger areas of the island, including as far north as Ankarana. Some notable parts of the current range are the Ranomafana and Andringitra National Parks.|$|E

40|$|Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT) has {{conducted}} since 1994 several census ’ {{on the population}} of the Alaotran <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> to observe the development of the population in time and space. ALAOTRA <b>GENTLE</b> <b>LEMUR</b> AND ITS THREATS The Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> or Bandro (Hapalemur griseus alaot-rensis) (Figure 1) is confined to the papyrus and reed beds of the Lake Alaotra (see Figure 2). This type of vegetation is most found in the southern parts of the lake. The population of the Alaotra lemur is suffering severe anthropogenic threats: The major pressures derive from habitat destruction mainly through fires. Slash and burn culture is mostly used to convert marshy habitat into rice paddies and to gain better access to fish ponds. Since the beginnings of the 1980 ’s, there has been a significant reduction in rain precipitation which prolongs the dry season and therefore leads to a desiccation of substantial parts of the marshes. This enhances and further propagates the slash and burn culture. Another direct population pressure is the hunting of the lemurs mainly for protein supply...|$|E
