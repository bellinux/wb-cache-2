5|$|In the west, US {{forces were}} pushed back {{repeatedly}} before finally halting the North Korean advance. Forces from the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly {{arrived in the}} country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing the 19th Infantry Regiment back and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean <b>forces.</b> <b>US</b> units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the North Korean force on the west flank withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides several days of reprieve {{to prepare for the}} attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

25|$|On 25 September, Seoul was recaptured by South Korean <b>forces.</b> <b>U.S.</b> {{air raids}} caused heavy {{damage to the}} KPA, {{destroying}} most of its tanks and much of its artillery. North Korean troops in the south, instead of effectively withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated, leaving Pyongyang vulnerable. During the general retreat only 25,000 to 30,000 North Korean soldiers managed to reach the KPA lines. On 27 September, Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo, in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat.|$|E

25|$|In May 1950, {{after the}} capture of Hainan island by Chinese {{communist}} <b>forces,</b> <b>U.S.</b> President Harry S. Truman began covertly authorizing direct financial assistance to the French, and on June 27, 1950, after {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War, announced publicly that the U.S. was doing so. It was feared in Washington that if Ho were to win the war, with his ties to the Soviet Union, he would establish a puppet state with Moscow with the Soviets ultimately controlling Vietnamese affairs. The prospect of a communist-dominated Southeast Asia was enough to spur the U.S. to support France, so that the spread of Soviet-allied communism could be contained.|$|E

25|$|Seen another way, {{patients}} with heart, liver, lung, or kidney failure have a dismal prognosis for survival, so the toxicity associated with immunosuppression is warranted (the benefits of graft survival outweigh {{the risks associated}} with the medications). But for the subset of {{patients with}} diabetes and preserved kidney function, even those with long-standing and difficult-to-control disease, the prognosis for survival is comparatively much better. In addition to the immunosuppressive toxicities, other risks are associated with the islet transplant procedure itself, including intra-abdominal hemorrhage following the transplant, and portal vein thrombosis. The fact that there is already a good alternative to islet transplantation (i.e. the modern intensive insulin regimen) <b>forces</b> <b>us</b> to regard any newer, riskier interventions with a critical eye.|$|E

25|$|In the United States today, {{the federal}} courts and most state courts have merged law and equity in the courts of general jurisdiction, such as county courts. However, the {{substantive}} distinction between law and equity has retained its old vitality. This difference is not a mere technicality, because the successful handling of certain law cases is difficult or impossible unless {{a temporary restraining order}} (TRO) or preliminary injunction is issued at the outset, to restrain someone from fleeing the jurisdiction taking the only property available to satisfy a judgment, for instance. Furthermore, certain statutes like Employee Retirement Income Security Act specifically authorize only equitable relief, which <b>forces</b> <b>US</b> courts to analyze in lengthy detail whether the relief demanded in particular cases brought under those statutes would have been available in equity.|$|E
25|$|Relations between India and the United States came to {{an all-time}} low during the early 1970s. Despite reports of atrocities in East Pakistan, and being told, most notably in the Blood telegram, of genocidal {{activities}} being perpetrated by Pakistani <b>forces,</b> <b>US.</b> Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and US President Richard Nixon did nothing to discourage then Pakistani President Yahya Khan and the Pakistan Army. Kissinger was particularly concerned about Soviet expansion into South Asia {{as a result of}} a treaty of friendship that had recently been signed between India and the Soviet Union, and sought to demonstrate to the People's Republic of China the value of a tacit alliance with the United States. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Indian Armed Forces, along with the Mukti Bahini, succeeded in liberating East Pakistan which soon declared independence. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would mean total Soviet domination of the region, and that it would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. To demonstrate to China the bona fides of the United States as an ally, and in direct violation of the Congress-imposed sanctions on Pakistan, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan, routing them through Jordan and Iran, while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan.|$|E

The United States, a permanent member of the Security Council, immediately deployed armed <b>forces</b> (<b>U.S.</b> Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force units) to southeastern South Korea because of their immediate availability from their bases in Japan and Okinawa, where the military occupation of Japan was still in effect (through 1952).

500|$|Some critics, such as Larry Flynt's {{magazine}} Hustler and Gene Healy, {{allege that}} Dworkin endorsed incest. In the closing chapter of Woman Hating (1974), Dworkin wrote that, [...] "The parent–child relationship is primarily erotic because all human relationships are primarily erotic", and that, [...] "The incest taboo, because it denies us essential fulfillment {{with the parents}} whom we love with our primary energy, <b>forces</b> <b>us</b> to internalize those parents and constantly seek them. The incest taboo does the worst work of the culture... The destruction of the incest taboo {{is essential to the}} development of cooperative human community based on the free-flow of natural androgynous eroticism". Dworkin, however, does not explain if [...] "fulfillment" [...] is supposed to involve actual sexual intimacy, and one page earlier characterized what she meant by [...] "erotic relationships" [...] as relationships whose [...] "substance is nonverbal communication and touch", which she explicitly distinguished from what she referred to as [...] "fucking".|$|E
