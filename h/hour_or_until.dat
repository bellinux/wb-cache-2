40|$|Current {{clinical}} {{testing of}} autoregulatory failure involves the patient undergoing a head-up tilt test. This is an experiment {{to investigate the}} sequence of physiological events that lead to a syncopal episode by tilting the patient from supine to 70 % for up to an <b>hour,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the patient loses consciousness. This thesis argues that this test {{is no longer a}} suitable way of investigating these types of failures. An experiment was carried out to compare the effects of the tilt-test with a battery of other tests that have been used in the assessment of cerebrovascular autoregulation, namely carotid sinus massage, the transient hyperaemic response test, the Valsalva manoeuvre, and lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The first three tests were short, dynamic tests of autoregulation. The final test, and the tilt test, are longer, static tests. It was shown that lower body negative pressure produced more consistent results compared to the tilt-test, principally due to the stimulation of fewer systemic parameters by the test. The thesis also presents an experiment demonstrating for the first time measurement of blood flow to and from the brain during mild LBNP, using quantitative flow analysis conducted using magnetic resonance imaging. The results show a drop in cardiac output, which is reflected in a fall in blood flow in the carotid and vertebral arteries. The near-infrared spectroscopic data suggest that whist there was a drop in cerebral blood volume, sufficient perfusion was maintained through the test. This work provides a basis for future experiments, and the possibility of developing a more specific test to measure changes in blood concentrations locally in the cortex during LBNP.

40|$|Background: Physical {{exercise}} induces {{a pattern}} of hormonal and immunological responses that prevent endothelial dysfunction by maintaining the availability of nitric oxide (NO). Regular and moderate exercise stimulates NO release, that {{can be considered as}} protective factor of cardiovascular diseases, while strenuous exercise induces increased levels in a number of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) triggers endothelial activation which results in an increased vascular permeability. Nuclear gene factor kappa B (NF-κB) activates biological effect of TNF-α. Aim of Study: To determine the effect of physical exercise on the endothelial and skeletal muscle, we measured the level of NF-κB on rats’ serum, macrophages, and myocytes after strenuous physical exercise. Methods: 30 male Rattus norvegicus in the age of eight weeks were randomly divided into five groups (each containing six), and there were treated groups (T) and control group (C). The treated groups obtain strenuous physical exercise by ran on treadmill at 32 m/minutes for 1 <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> exhaustion. Blood samples, myocytes of gastrocnemius muscle, and intraperitoneal macrophages were collected sequentially. There were investigated immediately, 2 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours (T 1, T 2, T 3, and T 4) after sacrifice. The levels of NF-κB were measured by ELISA methods. Results: From our study, we found that the levels of NF-κB on myocytes in treated group from which its specimen was taken immediately (T 1), 2 hours after treadmill (T 2), and 6 hours after treadmill (T 3) were significantly higher than control group (p 0. 05). Also on macrophages, NF-κB in treated groups T 1, T 2, and T 3 was significantly higher than control group (p 0. 05). The level of serum NF-κB was not significantly different between treatment group as well as compared to control group (p> 0. 05). Serum NF-κB was significantly higher than the level on macrophages and myocytes (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that strenuous physical exercise stimulates the activation of NF-κB that plays a role in vascular inflammation and muscular damage, and may be recovered after resting period...|$|E

Subjective evaluations of MS symptom onset were taken using Graybiel's Diagnostic Criteria for Grading the Severity of Acute Motion Sickness and a 7 -Point nausea rating scale. Defence Research Development Canada's Sustained Operations task batteries were employed to measure cognitive performance and were administered every 10 minutes throughout the motion exposure. Physiological measures, including core body temperature and skin temperatures were sampled continuously throughout the trial at 1 second intervals. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences in the physiological responses, however there was a significant difference found in the 7 -point nausea scale rating evaluation of psychophysical responses. The placebo trial was significantly greater than any of the intervention trials. In addition to this significant difference, there were apparent rank order tendencies in response to the placebo and drug interventions. From these data there are trends indicating some drugs are better used in some scenarios, such as those requiring cognitive awareness and performance, while other drugs may be applied in situations where the main purpose is for the comfort of the passenger, or of someone whom vigilance and alertness is not required...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Meckel's {{diverticulum}} (MD) is {{the most}} common anomaly of the large intestinal tract (1 - 3 %) and is more frequent in children (62 % < 2 years) and in males (66 %). It often involves ectopic gastric mucosa which manifests through gastrointestinal bleeding in 50 % of cases. 99 m-Technetium scintigraphy (99 mTcO 4) is one of the procedures available for the non-invasive diagnosis of ectopic gastric mucosa. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (11 females, 17 males), including 16 children and 12 adults, aged 8 months- 80 years old, were included in the study. The patients were admitted to hospital for hematochezia and melena (22) associated with abdominal pain (5) : 3 patients repeatedly presented occult blood in their stools. Two patients only suffered from abdominal cramps and one only anemia. Patients were studied using plain abdominal radiographs and ultrasound; 10 underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy; radiological contrast studies were performed in 5 patients. All tests were inconclusive. All the patients were premedicated with oral cimetidine (20 mg/kg in pediatric patients and 300 mg q. i. d. for adults, 48 hours before the test) or with ranitidine i. v. (1 mg/kg, max 50 mg, in 20 minutes, one hour before the test); barium meals and colonoscopy were deferred for 2 - 3 days after examination. An intravenous injection of 37 - 180 Mbq of 99 mTcO 4 was given followed by a dynamic study of the abdomen in anterior projection. Images were acquired for one <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the visualisation of abnormal foci of intake: in this case, lateral and oblique images were acquired for a better localisation of the suspicious area. Some patients were administered furosemide i. v. (0. 75 mg/kg). All underwent a follow-up period of 12 months. RESULTS: Pertechnetate scintigraphy was positive in 10 cases and the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa was confirmed by surgery. The study was negative in 18 cases: 3 of them were discharged with a diagnosis of Salmonella infection, polyp of the small bowel or ulcer of the large bowel respectively; the other 15 patients did not show symptoms of onset during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the high diagnostic accuracy of pertechnetate scintigraphy to detect ectopic gastric mucosa if associated with H 2 -receptor-blocking agent premedication...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{evaluated}} gas exchange, pulmonary function, {{and lung}} histology during perfluorocarbon liquid ventilation (LV) {{when compared with}} gas ventilation (GV) {{in the setting of}} severe respiratory failure. BACKGROUND: The efficacy of LV in the setting of respiratory failure has been evaluated in premature animals with surfactant deficiency. However, very little work has been performed in evaluating the efficacy of LV in older animal models of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: A stable model of lung injury was induced in 12 young sheep weighing 16. 4 +/- 3. 0 kg using right atrial injection of 0. 07 mL/kg of oleic acid followed by saline pulmonary lavage and bijugular venovenous extracorporeal life support (ECLS). For the first 30 minutes on ECLS, all animals were ventilated with gas. Animals were then ventilated with either 15 mL/kg gas (GV, n = 6) or perflubron ([PFC], LV, n = 6) over the ensuing 2. 5 hours. Subsequently, ECLS was discontinued in five of the GV animals and five of the LV animals, and GV or LV continued for 1 <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> death. MAIN FINDINGS: Physiologic shunt (Qps/Qt) was significantly reduced in the LV animals when compared with the GV animals (LV = 31 +/- 10 %; GV = 93 +/- 4 %; p < 0. 001) after 3 hours of ECLS. At the same time point, pulmonary compliance (CT) was significantly increased in the LV group when compared with the GV group (LV = 1. 04 +/- 0. 19 mL/cm H 2 O/kg; GV = 0. 41 +/- 0. 02 mL/cm H 2 O/kg; p < 0. 001). In addition, the ECLS flow rate required to maintain the PaO 2 in the 50 - to 80 -mm Hg range was substantially and significantly lower in the LV group when compared with that of the GV group (LV = 14 +/- 5 mL/kg/min; GV = 87 +/- 15 mL/kg/min; p < 0. 001). All of the GV animals died after discontinuation of ECLS, whereas all the LV animals demonstrated effective gas exchange without extracorporeal support for 1 hour (p < 0. 01). Lung biopsy light microscopy demonstrated a marked reduction in alveolar hemorrhage, lung fluid accumulation, and inflammatory infiltration in the LV group when compared with the GV animals. CONCLUSION: In a model of severe respiratory failure, LV improves pulmonary gas exchange and compliance with an associated reduction in alveolar hemorrhage, edema, and inflammatory infiltrate...|$|E
