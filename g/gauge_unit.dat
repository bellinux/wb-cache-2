40|$|Segregation of {{hot mix asphalt}} (HMA) is a {{continuing}} problem in construction practice which has caused premature distress in many flexible pavements. A study, funded by the Kansas Department of Transportation, was conducted on a newly constructed pavement {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of indicator tests in detection of segregation. Cores were obtained from segregated and non-segregated areas of the pavement and the unit weights of the pavement were determined using a thin-lift nuclear gauge. The change gradation on the 4. 75 mm sieve was compared with the indicator tests of asphalt content, i. e., nuclear <b>gauge</b> <b>unit</b> weight, core unit weight and macrotexture. The results of this study indicate that asphalt content is the best indicator test of segregation whilst macrotexture is the best non-destructive indicator test of segregation...|$|E
40|$|IN a {{previous}} paper ' a method {{was described by}} which masticatory loads could be recorded, using a resistance wire strain gauge small enough to be ac-commodated in a molar tooth. Since then, this apparatus has been constructed for 7 subjects, and data from 4 of them are presented in this paper. METHOD In every subject, {{all of whom had}} complete or nearly complete dentitions, a lower molar tooth was chosen which had already been fairly extensively restored. Two lower left first molars, 1 lower left second molar and 1 lower right first molar were used. The preparation of the chosen tooth and the construction of the strain gauge apparatus followed the technic previously described. Records were obtained with a Wheatstone bridge circuit, D. C. amplifier, and oscilloscope and were photographed. Calibration of the strain <b>gauge</b> <b>unit</b> took place outside the mouth before and after every chewing sequence, and, if the calibrations differed, the records obtained in the mouth were discarded...|$|E

The novel design meets the set of functional requirements for track switching solutions, in addition to offering several features that the current designs are unable to offer, in particular to enable multi-channel actuation and rail locking, and provide a degree of fault tolerance. This paper describes the design and operation of this switching concept, from requirements capture and solution generation through to the construction of the laboratory demonstrator.
