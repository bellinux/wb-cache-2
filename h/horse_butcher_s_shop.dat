He looked like a transport worker; the high-buttoned formal jacket looked strange on him. His closely-cropped skull rested upon a bull neck. In spite of the faint light, he looked suntanned and healthy. Never before had I seen executioner Gröpler from Magdeburg. But as he passed me with a slight bow, I knew it was him. Anyone who had any business in the Criminal Court of Justice knew about Gröpler. He had been a <b>horse</b> <b>butcher</b> previously.... each month he collected a small fixed salary, and had in return to be ready with his massive axe and his three skilled assistants at the demand of the State attorney. For every execution he received 300 Marks plus his expenses. Gröpler went in to see his customers....

40|$|The view of {{a butcher}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shop</b> {{provides}} picturesque theorist Uvedale Price with a crucial example in his consideration {{of the role of}} disgust in aesthetics. This paper analyses Price 2 ̆ 7 s theory in light of Derrida 2 ̆ 7 s essay on disgust in Kant 2 ̆ 7 s aesthetic. Price 2 ̆ 7 s ideas are explosively reversible and provide a definite historical instance of the collapse of 2 ̆ 7 economimesis 2 ̆ 7 onto the socio-political economy which Derrida claims is implicit in Kant. The theme of an aesthetic disgust can be found more generally in aesthetics and in critiques of the aesthetic attitude and this is one reason for the historical success of the picturesque. Price 2 ̆ 7 s theory is intended to be applicable to landscape architecture and rural buildings, and it is argued that the butcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shop</b> in Price is a deferral of the larger question of the relation of architecture to the informe (un-formedness) of vernacular buildings. Cottage hovels and villages are in Price 2 ̆ 7 s time so much viscera. Doubly disgusting they are the waste cut from the countryside in the production of idealized landscapes, while their stench of poverty and treason arises from the shortage of food. Certain 19 th century architects, reading Price over-literally, indulge the unlikely fantasy of a landlord constructing ornamental butcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shops</b> for the labourers who could not afford bread. Today the picturesque in architecture disgusts somewhat. It is identified with the sensual pleasing of escape into images, with a lack of the smell and squeals of real urban and contemporary materials. Yet this is an anachronism, a distortion by Nikolaus Pevsner and Gordon Cullen of the historical picturesque which always had a taste for piquancy. If we wish to understand the fascination of modern architects with banality, ugliness, and brutality, and if we thought it useful to distinguish this from Renaissance grotesques and neo-Classical sublimity, then the picturesque will supply us with a cleaver and a knife...|$|R
