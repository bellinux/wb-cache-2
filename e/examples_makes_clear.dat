40|$|Suburbane Räume als Kulturlandschaften zu denken, stellt in der deutschen Forschungstradition noch immer eine Provokation dar. Genau diese Perspektive fi ndet sich aber zunehmend in der internationalen Raumforschung. Zudem wird ein solches Denken auch in einigen europäischen Dokumenten zur Raumentwicklung gefordert. In diesem Sinne versteht auch das 3. Leitbild "Ressourcen bewahren, Kulturlandschaften gestalten" der bundesdeutschen Raumordnung aus dem Jahr 2006 alle Räume als Kulturlandschaften, also auch die suburbanen, und sieht ein solches Kulturlandschaftsverständnis insgesamt als wichtige {{qualitative}} Ergänzung traditioneller Raumentwicklungspolitik. Dieser Band will zeigen, dass der kulturlandschaftliche Blick tatsächlich dazu beitragen kann, eine neue Wahrnehmung auf suburbane Räume zu strukturieren, denn er hilft, ökologische, ästhetische, kulturelle und lebensweltliche Qualitäten auch in diesen Räumen aufzudecken, obgleich sie ihnen bisweilen abgesprochen werden. Das bedeutet eine Erweiterung der bislang eher funktionalen Perspektive der Raumordnung auf diesen hybriden Raumtypus und kann als Ausgangspunkt für adäquate Formen kooperativer Regionalentwicklungspolitik genutzt werden, wie an Beispielen verdeutlicht wird. The conceptualisation {{of suburban}} spaces as cultural landscapes still represents a provocation within the German research tradition. It is, however, increasingly common in international spatial research. Indeed, several policy documents concerning European spatial development call for suburban spaces {{to be seen}} as cultural landscapes. Similarly, the 2006 German Spatial Planning guideline “Preserving resources, shaping cultural landscapes” understands all spaces, including suburban, as cultural landscapes and sees cultural landscapes overall as being an important qualitative supplement to traditional spatial development policy. This volume is intended to show that the cultural landscape viewpoint can indeed contribute to the structuring of a new perception of suburban spaces, as it helps to uncover the ecological, aesthetic, cultural and everyday qualities of these spaces, the very existence of which is not always acknowledged. This involves extending the rather functional way in which spatial planning sees this hybrid spatial type and can thus represent a starting point for more adequate forms of cooperative regional development policy, as the <b>examples</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work solves a fuel cell-battery {{hybrid vehicle}} (FCHV) power {{management}} problem using the embedding approach to hybrid (switched) optimal control problems. The FCHV is a switched system with three distinct modal configurations (modes) : electric motor propelling/battery discharging, propelling/charging, and generating/charging. Each powertrain mode {{has a distinct}} set of dynamics and constraints. A supervisory-level switched system power flow model is developed as an interconnection of powertrain subsystems using component dynamical/algebraic models appropriate to power flow management. Given the model, a hybrid model predictive control strategy is set forth based on a minimization of a performance index (PI) that trades off velocity tracking error, {{battery state of charge}} variance, and electric drive and hydrogen fuel usages while penalizing frictional braking to encourage regenerative braking. The embedding approach representation of the optimization problem is solved, after applying collocation, with MATLAB 2 ̆ 7 s fmincon to compute mode switches and continuous time controls. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology, an example mid-size sedan FCHV is simulated using five driving velocity profiles, which include three regulatory profiles. Drive cycle fuel consumption is shown to be lower than that from the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy, a popular power management strategy. Finally, mode and continuous control projection are required in the infrequent case when the embedding approach solution does not result in a switched system solution; the projection methods used during the simulations are justified with an empirical study. The study 2 ̆ 7 s goal was to identify which of the eight mode and control projection combinations tested results in the least error between the embedding approach solution and simulated switched system costs. ^ This work also demonstrates the superiority of the embedding approach over alternative methods for solving hybrid optimal control problems. The embedding approach is compared to multi-parametric programming, mixed-integer programming, gradient-descent based methods, and CPLEX in the context of five published examples: a spring-mass system, moving-target tracking for a mobile robot, two-tank filling, DC-DC boost converter, and a skid-steered vehicle.
