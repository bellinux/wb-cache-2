5000|$|Primatology, paleoanthropology, {{and other}} related fields are split on their usage of the synonymous infraorder names, Simiiformes and Anthropoidea. According to Robert Hoffstetter (and {{supported}} by Colin Groves), the term Simiiformes has priority over Anthropoidea because of the taxonomic term Simii by van der Hoeven, from which it is constructed, dates to 1833. In contrast, Anthropoidea by Mivart dates to 1864, while Simiiformes by Haeckel dates to 1866, leading <b>to</b> <b>counterclaims</b> of priority. Hoffstetter also argued that Simiiformes is also constructed like a proper infraorder name (ending in -iformes), whereas Anthropoidea ends in -oidea, which is reserved for superfamilies. He also noted that Anthropoidea is too easily confused with [...] "anthropoïdes", which translates to [...] "apes" [...] from several languages.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} legal regime governing counterclaims in investor-State disputes. It challenges the frequent presumption that the right <b>to</b> assert <b>counterclaims</b> is hindered {{by the fact that}} investment treaties impose no obligations on foreign investors and only protect their rights. The paper demonstrates that the right <b>to</b> assert <b>counterclaims</b> is a procedural right, and subject matter jurisdiction over counterclaims depends on whether the investor has breached obligations found in applicable law. The paper shows that foreign investors’ substantive obligations can be found in sources of international law other than investment treaties. The paper also highlights the difficulties of asserting counterclaims in non-commercial areas such as human rights and environmental protection. Finally, it also shows that tribunals may pierce the corporate veil of foreign investors in the context of counterclaims...|$|R
