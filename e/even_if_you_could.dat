60|$|I {{believe that}} Mr. Arthur Morrison is a {{connection}} of yours, and I am venturing to introduce myself {{to you as a}} friend of his. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> spare me half-an-hour of your company after the performance of this <b>evening?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> honor me so much, you might perhaps allow me to give you some supper.|$|R

6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} that you would expect me, master," [...] she said, [...] "but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had I <b>could</b> not have come. Do you think that one could stand still like a statue for hours when great things were being done, when the people were getting their liberty again, and the flag of the despot was being pulled down from the Tuileries. I have blood in my veins, master, not ice." ...|$|R

6000|$|Olive {{did not get}} angry. [...] "He is not impertinent," [...] said she. [...] "He {{knows nothing}} in this world but that I once loved him, and that now he loves me. Employer and {{employee}} are nothing to him. I don't believe he would go if you told him to, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do such a thing, which I don't believe you would, for, of course, you would {{think of me as}} well as of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{me a good}} turn," [...] he said, [...] "and you're a man. You've the pluck--that's what I like. You knew nothing, {{you were}} as green and ignorant {{as a young man}} from behind the counter of a country shop, but, my God! you'd got the right stuff, and I meant getting <b>even</b> with <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I <b>could.</b> You'll leave here with me to-morrow, and in three weeks we sail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In plain words, I do," [...] she admitted. [...] "Russia's {{intentions}} concerning {{that are}} trembling in the balance. Germany is pressing her hard. Nothing will be finally decided until I return to Petrograd. You see, I {{speak to you}} quite openly, for I myself have had some experience of your present statesmen. I believe <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to repeat this conversation {{to any one of}} them, <b>if,</b> <b>even,</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> open their eyes to what is happening, they would only shrug their shoulders and say that they relied for their protection on the League of Nations." ...|$|R

I should think when Gilliat sees a copy of those papers Mr. Danvers sent us, he will be convinced {{that he has been}} wrong all through, but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> he isn't, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not argue the matter with him. Mr. Levine could say a great deal more than <b>you</b> <b>could.</b> I quite understand, from what you told me, that there is really nothing to connect this woman with the theft; still, anyone could see that it would be more likely that she should do it than I should.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] replied his father, [...] "we are all {{surrounded}} and enveloped with air. It spreads {{in every}} direction all around us, and rises many miles above us. Whereas, in respect to water, you had one little stream before you, which you could manage just as you pleased. If you were {{down at the bottom}} of the sea, then the water would be all around you and above you; and there, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> live there, you could not have a dam." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well; but be {{sure you}} take notice of the exact {{position}} of the stone, or {{you may not be}} able to find it again yourself. One big stone is a good deal like another. Choose a stone with a tree growing near it, and make a cross with your knife on the bark. That will serve as a guide to you, and you would recognize the stone by it <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not find it in any other way." ...|$|E

When he can get to it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you. But you {{will not be able to}} see him, my poor child, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could,</b> it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition." ...|$|E
30|$|The paper survey {{indicated}} that 74.1 % of respondents treated water before drinking it, and the interviews substantiate this finding but also reveal some {{skepticism about the}} effectiveness with which home treatment is administered. Of 19 interviewees, 14 were familiar with home water treatment methods, four {{did not mention the}} subject in their interview, and only one interviewee (a resident of Leogane) was not familiar with home water treatment. Fourteen interviewees stated that they treat their water before drinking, though one individual also relayed that some people “drink from the well without treating it.” Three interviewees viewed home water treatment as a solution to the water problem, and only one person did not think it was an appropriate solution. However, even those with a favorable view of home treatment may still be interested in a centralized water supply. One local explained his preferred solution: “divert the water into people’s homes. The water would be treated but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> it wasn't <b>you</b> <b>could</b> treat it at home.” In the post-workshop survey, > 90 % of participants {{indicated that}} it is important (Likert score 4.87, see Table  4) that training and support be provided for people to treat water at home so it is safe to drink.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] Maxwell answered, with a {{shade of}} vexation. [...] "That wouldn't do. You couldn't have a scene, or, at least, {{not a whole}} act, without women. Of course I {{understand}} that. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> keep {{the attention of the}} audience without them, through the importance of the intrigue, still you would have to have them {{for the sake of the}} stage-picture. The drama is literature that makes a double appeal; it appeals to the sense as well as the intellect, and the stage is half the time merely a picture-frame. I had to think that out pretty early." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{very dear}} Cousin,--Your {{kindness}} having touched me much, and your good opinion, whether literary or otherwise, being of great price to me, {{it is even}} with {{tears in my eyes}} that I begin to write to you upon a difference between us. And what am I to say? To admit, of course, in the first place, the injuriousness to the 'popularity,' of the scriptural tone. But am I to sacrifice a principle to popularity? Would you advise me to do so? Should I be more worthy of your kindness by doing so? and could you (apart from the kindness) call my refusal to do so either perverseness or obstinacy? <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could,</b> I hope you will try a little to be patient with me, and to forgive, at least, what you find it impossible to approve.|$|E

It is only necessary, however, in {{this matter}} that you should {{understand}} the principle; for {{it would never be}} possible for you to gradate your scales so truly as to make them practically accurate and serviceable; and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could,</b> unless you had about ten thousand scales, and were able to change them faster than ever juggler changed cards, you could not in a day measure the tints on so much as one side of a frost-bitten apple. But when once you fully understand the principle, and see how all colors contain as it were a certain quantity of darkness, or power of dark relief from white--some more, some less; and how this pitch or power of each may be represented by equivalent values of gray, you will soon be able to arrive shrewdly at an approximation by a glance of the eye, without any measuring scale at all.|$|E

[...] "Oh, Godwin and Wulf! <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{know how}} she thought of and made ready everything; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have seen how all those cruel men glared at us, searching out our very souls! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have heard how high she {{answered}} them, waving that ring before their eyes and bidding them to obey its presence, or to die!" ...|$|R

60|$|I take it {{that when}} you asked me for a Don Juan play you did not want that sort of thing. Nobody does: the successes such plays {{sometimes}} obtain are due to the incidental conventional melodrama with which the experienced popular author instinctively saves himself from failure. But what did you want? Owing to your unfortunate habit--you now, I hope, feel its inconvenience--of not explaining yourself, I have had to discover this for myself. First, then, I have had to ask myself, what is a Don Juan? Vulgarly, a libertine. But your dislike of vulgarity is pushed {{to the length of}} a defect (universality of character is impossible without a share of vulgarity); and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> acquire the taste, you would find yourself overfed from ordinary sources without troubling me. So I took it that you demanded a Don Juan in the philosophic sense.|$|E

Besides being buyer, you would go up the country, and see to the felling and getting the timber down to the coast, as you have often done before. He knows how absolutely I trust you, and how much you have done for me, {{and he said that he}} should be very glad to have you in charge of the buying side of the work, here. Besides, you know you have now a wife and children and, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> make yourself comfortable in England, they would never be able to do so; and the bitter cold that we sometimes have, in winter, would try them terribly, and might even carry them all off." ...|$|E

There are millions of others, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only find them, who understand, too--men too great to come out from their studies and talk claptrap to the mob.

6000|$|... "I {{wish that}} I could have lent you {{a hand in}} the fight," [...] Enghien said, [...] "but the Bavarians had fallen back into the woods, and we knew not whether they still held their ground there. In the rain and {{darkness}} it would have been dangerous to have crossed the broken ground with its woods and ravines, and the troops, after their exertions and heavy marches, were incapable of such an effort. Indeed, I had lost fully half my infantry, and the cavalry would be useless for such work. You must indeed have been sorely pressed, having Merci's whole force to contend with. Still, I had no doubt <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not issue from the defile you would be able to check the enemy."

Do not think that I am the less obliged to you for your disinterested kindness,--for I {{know that it is}} disinterested; but this I think I may {{confidently}} say, that not even to avert so terrible a calamity will I again put my name to any bill. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take my own promise to pay without the addition of any second name, I would not do it." [...] There was nothing for Mr. Forrest to do under such circumstances but simply to drive back to Barchester. He had done the best for the young clergyman according to his lights, and perhaps, in a worldly view, his advice had not been bad. But Mark dreaded the very name of a bill. He was as a dog that had been terribly scorched, and nothing should again induce him to go near the fire.|$|E
