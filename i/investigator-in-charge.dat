25|$|In 2005, the NTSB and the FBI {{entered into}} a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that states that, “n the {{immediate}} aftermath of a transportation accident, the NTSB is the presumptive lead investigative agency and will assume control of the accident scene.” The FBI may still conduct a criminal investigation, but the NTSB investigation has priority. When investigative priority remains with the NTSB, the FBI must coordinate its investigative activities with the NTSB <b>investigator-in-charge.</b> This authority includes interviewing witnesses. The MOU states that: “his procedure is intended…to ensure that neither NTSB nor FBI investigative activity unnecessarily complicates or compromises the other agency’s investigation. The new statutory language and the MOU have improved coordination between the NTSB and FBI since the TWA flight 800 accident. Today, FBI and NTSB personnel conduct joint exercises. They can call upon one another’s laboratories and other assets. The NTSB and the FBI have designated liaisons to ensure that information flows between agencies, and to coordinate on-scene operations.|$|E

2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) <b>investigator-in-charge</b> (IIC) {{reviewed}} {{the data from}} the Outerlink system. The satellite data indicated that the helicopter departed from 94CL and flew towards the Cajon Pass in a northwest direction. The flight path then followed the northbound Interstate 15 until it had almost reached the summit of the Cajon Pass. The global positioning system (GPS) tracked the helicopter as it continued toward the northeast while the Interstate turned toward the north.

50|$|The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) is {{the federal}} agency {{responsible}} for investigating incidents that occur with rail transportation, and has launched an investigation immediately after the accident. The main <b>investigator-in-charge</b> was Tom Griffith, {{who has been a}} senior investigator with the TSB since 1990. He has led 28 other rail investigations in his career.|$|E

He was involved in several major aircraft accident investigation such as being the chief investigator of the Mount Erebus Disaster, the DC-10 accident in Antarctica in which 257 lives were lost.|$|E

After the film was released Benzon said: [...] I {{do not know why}} the writer and director chose to twist the role of the NTSB into such an inaccurate depiction. Their treatment of the NTSB went very far beyond cinematic license into simple mean-spirited dishonesty. The movie may actually be detrimental to aviation safety. Pilots involved in accidents will now expect harsh, unfair treatment by investigators.|$|E
5000|$|During the investigation, the NTSB and the FBI {{clashed with}} each other many times. The {{agencies}} needed a detailed protocol describing which agency takes the lead when it is initially unclear whether an event is an accident or a criminal act. 49 Code of Federal Regulations 831.5 specified in 1996 (as it does now) that the NTSB’s aviation accident investigations have priority over all other federal investigations. After the TWA flight 800 investigation, the NTSB recognized the need for better clarity. The NTSB sought and secured language to clarify the issue in 49 USC 1131(a)(2)(B), which was amended in 2000 to read: [...] If the Attorney General, {{in consultation with the}} Chairman of the NTSB, determines and notifies the NTSB that circumstances reasonably indicate that the accident may have been caused by an intentional criminal act, the NTSB shall relinquish investigative priority to the FBI. The relinquishment of investigative priority by the NTSB shall not otherwise affect the authority of the NTSBto continue its investigation under this section https://twa800.sites.usa.gov/improvements/ In 2005, the NTSB and the FBI entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that states that, “in the immediate aftermath of a transportation accident, the NTSB is the presumptive lead investigative agency and will assume control of the accident scene.” The FBI may still conduct a criminal investigation, but the NTSB investigation has priority.
