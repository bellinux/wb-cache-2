25|$|The {{chromosomal}} {{defect in}} the Philadelphia chromosome is a translocation, in which parts of two chromosomes, 9 and 22, swap places. The result is that a <b>fusion</b> <b>gene</b> is created by juxtaposing the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 (region q34) to {{a part of the}} BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22 (region q11). This is a reciprocal translocation, creating an elongated chromosome 9 (termed a derivative chromosome, or der 9), and a truncated chromosome 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome, 22q-). In agreement with the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN), this chromosomal translocation is designated as t(9;22)(q34;q11). The symbol ABL is derived from Abelson, the name of a leukemia virus which carries a similar protein.|$|E

25|$|Cancer {{can be seen}} as a {{disturbance}} in the homeostatic balance between cell growth and cell death. Over-expression of anti-apoptotic genes, and under-expression of pro-apoptotic genes, can result in the lack of cell death that is characteristic of cancer. An example can be seen in lymphomas. The over-expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in lymphocytes alone does not cause cancer. But simultaneous over-expression of Bcl-2 and the proto-oncogene myc may produce aggressive B-cell malignancies including lymphoma. In follicular lymphoma, a chromosomal translocation commonly occurs between the fourteenth and the eighteenth chromosomes — t(14;18) — which places the Bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18 next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This <b>fusion</b> <b>gene</b> is deregulated, leading to the transcription of excessively high levels of Bcl-2. This decreases the propensity of these cells for apoptosis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fusion</b> <b>genes</b> {{caused by}} {{chromosomal}} rearrangements {{are a common}} and important feature in haematological malignancies, but have until recently been seen as unimportant in epithelial cancers. The discovery of recurrent <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> in prostate and lung cancer suggests that <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> may {{play an important role}} in epithelial carcinogenesis, and that they have been previously under-reported due to the difficulties of cytogenetic analysis of solid tumours. In particular, breast cancers often have complex, highly rearranged karyotypes which have proved difficult to analyse using classical cytogenetic techniques. The aim of this project was to search for <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> in breast cancer by using high-resolution mapping of chromosome rearrangements in breast cancer cell lines. Mapping the chromosome rearrangements was initially done using high-resolution DNA microarrays and fluorescence in- situ hybridisation, but moved to high-throughput sequencing as it became available. Interesting candidate genes identified from the mapped chromosome rearrangements were investigated on a larger set of cell lines and primary tumours. The complete karyotypes of two breast cancer cell lines were constructed using a combination of microarrays, fluorescence microscopy, and high-throughput sequencing. A number of potential <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> were identified in these two cell lines. Although no expressed <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> were found, the complete karyotypes gave insight into the number and mechanisms of chromosome rearrangement in breast cancer, and identified interesting candidate genes which may be of importance in tumourigenesis. Two genes which were fused in other breast cancer cell lines, BCAS 3 and ODZ 4, were disrupted by chromosome rearrangements and identified as interesting candidate genes in tumorigenesis. A bioinformatic pipeline to process high-throughput sequencing data was set up and validated, and shown to more accurately predict <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> than other methods, and can be used to investigate further cell lines and tumours for recurrent <b>fusion</b> <b>genes.</b> The pipeline was used to analyse data from 3 other breast cancer cell lines and predict chromosomal rearrangements and <b>fusion</b> <b>genes,</b> several of which were found to be expressed. Of the fusions predicted in the cell line ZR- 75 - 30, 7 expressed <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> were identified, and may have functional significance in breast cancer.

Background: In subsets of adipocytic tumors, {{specific}} chromosomal translocations lead to {{the generation}} of <b>fusion</b> <b>genes.</b> The high mobility group A 2 (HMGA 2) -lipoma preferred partner (LPP) and the reciprocal LPP-HMGA 2 represent such <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> in lipoma, while the human translocation liposarcoma (TLS) -CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) and the Ewing sarcoma (EWS) -CHOP in liposarcoma.

2500|$|The Philadelphia {{chromosome}} or Philadelphia translocation is {{a specific}} genetic abnormality in chromosome 22 of leukemia cancer cells (particularly chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells). This chromosome is defective and unusually short because of reciprocal translocation of genetic material between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, and contains a <b>fusion</b> <b>gene</b> called BCR-ABL1. This gene is the ABL1 gene of chromosome 9 juxtaposed onto the BCR gene of chromosome 22, coding for a hybrid protein: a tyrosine kinase signalling protein that is [...] "always on", causing the cell to divide uncontrollably.|$|E
2500|$|The Abl gene {{expresses a}} membrane-associated protein, a {{tyrosine}} kinase, and the BCR-Abl transcript is also {{translated into a}} tyrosine kinase. The activity of tyrosine kinases is typically regulated in an auto-inhibitory fashion, but the BCR-Abl <b>fusion</b> <b>gene</b> codes for a protein that is [...] "always on" [...] or continuously activated leading to unregulated cell division (i.e. cancer). This {{is due to the}} replacement of the myristoylated cap region, which when present induces a conformational change rendering the kinase domain inactive, with a truncated portion of the BCR protein. Although the BCR region also expresses serine/threonine kinases, the tyrosine kinase function is very relevant for drug therapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as imatinib and sunitinib) are important drugs against a variety of cancers including CML, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).|$|E

40|$|Pediatric cancers {{differ from}} adult tumors, {{especially}} {{by their very}} low mutational rate. Therefore, their etiology could be explained in part by other oncogenic mechanisms such as chromosomal rearrangements, supporting the possible implication of <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> {{in the development of}} pediatric cancers. <b>Fusion</b> <b>genes</b> result from chromosomal rearrangements leading to the juxtaposition of two genes.
