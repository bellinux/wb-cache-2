40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that greater global and situational relationship satisfaction would reduce the negative impact of threatening information on acute pain. Design. An experimental design was used to manipulate threat and elicit acute pain via a cold pressor task. Setting. The study was completed in a research laboratory at a large urban university in the Midwestern USA. Subjects. Participants were 134 couples, in which at least one individual was an undergraduate student. Methods. After administration of a global relationship satisfaction measure, couples were randomly assigned to either receive high or low threatening information about the painful task. Following the threat manipulation, couples discussed the upcoming task and rated their satisfaction with the interaction (i. e., situational relationship satisfaction). The <b>designated</b> pain <b>participant</b> then completed the painful task alone. Results. The threat manipulation altered couples' perceived threat of pain. Situational relationship satisfaction moderated the effect of threat on pain trajectories such that situational relationship satisfaction predicted less pain intensity at an earlier point in the task for the low threat condition than the high threat condition. Greater global relationship satisfaction predicted greater likelihood of task completion among those in the low threat condition, whereas it was unrelated to task completion in the high threat condition. Greater global relationship satisfaction also predicted lower pain intensity throughout the task. Conclusions. These findings demonstrate that the interpersonal context is independently related to acute pain and may also alter the effect of threatening information on acute pain...|$|R

40|$|Research into {{instructional}} animations {{has produced}} inconsistent results. Some {{studies have found}} animations superior to static pictures, while others have found no differences, or even advantages in favour of statics. These mixed results have often puzzled researchers because animations have a greater flexibility than static pictures in depicting physical and temporal changes. Several factors have been proposed to explain {{the lack of a}} clear pattern, including poorly designed studies with a number of biases, and failure to consider moderating factors such as gender and spatial ability. However, one explanation on why animations can be ineffective is that, they are a cause of transient information, which requires extra working memory resources to process and therefore hinders learning. However, there is a special case for learning human movement tasks where animations do not create additional cognitive load because humans have evolved to learn about movement through observations. This thesis continues the research into comparing animations and statics using a human movement task (building Lego shapes). It also examines the impact of gender and spatial ability (and the relationship between the two) on learning from both animations and statics. Furthermore, some embodied cognition effects are investigated in the form of gesturing and observing hands manipulating the shapes. Four experiments were conducted with university students having an equal number of males and females, randomly assigned to the <b>designated</b> conditions. <b>Participants</b> were required to observe a Lego construction, and then rebuild it. Spatial ability was measured and statistically controlled in the analysis. Results (Experiments 1, 2 & 3) did not show any animation advantages; however, there was a consistent gender-presentation format interaction effect where females performed better after observing animations while males performed better with static pictures. Furthermore, in contrast to the gesturing research, gesturing was found to be impedimental to learning, as was the observation of hands (Experiment 4). Furthermore, the best predictors of male performance were objective measures of spatial ability, whereas for females self-rating measures were best. Overall it was found that gender plays a significant role in animation research as do a number of other moderating factors...|$|R
