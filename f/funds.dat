5|$|This section {{covers the}} actual management, or handling, of <b>funds</b> {{pertaining}} {{to a federal}} program, specifically on how federal assistance is distributed to recipients and how recipients manage the <b>funds</b> until disbursement. The actual transfer of <b>funds,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} “drawdowns”, is usually done electronically by requesting the <b>funds</b> to the federal agency via website or a network. The <b>funds</b> are automatically transferred from the US Department of Treasury to the recipient’s bank account. Federal assistance for program operations is provided to recipients usually by one of two methods, also called “funding techniques”: by either advances of <b>funds</b> or by reimbursement of <b>funds.</b>|$|E

5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising rebates paid to its American franchises by Coca Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these <b>funds</b> to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} corporate advertising costs were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008). The NFA contended that Burger King Corporation improperly redirected 40% of restaurant operating <b>funds</b> (ROF) paid by the two beverage suppliers to franchises since 1990 into the corporate advertising budget. These <b>funds</b> were often used by the franchises to pay for beverage support systems such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the <b>funds</b> would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012. These <b>funds</b> often helped the franchises' bottom lines, as they were often used to offset other costs imposed on the franchises by Burger King, such as the $1 (USD) Double Cheeseburger.|$|E

5|$|Advances of <b>funds</b> – Advances are federal <b>funds</b> {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal <b>funds</b> received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request <b>funds</b> only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of <b>funds</b> to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E
