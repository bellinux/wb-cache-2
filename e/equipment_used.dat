5|$|The {{performance}} of a solar park {{is a function of}} the climatic conditions, the <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> and the system configuration.

This takes into account snow physics, methods for packing snow and surface shaping, and the <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> for these functions. Also key is the layout of grooming and track setting in the stadium with various formats for starts, finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, Monsanto rented {{three floors}} of a {{warehouse}} at 601 East Third Street from General Electric. Initially {{it was used}} to receive and store <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> by the Project. Later the fourth floor was used as office space, and a laboratory was established on the fifth floor where studies were carried out on the effects of polonium on laboratory animals. Analysis of bioassay samples was carried out there to minimize the danger of polonium contamination of the samples.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th Century, an {{estimated}} $2 billion was spent annually in North America on roadway winter maintenance, owing to snow and other winter weather events, {{according to a}} 1994 report by Kuemmel. The study surveyed the practices of jurisdictions within 44 US states and nine Canadian provinces. It assessed the policies, practices, and <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> for winter maintenance. It found similar practices and progress to be prevalent in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Of Human Feelings was {{recorded}} with a Sony PCM-1600 two-track digital recorder, a rare item at the time. According to journalist Howard Mandel, the passages {{played by the}} band sounded neither very soft or loud on the album, {{because it had been}} mixed with a middle-frequency range and compressed dynamics. Because of the <b>equipment</b> <b>used,</b> Coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided overdubbing, multi-tracking, and remixing. According to him, Of Human Feelings was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Over 3 million {{vessels are}} {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|E
5|$|Snow figures {{into many}} winter sports {{and forms of}} recreation, {{including}} skiing and sledding. Common examples include cross-country skiing, Alpine skiing, snowboarding, snow shoeing, and snowmobiling. The design of the <b>equipment</b> <b>used,</b> typically relies on the bearing strength of snow, as with skis or snowboards and contends with the coefficient of friction of snow to allow sliding, often enhance by ski waxes.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Hornets {{were very}} similar to the {{standard}} USNavy variants, but incorporated a number of minor modifications. These included the addition of an Instrument Landing System/Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (ILS/VOR) system, a high-frequency radio, a different ejection seat harness and the deletion of all <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> only to launch the aircraft from catapults. In addition, two of the Australian aircraft were fitted with flight-test instrumentation so that they could be used as part of trials.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{equipment}} of a 4th-century foot soldier was {{essentially the same}} as in the 2nd century: metal armour cuirass, metal helmet, shield and sword. Some evolution took place during the 3rd century. Trends included the adoption of warmer clothing; the disappearance of distinctive legionary armour and weapons; the adoption by the infantry of <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> by the cavalry in the earlier period; and the greater use of heavily armoured cavalry called cataphracts.|$|E

5|$|Two mini-series {{were also}} produced. The first, G.I. Joe: Order of Battle, was a 4-issue mini-series running from December 1986 to March 1987, reprinting the data {{found on the}} action figures' file cards with some edits. Written by Hama, with all-new artwork by Trimpe, the first two issues {{featured}} G.I. Joe members, while the third issue focused on the members of Cobra Command, and the fourth highlighted the vehicles and <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> by both organizations. A trade-paperback edition, which included material from all four issues, was published in 1987.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|Amanda caused heavy {{damage in}} the {{northeast}} Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Panhandle. In addition to sinking the USS Amanda, several other ships encountered the storm or were also capsized. At least 38deaths occurred at sea. In St. Marks, Florida, strong winds destroyed homes and fences, {{as well as the}} salt works, ruining about 40,000bushels of salt. Storm surge inundated crops and the railroad tracks. A total of 40people and 48mules and oxen drowned. An additional 32people drowned at Dickerson Bay and Goose Creek. Some coastal forts were damaged, while tents and <b>equipment</b> <b>used</b> by Confederate troops were lost. In Tallahassee, heavy rainfall and severe gales were reported, damaging homes and other properties. The hurricane caused upward of 110fatalities.|$|E
