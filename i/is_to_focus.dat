25|$|One {{approach}} to capture {{most of the}} information present in data would be to use many statistics, but the accuracy and stability of ABC appears to decrease rapidly with an increasing numbers of summary statistics.

25|$|Relative to training, a mastery-oriented {{approach}} {{has been shown to}} be an effective way to bolster self-efficacy. In such an approach, the goal of training <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on mastering skills or tasks rather than focusing on an immediate performance-related outcome. Individuals who believe that mastery can be achieved through training and practice are more likely to develop greater self-efficacy than those who see mastery as a product of inherent talent than is largely immutable.|$|E

However, there is often an emphasis on cognitive restructuring due to the deep-seated nature of the trauma.

25|$|If the Southern Maya Area {{is a part}} of Mesoamerica {{delineated}} {{from the}} rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call this or that civilization “great”? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” Another way <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription, peer polity interaction, and other theories.|$|E
25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in scanning probe microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.|$|E
25|$|User {{submission}} to the database is encouraged. To {{contribute to the}} database, one must submit: contact info, PubMed identifier and the two molecules that interact. The person who submits a record {{is the owner of}} it. All records are validated before being made public and BIND is curated for quality assurance. BIND curation has two tracks: high-throughput (HTP) and low-throughput (LTP). HTP records are from papers which have reported more than 40 interaction results from one experimental methodology. HTP curators typically have a bioinformatics backgrounds. The HTP curators are responsible for the collection of storage of experimental data and they also create scripts to update BIND based on new publications. LTP records are curated by individuals with either an MSc or PhD and laboratory experience in interaction research. LTP curators are given further training through the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops. Information on small molecule chemistry is curated separately by chemists to ensure the curator is knowledgeable about the subject. The priority for BIND curation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on LTP to collect information as it is published. Although, HTP studies provide more information at once, there are more LTP studies being reported and similar numbers of interactions are being reported by both tracks. In 2004, BIND collected data from 110 journals.|$|E

500|$|Tornadas {{can serve}} {{a number of}} {{purposes}} within poems; they often contain useful information about the poem's composition—often {{able to identify the}} location and date of the poem's composition, and the identity of members of the troubadour's circle—and several tornadas serve as dedications to a friend or patron of the poet. An additional purpose of the tornada <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> and reflect on the theme of the poem, commenting on the surrounding material within the poem, and to act as a concluding stanza for the poem. [...] However, the device can sometimes be used to create new narrative material. [...] For instance, in Marcabru's pastorela “L’autrier jost’una sebissa” (trans. [...] "The other day along a hedgerow"), the narrator is attracted to a shepherdess for her feisty wit and professes that [...] "country-men want country-women / in places where all wisdom's lacking." [...] The shepherdess' reply in the tornada: [...] "and some will gawk before a painting / while others wait to see real manna." [...] serves to [...] " [...] some tension with the enigma she seems to introduce suddenly at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{stories of}} the core Shin Megami Tensei titles {{frequently}} include fighting against a tyrannical God. The method of story-telling in the series can involve traditional use of cutscenes and spoken dialogue (Persona, Digital Devil Saga), or a text-based minimalist approach that places emphasis on atmosphere (Nocturne). A tradition within the core Shin Megami Tensei series <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on a single playable character {{as opposed to a}} group. A recurring character is Lucifer, the fallen angel who stands against God and is portrayed in multiple forms to represent his omnipotence. Since Megami Tensei II, the series has used a morality-based decision system, where the player's actions affect the outcome of the story. In Megami Tensei II, the alignments were defined as [...] "Law" [...] (the forces of God) and [...] "Chaos" [...] (the army of Lucifer). In future games, an additional [...] "Neutral" [...] route was included where the player could reject both sides. Selected games have been thematically or otherwise linked to a particular alignment. Shin Megami Tensei II, due to events prior to the story, focuses on the [...] "Law" [...] alignment. For Nocturne, all the characters were roughly aligned with [...] "Chaos", which was done both to bring variety to the series and allow the development team more creative freedom. Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse is restricted to a [...] "Neutral" [...] alignment while still having multiple endings. The three-tiered alignment was used in Strange Journey, and continued into Shin Megami Tensei IV.|$|E

2500|$|One {{research}} group reported {{a case study}} of a single individual with piriformis syndrome whose symptoms were entirely resolved through physical therapy sessions that worked to strengthen the hip abductors, external rotators and extensors. This treatment involved three phases: non-weight bearing exercises, weight bearing exercises, and ballistic exercises. The purpose of non-weight bearing exercises <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on isolated muscle recruitment. Ballistic and dynamic exercises consists of plyometrics. [...] As this was {{a case study of}} a single individual, however, its statistical significance is meaningless and it may indicate nothing important regarding piriformis syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{assumption}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on planets orbiting Sun-like {{stars for}} increased probabilities of planetary habitability. Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life {{might not have}} time to emerge on planets orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be tidally [...] "locked" [...] to the star. The long lifetimes of red dwarfs could allow the development of habitable environments on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See Habitability of red dwarf systems).|$|E
2500|$|LeVay {{writes that}} his aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> [...] "on the brain {{mechanisms}} {{that are responsible}} for sexual behavior and feelings"; he discusses sexual orientation among other topics such as the evolutionary basis of sex, sexual development, the organization and development of the brain, the neural mechanisms associated with sexual intercourse, gender differences, and gender identity. LeVay expresses skepticism about the work of Sigmund Freud, writing that while he once accepted the Freudian view that [...] "a young child's relations with his or her parents play a decisive role" [...] in the development of sexual orientation, he rejected it after he came to know large numbers of gay men and lesbian women. LeVay writes that he doubts that there is anything scientific about Freud's ideas.|$|E

2500|$|A {{special feature}} of {{competitive}} breaststroke is the underwater pullout. From the streamline position, one uses the arms to pull {{all the way}} down past the hips. As the arms are pulling down, one downward dolphin kick is allowed (as of the 2005 season), though still optional; more than one dolphin kick will result in disqualification. This is followed by the recovery of the arms to the streamline position once more with a breaststroke kick. The pullout is also called the [...] "pull down". The pullout at the start and after the turns contributes significantly to the swimming times. Open turns can be easily performed at the walls, but both hands must make contact with the wall. Therefore, one way to improve swimming times <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on the start and the turns.|$|E

2500|$|The Mall of America's {{security}} {{program is}} unique {{and in many ways}} the first of its kind. Michael Rozin, who used to be employed as the mall's Special Operations Security Captain, developed and implemented a behavior detection unit specifically focused on mitigating the threat of terrorism and enhancing counter-terrorism capabilities. Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) are trained extensively in Israel, each one going through at least 240 hours of training that includes communication techniques, first aid, defensive tactics, crisis intervention, terrorism awareness, and rapid response. As Doug Reynolds, the Security Director at the mall, noted in a congressional testimony in 2008, BDOs are taught to [...] "look for intent, rather than means. The objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on suspicious indicators in three categories: People, vehicles and unattended items like backpacks, shopping bags, suitcases." [...] This methodology has prepared the mall for a variety of threats, both from terrorists and everyday criminals.|$|E
