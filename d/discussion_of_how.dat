5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: {{the gravitational}} influence of two masses {{is not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, as had {{been the case in}} Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E
5|$|Bodyguard of Lies {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} to Ultra, the codename for decrypted signals intelligence. It goes on to document {{the origins of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and the work of Dudley Clarke in the Middle East. In late 1942, Allied high command in London became aware of Clarke's successes during the North African Campaign. Based on his theories of deception, the LCS was created under Colonel John Bevan and granted broad powers to plan deception strategy. The introduction finishes with a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the Allies evolved deception strategy prior to 1943, including the Double-Cross System (the Allied system of double agents). The second section of the book introduces the German intelligence forces, in particular Admiral Canaris and his Abwehr intelligence agency. Brown discusses early deceptions, such as those surrounding Operation Torch, conducted against the Germans, and how the Abwehr struggled to decipher the information it was being fed.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{met with}} Mahatma Gandhi, {{becoming}} the first African Americans to have an audience with him. When Thurman asked him to take his message to the United States, he demurred as his work in India and his personal quest there were not finished. One {{important aspect of the}} meeting was a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> non-violent resistance {{could be used as a}} means of creating social change. The meeting had a profound effect on the couple, changing the direction of their lives. Though they would remain Christians, the meeting with Gandhi led them to consider establishing a church free of prejudice, transcending racial, social, economic and spiritual boundaries. After they returned to the United States, Howard received a letter from A. J. Muste on behalf of Alfred Fisk who was looking for someone to establish a church in San Francisco which crossed the racial and spiritual divides. Muste was hopeful that Rev. Thurman might know of a divinity student interested in the position. Instead, Howard decided to take up the challenge himself, securing a leave of absence in order to found the church. Thurman went with him bringing their two daughters, as she strongly believed in the cause.|$|E

25|$|Conquest of Mind is a {{book that}} {{describes}} practices and strategies for leading the spiritual life. Written by Eknath Easwaran, the strategies are intended to be usable within any major religious tradition, or outside of all traditions. The book was originally published in the United States in 1988. Multiple revised English-language editions have been published, and translations have also appeared in several other European and Asian languages. The book has been reviewed in newspapers and magazines. In Conquest of Mind, Easwaran provides a much more extensive <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> his program {{can be used to}} train the mind, and the importance of training the mind.|$|E
25|$|As of 2001, {{the scholar}} of {{religion}} Olav Hammer could still note that books presenting the Theosophical doctrines were mostly apologetic in nature. Examples of such works include William Q. Judge's 1893 book Ocean of Theosophy and Robert Ellwood's 1986 book Theosophy. He noted {{that most of}} these works treated Theosophical doctrine {{as if it were a}} fixed entity and provided little or no <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> they have changed over the decades. Hammer also lamented that while scholarship on Theosophy was developing, it had not focused on the reformulation of Theosophy by Leadbeater and Besant or with the developing ideas of post-Theosophical writers like Steiner or Bailey.|$|E

25|$|The {{organizing}} model, as {{the term}} refers to trade unions (and sometimes other social-movement organizations), {{is a broad}} conception of how those organizations should recruit, operate, and advance the interests of their members, though the specific functions of the model are more detailed and are discussed at length below. It typically involves many full-time organizers, who work by building up confidence and strong networks and leaders within the workforce, and by confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. The organizing model is strongly linked to social movement unionism and community unionism. The organizing model contributes to the <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> trade unions can reverse the trend of declining membership, which they are experiencing in most industrial nations, {{and how they can}} recapture some of the political power, which the labor movement has lost over the past century.|$|E
25|$|When {{a new set}} {{of county}} commissioners decided to remove the display cases, the local American Legion post then {{displayed}} Brostrom's Medal of Honor. In time, local veterans dwindled and the Legion Hall was taken over by the County. The last commander of the Preston American Legion Chapter in Preston then took Brostrom's display home for safe keeping. By this time, all of Brostrom's family had died except for a niece, who did not want the Medal of Honor display, citing that she {{would not be able to}} preserve it properly. A local lawyer, Jay MacKenzie, was asked to keep the display safe in his office. The medal sat there until a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, Sherman L. Fleek, who was then the command historian for the United States Military Academy at West Point and doing research on Pfc. Brostrom's life, called MacKenzie. This eventually led to a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to properly honor Brostrom and display his Medal of Honor. Since Brostrom had been a lifetime member of the LDS Church, the Church History Library was contacted and agreed to preserve and display the medal there.|$|E

500|$|Starting in 1932, {{county and}} state {{officials}} proposed rerouting US 80 away from what is now La Mesa Boulevard. Although the city raised concerns about the proposal, due to the shift in transportation design towards [...] "free-access highways" [...] where vehicles could travel up to , {{and the success of}} the Arroyo Seco Parkway in Los Angeles, the La Mesa Scout newspaper withdrew their objections to the construction. In the meantime, parts of El Cajon Boulevard through downtown El Cajon were widened in 1935. Federal funds were allocated for rerouting US 80 in 1940; by then, La Mesa Boulevard had been designated as a U.S. 80 Business Route, and El Cajon Boulevard then carried the US 80 designation to San Diego. But in 1947, the San Diego Highway Development Association criticized the proliferation of traffic signals and businesses on El Cajon Boulevard, during the <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to resolve traffic issues on US 101 through Oceanside.|$|E
500|$|Breaking {{from the}} theme of the natural {{environment}} after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete demise of humans without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers transhumanism, the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, the Church of Euthanasia and John A. Leslie's The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction. Weisman concludes the book considering {{a new version of the}} one-child policy. While he admits it is a [...] "draconian measure", he states, [...] "The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder." [...] He responded to criticism of this saying [...] "I knew in advance that I would touch some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but I did so because it's been missing too long from the <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too (sic)".|$|E
500|$|The Reapers {{went through}} many designs. Originally, they were {{supposed}} to be [...] "men in cowls" [...] based on the Grim Reaper; the final design retains some of this image with its [...] "scythe-like tail". The original design was deemed too similar to creatures seen in [...] "The End of the World", and so were reworked into something more [...] "otherworldly". They were not originally intended to fly. There was also <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much they should resemble animals as opposed to the Grim Reaper; the end result is a mixture of the two approaches. The final design had a [...] "shark quality", bat wings, and a mouth influenced by the praying mantis. Vulture sound effects were used for its screech. The model was made over two months, being finished at the end of February 2005 rather than at the beginning of January as scheduled.

500|$|The OdioWorks {{case was}} one of the first {{high-profile}} cases illustrating Apple's attempts to employ federal police power in its litigation practices by invoking the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a means of shielding its intellectual property from reverse engineering. In November 2008, Apple sent a cease-and-desist letter to BluWiki, a non-commercial wiki provider, alleging BluWiki infringed Apple's copyrights in publishing a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to make the latest iPods interoperate with other software and that, by so doing, violated the DMCA. [...] In April 2009, OdioWorks, the operators of BluWiki, backed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), defensively sued Apple seeking a declaration of non-infringement and non-circumvention. In July 2009, Apple ceased claiming infringement, stating it was [...] "withdrawing [...] takedown notifications" [...] and that [...] "Apple no longer has, nor will it have in the future, any objection to the publication of the itunesDB Pages which are the subject of the OdioWorks complaint". After Apple withdrew its complaint and cited code obsolescence as a contributing factor in its decision to withdraw, BluWiki then republished its discussion of the issue.
