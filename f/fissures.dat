5|$|The water {{ejected from}} a geyser travels {{underground}} through deep, pressurized <b>fissures</b> in the Earth's crust.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the heated water to form a geyser, a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, <b>fissures,</b> porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being heated. Geysers are generally aligned along faults. Constrictions in the system {{are essential to the}} building up of pressure before an eruption.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via <b>fissures.</b> Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through <b>fissures</b> created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the <b>fissures</b> are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

50|$|The petrotympanic <b>fissure</b> (also {{known as}} the squamotympanic <b>fissure</b> or the glaserian <b>fissure)</b> is a <b>fissure</b> in the {{temporal}} bone that runs from the temporomandibular joint to the tympanic cavity.|$|R
40|$|Fractal {{geometry}} {{has become}} a widely accepted description tool to model the capillary <b>fissure</b> network in rocks. The fractal theory is applied to model the permeability and porosity of a natural <b>fissured</b> rock. The <b>fissured</b> structure is treated as having three fractal dimensions: the <b>fissure</b> breadth, the <b>fissure</b> length and the <b>fissure</b> depth. In a first attempt the permeability model predictions are found to agree satisfactory well with data presented in literature...|$|R
5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock <b>fissures</b> to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Lava {{flows from}} Mauna Kea {{overlapped}} in complex layers {{with those of}} its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive <b>fissures</b> (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once {{believed to be a}} part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.|$|E
5|$|Llullaillaco {{has been}} active in {{historical}} time, with the last eruption occurring in the late 19th century. Eruptions were recorded in February 1854, September 1868, and May 1877, involving two explosive eruptions and one with lava flows. According to a report in 1899, during the 1868 eruption large <b>fissures</b> opened on its slopes. The last eruption consisted of smoking reported {{at the time of the}} 1877 Iquique earthquake.|$|E
50|$|The 2008 {{eruption}} {{began in}} May and included a <b>fissure</b> eruption {{on the south}} east flank of the volcano; the eruption in 1998 had also included <b>fissure</b> eruptions on {{this part of the}} volcano. The <b>fissure</b> eruptions resulted in lava flowing 10 km from the <b>fissure.</b> There was also an eruption within the caldera. A second <b>fissure</b> opened lower down the slope in early June.|$|R
50|$|The central sulcus is a sulcus, or fold, in the {{cerebral}} cortex in {{the brains of}} vertebrates.

40|$|The {{developmental}} {{state of}} residual <b>fissure</b> in goaf {{is an important}} factor in the design of goaf filling and grouting. Under the conditions of multiple seams mining, this paper discusses the distribution of residual <b>fissure</b> in overlying strata by means of the similar material experiment. The results show that, after the end of mining, the distribution of residual <b>fissure</b> in goaf displays obvious characteristics in different zones. From both sides to the middle of goaf, it can be divided into three zones: residual <b>fissure</b> zone, compacted <b>fissure</b> zone, and surface tensile <b>fissure</b> zone. The <b>fissure</b> rate of the residual <b>fissure</b> zone generally varies from 19. 45 % to 45. 27 % while the <b>fissure</b> rate of the <b>fissure</b> compacted zone varies from 9. 28 % to 19. 33 %. The developmental height of interlayered <b>fissure</b> is decided by both mining width and total mining height. In both theory and practice, this study has the great importance in estimation of stability of the goaf, determining the range and depth of the goaf treatment, reasonable arrangement of the injected holes, and reasonable grouting amount of the single injected hole...|$|R
5|$|Malvern {{water is}} a natural spring water from the Malvern Hills {{on the border of}} the {{counties}} of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England. The Hills consist of very hard granite and limestone rock. <b>Fissures</b> in the rock retain rain water, which slowly permeates through, escaping at the springs. The springs release an average of about 60 litres a minute and the flow has never been known to cease.|$|E
5|$|People with OCD report activity-related {{pain that}} {{develops}} gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom {{may be a}} restriction {{in the range of}} movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stageI; however, the onset of stageII occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stageII, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or <b>fissures</b> to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) has been {{described}} by 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and leathery peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, <b>fissures</b> develop across the top. These <b>fissures</b> usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to open again when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and inner cells of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E
40|$|During {{dissection}} {{practice for}} medical students at Nagasaki University, a horizontal <b>fissure</b> and hypoplastic middle lobe were {{encountered in the}} right lung of an 81 -year-old Japanese female. In a normal right lung, the horizontal <b>fissure</b> is situated anterior to the oblique <b>fissure.</b> On the contrary, in the present case, the horizontal <b>fissure</b> was situated posterior to the oblique <b>fissure.</b> We identified a small, additional lobe on the medial surface of this lung. It was situated in the medial part of the oblique <b>fissure,</b> and {{was determined to be}} a small hypoplastic middle lobe. As a result of the hypoplasia of the middle lobe, the original horizontal <b>fissure</b> may have disappeared from the anterior surface. The horizontal <b>fissure,</b> in this case, may be a compensatory additional <b>fissure</b> that developed within the inferior lobe. This horizontal <b>fissure</b> was incomplete, both in length and depth. The left lung was normal. This case might be very rare; however, it may aid in the understanding of normal lung development. Therefore, we report this case, including its bronchial branching and vascular distribution...|$|R

40|$|Anal <b>fissure</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of severe anal pain. Factors which {{predispose}} people to develop anal <b>fissure</b> include diarrhea, constipation, childbirth, medication as well as constant saddle vibration (amongst professional mountain-bikers) and using a jet of water from a bidet-toilet. For many years, it has been generally accepted that a sphincterotomy, whether surgical or pharmacological, treats chronic anal <b>fissure</b> as it produces a reduction in anal pressure, reverses sphincter spasms and promotes <b>fissure</b> healing. However, recent studies cast doubt upon this explanation. A new theory explains that anal <b>fissure</b> healing depends on biochemical processes taking place in the anal passage. Eruption of tissues in the <b>fissure</b> region during defecation releases platelet products such as ADP, ATP, 5 -HT, platelet activation factor, thrombin and substance P which cause the contraction of smooth muscles (of Internal Anal Sphincter and blood vessels) and results in difficulties in <b>fissure</b> healing. Reducing trauma of defecation by posterior perineal support plays an important role in anal <b>fissure</b> healing. It brings a significant improvement in the symptoms of patients with anal <b>fissure...</b>|$|R
5|$|The right lung {{has both}} more lobes and {{segments}} than the left. It {{is divided into}} three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower, by two <b>fissures,</b> one oblique and one horizontal. The upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from the middle lobe. It begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal surface it may be traced backward to the hilum.|$|E
5|$|Where the two chough species occur together, {{there is}} only limited {{competition}} for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and <b>fissures,</b> concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek {{on the southern}} flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises {{back to the surface}} along <b>fissures</b> or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because they seem to represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E
50|$|Fractures {{within the}} <b>fissure</b> swarms are {{generally}} subparallel to each other. Irregular fracture patterns are found where the Húsavík transform fault meets the <b>fissure</b> swarms, which indicates {{interaction between the}} <b>fissure</b> swarms and the strike-slip faults.|$|R

5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been undermined by the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious <b>fissures</b> in the stonework. The high costs of maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended {{to turn it into a}} railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry price of one penny.|$|E
5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and <b>fissures</b> {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from <b>fissures</b> on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. <b>Fissured</b> {{tongue is}} a {{commonly}} encountered tongue disorder in dental practice. But {{there is a}} lack of data on different pattern, severity, and association of <b>fissuring</b> with various systemic disorders and other tongue anomalies. This study attempts to establish a classification system for <b>fissured</b> tongue and to know the correlation with the systemic health and other disorders of the tongue. Materials and Methods. A total of 1000 subjects between the age groups of 10 and 80 years were included in the study. Pattern of <b>fissuring,</b> allied systemic diseases, and related tongue anomalies were tabulated. Results. Out of 1000 subjects, 387 subjects presented with <b>fissured</b> tongue. Out of 387 subjects, hypertension was present in 57 cases, 18 subjects had diabetes, and 3 subjects had both hypertension and diabetes. Central longitudinal type was found to be the most common type of tongue <b>fissuring.</b> Conclusion. <b>Fissured</b> tongue has been found to be associated with certain systemic disease and further researches are required to know positive correlation. If a correlation exists, such disorders could be diagnosed earlier by identifying <b>fissured</b> tongue at an earlier age...|$|R

5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} <b>fissures</b> {{in the water}} drums of her boilers {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{during three}} flybys by Cassini on February 17, March 9, and July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} Enceladus' surface features in much greater detail than the Voyager 2 observations. The smooth plains, which Voyager 2 had observed, resolved into relatively crater-free regions filled with numerous small ridges and scarps. Numerous fractures were {{found within the}} older, cratered terrain, suggesting that the surface {{has been subjected to}} extensive deformation since the craters were formed. Some areas contain no craters, indicating major resurfacing events in the geologically recent past. There are <b>fissures,</b> plains, corrugated terrain and other crustal deformations. Several additional regions of young terrain were discovered in areas not well-imaged by either Voyager spacecraft, such as the bizarre terrain near the south pole. All of this indicates that Enceladus's interior may be liquid today, even though it should have been frozen long ago.|$|E
5|$|Some parasites feed on giraffes. They {{are often}} hosts for ticks, {{especially}} {{in the area around}} the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. Giraffes may rely on red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which {{comes in the form of}} wrinkles, lesions or raw <b>fissures.</b> It appears to be caused by a nematode and may be further effected by fungal infections. As much as 79% of giraffes show signs of the disease in Ruaha National Park.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{the use of}} hybrid rice cultivars has greatly increased, and {{this has led to}} {{questions}} about the processing behavior of hybrid cultivars. This study compares the milled rice <b>fissuring</b> kinetics of hybrid and pureline cultivars. Also, this study elucidates the effects of kernel type (long-grain vs. medium-grain rice cultivars), surface lipid content (SLC), and kernel thickness on <b>fissuring</b> rates. Three hybrid (CL XL 745, CL XL 729 and XL 753) and five pureline (Wells, CL 151, Cheniere, Jupiter and CL 261) cultivar lots were procured. Jupiter and CL 261 are medium-grain cultivars, whereas the rest are long-grain cultivars. Two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 quantified the number percentage of <b>fissured</b> kernels of all eight cultivar lots; samples were milled to a SLC of 0. 4 %, and then exposed to air temperatures of 10 °C and 30 °C and relative humidities (RHs) of 10, 20, 50, 80 and 90 %. Percent <b>fissured</b> kernels were recorded at durations of 4, 8, 16, 32, 60 and 120 min. Experiment 2 quantified the number percentage of <b>fissured</b> kernels of CL XL 745 and CL 151 cultivar lots; samples of both lots were milled to SLCs of 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, and 0. 8 %, and then exposed to an air temperature of 30 °C and RHs of 20 and 80 %. Percent <b>fissured</b> kernels were recorded at 4, 8, 16, 32, 60 and 120 min. In addition, the number percentage of <b>fissured</b> kernels of thin-, medium-, and thick-kernel fractions were exposed to these same air conditions and then analyzed. When exposed to low- and high-RH air, some hybrid long-grain (H-L) cultivar lots <b>fissured</b> less than some pureline long-grain (P-L) cultivar lots and vice versa. Of the H-L cultivar lots, XL 753 significantly <b>fissured</b> the least, and of the P-L cultivar lots, CL 151 and Wells significantly <b>fissured</b> less than Cheniere. Initial <b>fissuring</b> rates were greater at 30 °C than 10 °C, and greater at 10 % RH than 90 % RH. On average, pureline medium-grain (P-M) cultivar lots were found to significantly <b>fissure</b> more than long-grain cultivars; and at 10 °C and RHs of 20 and 90 %, milled rice from the hybrid long-grain cultivar group <b>fissured</b> significantly less than the pureline long-grain cultivar group. All other conditions showed {{no significant difference between the}} mean percent <b>fissured</b> kernels of H-L and P-L cultivar groups. As for SLC and kernel thickness, significant differences in <b>fissuring</b> rates were seen among SLCs. As SLC decreased, an increase in percent <b>fissured</b> kernels was seen.
