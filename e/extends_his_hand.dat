5|$|Of {{greatest}} {{interest is}} the fourth composition of historical figures, {{a young man and}} a woman, which was painted on the lowest west wall of the narthex and includes inscriptions in Old Church Slavonic. The figures are painted facing the viewer. The man's red clothing is covered in pearls and double-headed eagles, and he wears an archaic-looking despot's crown on his head. In his right hand, the man holds a sceptre with a cross. He <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to a woman, clad in a despotissa's attire and wearing a fitting crown.|$|E

The {{old man is}} surprised, however, when the horse chooses to return to Albert, and he {{presents}} Albert with the military pennant, asking him what it is.

Upon doing so, David sees visions of Elijah orchestrating several terrorist disasters, including David's recent train accident, causing hundreds of deaths. David is horrified, but Elijah insists the deaths were justified as a means to find him.

2500|$|In , Magneto returns {{again as}} the main {{antagonist}} and has expanded the Brotherhood of Mutants with new recruits. After learning that a major company has produced a [...] "cure" [...] for the mutant gene, he and his Brotherhood attack the facility {{with the intention of}} killing the cure's source. Upon learning of Jean Grey's return, Magneto sets his concerns about the cure aside to sway Phoenix to his side; he succeeds, but is shaken when Phoenix vaporizes Xavier before his eyes. After Xavier's apparent demise, Magneto shows genuine grief over Xavier's death. During the Brotherhood's assault on Alcatraz, Magneto lifted and manipulated the Golden Gate Bridge and had no qualms about endangering or sacrificing dozens of his mutant followers by knowingly sending them against anti-mutant weapons while he remained safely out of range stating that [...] "in chess, the pawns go first." [...] During the final showdown, Wolverine and Beast work together and inject Magneto with the [...] "cure" [...] which strips him of his powers. From there, Magneto realizes his horror as Phoenix unleashes her fury on all sides of the conflict before fleeing. In the final scene, he <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> toward a metal chess piece and is able to slightly move it, indicating that his powers are returning.|$|E

60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Sliverstone are an egotistical {{couple of}} another class, {{for all the}} lady's egotism is about her husband, and all the gentleman's about his wife. For example:- Mr. Sliverstone is a {{clerical}} gentleman, and occasionally writes sermons, as clerical gentlemen do. If you happen to obtain admission at the street-door while he is so engaged, Mrs. Sliverstone appears on tip-toe, and speaking in a solemn whisper, {{as if there were}} at least three or four particular friends up-stairs, all upon the point of death, implores you to be very silent, for Mr. Sliverstone is composing, and she need not say how very important it is that he should not be disturbed. Unwilling to interrupt anything so serious, you hasten to withdraw, with many apologies; but this Mrs. Sliverstone will by no means allow, observing, that she knows {{you would like to see}} him, as it is very natural you should, and that she is determined to make a trial for you, as you are a great favourite. So you are led up-stairs--still on tip-toe--to the door of a little back room, in which, as the lady informs you in a whisper, Mr. Sliverstone always writes. No answer being returned to a couple of soft taps, the lady opens the door, and there, sure enough, is Mr. Sliverstone, with dishevelled hair, powdering away with pen, ink, and paper, at a rate which, if he has any power of sustaining it, would settle the longest sermon in no time. At first he is too much absorbed to be roused by this intrusion; but presently looking up, says faintly, 'Ah!' and pointing to his desk with a weary and languid smile, <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and hopes you'll forgive him. Then Mrs. Sliverstone sits down beside him, and taking his hand in hers, tells you how that Mr. Sliverstone has been shut up there ever since nine o'clock in the morning, (it is by this time twelve at noon,) and how she knows it cannot be good for his health, and is very uneasy about it. Unto this Mr. Sliverstone replies firmly, that 'It must be done;' which agonizes Mrs. Sliverstone still more, and she goes on to tell you that such were Mr. Sliverstone's labours last week--what with the buryings, marryings, churchings, christenings, and all together,--that when he was going up the pulpit stairs on Sunday evening, he was obliged to hold on by the rails, or he would certainly have fallen over into his own pew. Mr. Sliverstone, who has been listening and smiling meekly, says, 'Not quite so bad as that, not quite so bad!' he admits though, on cross-examination, that he WAS very near falling upon the verger who was following him up to bolt the door; but adds, that it was his duty as a Christian to fall upon him, if need were, and that he, Mr. Sliverstone, and (possibly the verger too) ought to glory in it.|$|E

The fifth, to the far right, is bearded and wearing a garment that is not a toga; he carries something slung over his right shoulder.|$|E
