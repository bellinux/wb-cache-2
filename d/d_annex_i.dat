40|$|The {{historical}} responsibility of countries {{listed in the}} <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> of the Convention on Climate Change has been used extensively as a justification {{for the lack of}} action of countries not included in <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We analyzed the contribution of non-Annex I countries to the CO 2 emissions in the period 1850 - 2006 to assess their relative contribution to total CO 2 emissions. In the period 1980 - 2006 non-Annex I countries represented 44 % of the total but this contribution increased in the period 1990 - 2006 to 48 %. If we extrapolate present trends to 2020 they will represent 56 % in the period 1990 - 2020. The "{{historical responsibility}}" of <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries is therefore decreasing. If we take 1990 as the starting year in which the Climate Convention recognized clearly that greenhouse gases are interfering dangerously with the climate system, it becomes very difficult to attribute "blame" and "guilt" to <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> for their historical contributions. It becomes also quite clear the need of non-Annex I countries to engage with <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries in the effort to reduce emissions. The Copenhagen Accord has no mention of "historical responsibilities"...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} ABARE's Global Trade and Environment Model (GTEM) {{is used to}} analyse the {{potential}} of international emissions trading as a mechanism for helping to achieve the abatement commitments agreed to in the Kyoto Protocol. The prospect of two emission trading blocs, one consisting of the European Union and eastern Europe and the other consisting {{of many of the}} remaining <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> regions, is also considered. The analysis shows that the carbon penalty varies significantly across regions when no emissions trading is allowed. In aggregate, the cost of abatement to <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> regions falls with emissions trading. Under the assumption of the two trading blocs, the carbon penalty in the European bloc is higher than with full <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> trading. The paper also considers the impact on developing countries and the role of carbon leakage in determining the economic impacts on <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> regions. ...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{theoretical}} framework, we explain {{the impact of}} the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) on emissions in <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> and non-Annex I countries.

For the CDM to be e¤ective in reducing global emissions, we show that partial Certi ed Emissions Reduction credits should be given to the <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> country that sponsors CDM projects in the non-Annex I country.

40|$|The Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was {{established}} in 1997 with the dual purposes of assisting non-Annex I Parties in achieving sustainable development and assisting <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> Parties in achieving compliance with their quantified greenhouse gas (GHG) emission commitments.

Market demand for GHG credits from CDM projects comes from <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries’ emission commitments. <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries can meet those commitments by domestic as well as international emission mitigation activities, including the CDM. The CDM can be an attractive compliance option as it can help meet <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> GHG commitments more cost-effectively through project-based activities that are consistent with host-countries’ sustainable development priorities. The extent of the demand for CDM credits depends on the stringency of emission commitments, the “gap” between countries’ emission commitments and actual emissions, and the relative use of CDM and other means of meeting emission commitment...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} a theoretical model is put forward, which explains {{the impact of}} the clean development mechanism (CDM) on greenhouse gas emissions in <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> and non-Annex I countries. This paper shows that on the one hand, emissions in the non-Annex I country decline because of abatement sponsored by the <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> country under the CDM; on the other hand, global emissions may increase because (1) the <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> country increases emissions in its own country after obtaining the Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits, and (2) the non-Annex I country crowds out the benefits from the CDM projects by increasing its domestic emissions. For the CDM to be effective in reducing global emissions, the model demonstrates why partial CER credits should be given to the <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> country that sponsors CDM projects in the non-Annex I country. The article also suggests that the CDM Executive Board should allow the CDM projects to be hosted by the non-Annex I countries that are producing at their optimum level because they have sufficiently high tolerance for pollution.
