5|$|<b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance, and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> genome is shared among all strains.|$|E
5|$|<b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> stains Gram-negative {{because its}} cell wall is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain safranin and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} evolution experiments using <b>E.</b> <b>coli,</b> {{begun by}} Richard Lenski in 1988, have allowed direct observation of major evolutionary {{shifts in the}} laboratory. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> typically {{do not have the}} ability to grow aerobically with citrate as a carbon source, which is used as a diagnostic criterion with which to differentiate <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> from other, closely, related bacteria such as Salmonella. In this experiment, one population of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> unexpectedly evolved the ability to aerobically metabolize citrate, possibly marking a speciation event observed in the laboratory.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{large-scale}} differential equation model of <b>E.</b> <b>coli's</b> central metabolism and its enzymatic, transcriptional, and posttranslational regulation. This model reproduces <b>E.</b> <b>coli's</b> known physiological behavior. We {{found that the}} interplay of known interactions in <b>E.</b> <b>coli's</b> central metabolism can indirectly recognize the presence of extracellular carbon sources through measuring intracellular metabolic flux patterns. We found that <b>E.</b> <b>coli's</b> system-level adaptations between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources are realized on the molecular level by global feedback architectures that overarch the enzymatic and transcriptional regulatory layers. We found that the capability for closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously to changing carbon sources (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling) ...|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia <b>coli</b> (<b>Es.</b> <b>coli)</b> protein Fis (factor for {{inversion}} stimulation) stimulates site-specific DNA {{inversion of}} the G segment in phage Mu by binding to a recombinational enhancer. By using synthetic oligonucleotides deduced from the amino-terminal amino acid sequence, we have cloned the gene (termed fis) encoding this specific DNA-binding protein. The DNA sequence {{shows that the}} Fis protein is basic and contains 98 amino acids. A helix-turn-helix sequence motif characteristic of many DNA-binding proteins {{is located at the}} carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. By marker exchange, we have constructed an insertion mutation of fis. Fis is nonessential for <b>Es.</b> <b>coli</b> growth; however, inversion of the G segment of a Mu prophage was not detected in the fis mutant. The fis gene is located between 71 and 72 min on the <b>Es.</b> <b>coli</b> genetic map...|$|R

5|$|<b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> {{and related}} {{bacteria}} possess {{the ability to}} transfer DNA via bacterial conjugation or transduction, which allows genetic material to spread horizontally through an existing population. The process of transduction, which uses the bacterial virus called a bacteriophage, is where {{the spread of the}} gene encoding for the Shiga toxin from the Shigella bacteria to <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> helped produce , the Shiga toxin-producing strain of <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b>|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{from the}} {{evolutionary}} point of view, {{the members of}} genus Shigella (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei) should be classified as <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains, a phenomenon termed taxa in disguise. Similarly, other strains of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (e.g. the K-12 strain commonly used in recombinant DNA work) are sufficiently different that they would merit reclassification.|$|E

40|$|Apart from {{addressing}} humanity’s {{growing demand}} for fuels, pharmaceuticals, plastics and other value added chemicals, metabolic engineering of microbes {{can serve as a}} powerful tool to address questions concerning the characteristics of cellular metabolism. Along these lines, we developed an in vivo metabolic strategy that conclusively identifies the product specificity of glycerate kinase. By deleting <b>E.</b> <b>coli’s</b> phosphoglycerate mutases, we divide its central metabolism into an ‘upper’ and ’lower’ metabolism, each requiring its own carbon source for the bacterium to grow. Glycerate can serve to replace the upper or lower carbon source depending on the product of glycerate kinase. Using this strategy we show that while glycerate kinase from Arabidopsis thaliana produces 3 -phosphoglycerate, both <b>E.</b> <b>coli’s</b> enzymes generate 2 -phosphoglycerate. This strategy represents a general approach to decipher enzyme specificity under physiological conditions...|$|R

5|$|<b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease.

5|$|Like all lifeforms, new {{strains of}} <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> evolve through the natural {{biological}} processes of mutation, gene duplication, and horizontal gene transfer; in particular, 18% {{of the genome}} of the laboratory strain MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> K-12 and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> B strains are {{the most frequently used}} varieties for laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits that can be harmful to a host animal. These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world.

Under favorable conditions, it takes only 20 minutes to reproduce.|$|E
40|$|Many {{microbial}} {{systems are}} known to actively reshape their proteomes in response to changes in growth conditions induced e. g. by nutritional stress or antibiotics. Part of the re-allocation accounts for the fact that, as the growth rate is limited by targeting specific metabolic activities, cells simply respond by fine-tuning their proteome to invest more resources into the limiting activity (i. e. by synthesizing more proteins devoted to it). However, this is often accompanied by an overall re-organization of metabolism, aimed at improving the growth yield under limitation by re-wiring resource through different pathways. While both effects impact proteome composition, the latter underlies a more complex systemic response to stress. By focusing on <b>E.</b> <b>coli's</b> `acetate switch', we use mathematical modeling and a re-analysis of empirical data {{to show that the}} transition from a predominantly fermentative to a predominantly respirative metabolism in carbon-limited growth results from the trade-off between maximizing the growth yield and minimizing its costs in terms of required the proteome share. In particular, <b>E.</b> <b>coli's</b> metabolic phenotypes appear to be Pareto-optimal for these objective functions over a broad range of dilutions.

40|$|Abstract. Transcriptional {{attenuation}} at <b>E.</b> <b>coli’s</b> tryptophan operon is a {{prime example}} of RNA-mediated gene regulation. In this paper, we present a discrete stochastic model of the fine-grained control of attenuation, based on chemical reactions. Stochastic simulation of our model confirms results that were previously obtained by master or differential equations. Our approach is easier to understand than master equations, although mathematically well founded. It is compact due to rule schemas that define finite sets of chemical reactions. Object-centered languages based on the π-calculus would yield less intelligible models. Such languages are confined to binary interactions, whereas our model heavily relies on reaction rules with more than two reactants, in order to concisely capture the control of attenuation. ...|$|R
5|$|Today, {{several hundred}} {{complete}} genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are available. The genome {{sequence of the}} type strain of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> {{has been added to}} this collection not before 2014. Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present in every one of the isolates, while around 80% of each genome can vary among isolates. Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean that two-thirds of the <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> pangenome originated in other species and arrived through the process of horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

How this novel, to our knowledge, swimming pattern is regulated by cells of V. alginolyticus is not currently known, but its significance for bacterial chemotaxis is self-evident and will be delineated herein. Using a statistical approach, we calculated the migration speed of a cell executing the three-step pattern in a linear chemical gradient, and found that a biphasic chemotactic response arises naturally.
