40|$|AbstractMore {{than half}} of spring wheat cultivars have a {{dominant}} Vrn-A 1 a allele that has an insertion of a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in its promoter. In this study, {{we found that the}} MITE present in the Vrn-A 1 a gene (MITE_VRN) is a nearly perfect palindrome and it can form highly stable hairpin loops when expressed as RNA. MITE_VRN also possessed sequences of a microRNA in Triticum aestivum (TamiR 1123). The P 32 labeled TamiR 1123 probe detected two RNA molecules on a small RNA gel blot, one expected for MITE_VRN, and the other expected for TamiR 1123. These results demonstrated that MITE_VRN was expressed as RNAs and TamiR 1123 was originated from the MITE_VRN family. The <b>isogenic</b> <b>line</b> TDD carrying the dominant Vrn-A 1 a allele with MITE_VRN showed higher TamiR 1123 and Vrn-A 1 a transcript levels than the <b>isogenic</b> <b>line</b> TDE carrying the recessive vrn-A 1 a allele without MITE_VRN.

In the F 1 generation of treated males mated with nontreated females of the same <b>isogenic</b> <b>line,</b> mass transpositions of copia-like mobile genetic element Dm- 412 were found.

These probabilities were, respectively, 3. 4 x 10 (- 2), 8. 7 x 10 (- 2), and less than 4. 1 x 10 (- 4) transpositions per genome per occupied position per generation. Therefore, {{as a result of}} heat shock treatment, the probabilities of transpositions were two orders of magnitude greater than those of the control sample in the next generation after induction.

Pepper plants, with five fully expanded leaves, were artificially inoculated by dipping into the bacterial suspension, concentration of 106 cfu/ml and 108 cfu/ml, for 10 seconds. Early Calwonder (ECW) was used as susceptible control genotype, and its <b>isogenic</b> <b>line</b> ECW- 20 withBs 2 resistance gene as a resistant control.

The predictive model was developed using the stepwise procedure in forward selection with DAA as the response variable and all the possible combinations between the next group of regressor: L*, a* and b*, square L*, a* and b*, chroma and Hue angle calculated from measured a* and b* values. It was used the F statistic, mean square error, coefficient of determination, Mallows coefficient and distribution of residuals around zero as indicators of model predictionâs efficiency.

Comparative analysis of approximately 2000 spots resolved by 2 -DE in the soluble proteomes of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant <b>isogenic</b> <b>lines</b> of T. brucei identified a protein spot whose absence associated with resistance to the arsenical drug, Cymelarsan. MS matched this protein to an identical pair of tandem genes Tb 09. 211. 0120 and 0130 that encode a putative nascent polypeptide associated complex subunit. This protein also occurs as an isoform located in both resistant and sensitive lines at a similar molecular weight, but different pI. The difference between <b>isogenic</b> <b>lines</b> was confirmed by Western blot using an antibody against recombinant protein. Both genes were identical in sequence between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant lines and both were transcribed as determined by RT-PCR. We postulate that the missing protein isoform arose {{due to the lack}} of a PTM...|$|R

Ten backcrosses to the recurrent parent were made. Seedlings in the F 1 generation of each backcross {{and in the}} F 2 and F 3 of the 10 th backcross were inoculated using a spore suspension containing about 10 (5) spores/ml, through a De Vilbiss atomizer, under greenhouse or laboratory conditions.
