In this chapter, we describe recent work from our research group, which examines the moment-by-moment <b>interpretation</b> <b>decisions</b> of children (age 4 to 6 years) while they listen to spoken sentences. These real-time measures were obtained by recording the children’s eye movements as they visually interrogated and manipulated objects in response to spoken instructions.

40|$|This article {{asserts that}} {{although}} notions of uniformity and certainty {{have always been}} part of patent law parlance, since the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., these noble ends have achieved mantra status. In Markman, the Federal Circuit, in the name of uniformity and certainty, characterized claim interpretation as a question of law subject to de novo review, thus positioning itself as the arbiter of claim meaning. If the Federal Circuit is unwilling to exercise greater obeisance toward district court claim interpretations, this article argues that to achieve uniformity and certainty in the context of de novo review the Federal Circuit should entertain interlocutory appeals of Markman hearings. Accordingly, this article proposes that the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, promulgate a rule specifically permitting or requiring the Federal Circuit to hear an interlocutory appeal of a district court claim interpretation decision. The Federal Circuit, which has a special duty to promote uniformity and certainty, cannot have it both ways; that is, the court cannot employ a de novo standard of review on the one hand, and, on the other hand, refuse to entertain interlocutory appeals. Furthermore, acceptance of interlocutory appeals would foster early certainty and promote settlement negotiations. Consistent with this proposal, this article also recommends that district courts, when applicable, apply the doctrine of issue preclusion to their sister courts 2 ̆ 7 claim <b>interpretation</b> <b>decisions.</b> The application of issue preclusion would promote uniformity at the district court level, and coupled with interlocutory review, would promote early certainty...|$|E

The student cohort was a large diverse group of non-mathematicians and the syllabus comprised a short course in statistics together with learning the SPSS statistical software package.

This freed up time in lectures and subsequent computer practicals for staff to concentrate on giving higher level interpretative advice. The statistics assessment comprised a contribution from each computer practical to a Learning Journal and two e-Assessments.

40|$|In {{a recent}} article, 2 ̆ 7 Erwin Chemerinsky {{argues that the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{constitutional}} law decisions of the 2002 Term 2 ̆ 2 cannot be explained by any overarching theory or underlying set of interpretative principles. 2 ̆ 2 Instead, he argues, 2 ̆ 2 constitutional law is all about value choices made by the Justices. 2 ̆ 2 Professor Chemerinsky also argues that given the current composition of the Court, 2 ̆ 2 it is the value choices of the middle 2 ̆ 2 - Justice O 2 ̆ 7 Connor and Justice Kennedy - that matter the most.

Unlike the situation described by Professor Chemerinsky, {{when it comes to}} employment law decisions, at least those involving statutory interpretation disputes, the Court often speaks with one voice, frequently reaching unanimous or nearly unanimous opinions. Value choices {{do not appear to be}} driving the Justices 2 ̆ 7 behavior in these cases. Instead, employment law decisions can be explained in terms of a 2 ̆ 2 text- and rule-based 2 ̆ 2 approach, most directly linked to Justice Scalia and the conservative block of the Court. Under this approach the Court first looks at the statute 2 ̆ 7 s text, interpreted in the light of 2 ̆ 2 proper English 2 ̆ 2 and related statutes. If the text of the statute is unclear, the Court finds a rule to decide the case, and at least under Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of this approach, the chosen rule should be one that minimizes the opportunity for judicial lawmaking. 2 ̆ 7 The various statutory <b>interpretation</b> <b>decisions</b> reviewed in this article fit this approach remarkably well and help us understand the outcome of these cases. 2 ̆ 2 Value choices 2 ̆ 2 are not completely irrelevant in describing the employment law decisions of the Court, however.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} part that child-orientated {{exhibitions}} play in the child and family museum experience. Such exhibitions are characterised by their distinctive approaches to learning, interpretation, and design, being especially devised for children. The research {{was carried out in}} children's galleries from three types of museum (a maritime museum, a science museum, and a children's museum) in order to compare and contrast similarities and differences between them. Since most of the research in this area has been carried out in science centres or science museums, {{there is a need to}} explore the situation in child-orientated exhibitions and compare it to studies carried out in other informal learning settings. Understanding the qualities of their experience in a child-orientated exhibition which children and families value and why and how design and <b>interpretation</b> <b>decisions</b> may affect family behaviour, perceptions, and learning, will enable educators, museum designers and other museum professionals to plan more responsive and meaningful child-centred exhibitions. Children from seven to eleven years old and their accompanying adults were considered in this study. The research involves both qualitative and quantitative approaches and the use of different methods of investigation, such as face-to-face interviews with children and an adult relative; unobtrusive observation of family group interactions at three exhibits in each gallery; and collection of children's drawings about their favourite exhibit in the galleries. The sample sizes for each investigation varied: 150 families, totaling 300 individuals, were interviewed (150 adults and 150 children); 450 different family groups were observed at the galleries (150 in each gallery); and 120 children's drawings were collected. The guiding principle was to adopt an holistic approach to the situation under investigation, taking into consideration Falk & Dierking's interactive museum experience model (Falk & Dierking, 1992), which considers the personal, social, and physical contexts of a museum visit. Findings from the observations indicated gender effects in adult splitting behaviour from the family group at exhibits according to family members joint-activity compositions, and that differences in exhibit design/tasks affected adult manipulation of hands-on exhibits and the level of proximity between family members. Nine attributes from attractive child-orientated exhibits were drawn from the observed exhibits: element of fun, challenging situation, element of surprise, child-sized exhibit design, imaginative design, opportunity for experiencing things, opportunity for role play, interactive machine/game, and teamwork. The analysis of the children's drawings revealed that drawings can be a valuable source of information about children's interactions with hands-on exhibits and can be used to assess children's understanding of exhibits through the depiction of the exhibit outcomes. The interview data was analysed qualitatively (inductive content analysis) and statistically (chi-squared tests). The analysis of the open-ended interview questions indicated that adult relatives were enthusiastic about the opportunity for the children to interact with exhibits and perceived the hands-on gallery approach as motivating to the child with regard to learning. Children perceived the exhibitions as exciting places and reported positive feelings. A few children mentioned negative feelings, which were related to problematic exhibit design. The majority of children said that they prefer to visit museums in a family context rather than in a school context. The statistical analysis of the closed questions indicated twenty-two significant associations between the adults' and children's interview variables, related to adults' and/or children's age, gender, education, perceptions, behaviour, preferences, visiting habits, and type of museum, supporting the notion that personal, social, and museum aspects affect the child's and adult's museum experience, perceptions and learning. Children's perceptions of their learning in the galleries were found to be affected by the time spent in the gallery, the type of museum, the accompanying relative, and the child's preference for the social context of the museum visit. This investigation provided new insights into the study of galleries designed for children, and has demonstrated that child-orientated exhibitions have features which positively affect the child and family museum experience, that children do perceive that they are learning in this environment, and that it is a effective catalyst for family social activity. Therefore, child-orientated exhibitions are a valuable museum provision for the child and family audiences...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the first of a two-part report {{addressing}} different aspects of the priority setting process. The priority setting process includes standpoints, choices, information acquisition, information <b>interpretation,</b> <b>decisions,</b> and activities to win support for the various steps in this type of process. Setting priorities for collective resources requires conscious choices between different options, it takes place at different levels in a society, and it involves different types of actors (politicians, administrators, health care personnel, patients, and the public). This report presents several broad strategies from the body of international literature on priority setting in health care. The muddling through elegantly strategy dissociates itself from general rules or formulas for allocating resources in health care since these tend to make the process static. Rather, health care personnel should have substantial freedom to make decisions about the distribution of resources. The public has limited insight into the priority setting process, but is given the opportunity to judge the results. In the strategy for rational decision making, the acquisition of information is a key activity – usually the most important. Only the best available information, preferably acquired through scientific methods, should serve as a foundation for making decisions. Decision makers at different levels are expected to act rationally, i. e. guided by the available information they seek the optimum solution without allowing themselves to be influenced by extraneous factors. The strategy for pluralistic bargaining implies that priority setting involves the ability to make socially acceptable decisions, and that this bargaining process must be repeated again and again. According to this strategy, we reach the best possible solution to the prioritisation problem through transparency, participation of many different parties in the process, the ability to consider and analyse opposing arguments, and finally viewing the decision as being “reasonable”. The community approach strategy assumes that strain on society will increase to gigantic proportions if we attempt to finance all potential medical interventions. There is a risk that along the way we will stray from the essential values of what constitutes a “humane society” and a “good life”. A broad discussion should be initiated in the community to deal with the “impossible” value systems that lead in the wrong direction. The public should participate in this discussion, whereupon politicians and administrators need to develop “categorical standards” that are applied by health care personnel. The model of health care requirements combines elements of the rational and the pluralistic strategies. It includes the clarification of goals and principles, the utilisation of good information, and the understanding that prioritisation must be a continuous process at different levels that also considers the viewpoints of lay persons (consultation of patients and the public). Explicit and implicit decision making refers to the situation where elected officials are forced to explicitly indicate what should be financed while implementation of decisions at other levels involves an implicit process of prioritisation (not so much a conscious choice as a compelling condition). The transparency at one level serves as “protection” for the concealed process that must be carried out at other levels. If we focus solely on the transparency issue, the strategies themselves do not appear to differ substantially, except on a few points. However, such a conclusion would be entirely erroneous – substantial differences begin to appear as we carefully scrutinise the various strategies. This review suggests that we are not dealing with a single priority setting process, but rather with two processes – one concerning internal legitimacy and another concerning external legitimacy. Only when we make this sharp distinction does the content of the different strategies become truly apparent. The process of internal legitimacy is characterised by the ability to identify a knowledge base (scientific) and arguments for establishing priorities based on that knowledge. This is the only way that knowledge-based organisations like health services can begin to gain trust for the priorities. The model of health care requirements describes a reasonable model for establishing internal legitimacy in a priority setting process. Pluralistic bargaining, the community approach, and muddling through elegantly are priority setting processes concerned with improving the conditions for external legitimacy. However, they present two fundamentally different perspectives: to prospectively (ex ante) build confidence through guiding principles and a transparent and pluralistic decision making process, or to retrospectively (ex post) provide an opportunity to review and revise the results. Of the strategies reviewed, two emerge as being more attractive in regard to developing a priority setting process for health services in Sweden. These are the model of health care requirements to assure internal legitimacy and pluralistic bargaining to enhance the conditions for external legitimacy.

40|$|This Article {{considers}} the likely effects of continued political polarization {{on the relative}} power of Congress and the Supreme Court. Polarization already is leading to an increase {{the power of the}} Court against Congress, whether or not the Justices affirmatively seek that additional power. The governing model of Congressional-Supreme Court relations is that the branches are in dialogue on statutory interpretation: Congress writes federal statutes, the Court interprets them, and Congress has the power to overrule the Court’s interpretations. The Court’s interpretive rules are premised upon this dialogic model, such as the rule that Supreme Court statutory interpretation precedents are subject to 2 ̆ 7 super strong 2 ̆ 7 stare decisis protection because Congress can always correct an errant court interpretation. Legislation scholars also write as though congressional overriding remains common. In fact, {{in the last two decades}} the rate of Congressional overriding of Supreme Court statutory decisions has plummeted dramatically, from an average of 12 overrulings of Supreme Court cases in each two-year Congressional term during the 1975 - 1990 period to an average of 5. 8 overrides for each term from 1991 - 2000 and to a mere 2. 8 average number of overrides for each term from 2001 - 2012. Although some of the decline seems attributable to the lower volume of Supreme Court statutory <b>interpretation</b> <b>decisions,</b> the decline in overridings greatly outpaces this decline in cases. Instead, partisanship seems to have strongly diminished the opportunities for bipartisan overridings of Supreme Court cases, in which Democrats and Republicans come together to reverse the Supreme Court. In its place we see a new, but rarer, phenomenon, partisan overriding, which appears to require conditions of near-unified control of both branches of Congress and the presidency. The two recent examples are the Military Commissions Act of 2006, in which Republicans overturned the Court’s statutory interpretation decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld on the habeas corpus rights of enemy combatants, and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, in which Democrats overturned the Court’s statutory interpretation decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire 2 ̆ 6 Rubber Company on how to measure the statute of limitations period in certain employment discrimination lawsuits. In a highly polarized atmosphere and with Senate rules usually requiring 60 votes to change the status quo, the Court’s word on the meaning of statutes is now final almost as often as its word on constitutional interpretation. Although political polarization has benefited the Supreme Court’s power relative to Congress in the short term, the longer term power relations are more uncertain. Aside from the statutory interpretation dialogue, Congress interacts with the Supreme Court in other ways, including through Senate confirmation of Supreme Court judicial nominees. The recent partisan realignment of the Supreme Court makes it more likely that a Supreme Court judicial nominee will be filibustered in the Senate, thanks to the increasing willingness of Senators to oppose nominees on ideological grounds and increased partisan polarization in the Senate. The number of Senators from the opposing party of the nominating president voting against Supreme Court nominees is approaching or exceeding the filibuster level. Depending upon how the politics plays out in a possible filibuster of a Supreme Court judicial nominee, we may see either an erosion of the use of the filibuster in the Senate or a compromise which would weaken the power of the judiciary, such as term limits imposed upon future Supreme Court Justices. Part I of this Article demonstrates that despite the model of Congress-Court dialogue, and Supreme Court statutory interpretation tools premised on dialogue, congressional overridings of Supreme Court statutory interpretation precedents have become exceedingly rare. The effect of this change is to empower the Court over Congress. Part II argues that the steep decline in overridings over the last two decades appears due in large part to increased polarization in Congress and not simply to a decline in the number of Supreme Court statutory interpretation cases. When Congress does override a Supreme Court case, it is now more likely to be a partisan overriding, pushed through in periods of unified government. Part III is more speculative. It considers how polarization in Congress and the partisan realignment of the Supreme Court — a Court in which all the conservative Justices are Republicans and all the liberal Justices are Democrats — may eventually lead to a major confrontation in Congress over the power of the Senate filibuster. That confrontation may leave the Senate, the Supreme Court, or both, looking very different than they are today. Furthermore, partisan realignment has the potential to harm the Supreme Court’s legitimacy in a way which we have not witnessed in modern times...|$|E
40|$|German arms export {{policies}} {{have proved to}} be an eternally emotive issue in political and social debate. Although the controversy does not, in the long run, illuminate, the vehemence with which it is time and again conducted indicates that all is not well. In a democracy based on the rule of law, should we not be able to assume that the apparent collisions between accepted norms and vested interests are governed by the law in a way that political and administrative actions do not produce any fundamental contradictions in terms? To meet this objective, the law must be universally valid and achievable, to ensure the maintenance of peace under the law. In reality, a glance at the system of legal norms and procedures that shape current German arms export politics leaves an impression of “extraordinary complexity” and reflects “an extremely unclear and interlocked structure of legal rulings with numerous origins” candidly admits a legal commentator. This judgement is confirmed when these legal foundations, as they appear in their German sources, are considered {{in the context of the}} European Union and in view of the general global situation. Therefore, it is not surprising that the German political and administrative handling of arms exports gets tangled in inconsistencies that feed the controversy. In view of this awkwardness, the situation should be reviewed from the perspective that maintenance of the peace nationally also demonstrates the state’s ability to maintain peace at an international level, particularly if that state is a democracy. Difficulties already start with the effort to define, in detail, what is meant by the phrase “arms exports. ” Currently, a distinction is drawn between the cross-border transfer of arms, defence equipment, goods that promote war and dual-use goods. Most recently, the term “military equipment” has been used to summarise all these different categories of items. As a consequence, the Arms Control Law (Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz) and the law ruling commercial relations with other states (Law for Foreign Trade, Außenwirtschaftsgesetz), including their detailed administrative regulations, apply. However, intervention is repeatedly required to ensure harmony between administrative acts and the changing parameters of political actions. This is demonstrated by the various editions of the “Principles of Government Policy in Relation to Arms Export,” the most recent of which was published in January 2000. German law only applies, however, where it has not been superseded or complemented by EU regulations. This is true for the treatment of dual-use goods and for the growing consolidation of cooperation in arms manufacture within Europe. While decisions about arms export issues in the context of the EU still fall under the ultimate sovereignty of individual states, the EU member states agreed, in 1998, to a code of conduct concerning arms transfers. This agreement contains criteria to be applied to the decision making process of the individual member states. Special emphasis is given to the human rights standards, social and economic aspects of development and the regional and domestic stability of the receiver states. Also, the code of conduct commits EU member states to present a report annually on the previous year’s arms export activities to the European parliament and requires the member states to provide each other with information about their arms trade. II The EU code of conduct incorporates aims, formulated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the beginning of the nineties, that also relate to the adjustment of export policies of Central and Eastern European states. The idea of agreeing to a code of conduct, when legally binding arrangements do not seem possible, also formed the basis of an agreement between the EU and the USA in December 2000, the goal of which was the realisation of a global code of conduct. In this context, the EU and the USA can make reference to similar initiatives of other regional alliances, in particular the Organisation of American States (OAS), the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and some groups of states in South Asia. All these initiates demonstrate that the international arms trade has become part of arms control politics. In addition to being influenced by regulations within individual states and newly agreed political understandings, arms export politics takes into consideration informal consultation and coordination mechanisms, which are treated as “gentlemen’s agreements”. The best known of these is the 1994 / 5 ”Wassenar Arrangement,” which followed the earlier Coordination Committee for Multilateral Exports Controls (COCOM). It aims to regulate the export of conventional arms and equipment, sensitive dual-use goods and plant. The arrangement has more than thirty participant states, including Russia and other states that formerly belonged to the Warsaw Pact. Despite the informal nature of this agreement, the resulting regime has a strong influence on national and European export controls. The legal and political situation can, thus, be summarised as consisting of a “hard” core surrounded by “soft” regulations, instructions and procedures that together form the basis of decisions and are open to <b>interpretation.</b> <b>Decisions</b> are often made in an inconsistent manner, as political recommendations are influenced by conflicting economic and technological interests, not to mention cases of political opportunism with regard to the granting or refusal of individual arms export licences. Different levels of law, national, international and trans-national, are entwined, often leaving legislative loopholes and creating contradictions in terms. While lawyers might be used to dealing with different levels of law, politicians and the public find it much more difficult to cope with the resulting dilemmas. Exaggeratedly, the situation in Germany can be characterised as follows: 1. the prohibition versus the allowance of cross-border trade in defence equipment; 2. qualitative criteria for the decision making process versus lists of countries; 3. national versus international or trans-national restrictions; 4. governmental agreements versus cooperation in the private sector; 5. secrecy versus transparency. The current state of affairs casts doubt on whether the general validity, clarity and enactment of present laws can be sufficiently guaranteed. This rocks the foundations of the legitimacy and legality of arms export politics – a situation or constellation that calls for a fundamental examination and reorientation of arms export politics, down to its very roots. III The plea for a revision of the foundations of the arms export politics and for a search for alternatives, aims to reconcile the legal norms and procedures with the political requirements and central trends of the social debate, which could remedy the deficits that can, in the long run, damage a democracy based on the rule of law. This should also include changes in the global arms market that have occurred in the meantime. This market can be divided into different segments: The first segment relates to the predominantly uncontrolled distribution of the means of mass destruction, in the form of a multitude of so-called small arms. These can be characterised as being easy to transport, easy to handle without previous knowledge, low cost and long-lived. They are produced in many places and are available on open, grey and black markets. The second segment relates to the transfer of technologically advanced and very expensive weapons systems, the purchase and deployment of which is only sensible in cooperation with modern, highly qualified forces. In between these two segments exists a third segment that relates to the trade of weapons and defence equipment that are considered outdated by industrial states but which still have high value as status symbols or as part of the military politics of less demanding prospective buyers. A German contribution to the first segment of the global arms market exists in form of German licences, which are openly used to produce and distribute weapons in an uncontrolled way, not to mention the transfer of plant of German origin that can be used to produce those weapons or their ammunition. Conventional legal instruments have become virtually ineffective for monitoring, as this segment is becoming more and more mixed up with cross-border criminal acts, international drugs trade and money laundering. Therefore, national as well as international measures are required to put an end to illegal deals. Also, in order to decrease demand for these weapons, it is imperative to strengthen international criminal law, cooperation between police and customs and initiatives in development policy regarding violent conflict-zones in the Third World. As a consequence of the increasing integration of the foreign and security policies of the European Union, of the restructuring of the armed forces in many countries and the increasing cooperation or even merger of European defence industries, it will not be possible to control the second and third segment except in a European context. The six most important arms producing states in the European Union settled on a skeleton agreement in July 2000 that creates the basic conditions for such a European endeavour. It would be anachronistic if arms export politics continued as a remnant of national sovereignty, rather than becoming a component of this political and economical process. It would be consistent to restrict the transfer of weapons and defence equipment to the circle of states that are part of these developments. Also, the norms and qualitative criteria that are valid here should govern decisions about transfer of surplus weapons to countries that are not part of military or security alliances. If it were possible to reconcile the procedures involved in political direction setting with decisions about arms export, then the law would no longer have to serve as workshop, repairing the faults caused by political omissions and failures. IV Although all options so far discussed assume that some form of arms export will continue to be carried out, the alternative of living without such deals should also be considered. This would place considerable emphasis on the proclaimed aim of a democracy to be recognised as a ‘civil power’ (Zivilmacht), including in their behaviour to other states. However, the most important suppliers of arms are still democracies that provide arms to the rest of the world. Without the supply of weapons and other defence equipment, the intensity with which brute force is used in the violent conflicts in which democracies are involved, would decrease. Thus, the costs of such a sudden change in policy need to be weighed against the burdens imposed by the current situation. This comparison might also reveal connections that would cast a different light on the pros and cons of arms transfer and might even convince current advocates of arms trade. One example of such a process is the successful campaign, 150 years ago, for the abolition of slavery. If democracy, law and peace are to go hand in hand, then the rejection of arms export is a good example to test this cause and a global advertisement for it...|$|E

Much of this work has demonstrated the complex and sophisticated needs of so-called knowledge workers, and the requirement for better understandings of knowledge sharing processes. The example we present in this paper is that of knowledge work in emergency calls at SOS Alarm in Sweden, currently of interest because of a planned new system that will allow for centre-to-centre case coordination and not only within the centre. What makes such a case interesting is that workers in this context face an unlimited variety of incidents that require <b>interpretation,</b> <b>decision</b> and coordination, many of which require the deployment of local knowledge and, as importantly, {{have to be dealt with}} in a timely fashion. In this paper we focus on how a number of people work to combine their knowledge and expertise in a time effective way...|$|R

40|$|Transcription is an {{essential}} clinical tool for speech-language pathologists as it provides a permanent written record of communicative behaviour and forms {{an important source of}} data for analysis, <b>interpretation,</b> <b>decision</b> making, and dissemination. One of the responsibilities in speech-language pathology is to faithfully capture the speech production characteristics of clinical populations so that informed management decisions may be made. Notation systems that are appropriately suited for this purpose are mandatory. In Australia today, the conventional phonemic transcription system was first described over 60 years ago. However, an alternative to this traditional system has more recently been proposed by Harrington, Cox and Evans (HCE). This paper details the HCE system and argues its advantage as a clinical tool for speechlanguage pathologists in Australia. This new system provides a more accurate phonetically oriented foundation against which atypical vowel production can be assessed. It is further argued that the HCE system can form the basis for narrower phonetic examination and has pedagogical value in the description of Standard Australian English. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNanotechnology, {{like other}} {{emerging}} technologies that increasingly characterize {{the dynamic of}} our era, makes specific demands on datamining to track and interpret efficiently what is happening, through publications and other scientific output. We here propose and describe a strategy based on an automated lexical modular methodology to overcome rapidly evolving content and classification problems, which may otherwise accommodate poor quality of data and expert bias, with potential dire consequences for <b>interpretation,</b> <b>decision</b> and strategy. The proposed methodology {{is based on an}} initial nanostring enriched and screened by eight subfields, automatically identified and defined through the journal inter-citation network density displayed in the initial core nanodataset. Relevant keywords linked to each subfield are then tested for their specificity and relevance before being sequentially incorporated to build a modular query. We then, as a first test, compare the database constructed using this methodology for years 2003 and 2005 with those obtained by other approaches previously used to cover and explore the nanotechnology dynamic. Finally, using the inherent transparency, portablity and replicability of our methodology, we offer, in order to help our initial query evolve and develop, a set of evaluation processes for tests by researchers in the nano field, other scientometric teams and intelligence experts involved in decision-making processes...|$|R
