40|$|Saturation is {{becoming}} more and more of an issue for infrastructure owners, but there is no existing method to measure it. This master thesis aims at suggesting a method in order to evaluate the saturation level of a railway line. Saturation has an ambiguous definition. It deals with capacity <b>issues,</b> <b>timetable</b> stability and robustness, and with delay issues. Three methods are mainly studied, each one defining saturation from a different angle, and meeting a different definition of saturation. These methods are the compression method, defining saturation as a capacity issue, the robustness method, and the regularity method, i. e. delays analysis. A fourth method is created and studied in order to complete the previous three. The idea is to find the relevant indicators to evaluate saturation. These methods are first studied from a theoretical perspective before being applied to a study case to choose the relevant indicators. This study case involves a statistical analysis and a dynamic simulation of the graphical timetable. The results show that the regularity method is irrelevant to study saturation. The method suggested by this master thesis in order to evaluate saturation is a two-step method. The first step is the diagnosis based on the compression method and the traffic heterogeneity. The second step is the comparison between different scenarios to reduce saturation: this step is based on the compression method, the robustness method and the traffic heterogeneity. This method can later be used for an economic study or a multi-criteria analysis...|$|R

The aim is to answer the question when in the design and development of application or system it is appropriate to proceed with one of these models. Furthermore, this work also provides a general procedure for mapping conceptual schema into XML schema structures and solutions to problems that can come across during the mapping process. The problem is solved by analyzing two real <b>issues</b> - <b>timetables</b> of public transportation and the information system of a swimming school, formalized through a mechanism of predicate logic.

40|$|Finding {{reliable}} train connections is {{a considerable}} <b>issue</b> in <b>timetable</b> information since train delays perturb the timetable daily. We present an effective probabilistic approach for estimating the reliability of connections in a large train network. Experiments on real customer queries and real timetables for all trains in Germany show that our approach can be implemented to deliver good results {{at the expense of}} only little processing time. Based on probability distributions for train events in connections, we estimate the reliability of connections. We have analyzed our computed reliability ratings by validating our predictions against real delay data from German Railways. This study shows that we are able to predict the feasibility of connections very well. In essence, our predictions are slightly optimistic for connections with a high rating and pretty accurate for connections with a medium rating. Only for the rare cases of a very low rating, we are too pessimistic. Our probabilistic approach already delivers good results, still has improvement potential, and offers a new perspective in the search for more reliable connections in order to bring passengers safely to their destinations even in case of delays...|$|R

40|$|AbstractScheduling {{university}} timetabling {{for large}} numbers of students is a difficult task especially to ensure no overlapping. Most of timetables are prepared manually, or at best {{with the help of}} a spreadsheet program. However, a manual process requires numbers of verification by domain experts (for example lecturers, supervisors) before it can be approved. In this research, we focus on a solution to the university timetabling problem. We will consider various soft and hard constraints of time tabling parameters such as a number of subjects (“subject”), a number of lecture or tutorial sessions (“time slots”), a number of classrooms (“sessions”), number of teachers (“teacher”), number of students (“student”) and number of workloads (“workload”). We use methods based on simulated annealing to obtain optimal and sub-optimal solutions to scheduling problems.

The Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Libraries {{is one of the}} libraries that is embracing the cloud by implementing Alma, a cloud-based library management system. This article will provide an overview of the VCU Libraries’s journey from implementation up until “Go Live” {{through the eyes of the}} Acquisitions Department. The VCU Libraries was on the verge of buying two new servers to support its operations. After researching available library management systems, Alma was found to be an attractive prospect. Around the same time, the Libraries was looking for a discovery tool, Primo, and felt that Primo and Alma, both Ex Libris products, would be a good fit. After showing a true interest in Alma, VCU received an invitation to upgrade its software as an “early adopter” that was being offered to only 12 North American libraries in 2011. As early adopters, there were many challenges encountered by the Implementation Task Force. The Task Force had to make configuration decisions, attend training sessions, conduct internal training sessions, analyze existing workflows, and review configuration and migrated data. This article will document the Libraries’s journey in the cloud. A discussion of opportunities and challenges are discussed. Readers will learn about processes, cleanup and workflow <b>issues</b> and <b>timetables.</b> Finally, this article will share some lessons learned by different members of the Alma Implementation Task Force...|$|R

Assessment tasks designed for students to continually put teaching skills into practice are essential to develop quality teachers. The process involved student and teacher consultation {{and the establishment of}} additional school-university partnerships. The purpose of the research was to review the school-university partnerships and to determine whether these links have been beneficial to the students and the schools involved. Forty physical and health education students in their final year of pre-service training were surveyed (questionnaire and interviews) along with personnel from schools and school-related organisations. Results indicated that the links have been well established and that there have been mutual benefits. Students found the tasks and experiences meaningful and useful for their future teaching careers whilst participating personnel indicated a desire to continue the partnerships. <b>Timetabling</b> <b>issues,</b> transport the need for coordination and guidlines for schools and tertiary institutions to follow when establishing partnerships are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Agent {{technology}} promises {{possibilities for}} the design of distributed systems, the design of open systems and the reduction of information overload for the users. Timetabling applications must operate in heterogeneous environments at large organisations where users cannot be bothered with all the details influencing their work schedules. It is a domain where, at least at the system level, many separately developed systems must interact. In this paper, we investigate how agent technology can play a part in timetabling applications. Timetabling problems are distributed by nature but performance also contributes to the distributiveness. The performance issues are related to the complexity of the timetabling problem and the need to respond within a limited time. The problem becomes distributed when departments of a different speciality are interconnected and have to gear their timetables to one another. Timetabling systems must be open systems since they have to interact with existing software. Data are stored in databases; business systems may contain relevant information. The results of the timetabling operations must be fed back to these information providers because these systems ultimately control the operations. Timetabling systems need as much detail as possible while they must report on the resulting timetable to users with a limited scope. Both channels must be guarded against information overload. The user should not be prompted to specify information which he has not available and he should not be confronted with information he cannot interpret. On the other hand the system should try to understand what the user really wants and comment on the results in an accessible way to the user. The three mentioned key <b>issues</b> in <b>timetabling</b> systems are competences for which software agents are particularly appropriate.
