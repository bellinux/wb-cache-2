Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever {{you have to do to}} get me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E

If compensation or anti-pollution measures cost too much the highway will be built elsewhere, or not at all. Similar for flying, or polluting industries. Insurance companies will put a premium on all risky activities, making them either economically viable or not possible.|$|E

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION Convoy <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> public <b>highway</b> is <b>a</b> phenomena with multiple benefits.

50|$|In 1951, a truck {{driven by}} Paul Breithaupt {{collided}} with another vehicle while <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> near Carlsbad, New Mexico. Three passengers in Breithaupt's truck were killed, and Breithaupt {{was taken to}} a local hospital to treat serious injuries. Responding officers found a nearly empty one-pint bottle of whiskey in the truck's glove compartment. While Breithaupt lay unconscious in the emergency room, officers ordered physicians to take a sample of his blood. A chemical analysis of this blood sample determined that Breithaupt was {{under the influence of alcohol}} when the sample was taken. This blood sample was admitted into evidence at trial, and Breithaupt was ultimately convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Breithaupt filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court of New Mexico, but the state supreme court denied relief. He then filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming the taking of the blood sample violated his rights to substantive due process. On April 23, 1956, the Supreme Court granted Breithaupt's petition for certiorari.|$|E

40|$|A hard {{real-time}} {{vision system}} has been developed that analyses color videos taken from a car <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>highway.</b> The system uses a combination of color, edge, and motion information to recognize and track the road boundaries, lane markings and other vehicles on the road. Cars are recognized by matching templates that are cropped from the input data online, by detecting image features, and by evaluating how these features relate to each other. Cars are also recognized by temporal differencing and by tracking motion parameters that are typical for cars. The system recognizes and tracks road boundaries and lane markings using a recursire least squares filter. Experimental results demonstrate robust, real-time car recognition and tracking over thousands of image frames...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is based on}} two previously published approaches one of which automatically extracts vehicle trajectories from image sequences of traffic scenes and associates these trajectories with motion verbs.

Building on implemented representations for elementary motion verbs and for elementary road vehicle maneuvers, a grammar to represent a nontrivial subset of more complex driving activities on a highway is formulated. <b>Driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> can thereby be investigated not only at the level of control algorithms, but simultaneously at the level of naturual language descriptions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Driving always {{involves}} risk. Various means {{have been}} proposed to reduce the risk. Critical motion detection of nearby moving vehicles {{is one of the}} important means of preventing accidents. In this paper, a computational model, which {{is referred to as the}} dynamic visual model (DVM), is proposed to detect critical motions of nearby vehicles while <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>highway.</b> The DVM is motivated by the human visual system and consists of three analyzers: 1) sensory analyzers, 2) perceptual analyzers, and 3) conceptual analyzers. In addition, a memory, which is called the episodic memory, is incorporated, through which a number of features of the system, including hierarchical processing, configurability, adaptive response, and selective attention, are realized. A series of experimental results with both single and multiple critical motions are demonstrated and show the feasibility of the proposed system.
