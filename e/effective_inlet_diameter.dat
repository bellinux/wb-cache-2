40|$|Cooling tower inlet {{losses are}} the flow losses or viscous {{dissipation}} of mechanical energy affected {{directly by the}} cooling tower inlet design, which according to the counterflow natural draft wet-cooling tower performance analysis example given in Kröger (Kröger, 2004, Air-Cooled Heat Exchangers and Cooling Towers: Thermal-Flow Performance Evaluation, Pennwell Corp., Tulsa, OK), can be more than 20 % of the total cooling tower flow losses. Flow separation at the lower edge of the shell results in a vena contracta with a distorted inlet velocity distribution that causes a reduction in effective fill or heat exchanger flow area. In this paper, a two-dimensional (axi-symmetric) computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model is developed using the commercial CFD code ANSYS FLUENT, to simulate the flow patterns, loss coefficients and effective flow diameter of circular natural draft cooling tower inlets under windless conditions. The CFD results are compared with axial velocity profile data, tower inlet loss coefficients and effective diameters determined experimentally by Terblanche (Terblanche, 1993, "Inlaatverliese by Koeltorings," M. Sc. Eng. thesis, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa) on a cylindrical scale sector model as well as applicable empirical relations found in Krger, determined using the same experimental apparatus as Terblanche. The validated CFD model is used to investigate the effects of Reynolds number, shell-wall thickness, shell wall inclination angle, fill loss coefficient, fill type, <b>inlet</b> <b>diameter</b> to <b>inlet</b> height ratio and inlet geometry on the flow patterns, inlet loss coefficient and effective diameter of full-scale cooling towers. Ultimately, simple correlations are proposed for determining the cooling tower inlet loss coefficient and <b>inlet</b> <b>effective</b> flow <b>diameter</b> ratio of full-scale cooling towers excluding the effect of rain zones and the structural supports around the cooling tower entrance. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

40|$|Abstract — Vortices can be {{produced}} and ingested into the intake of a jet engine during high power operation {{in the vicinity of}} solid surfaces causing Foreign Object Damage (FOD) or compressor stall and engine surge problems. This can occur when the engine is mounted on the wing of a plane during take-off and engine ground runs or when the engine is placed inside a test cell for testing after an engine overhaul and prior to reinstallation onto the aircraft. In order to prevent such vortices from forming, especially in the test cells, it is necessary to be able to predict the onset of the vortex or understand the factors affecting the formation of such vortices. Ho and Jermy [TD 1 DT] investigated vortex formation using a suction tube in a open-end box model simulating an engine in a test cell scenario and found that 3 distinct regimes of flow (regular vortex, deformed vortex and no vortex) exists as the ratio of suction inlet velocity to upstream average velocity (Vi/Vo) varies. The effect of the upstream velocity gradient and suction <b>inlet</b> <b>diameter</b> on the threshold is considered. The results show that the as the size of the suction <b>inlet</b> <b>diameter</b> is increased, the range of conditions over which a vortex forms also increases. This is in line with earlier findings [TD 2 DT] in the take-off and engine run scenarios. The threshold for all three regimes appears to shift to a lower Vi/Vo for a given ratio of height over <b>inlet</b> <b>diameter</b> (H/Di). This indicates that in order to accommodate a larger engine, it is necessary to increase the size of the test cell by more than the ratio of engine diameters if the same margin of safety (with respect to vortex formation) are to be maintained...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, the Reynolds {{number at}} mean flow was <[*] 1760 and was >[*] 2000 at peak flow under intubation. Therefore, gas flow became {{turbulent}} at peak flow and then decelerated markedly to a laminar flow, regardless of tube size, because the lower critical Reynolds number is approximately 1760, below which turbulent structures cannot be sustained by any induced disturbance [25]. The pressure gradient of turbulent flow produces fluid flow less efficiently {{than that of}} laminar flow [26 – 28], which may have affected WOB and pressure parameters. The upper critical value of the Reynolds number for transition from a laminar to a turbulent flow cannot be generalized even when at 2000 in clinical practice. Hof et al.

The <b>inlet</b> <b>diameter</b> of ASL 5000 ™ was sufficiently large, such that inspiratory flow constantly remained laminar {{with an increase in}} respiratory rate because the Reynolds number was constantly <[*] 1760.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{swimming}} {{fish on the}} average velocity and velocity profile of a circular tank was studied. Working with different <b>inlet</b> <b>diameters</b> and flow rates, nine different impulse forces (configurations) were evaluated. Each configuration was tested with and without fish, {{and the effects of}} two different fish sizes were compared. The velocity profiles in experiments with fish presented a considerable reduction in velocity in the centre of the tank near the outlet, which was a consequence of the increase in the kinematic eddy viscosity due to the turbulence introduced by fish swimming. A flattening of the angular velocity profile was observed in the central area of the tank, which had a radius of about 0. 3 m (18...|$|R
