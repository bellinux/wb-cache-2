The READ foundation was created {{in light of the}} high proportion of children in New York City from low-income households who, at that time, read <b>below</b> <b>grade</b> level. READ benefits kindergarten and first-grade students at risk of reading <b>below</b> <b>grade</b> level. The average session is forty-five minutes of phonics and fluency, conducted by middle through high-school students.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study vas to {{determine}} whether a relationship exists between reading ability and self-concept of academic ability. The Nelson-Denny Reading Test was administered to 253 freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior college subjects. The scores attained by the subjects were used to classify the subjects as reading above actual <b>grade</b> placement or <b>below</b> actual <b>grade</b> placement, according to norms for their re:pective groups. Further stratification was done on the basis of sex. Thus, the subjects were classified in one of the following four categories: males reading above grade placement, females reading above grade placement, males reading <b>below</b> <b>grade</b> placement, and females reading <b>below</b> <b>grade</b> placement. All subjects {{in each of the four}} categories were also given the Michigan State Self-Concept of Academic Ability Scale. The results indicated that those subjects above grade level have a higher self-concept of academic ability than those reading <b>below</b> actual <b>grade</b> level. No difference was found between male and female subjects. (WR) i...|$|R
