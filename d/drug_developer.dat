5|$|The fugitives {{arrive at}} Elizabeth's house, where she tends to Steve, {{in the late}} stages of his infection. One of Steve's pustules erupts in her face, killing him and infecting Elizabeth. At that moment, Mulder and the Marshals raid the house and arrest her, but find Paul missing. Meanwhile, Scully traces Torrance's package to Pinck Pharmaceuticals, a major <b>drug</b> <b>developer.</b> She also finds an insect {{in the body of}} another prisoner. Dr. Osbourne, who has become infected, reveals that his team works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme {{produced}} by the insect. However, the insect has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts. Osbourne claims that the insect and its contagion were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment. He tells Scully that since she was next to him when he became infected, she may have contracted the contagion as well.|$|E

50|$|Artificial {{scarcity}} {{is said to}} {{be necessary}} to promote the development of goods. In the example of digital information, it may be free to copy information ad infinitum, but it requires a significant investment to develop the information in the first place. In the example of the pharmaceutical industry, production of drugs is fairly cheap to execute on a large scale, but new drugs are very expensive. This is because the initial investment to develop a drug is generally billions of dollars, due to strict regulation. Typically, drug companies have profit margins much higher than this initial investment, but the high payoff also attracts many companies to compete, increasing the pace of drug development. A feature of many economies is also time limit in patent rights; after a set number of years enjoying an artificial scarcity, the patent wears off and cheap generic versions of a product enter the market. Thus, the <b>drug</b> <b>developer</b> gets a return on investment, and other companies subsequently compete to lower prices.|$|E

In August 2015, Valeant said it would purchase Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1 billion, a day after Sprout received approval to market the women's libido drug Addyi. In September 2015, Valeant licensed psoriasis drug Brodalumab from AstraZeneca for up to $445 million. In September 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire eye surgery product manufacturer, Synergetics USA, for $192 million in order to strengthen the company's Bausch & Lomb division.

40|$|The {{repositioning}} or “repurposing” {{of existing}} therapies for alternative disease indications {{is an attractive}} approach that can save significant investments {{of time and money}} during drug development. For cancer indications, the primary goal of repurposed therapies is on efficacy, with less restriction on safety due to the immediate need to treat this patient population. This report provides a high-level overview of how <b>drug</b> <b>developers</b> pursuing repurposed assets have previously navigated funding efforts, regulatory affairs, and intellectual property laws to commercialize these “new” medicines in oncology. This article provides insight into funding programs (e. g., government grants and philanthropic organizations) that academic and corporate initiatives can leverage to repurpose drugs for cancer. In addition, we highlight previous examples where secondary uses of existing, Food and Drug Administration- or European Medicines Agency-approved therapies have been predicted in silico and successfully validated in vitro and/or in vivo (i. e., animal models and human clinical trials) for certain oncology indications. Finally, we describe the strategies that the pharmaceutical industry has previously employed to navigate regulatory considerations and successfully commercialize their drug products. These factors must be carefully considered when repurposing existing drugs for cancer to best benefit patients and <b>drug</b> <b>developers</b> alike...|$|R

5000|$|Expanded access (also {{known as}} {{compassionate}} use or [...] "pre-approval access") {{refers to the}} use of an investigational new drug (IND) outside of a clinical trial by people with serious or life-threatening conditions who do not meet the enrollment criteria for the clinical trial in progress. Outside the US, such access is allowed through Named patient programs. In the US this type of access may be available, in accordance with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, when it is determined that people may benefit from the treatment, the therapy can be given safely outside the clinical trial setting, no other alternative therapy is available, and the <b>drug</b> <b>developer</b> agrees to provide access to the drug.

30|$|The {{relevance}} of solid form in drug {{development has been}} well established over time. In order to fully understand drug properties, {{attention has been paid}} to solid state structure of drug molecules and their relationship to the drug formulation. While each <b>drug</b> <b>developer</b> has had their own strategies and workflows for screening and choosing solid forms of drug molecules, the industry is aware of instances where “the best laid plans” often go awry. This manuscript has summarized several case studies in development programs that display the “good, bad, and ugly” of solid form changes.|$|E
30|$|Every {{innovator}} <b>drug</b> <b>developer</b> has approached API {{solid form}} decisions {{with a unique}} paradigm; however, identifying and maintaining the optimal API solid form in early pharmacokinetic studies, as well as maintaining this form through product launch, has been recognized as an ideal situation. This utopian scenario, however, has often been noted to be far removed from reality, especially if the API solid form has been ignored or assumed to be trivial for a particular program. This has often led to significant program delays and cost as bioequivalence studies, new crystallization studies, or formulation development may have been needed.|$|E
