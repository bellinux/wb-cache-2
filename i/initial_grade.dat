50|$|Throughout its life, the Short Line (as it {{was known}} to residents) faced stiff {{competition}} from the Lehigh Valley's Ithaca & Auburn Branch. The two-car maximum up the hill out of Ithaca effectively guaranteed to the LV the freight business of Ithaca, but the Short Line offered four trains a day between Ithaca and Auburn, against two for the Lehigh Valley. However, the Short Line lacked the financial resources of the Lehigh Valley, and struggled in the harsh upstate winters. It went into receivership in 1912 and was reorganized as the Central New York Southern Railroad in 1914 (organized May 28; property of NYA&L conveyed July 14). At this time the <b>initial</b> <b>grade</b> out of Ithaca was eased somewhat {{with the construction of}} an S-shaped approach from Percy Field, replacing the use of the steeper Cayuga Heights loop of the Ithaca Street Railway; this is the abutment over East Shore Drive that is still in place. This gentler grade allowed the use of gas-powered McKeen cars through to Auburn, so that passengers no longer needed to change from electric to steam in South Lansing. The purchase of two McKeen cars to speed the Ithaca-Auburn run could not put off insolvency forever. The Rogues Harbor spur was closed on October 19, 1920, and the last run on the main line was made on October 19, 1923. The railroad was formally abandoned in 1924, and rail was removed in 1925, except for the line from Ithaca to Remington, which was operated by the Ithaca Traction Corporation to serve a powerhouse until 1931.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the reliability of}} the diagnosis of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), and the variation between and within microscopists, from urethral smears at a large London genitourinary medicine clinic. METHODS: A senior microscopist (SM) preselected 60 Gram stained urethral smear slides, 20 negative (20 p/hpf). Ten experienced microscopists, blinded to these <b>initial</b> <b>grades,</b> examined all slides giving each a polymorph score. After relabelling and randomly changing their order, the slides were re-examined by the same microscopists. Finally, the SM determined whether the study had resulted in loss of cells from any of the slides. The SM's <b>initial</b> <b>grading</b> and the consensus among microscopists provide two gold standards for analysis. RESULTS: Nine low grade and five high grade slides were removed from analysis because of loss of cells. By SM standard, considering microscopists' readings as simply non-NGU (or= 5 p/hpf), 97 % from negative slides were correct (variation 93 - 100 across microscopists), 68 % from low grade slides (45 - 95), and 94 % from high grade slides (83 - 100). Consistency between repeat readings by the same microscopist was 96 % for negatives, 75 % for low grade and 89 % for high grade slides. Results were similar by consensus standard. CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable variation between and within microscopists in the diagnosis of NGU. Sensitivity was strongly related to grade of urethritis, with an appreciable proportion of low grade urethritis falsely diagnosed as negative. With increasing attendances for sexual health screening, a false positive rate of only 3 % may lead to many false diagnoses...|$|R
