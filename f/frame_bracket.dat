In this work automotive gage panel (GP) is designed based on Finite Element Model (FEM). The stationary and transient {{behaviors of the}} gage panel under dynamic excitations as well as stress distribution under static loading are investigated. Dynamic behavior of the gage panel is obtained by solution of the full FEM models in case of random excitations as well as polyharmonic loading.

50|$|To {{initiate}} the performance, {{there must be}} a frame of some sort to indicate that what is to follow is indeed performance. The <b>frame</b> <b>brackets</b> it as outside of normal discourse. In customary lore such as life cycle celebrations (ex. birthday) or dance performances, the framing occurs as part of the event, frequently marked by location. The audience goes to the event location to participate. Games are defined primarily by rules, it is with the initiation of the rules that the game is framed. The folklorist Barre Toelken describes an evening spent in a Navaho family playing string figure games, with each of the members shifting from performer to audience as they create and display different figures to each other.|$|R

Next, for a rear frame model, shape parameter study on collapse characteristics such as peak resistance load and absorbed energy was carried out. Also, the stiffness of <b>frame</b> mounting <b>brackets</b> was predicted using inertance calculation and the durability of those mounting brackets for vehicle system loads was evaluated.

50|$|Bicycle frames {{utilizing}} pressed bearing standards do {{not have}} any threads inside the bottom bracket shell. The bottom bracket is pressed directly into the frame. Using pressed in standards allows frame manufacturers greater flexibility in frame design that many times offers greater stiffness and weight reductions. The current pressed-bearing standards (and developed by) are: BB30 (Cannondale), PF30 (SRAM), BB90 & BB95 (Trek), BB86 & BB92 (Shimano), BB79 (Cervelo’s BBRight), and BB386EVO (FSA and BH bicycles). In BB30, BB90 & BB95 systems: the bearings are pressed directly into the frame. For PF30, BB86 & BB92, BB79, and BB386EVO; the bearing is housed in a nylon plastic cup that is pressed into the <b>frame’s</b> bottom <b>bracket</b> shell. Pressed in standards usually require two-piece cranksets where the spindle is attached to one of the crankarms. Due to fixed spindle length and diameter, cranksets designed for one pressed standard may not be compatible with another. For example, a crankset made specifically for BB30 will not fit in a BB86 bottom <b>bracket</b> and <b>frame.</b> There are other instances where adapters can be used to fit a crankset made for one standard into another. For example, a Shimano (two piece Hollowtech II 24mm OD spindle) road crankset can fit into a BB30 bottom bracket shell (42mm ID) using aftermarket adapters.|$|R

40|$|Mirror shape {{accuracy}} {{as a key}} optical {{performance parameter}} for parabolic trough collectors can be assessed accurately by common measurement systems proving the high quality of state-of-the-art mirror panels. However, measurement results cannot always be compared directly because critical boundary conditions are not yet standardized. This paper quantifies the differences in shape accuracy results between the most common measurement setups for parabolic trough mirror panels and identifies measurement position, mounting mode and support frame employed for the measurement as relevant boundary conditions. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels of RP 3 geometry were performed at DLR’s QUARZ Center Cologne in vertical (mounting points vertically and curved direction horizontally aligned) and horizontal measurement position (mirrors facing upward with mounting points horizontally aligned), both with and without tightening the mirrors to a support frame with screws. Finite element models were applied to calculate gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of support frame: an ideally rigid support frame, a laboratory support frame, and an ideal support <b>frame</b> with elastic <b>brackets.</b> The measurement results demonstrate that the difference in position and mounting mode can lead to relevant deviations of the shape accuracy results higher than {{the uncertainty of the}} employed deflectometric measurement system. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 7 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position was measured. Mirror shape specifications may thus not be applicable in all positions. Concerning the mounting onto different types of modeled support frame (in horizontal position) a variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) was calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid support frame compared to the case when mounted to a support <b>frame</b> with elastic <b>brackets...</b>|$|R
