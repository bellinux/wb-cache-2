5|$|In {{the present}} day, Dr. Archie Hopper (Sbarge) {{continues}} to evaluate Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), {{who is still}} trying to convince him that he is Jiminy. Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) officially makes Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the <b>damaged</b> <b>area,</b> Regina (Lana Parrilla) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in her pocket. She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people in}} the stadium were unaware that the (first) Ibrox {{disaster}} had happened. People even re-occupied the <b>damaged</b> <b>area,</b> despite the danger of further collapse. A definite reason for the disaster was not agreed upon, partly {{because there was no}} public inquiry held. Some experts blamed the quality of wood and the supplier was tried for culpable homicide, but was acquitted. The design was also cited as a possible cause. Generally, wooden structures of that size were not trusted. Rangers removed the wooden terraces, reducing capacity to 25,000. The criticism of the design did not deter Rangers from hiring Leitch in the future. He designed an expansion of Ibrox to a 63,000 capacity by 1910, using slopes made of earth. By this point, the city of Glasgow had the three largest purpose-built football grounds in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the <b>damaged</b> <b>area.</b> In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
40|$|Immersion type {{ultrasonic}} C-scan {{has been}} performed on Twaron-epoxy (T-E) and Twaron-polypropylene (T-PP) composite laminates impacted by 7. 62 mm armor piercing (AP) projectile with different striking velocitiesto assess the bullet inflicted <b>damage</b> <b>area.</b> Square zones of size 72 mm by 72 mm around each impact area are subjected ultrasonic C-scan in pulse echo mode. Ultrasonic features are  extracted and processed {{to estimate the}} <b>damage</b> <b>area</b> in the laminates due to each impact. The variation in internal <b>damage</b> <b>area</b> is correlated with ballistic properties of composite laminates. It is observed that in the similar range of impact velocity, the <b>damage</b> <b>area</b> is invariably higher in composites made from thermoplastic polypropylene (PP) resin compared to the thermoset epoxy resin. The internal <b>damage</b> <b>area</b> of impacted panel is found to decrease with increase in impact velocity for both the types of resin matrix which corroborated the trend in experimental ballistic curve. The internal <b>damage</b> <b>area,</b> however, increases substantially when shot lodging takes place inside the laminate below ballistic limit or upon excessive yawing.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{automatic}} detection method of the <b>areas</b> <b>damaged</b> by an earthquake. We use aerial {{images that are}} taken {{before and after the}} earthquake. To detect the <b>damaged</b> <b>areas,</b> we register these two aerial images. It is difficult to register two aerial images by using only the image information, and hence, we use digital map for registering them. First each aerial image is registered to the digital map by using the perspective transformation. Then we detect <b>damaged</b> <b>areas</b> by computing the differences between the registered images. The <b>damaged</b> <b>areas</b> can be detected automatically and correctly by our method. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis) {{population has}} caused forest damage in Finland. However, the occurrence, extent {{and importance of}} the damage have not been comprehensively studied. The field inspection {{was carried out in}} all of the beaver <b>damage</b> <b>areas</b> (n = 50) in the Anttola, Juva and Pieksämäki game management units in summer 1998. The characteristics of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas,</b> types of <b>damage</b> and the severity of the damage were examined. The size of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas</b> averaged 2. 2 ha. The <b>damage</b> <b>areas</b> occurred on peatland forest more (p < 0. 05) than expected. The dominant tree species were commercially valuable trees such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) (33 %), Norway spruce (Picea abies) (18 %) and birches (Betula spp.) (47 %). Birch occurred as dominant tree species more (p < 0. 05) than expected. The proportion of older forest development classes was considerable. The most important type of damage was flooding (50 %) caused by the damming activity of beavers. The trees were dead or dying in 18 % of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas.</b> It was estimated that the ecosystem engineering performed by beavers was of no importance in 28 % of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas.</b> Prevention of beaver damage has been carried out in 80 % of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas.</b> In the study area, beaver numbers have steadily increased, although the number of beavers taken by hunting and the allowed hunting harvest have sharply increased. It is suggested that the methods used to prevent beaver damage should be improved and a compensation system should be provided by the state for the most <b>damaged</b> <b>areas.</b> Beavers can cause damage to commercial forestry, and this should be taken into account more effectively in the management plans made by the game management districts...|$|R

25|$|Knee {{osteotomy}} {{is commonly}} used to realign arthritic damage {{on one side of}} the knee. The goal is to shift the patient's body weight off the <b>damaged</b> <b>area</b> to the other side of the knee, where the cartilage is still healthy. Surgeons remove a wedge of the tibia from underneath the healthy side of the knee, which allows the tibia and femur to bend away from the damaged cartilage.|$|E

25|$|If {{the impact}} of {{symptoms}} of osteoarthritis on {{quality of life is}} significant and more conservative management is ineffective, joint replacement surgery or resurfacing may be recommended.

25|$|On July 11, 2010, a fire {{broke out}} in a {{maintenance}} building during operating hours, forcing the evacuation and closure of the park. The fire was contained to a single building, located adjacent to the park's wave pool and used principally for storage. Spokespeople for the water park and for the Cobb County fire department noted that everyone was evacuated safely {{and that there were}} no reported injuries. The park re-opened two days later on July 13 after crews had sealed off the <b>damaged</b> <b>area</b> caused by the fire.|$|E

It was also found that at the moment of accident at least six nuts were missing from the bolts securing the turbine cover. After the accident 49 recovered bolts were investigated, of which 41 had fatigue cracks. On 8bolts, the fatigue <b>damaged</b> <b>area</b> exceeded 90% of the total cross-sectional area.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 1917, {{the palace}} was {{declared}} {{to be part}} of the Hermitage public museums. This first exhibition to be held in the Winter Palace concerned the history of the revolution, and the public were able to view the private rooms of the Imperial Family. This must have been an interesting experience for the viewing public, for while Soviet authorities denied looting and damage to the palace during the Storming, the Russian art connoisseur Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov, who visited these rooms immediately before and after the event, described the private apartments as the most badly <b>damaged</b> <b>area</b> of the palace. The contents of the state rooms had been sent to Moscow for safety when the hospital was established, and the Hermitage Museum itself had not been damaged during the revolution.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the cleanup}} of the {{derailment}} area could take 5 years, about 115 businesses were planning to relocate. 40 buildings have already been destroyed but another 160 {{may need to be}} expropriated for demolition because they sit on several metres of contaminated soil which must be removed and replaced with clean fill. Subsequent reconstruction on the site may initially be impractical as new buildings would require deeper foundations until the new fill settles. The town was considering making a memorial park in the <b>damaged</b> <b>area</b> and relocating displaced businesses to a proposed Papineau Street extension to cross the Chaudière River to Lévis Street. The new road was to be constructed in October 2013 using federal and provincial infrastructure funding, although insurance coverage for local companies to abandon contaminated sites remained uncertain. For 125 businesses, the move was expected to be permanent.|$|E

25|$|Sicily was at {{the time}} ruled as part of the Crown of Aragon by the Kings of Spain. The Viceroy in Madrid, the Duke of Uzeda, reacted by {{appointing}} Giuseppe Lanza, the Duke of Camastra, and the Prince of Aragon as Vicars General for the Val Demone and Val di Noto regions of Sicily respectively. Due to illness, both the Prince of Aragon and his replacement the bishop of Syracuse were unable to take up the position of Vicar General for Val di Noto and the Duke of Camastra was forced to take on the responsibility for both areas. Camastra already had considerable experience as an administrator, having served in a number of senior military and judicial positions. The Viceroy also appointed three generals as commissioners in order to organise the immediate relief efforts in the worst affected cities. One of the Duke of Camastra's first acts was to temporarily exempt the worst affected areas from taxes. Amongst other administrators sent to the <b>damaged</b> <b>area</b> was Colonel Don Carlos de Grunenbergh, Royal Engineer to the King of Spain, who had experience in planning and building fortifications.|$|E
25|$|Treatment in {{the acute}} setting is mostly focused on {{symptomatic}} management. After initial {{treatment in the}} hospital, some patients will need short-term placement {{in a nursing home}} or rehabilitation facility before going home. In hospital settings the doctors work with speech pathologists in issues like these. Typically, a commonly used tool to assess the degree of severity of dysphagia and speech issues is the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, which offers a validated guide to assessing plan of action (solid food diet, all liquid diet, IV hydration, etc.) for the patient while in the hospital and the proper course of action in the outpatient setting. Rehabilitation in Wallenberg’s Syndrome focuses on improving balance, coordination, working on activities of daily living, and improving speech and swallowing function. Severe nausea and vertigo can be present and limit progress in rehabilitation and recovery. Symptomatic treatment with anti-emetics and medications for the hiccups are important. Commonly used anti-emetics include ondansetron, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and promethazine. These medications are also used to treat hiccups, along with chlorpromazine. There are case reports of other medications useful in treating hiccups in Wallenberg’s Syndrome including baclofen and anti-epileptic medications. The prognosis for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of <b>damaged</b> <b>area</b> of the brain stem. Some individuals recover quickly while others may have significant neurological disabilities for months to years after the initial injury.|$|E
25|$|Further explosions by {{two more}} torpedoes that hit under the second stack, port side (near frame 82 and about frame 85) {{less than two}} minutes later at about 0205 caused catastrophic and {{terminal}} damage. Men were thrown about twice with each following explosion and the force was greater the higher up in the ship's structure. This is the time that Carpenter was injured. The forward movement of the ship along with the massive structural frame damage caused the ship to twist and jackknife around the <b>damaged</b> <b>area.</b> The ship's momentum quickly fell off and began to flood. The center part twisted to 45 degrees port sinking first. It dragged the rear of the ship down until the stern was vertical. Men quickly realized that the damage was fatal and began to abandon ship. About 22 minutes after the ship was first hit the ship sunk, at about 0225. In the meantime, Carpenter - who had been wounded in the legs - and others of the crew abandoned ship by going over the side after cutting free all the surviving lift rafts into the ocean. Even though the forward momentum of the ship dropped off rapidly the survivors were scattered over several hundred yards, at night, amidst a raging naval battle. Later currents would separate them even more.|$|E

40|$|After an {{earthquake}} occurs, {{it is vital}} to identify hard-hit areas and evaluate the degree of damage. The evaluation can be carried out through a field reconnaissance survey. However, it is time consuming and requires a lot of resources. In case of a large natural disaster, a fast assessment of the <b>damaged</b> <b>areas</b> is required to dispatch rescue teams to the heavily <b>damaged</b> <b>areas</b> and draw recovery plans. In this paper, satellite images are used to identify the affected areas due to the 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey earthquake. A method is developed to recognize the heavily <b>damaged</b> <b>areas,</b> sunk areas into the sea, and the areas affected by fire. The damage detection has been carried out by comparing and rationing between different bands of the LANDSAT/TM satellite images taken before and after the earthquake. The results obtained by using this method are then compared with the ones that were obtained from field surveys...|$|R
