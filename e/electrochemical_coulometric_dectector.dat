40|$|The {{target of}} this bacalary work was to {{validate}} the metod for determination of adrenaline and noradrenaline in plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with <b>electrochemical</b> (<b>coulometric)</b> detection. The metod was first necessary to optimize for the coulometric detection because it was used the Bio-Rad kit, {{which was designed to}} determine with amperometric detection. The principle of this metod is the chromatographic separation of substances with subsequent oxidation of the determined analyte passes through the analytic cell with coulometric detection. The part of the analytical procedure is the solid phase extraction. The part of this work was the optimization of the metod for the coulometric detector. For the analysis were selected following potentials: channel 1 - 350 mV with range 100 nA, channel 2 - 0 mV with range 50 nA, guard channel 0 mV with range 50 nA. Furthermore, the chromatographic metod was fully validated (accuracy, precision, limit of detection, robustness).

40|$|Methods were {{developed}} {{for the analysis of}} natural antioxidants including phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient HPLC with multi-channel <b>electrochemical</b> <b>coulometric</b> detection. Suitability of various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and sensitivity with limits of detection in the low mu g L- 1 range, at least an order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved identification of natural antioxidants...|$|R
40|$|Spatially {{selective}} electrodeposition of poly- 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) {{thin films}} on metallic surfaces {{is shown to}} be an effective means of visualizing latent fingerprints. The technique exploits the fingerprint deposit as an insulating mask, such that electrochemical processes (here, polymer deposition) may only take place on deposit-free areas of the surface between the ridges of the fingerprint deposit; the end result is a negative image of the fingermark. Use of a surfactant (sodium dodecylsulphate, SDS) to solubilise the EDOT monomer allows the use of an aqueous electrolyte. <b>Electrochemical</b> (<b>coulometric)</b> data provide a total assay of deposited material, yielding spatially averaged film thicknesses, which are commensurate with substantive filling of the trenches between fingerprint deposit ridges, but not overfilling {{to the extent that the}} ridge detail is covered. This is confirmed by optical microscopy and AFM images, which show continuous polymer deposition within the trenches and good definition at the ridge edges. Stainless steel substrates treated in this manner and transferred to background electrolyte (aqueous sulphuric acid) showed enhanced fingerprints when the contrast between the polymer background and fingerprint deposit was optimised using the electrochromic properties of the PEDOT films. The facility of the method to reveal fingerprints of various ages and subjected to plausible environmental histories was demonstrated. Comparison of this enhancement methodology with commonly used fingerprint enhancement methods (dusting with powder, application of wet powder suspensions and cyanoacrylate fuming) showed promising performance in selected scenarios of practical interest. 11549...|$|R

BackgroundWe have previously {{reported that a}} daily oral high dose of l-folinic acid {{for the treatment of}} hyperhomocysteinemia in hemodialysis patients does not provide significantly greater reduction in fasting total homocysteine (tHcy) levels than an equimolar dose of folic acid. The present study uses the affinity/HPLC method to analyze the distribution of plasma folate forms in patients who received l-folinic acid versus those who received folic acid. This was done to investigate claims that renal insufficiency is associated with impaired folate interconversion, a stance that is supportive of the premise that tHcy lowering in these patients is more efficacious with folinic acid and other reduced folates, than folic acid. MethodsForty-eight chronic and stable hemodialysis patients were block-randomized, based on their screening predialysis tHcy levels, sex, and dialysis center, into two groups treated for 12 weeks with oral folic acid at 15 mg/day or an equimolar amount (20 mg/day) of oral l-folinic acid. All 48 subjects also received 50 mg/day of oral vitamin B 6 and 1 mg/day of oral vitamin B 12. Folate distribution was determined in plasma of 46 participants (Folinic acid group, N = 22; Folic acid group, N = 24) by using the affinity/HPLC method, with <b>electrochemical</b> (<b>coulometric)</b> detection. ResultsBoth groups had similar baseline geometric means of plasma total folate and similar folate forms distribution. Following treatment, both groups demonstrated similar marked elevation in plasma total folate (geometric mean of the increase: Folinic acid group, + 337 ng/mL; Folic acid group, + 312 ng/mL; P = 0. 796). In the folinic acid-treated group, practically all of the increase in total folate was due to 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate. In the folic acid-treated group 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate accounted for 35 % of the increase in total folate and the remainder was unmethylated folic acid. ConclusionsData from the present findings suggest that defects in folate absorption or impairment in folate interconversion are not the cause of the persistent hyperhomocysteinemia in hemodialysis patients...|$|R
40|$|Erythromycin is a {{macrolide}} antibiotic with {{a spectrum}} similar to penicillin {{and is used}} mainly {{in the treatment of}} infections caused by gram-positive organisms. Since its discovery in 1952, erythromycin has achieved wide-spread clinical use. Susceptibility of erythromycin base to inactivation by acid results in decreased availability following exposure to acidic gastric fluids. Formulation of acid resistant dosage forms and the preparation of acid stable chemical derivatives have been attempted to improve absorption and subsequent clinical efficacy. Two of the most commonly used erythromycin derivatives are the stearic acid salt (erythromycin stearate) and the lauryl sulphate salt of the propionyl ester (erythromycin estolate). Although it has been known for many years that erythromycin is susceptible to acid degradation, very few reports on the stability of erythromycin in aqueous solutions appear in the literature. In this study, a high-performance liquid chromatographic system using electrochemical detection was employed for a kinetic study of erythromycin degradation. The effect of varying acid pH on the degradation rate of both erythromycin base and erythromycin stearate, and the effect on the hydrolysis rate of erythromycin estolate is presented. In addition, the effect of temperature on erythromycin degradation was also investigated. Until recently, the majority of pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies have utilized relatively non-specific microbiological assay procedures. However, in this study a solid phase extraction, followed by the use of a high-performance liquid chromatographic system using <b>electrochemical</b> <b>coulometric</b> detection was employed for the determination of erythromycin in biological fluids. Human volunteers each received enteric coated erythromycin base pellets in capsule dosage form and also film coated erythromycin stearate tablets on separate occasions. Results from the clinical trials revealed the enteric coated erythromycin base pellets had a greater bioavailability than the film coated erythromycin stearate tablets. Computer fitting of data revealed no intra-volunteer variability in elimination rate constants, suggesting differences in serum levels following administration of both dosage forms are due to variation in absorption.

40|$|Nonstoichiometric cerium dioxide, CeO 2 -x, is {{generally}} regarded as an n-type defect semiconductor at elevated temperatures and low oxygen partial pressures (P O 2). At high P O 22 Ì 7 s, below about 800 âC, p-type behavior has been reported but not extensively studied. Electrical conductivity and thermodynamic measurements have therefore been performed in order to characterize the defect structure and electrical behavior {{in the vicinity of}} the n to p transition. The dc electrical conductivity of single and polycrystalline CeO 2 -x, the latter with two different impurity levels, was measured in the temperature range of 600 - 1000 âC and from 1 - 10 - 4 atm of oxygen partial pressure. Partial conductivities and respective activation energies were determined by applying the law of mass action. Using the form Ï = Ï oe -(E/kT), activation energies of 2. 57 and 1. 15 eV were obtained for Ï n and Ï p respectively. The activation energy for ionic conductivity in the single crystal was 0. 63 eV when fit to the form Ï = Ï o Te -(E/kT). The ionic conductivity in the polycrystalline materials was affected by the grain boundaries. Electrical conductivity measurements were also made between 10 - 2 and 10 - 19 atm at 800 and 900 âC on one of the polycrystalline samples. Near-continuous data within this P O 2 region revealed one feature at â 10 - 6. 5 atm not previously reported. Thermodynamic measurements by <b>electrochemical</b> <b>coulometric</b> titration were made at 800 âC between 10 - 4 and 10 - 19 atm. High P O 2 data analyzed according to mass action equations indicated a significant number of holes compared to that of electrons are present in the high oxygen partial pressure region. Since the observed conductivity was only n-type at 800 âC, it was concluded that the drift mobility of the electrons was much greater than that of the holes. Thermodynamic constant composition measurements of CeO 2 -x for x 3 Ìc 10 - 2 revealed a decrease in the partial molar enthalpy with decreasing x for x 3 Ìc 10 - 2. 8.

40|$|Investigation of {{dopamine}} (DA) metabolism {{in humans}} {{is useful in}} order to get a deeper knowledge of neuropsychiatric disorders involving an altered DA transmission. The first reaction of the DA oxidative pathway, consists in oxidative deamination, carried out by monoamine oxidase (MAO). The direct product of MAO activity is dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPALD), which is immediately converted into dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). It is known that pharmacological inhibition of MAO, in animals as well as in humans, produces wide neurophysiological effects by modulating neurotrasmitter function. The activity of MAO can be evaluated by using several approaches, like: specific MAO inhibitors; radiotracers to examine the metabolic fate of catecholamines (CAs) and their metabolites; or, finally, deriving metabolic data from subjects with a genetically determined absence of one or both MAO isofonns (called MAO-A and MAO-B). Unfortunately, owing to the rapid conversion of DOPALD to DOPAC, the detection of the direct product of MAO (DOPALD), in vivo, has revealed a very difficult step to measure MAO activity. More recently, trans-striatal dialysis studies, performed in rats, in combination with either GLC mass-spectrometry or HPLC system and <b>coulometric</b> <b>electrochemical</b> analysis, have made possible to detect the aldehyde present in the extracellular fluid.

A novel high performance liquid chromatographic analysis of erythromycin in human serum and urine using U.

Because these metabolites are present in nanomolar concentrations in plasma, methods of detection generally require time-consuming precolumn processing or metabolite derivatization. Methods: We used HPLC with <b>coulometric</b> <b>electrochemical</b> detection for the simultaneous measurement of SAM and SAH in 200 ï¿½L of plasma, 10 6 lymphocytes, or 10 mg of tissue. Filtered trichloroacetic acid extracts were injected directly into the HPLC system without additional processing and were eluted isocratically. Results: The limits of detection were 200 fmol/L for SAM and 40 fmol/L SAH. In plasma extracts, the interassay CV was 3. 4 â 5. 5 % and the intraassay CV was 2. 8 â 5. 6 %. The analytical recoveries were 96. 8 % and 97. 3 % for SAM and SAH, respectively. In a cohort of healthy adult women with mean total homocysteine concentrations of 7. 3 ï¿½mol/L, the mean plasma value was 156 nmol/L for SAM and 20 nmol/L for SAH. In women with increased homocysteine concentrations (mean, 12. 1 ï¿½mol/L), plasma SAH, but not SAM, was increased (P < 0. 001), and plasma pyridoxal 5 ï¿½-phosphate concentrations were reduced (P < 0. 001). Plasma SAM/SAH ratios were inversely correlated with homocysteine concentrations (r ï¿½ 0. 73; P < 0. 01), and the SAM/SAH ratio in plasma was directly correlated with the intracellular SAM/SAH ratio in lymphocytes (r ï¿½ 0. 70; P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Increased homocysteine in serum is associated {{with an increase in}} SAH and a decrease in the SAM/SAH ratio that could negatively affect cellular methylation potential.

40|$|Erythromycin is a {{macrolide}} antibiotic used {{mainly in}} the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive organisms. Erythromycin base is rap idly degraded in acidic media necessitating the use of structurally modified erythromycin derivatives or acid resistant dosage forms in order to decrease gastric inactivation of the drug. The majority of pharmacokinetic studies to-date have utilized relatively non-specific microbiological assay procedures which are unable to differentiate between concentrations of active erythromycin base and the inactive pro-drug derivatives. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique is described for the simultaneous determination of erythromycin base and propionate (inactive pro-drug form) in human serum and urine following the oral administration of erythromycin estolate, an acid stable derivative of erythromycin. The method involves a solid-phase extraction step prior to chromatography on a C 18 reversed-phase column with <b>coulometric</b> <b>electrochemical</b> detection. Sample handling and storage techniques are presented which minimize hydrolysis of the inactive ester moiety between sample collection and analysis, thereby more accurately reflecting the in vivo situation than in previously published studies. Results from single dose pharmacokinetic studies indicate that only 10 - 15 % of the total erythromycin concentration in vivo is present as the active base component following oral administration of erythromycin estolate. This percentage increases to approximately 25 % during multiple dose administration. Novel urinary excretion data are presented which reveal that approximately 40 % and 55 % of the total erythromycin excreted in urine is excreted as erythromycin base following single and multiple dosages respectively. Computer fitting of mean serum concentration-time data revealed that an open one compartment model with linear first order absorption and elimination best described the absorption and disposition of erythromycin, although poor computer fits for individual data sets were observed. Some evidence of non-linear elimination is presented utilizing both compartmental and non-compartmental pharmacokinetic techniques. Large intra-and inter-personal variability in erythromycin absorption and disposition was experienced which was evaluated in five subjects who each received one 500 mg erythromycin estolate tablet from the same batch, on three separate occasions. In addition. an HPLC method is described for the analysis of "total erythromycin" concentrations following erythromycin estolate administration which involves hydrolysis of the ester component prior to chromatography. as well as an HPLC method utilizing amperometric electrochemical detection capable of monitoring the stability of erythromycin base in stored biological fluids. These methods were uti I ized in various stability studies involving erythromycin base and propionate {{as well as for the}} analysis of erythromycin estolate dosage forms...|$|R
