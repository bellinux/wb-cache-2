25|$|In {{conversation}} <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> the ultramontane Bishop Michael Corrigan {{that before}} his conversion {{he thought of}} becoming a Jesuit, and before his consecration a Redemptorist, but from both intentions his director dissuaded him. In addition to the volume on the Church on New York he wrote the Memoirs of Simon Gabriel Brute, First Bishop of Vincennes (New York, 1855), about Simon Bruté.|$|E
25|$|James Boswell who was {{a student}} of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the Literary Club, says that Smith thought that {{speaking}} about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, and so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> Sir Joshua Reynolds that 'he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood'.|$|E
25|$|James Dobson {{was born}} to Myrtle Georgia (née Dillingham) and James C. Dobson, Sr., on April 21, 1936, in Shreveport, Louisiana. From his {{earliest}} childhood, religion played a central part in his life. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> a reporter that he learned to pray before he learned to talk, and says he gave his life to Jesus {{at the age of}} three, in response to an altar call by his father. He is the son, grandson, and great-grandson of Church of the Nazarene ministers, although he does not speak for the denomination in any capacity.|$|E

500|$|Branham {{also taught}} {{that women were}} not a [...] "created product of God". Rather they were merely {{byproducts}} of man. His pronouncements with respect to women were often contradictory. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> women who wore shorts not to call themselves Christians. But he qualified his denunciations by affirming that obedience to his moral code was not a requirement for salvation. However, he also implied that no woman that disobeyed his [...] "Thus Saith the Lord" [...] moral code {{would be part of}} the rapture.|$|E
500|$|Dmowski had a scientist's {{background}} and thus preferred logic and reason over emotion and passion. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> famous pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski that music was [...] "mere noise". Dmowski {{felt very strongly}} that Poles should abandon what he considered to be foolish romantic nationalism and useless gestures of defiance and should instead work hard at becoming businessmen and scientists. Dmowski was very much influenced by Social Darwinist theories, then popular in the Western world, and saw life as a merciless struggle between [...] "strong" [...] nations who dominated and [...] "weak" [...] nations who were dominated.|$|E
500|$|He was {{in custody}} at Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight from February 1992 to August 1993, {{where he became}} a model prisoner. [...] Initially he did menial jobs such as dishwashing and general {{cleaning}} and was later promoted {{to the position of}} butcher, under the training of James Quigley, a prison caterer with more than 20 years' experience, and another inmate only identified as [...] "Ginger", who had been a professional butcher. They taught him how to dismember and remove the bone from animals after slaughtering them. Martin performed his duties with such efficiency that <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> Quigley he wished to open a butcher's shop after his release.|$|E
5000|$|As a union leader, Gilmore {{was known}} for his skill in public speaking, good humour, and {{straight}} talking manner - reportedly telling then-Prime Minister Ted Heath to [...] "cut the commercials". <b>He</b> also <b>once</b> <b>told</b> then-industry secretary Sir Keith Joseph to shut up.|$|R

500|$|As president, Coolidge's {{reputation}} as a quiet man continued. [...] "The words of a President have an enormous weight," [...] he would later write, [...] "and {{ought not to be}} used indiscriminately." [...] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. [...] "I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President," [...] <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> Ethel Barrymore, [...] "and I think I will go along with them." [...] Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic, while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening {{after the death of his}} son in 1924.|$|E
500|$|On {{the campus}} of the University of Chicago in December 1967, 25 years to the minute after the team of {{physicists}} led by Enrico Fermi achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore's Nuclear Energy was unveiled on the site of what was once the university's football field stands, in the rackets court beneath which the experiments had taken place. This 12-foot-tall piece {{in the middle of a}} large, open plaza is often thought to represent a mushroom cloud topped by a massive human skull, but Moore's interpretation was very different. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> a friend that he hoped viewers would [...] "go around it, looking out through the open spaces, and that they may have a feeling of being in a cathedral." [...] In Chicago, Illinois, Moore also commemorated science with a large bronze sundial, locally named Man Enters the Cosmos (1980), which was commissioned to recognise the space exploration program.|$|E
500|$|At Cambridge Inglis' {{students}} included Sir Frank Whittle (developer {{of the jet}} engine), James N. Goodier (mechanical {{engineer and}} academic), Sir Morien Morgan (called the [...] "Father of Concorde") and Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt (Conservative peer). [...] He was also in contact with Russian railway engineer Yury Lomonosov and lectured to biochemist Albert Chibnall. [...] Despite mentoring {{some of the best}} engineers of their generation Inglis was realistic about the actual intentions of many of his students at the time. [...] <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> a new intake class: [...] "Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated. In 10 years' time, however, 90% of you will have become managers, whether of design, manufacturing, sales, research or even accounts departments in industry. The remaining 10% of you will have become successful lawyers, novelists, and things of that sort". [...] Undeterred, Inglis sought to give his students the broadest possible engineering education, covering all fields to prevent them becoming [...] "cramped by premature specialisation".|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it isn't yours?" [...] she asked, turning {{round to}} him. It was an impulse of sympathy {{that made her}} look at him now, for she already knew how much he had {{the success of his}} {{newspaper}} at heart. <b>He</b> had <b>once</b> <b>told</b> her <b>he</b> loved the Reverberator as he had loved his first jack-knife.|$|R

500|$|Baker found {{enjoyment}} {{outside the}} office through sports. He joined the St. Nicholas Club, an amateur hockey team in New York, soon after he arrived in the city. Pyne introduced Baker to both polo and auto racing, sports he quickly mastered. Baker remained well known from his time at Princeton; marquees at his home arena, which was shared with Princeton, often said [...] "Hobey Baker Plays Tonight". This made Baker uncomfortable and he eventually asked the building manager to take down the sign. Preferring a life {{out of the public}} eye, <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> a reporter that he would rather have nothing written about him. In order to leave the arena quickly after hockey games without having to deal with the public, Baker often borrowed Pyne's valet and car. During the two years that Baker played hockey with St. Nicholas, he was {{recognized as one of the}} best players in the American Amateur Hockey League and named to the post-season All-Star Teams both years. While still with the St. Nicholas Club, Baker was offered a contract by the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey Association. He turned down an offer of $20,000 to play three seasons as social conventions prohibited a person of his standing from playing sports for money.|$|E
500|$|Arranger Nelson Riddle found Sinatra to be a [...] "perfectionist {{who drove}} himself and {{everybody}} around him relentlessly", {{and stated that}} his collaborators approached him {{with a sense of}} uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament. [...] Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others. On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians. [...] After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> Sammy Cahn, who wrote songs for Anchor's Away, [...] "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne, and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it were a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it were a [...] "rhythm" [...] number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior. Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter {{at the end of each}} number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as [...] "Isn't that a pretty ballad" [...] or [...] "Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song", delivered with [...] "childlike delight". She states that after each show, Sinatra would be [...] "in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".|$|E
2500|$|Yoshizawa {{began his}} {{collaboration}} with acclaimed film composer, John Williams, on Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster, Jurassic Park. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> the Cultural News {{web site that}} Williams asked him to play the shakuhachi for Jurassic Park because the instrument [...] "sounds like a dinosaur's cry." ...|$|E

60|$|Gregory {{had been}} ordered to remain with the camel train; to keep them, as much as possible, together, and prevent wide gaps from {{occurring}} in the ranks. It was tedious work; {{and the end of}} the train did not arrive, until broad daylight, at the spot where the infantry halted. <b>He</b> at <b>once</b> <b>told</b> Zaki to pitch his little tent, which he had already shown him how to do, while he went to see if there were any orders at headquarters.|$|R
2500|$|Davis {{believed}} that his singing career enhanced his political prospects. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> Georgia Republican Ronnie Thompson, a mayor of Macon: [...] "If {{you want to}} have any success in politics, sing softly and carry a big guitar," [...] a play on an old Theodore Roosevelt adage.|$|E
2500|$|... "Technique is {{something}} you use to make your ideas listenable", <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> jazz writer Len Lyons.

Don Bradman ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{a general}} exclamation of astonishment. Those {{of the men who}} had already lain down upon their straw for the night sat up again, and all crowded round to hear Ralph's story, which <b>he</b> at <b>once</b> <b>told</b> at length; and which, when finished, gave rise here--as it had done at the officers' table--to an {{animated}} discussion. Several of the men shook hands warmly with the Barclays, congratulating them on their offer to undertake this dangerous service, and upon the valuable--though unfavorable--information which they had obtained.|$|R
50|$|After 11 years enjoying {{good health}} {{with his new}} heart, <b>he</b> was <b>once</b> again <b>told</b> <b>he</b> needed a new heart {{transplant}} yet. As a result, on 5 July 2005 <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again underwent emergency heart transplant surgery, this time at the Centro Cardiovascular de San Juan (San Juan Heart Center) in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He thus became {{the first person to}} have two heart transplants in the Caribbean. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> again recuperated satisfactorily.|$|R

This act {{was said to have}} outraged Antonia, who was {{grandmother}} to Gemellus as well as to Caligula.|$|E
2500|$|Not surprisingly, Muir's {{deep-seated}} {{feeling about}} nature as being his true home led to tension {{with his family}} {{at his home in}} Martinez, California. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>told</b> a visitor to his ranch there, [...] "This {{is a good place to}} be housed in during stormy weather, [...] [...] [...] to write in, and to raise children in, but it is not my home. Up there," [...] pointing towards the Sierra Nevada, [...] "is my home." ...|$|E

5000|$|Heinlein {{found another}} {{publisher}} (Putnam), feeling himself {{released from the}} constraints of writing novels for children. <b>He</b> had <b>once</b> <b>told</b> an interviewer {{that he did not}} want to do stories that merely added to categories defined by other works. He rather wanted to do his own work, stating that: [...] "I want to do my own stuff, my own way".
