500|$|UGA {{created the}} music game Space Channel 5, in which players help a female outer space news {{reporter}} named Ulala fight aliens with [...] "groove energy" [...] by dancing.

[...] Neither Space Channel 5 nor UGA's Rez were commercially successful, and the latter title was only available in the U.S. market through a PS2 port released in limited quantities. Hitmaker's arcade ports included Crazy Taxi—an open world arcade racing game known for its addictive gameplay, which sold over one million copies and has been frequently cited {{as one of the best}} Dreamcast games—and Virtua Tennis—which revitalized the tennis game genre with a simple two-button control scheme and use of minigames to test the player's technique. Smilebit's Jet Set Radio—in which players control a Tokyo-based gang of youthful, rebellious inline skaters called the [...] "GGs", who use graffiti to claim territory from rival gangs while evading an oppressive police force—has been cited as a major example of Sega's commitment to original game concepts during the Dreamcast's lifespan. Lauded for composer Hideki Naganuma's [...] "punchy, psychedelic" [...] soundtrack incorporating elements of [...] "J-pop and electro-funk" [...] as well as its message of [...] "self-expression and non-violent dissent", the game also popularized cel shaded graphics. Despite wide praise for its style, some criticized Jet Set Radios gameplay as mediocre, and it failed to meet Sega's sales expectations.

50|$|The Araucaria Project is a {{collaboration}} between astronomers from institutions in Europe, Chile and the US. Its principal aim is to provide an improved calibration of the local extragalactic distance scale. In the process of setting up the extragalactic distance scale, the greatest difficulty leading to the currently largest contribution on the systematic uncertainty of the Hubble constant lies in the determination of accurate absolute distances to nearby galaxies. The principal reason for this persisting difficulty is in the unknown dependences of stellar standard candles, {{used to measure the}} distances of nearby galaxies, on the <b>environmental</b> <b>properties</b> of their host galaxies (metallicity, age of the stellar populations etc.). The Araucaria Project is an effort to remedy this situation for several of the most important stellar candles, including Cepheid variables, RR Lyrae stars, red clump giants, and blue supergiants which all have the potential to provide accurate distance determinations to nearby galaxies once their environmental dependences are well calibrated. Our strategy is to determine precise distances using the various stellar candles to handful of galaxies with widely different environmental parameters, carefully analyze the distance differences between the different stellar candles, and how they vary with the environmental parameters of their host galaxies.|$|E
5000|$|His {{main focus}} in {{bioethics}} {{is on the}} transition from paternalistic models of patient care towards partnership models between providers and customers of health care. [...] He has developed a widely used and translated ‘Interactive Post-Hippocratic Action Guide’ and other models for communication-in-trust and cooperation-in-trust interactions of individual, institutional and corporate persons in risk assessment, research and business ethics. His proposed virtues and principles for cross-cultural health care ethics include for the patient the balance between {{quality of life and}} length of life, individual self-determination and compliance with expert advice, for the expert the balance between professional responsibility and respect for clients’/patients’ autonomy, do-no-harm and do-good; trust, truthfulness and a prudent mix of solidarity and subsidiarity are important for all parties involved in the care for health, quality and happiness of life. He proposes that most ethical issues should be decided by risk-competent and health-literate citizens rather than bureaucracies and legislation, but that governments and institutions have the responsibility to introduce and to support health information and health competence as an essential part of educating risk-competent citizens for the 21st century. [...] As to health care reform and health education he defines in criticizing the WHO approach: Health is not just a status; rather the balanced result of health-literate and risk-competent care of one's own physical, emotional, and social well-being and well-feeling, achieved in competent understanding, modification and enhancement of individual genetic, social and <b>environmental</b> <b>properties,</b> with the support of health care professionals and through equal access health care services, including information, predictive and preventive medicine. He also is concerned that modern principles of bioethics do not put enough emphasis on professionalism and compassion in expert services and on developing and supporting better communication-in-trust and cooperation-in-trust models of provider-customer interactions. His most recent work include studies in cross-cultural bioethics and fundamentally common issues in different cultures of bioethics.|$|E
