5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security Council {{resolution}} were initially contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement.

5|$|On July 8, a {{hurricane}} watch {{was put into}} effect for coastal areas between the Pearl River and the Steinhatchee River. Early on July 9, the hurricane watch was upgraded to {{a hurricane}} warning {{in anticipation of the}} storm. Early on July 10 prior to Dennis' landfall, the warning was discontinued for locations between the Steinhatchee River and the Ochlockonee River, leaving Alabama within the advisory. <b>Just</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> the storm moved ashore, the warning was adjusted to include areas from the Alabama/Mississippi border to Destin, Florida. On July 10, the coastal hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning, although inland hurricane warnings remained in place. At 2200 (UTC) on July 10, all tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued as the hurricane progressed inland.|$|E
5|$|As the {{depression}} drifted erratically, the system remained weak {{due to its}} large circulation and lack of deep convection near the center. The center relocated to the south, closer to the center. An approaching upper-level trough lessened the shear over the system, allowing {{the depression}} to intensify into Tropical Storm Alex on August 1. The trough also caused Alex to increase its forward motion to the northeast. Deep convection continued to build over the center due to low shear and warm waters from the Gulf Stream, and Alex intensified into a hurricane on August 3 while located 75miles (120km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The cyclone continued to strengthen, and attained Category 2 status <b>just</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> becoming a hurricane. The hurricane approached the Outer Banks of North Carolina, coming within 11miles (16km) of Cape Hatteras later on the 3rd. The western portion of the eyewall passed over the Outer Banks, though the center remained offshore.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} accelerated on {{a trajectory}} toward the central U.S. Gulf Coast, sliding {{south of the}} Florida Panhandle. During the afternoon of September 1, the hurricane attained its peak intensity, with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) as confirmed by reconnaissance aircraft. On the morning of September 2, Elena approached coastal Mississippi from the east-southeast, still at major hurricane status. It came ashore close to Biloxi, which was coincidentally within the hurricane's first forecast destination range before its extended detour. Once inland, the hurricane immediately deteriorated, weakening to a tropical storm <b>just</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> landfall, and its center rapidly filled. The system curved northwestward over Mississippi and Louisiana, and despite weakening, it continued to ignite thunderstorm activity which spawned heavy rains. Elena persisted for several days before degenerating into a remnant {{area of low pressure}} on September 4. Its associated cloud structure became distorted on September 5, and dissipated over Kentucky that same night.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{began their}} 2009 season {{in front of}} a sold-out crowd of 44,532 at Citizens Bank Park on April 5, playing against the Atlanta Braves.

The Phillies defeated the Washington Nationals in the opener of their third series, <b>just</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> the death of Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas, but lost the third scheduled game of the series after the second was cancelled due to weather.
