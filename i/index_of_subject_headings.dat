40|$|The {{program of}} {{study of the}} {{educational}} discipline “Analytical and synthetic processing of documents” (ASPD) is compiled according to the educational and professional programs of preparation for BACHELORS of the course (specialty) “ 6. 020102 book science, library science and bibliography”. The program of educational discipline consists of the following sections: 1. 	Macroanalitycal information folding: compiling of documentary bibliographic description. 2. 	Macroanalitycal information folding: annotation of documents. 3. 	Microanalitycal information folding: <b>indexing</b> <b>of</b> documents (systematization). 4. 	Microanalitycal information folding: <b>indexing</b> <b>of</b> documents (<b>subject</b> <b>headings,</b> coordinate <b>indexing).</b> 5. 	Microanalitycal information folding: bases of summarization. The aim of the educational discipline is a formation of system of theoretical, empirical and methodological knowledge of different types, processes, operations, analytical and synthetic processing of documents, acquisition of practical abilities and skills of documentary investigation, implementation of the information folding process and its transmission to the users by means of presentation of bibliographic records in the databases of the electronic catalog, in other documentary searching systems and it’s directly aimed to create secondary documents; to prepare specialists who are perfectly skilled in different types of scientific processing of documents. Achieving of the goal {{is provided by the}} lectures’ contents, seminars, practical training aimed at implementation of the following tasks: to reveal the object, the subject, the structure, interdisciplinary connections of “ASPD” as a training discipline; to introduce the evolution and modern state of various types of analytical and synthetic processing of documents; to give fundamental knowledge about essence, functions, assignment, specific features of compilation <b>of</b> bibliographic record, <b>indexing,</b> annotation and abstracting of documents taking into account peculiarities of institutions’ activity of documentary information sphere; to help in learning of general and specific principles, requirements, methods and rules of their compilation; to prepare students for independent performing of all processes of analytical and synthetic processing of documents in different documentary systems. In accordance with introduction of the newest information technologies it is foreseen to study matters of equipment and exploitation of automated working place (AWP) “Cataloguer” in various library systems of automation and formats UNIMARC, USMARC, UNIMARK /Authorities for classification data. It is foreseen by the program to apply computer equipment and modern integrated library software in the training process. ...|$|R
