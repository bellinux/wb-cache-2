The thermal performance of various types of systems like PCM trombe wall, PCM wallboards, PCM shutters, PCM building blocks, air-based heating systems, <b>floor</b> heating, <b>ceiling</b> <b>boards,</b> etc., is presented in this paper. All systems have good potential for heating and cooling in building through phase change materials and also very beneficial to reduce the energy demand of the buildings.

Slaughter felt quite disappointed about his life as a rancher and he had decided to retire from being a working rancher once his days as sheriff were over. Viola, however, convinced him otherwise.

30|$|Several reviews {{have been}} {{published}} {{on the use of}} PCM in buildings. Zalba et al. [8] presented the history of thermal energy storage with solidâ€“liquid phase change. Materials used by researchers as potential PCM and commercial PCM were described, together with their thermophysical properties. Farid [9] published a review about PCM building applications, which provides an insight to efforts to develop new classes of PCMs for use in energy storage in building applications. Tyagi and Buddhi [10] published a comprehensive review of various possible methods for heating and cooling in buildings. The thermal performance of various types of systems like PCM Trombe wall, PCM wallboards, PCM shutters, PCM building blocks, air-based heating systems, <b>floor</b> heating, <b>ceiling</b> <b>boards,</b> etc., was presented. The main focus of Kenisarin and Mahkamov [11] review was the assessment of the thermal properties of various PCM, methods for heat transfer enhancement and design configurations of heat storage facilities {{to be used as a}} part of solar passive and active space heating systems, greenhouses and solar cooking.|$|R
