5|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook {{discussed}} the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV {{is the most common}} cause of vertigo, a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the semicircular canals. Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This randomized, open-label trial {{compared}} dacomitinib (PF- 00299804), an irreversible inhibitor {{of human}} {{epidermal growth factor}} receptors (EGFR) /HER 1, HER 2, and HER 4, with erlotinib, a reversible EGFR inhibitor, in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2. 86 months <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> dacomitinib and 1. 91 months <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 66; 95 % CI, 0. 47 to 0. 91; two-sided P =. 012); in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3. 71 months <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> dacomitinib and 1. 91 months <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> erlotinib (HR = 0. 55; 95 % CI, 0. 35 to 0. 85; two-sided P =. 006); and in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2. 21 months <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> dacomitinib and 1. 84 months <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> erlotinib (HR = 0. 61; 95 % CI, 0. 37 to 0. 99; two-sided P =. 043). Median overall survival was 9. 53 months <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> dacomitinib and 7. 44 months <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> erlotinib (HR = 0. 80; 95 % CI, 0. 56 to 1. 13; two-sided P =. 205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. CONCLUSION: Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants...|$|R
