5|$|Tomb Raider is {{presented}} in third-person perspective. Players {{take control of the}} series lead character Lara Croft. The game uses an interconnected <b>hub-and-spoke</b> model that combines action-adventure, exploration, and survival mechanics. Players can traverse between the camps and across the island using footpaths, improvised or already-available ziplines and climbable tracks. Many of the players moves are carried over from the previous games created by Crystal Dynamics, with some tweaks added, such as incorporating elements of stealth gameplay. Quick Time Events are scattered at regular intervals throughout the game, often appearing at crucial or fast-moving points in the game's plot, such as extracting a shard of metal, and escaping a collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional <b>hub-and-spoke</b> model.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a network planning problem called the hub network design problem with stopovers and feeders. Most, if not all, {{of the recent}} logistics research on <b>hub-and-spokes</b> networks has assumed that all nodes in the network are connected by direct flights to the hub. However, in the network used by the Federal Express Co., most flights {{to and from the}} hub make one or more stopovers, and many smaller cities are served by feeder aircraft which connect to other nonhub cities. This paper explores the tradeoffs and savings involved with stopovers and feeders, and develops a mixed-integer program to design the least-cost single-hub air network assuming that the hub location is already determined. The model is then applied to the western U. S. portion of the Federal Express package collection system. Comparing the optimal results to the pure <b>hub-and-spokes</b> network proves that substantial improvements in cost, miles flown, load factor and number of aircraft can be achieved by using stopovers and feeders in a hub network, and that it is unrealistic to assume a network with only direct flights. Comparison with the actual Federal Express network shows many similarities (which suggest that the model is capturing the important design criteria), and several differences (which indicate the model's potential for improving efficiency). The usefulness of the model for a company's comprehensive network planning and for hub location modeling is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Many of {{air cargo}} {{companies}} adapt the <b>hub-and-spokes</b> system where {{economies of scale}} exist in the transportation cost. In this paper, we formulate economies of scale using nonlinear cost function of distances and demands, and analyze how the change of the transportation cost affects single hub location of air cargo using the generalized Weber problem on the regular demand points of one and two-dimensional region and the actual location of airport in East Asia. The optimal location will move to the largest demand points as the economies of scale in distances become larger or the economies of scale in demands become smaller. We confirm economies of scale in both distances and demands from the parameters estimated by the actual transportation cost in East Asia and find the optimal hub location of air cargo...|$|R

40|$|Comparing {{air service}} growth in Amsterdam and Brussels, this paper aims to {{understand}} how the strategies of airlines and public authorities allow certain medium-sized cities to succeed in exceeding their local market by connecting passengers, while others do not. In contrast to Brussels, Amsterdam {{has become one of the}} most air serviced European cities, reaching a highly disproportionate level of service given both its size and its airport catchment area. Amsterdam has reached its rank thanks to a successful, global <b>hub-and-spokes</b> strategy led by KLM and its partners. Such a success story would have been impossible without support from the State pursuing the expansion of numerous, liberal bilateral air service agreements and a regional development strategy which facilitated the expansion of Amsterdam Schiphol airport in the 1990 s.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} topological {{evolution}} of surface transportation networks, using empirical evidence and a simulation model validated on that data. Evolution is an iterative process of interaction, investment, and disinvestment. The temporal change of topological attributes {{for the network}} is also evaluated using measures of connectivity, density, heterogeneity, and connection patterns. The simulation model is validated using historical data from the Indiana interurban network. Statistical analyses suggest that the simulation model performs well in predicting the sequence of link abandonment in the interurban network {{as well as the}} temporal change of topological attributes. The simulation model is then applied on different idealized network structures. Typical connection patterns such as rings, webs, <b>hub-and-spokes,</b> and cul-de-sac emerge in the networks; the spontaneous organization of network hierarchies, the temporal change of spacing between parallel links, and the rise-and-fall of places in terms of their relative importance are also observed, providing evidence for the claim that network topology is an emergent property of network dynamics.

40|$|This chapter {{will provide}} an {{overview}} of Australian perspectives on the US alliance in light of ongoing and emerging challenges in the Asia-Pacific region. After a brief discussion of the motivations behind the signing of the ANZUS treaty, {{the first part of the}} chapter examines the historical context of the alliance, with a particular focus on the longstanding and ongoing tussle in Australia between independence in foreign policy making vis-à-vis broader structural constraints. While this debate has been a constant feature of the political scene in Australia, it has come into particular focus since the US withdrawal from Vietnam, which marked a turning point in Australian perspectives with regard to its own role in Asia. The collision of ideas surrounding Australian identity and Australian national interest has been reflected in policy approaches as successive governments have sought to strike a balance between the two exigencies and thus, most optimally ensure Australia’s strategic future. The chapter concludes by examining current perspectives through the lens of an ongoing debate taking place in Australian academic circles about what the rise of China means for Australia and its commitment to the US alliance, and considers options for caucus-style cooperation with fellow US allies beyond the <b>hub-and-spokes</b> model...|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} of resources, particularly VMs, in current public IaaS clouds is usually {{done in a}} blind fashion, as cloud users do not have much information about resource consumption by co-tenant third-party tasks. In particular, communication patterns can play a significant part in cloud application performance and responsiveness, specially {{in the case of}} novel latencysensitive applications, increasingly common in today’s clouds. Thus, herein we propose an end-to-end approach to the VM allocation problem using policies based uniquely on round-trip time measurements between VMs. Those become part of a userlevel ‘Recommender Service’ that receives VM allocation requests with certain network-related demands and matches them to a suitable subset of VMs available to the user within the cloud. We propose and implement end-to-end algorithms for VM selection that cover desirable profiles of communications between VMs in distributed applications in a cloud setting, such as profiles with prevailing pair-wise, <b>hub-and-spokes,</b> or clustered communication patterns between constituent VMs. We quantify the expected benefits from deploying our Recommender Service by comparing our informed VM allocation approaches to conventional, random allocation methods, based on real measurements of latencies between Amazon EC 2 instances. We also show that our approach is completely independent from cloud architecture details, is adaptable to different types of applications and workloads, and is lightweight and transparent to cloud providers.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of overlapping free trade agreements (FTA) {{in recent years}} has led to pair-wise <b>hub-and-spokes</b> (HAS) throughout the world. Being avid subscribers to FTAs, many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including the United States, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Australia, have become trade hubs to their partners who are in turn relegated to spoke status. In this paper, we question whether being a hub is welfare optimal for a small and open economy such as Singapore compared to membership in a single bilateral FTA or a multi-member free trade zone. Within this context, we use a computable general equilibrium model to examine the welfare implications of the triangular trade relationship of the United States, Singapore and Japan. This is facilitated by the Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement, the USA-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, and a hypothetical USA-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. The analysis is extended to incorporate 'super-hub' effects, that is, the spoke countries could be trade hubs in other HAS systems. Our experiment reveals that hub status generates positive welfare gain and is the highest Singapore can get from the trade configurations considered. Meanwhile, Japan loses more than the USA when both are relegated to spoke status. These findings prove to be robust under different market structures and production technologies, deeper economic integration, 'super-hub' effects, as well as uncertainty in the key model parameters and the extent of trade liberalisation shocks.

40|$|How do {{networks}} {{form and}} what is their ultimate topology? Most of the literature that addresses these questions assumes complete information: agents know in advance the value of linking to other agents, even with agents they have never met and with whom they have had no previous interaction (direct or indirect). This paper addresses the same questions under what seems to us to be the much more natural assumption of incomplete information: agents do not know in advance [...] but must learn [...] the value of linking to agents they have never met. We show that the assumption of incomplete information has profound implications for the process of network formation and the topology of networks that ultimately form. Under complete information, the networks that form and are stable typically have a star, wheel or core-periphery form, with high-value agents in the core. Under incomplete information, the presence of positive externalities (the value of indirect links) implies that a much wider collection of network topologies can emerge and be stable. Moreover, even when the topologies that emerge are the same, the locations of agents can be very different. For instance, when information is incomplete, {{it is possible for}} a <b>hub-and-spokes</b> network with a low-value agent in the center to form and endure permanently: an agent can achieve a central position purely as the result of chance rather than as the result of merit. Perhaps even more strikingly: when information is incomplete, a connected network could form and persist even if, when information were complete, no links would ever form, so that the final form would be a totally disconnected network. All of this can occur even in settings where agents eventually learn everything so that information, although initially incomplete, eventually becomes complete...|$|R
40|$|Increasing pollution, {{congestion}} {{of roads}} and {{worries about the}} spatial and environmental impacts of road transports have promoted the idea of transferring part of freight transportation from roads to railways and waterways. Given the limited density of these two modes' networks, this policy implies necessarily the development of inter-modal transports. But their operation {{on a large scale}} is meeting several problems : the additional cost of transferring the commodities from one mode or means to another, the size of investments in new technology equipment for terminals, specialized rolling stock and information systems, the involvement of several intermediaries plus the control and management of safety and reliability of the services. In the past, many innovative plans and projects for bundling and transshipping were developed, but many plans were abandoned, and despite a steady growth of inter-modal transports, the results obtained are still limited. At the present time, the most promising projects seem to be the introduction of new shuttle connections on transport links with important flows of transports. However, lower costs and better management of services could probably make attractive the organization of more complex schemes like <b>hub-and-spokes</b> organizations. The paper presents a methodology to model bundling concepts on multi-modal freight networks. It is based on the extensive use of virtual links as they are implemented in the NODUS software developed by GTM. Different configurations of inter-modal networks are modeled which are implemented in a digitized trans-European multi-modal network (rail, road and waterway). Cost functions are associated with every (virtual) link which corresponds to a particular transport operation. A matrix of origins and destinations throughout the European space is generated on the basis of global EUROSTAT statistics by the use of a weighted stochastic procedure. Given this transportation task a minimization of generalized costs can be made which assigns transport flows between paths, modes and means of transport. Hence, successive simulations for different configurations and various parameters' values provide a set of measures of their impacts, which can be used for assessing the interest of concrete inter-modal propositions. The indicators are the market shares, the total operating cost of the transportation task, the total cost of a particular operation, the distances covered, the times of transport, the service frequency required, the energy consumption, etc. This research is part of the EU Commission's TERMINET project which focuses on the potentialities of innovative bundling concepts for transport nodes and terminals. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{are various}} names and {{descriptions}} for rural knowledge centers, but their main role is facilitate {{the access to}} managed or direct information services for rural families. India {{is home to a}} very large number of pilot projects in this sector over the last about ten years. The number of internet-connected rural knowledge centers varies but is believed to be close to 10000 as of mid- 2006. The recent decision of the Government of India to establish about 1, 00, 000 Common Service Centers has generated altogether new possibilities and opportunities to design and make available a wide range of information services for the rural poor in India. Earlier studies indicated that the access to government information, and information on education were the two priority information demands. A number of projects include provision of governance-related information as a key service. Education mostly relating to IT literacy is offered on many projects although systematic efforts to measure the importance and impact of such information are not yet available. One of the significant challenges that India faces is the recurrence of disasters that lead to large scale disruption of economic and development activities and causes considerable distress among the victims. Over a period of time, relief measures have become affordable in many situations but the cumulative losses are staggering. The Disaster Management Authority of India has identified drought and earthquakes as among the phenomena that can cause deep and lasting distress among the victims while generating massive economic losses to the system as a whole. There is a need to identify new systems that combine early warning arrangements with access for appropriate support services. Over the last two years, ICRISAT has made an effort in partnership with CRIDA to study the possible use of rural knowledge centers in enhancing drought preparedness at the micro-regional level among the rural families. The pilot is premised on the assumption that a country such as India has reasonable arrangements for early warning communication in a top-down manner. International experience shows that such top-down flow of important information must combine with a bottom-up process for its rapid and effective use by the intended recipients, namely the rural families. The rural knowledge centers, operating in an interactive <b>hub-and-spokes</b> model for local value-addition and dissemination and capture, could provide the right interfaces to generate such blended communication...|$|R
