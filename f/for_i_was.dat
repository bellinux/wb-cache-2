25|$|ASL makes {{heavy use}} of time-sequenced {{ordering}}, meaning that events are signed {{in the order}} in which they occur. For example, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> late to class last night because my boss handed me a huge stack of work after lunch yesterday, one would sign 'yesterday lunch finish, boss give-me work big-stack, night class late-me'. In stories, however, ordering is malleable, since one can choose to sequence the events either in {{the order in which}} they occurred or in the order in which one found out about them.|$|E

The proposition not A is not A will doubtless be recognized by every one as certain, and it is scarcely to be expected that any one will ask for its proof. If, however, such a proof were possible, it must in our system be deduced from the proposition A=A. But such a proof is impossible." ...|$|E

The Vikings wanted a four-year deal, but Munnerlyn signed a three-year deal so he could receive his third contract before turning 30. Munnerlyn stated, [...] "I had other visits set up but the number that Minnesota offered me was the number I was looking <b>for.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like, 'Man, instead of leaving this offer out there I'm {{just going to take}} this.

500|$|Extraordinary {{events had}} {{recently}} transpired in England, with King Charles I executed, {{power in the}} hands of a commoner, and freedom of the pulpit given to Puritans. The commoner in power was a personal friend of Wheelwright, the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, with whom Wheelwright had gone to college. Henry Vane, who had been very close to Wheelwright during the events of the Antinomian Controversy, had also reached high positions in government. These two prominent men had been working side by side for political and religious liberty, but became estranged and hostile towards each other in the early 1650s. Vane had retired from public life while Cromwell moved into the highest position of authority in England. Wheelwright was well received by Cromwell, who once described his classmate this way: [...] "I remember the time when I was more afraid of meeting Wheelwright at football than I have been since of meeting an army in the field, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> infallibly sure of being tripped up by him". Wheelwright wrote a letter to his church in Hampton, dated 20 April 1658, in which he described his meeting with Cromwell, writing, [...] "I had discourse in private about the space of an hour. All his speeches seemed to me very orthodox and gracious".|$|E

The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood <b>for.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left.

In it, Kelly admits to crimes but claims he was forced into becoming a criminal because of police persecution of himself and his family. He also gives his version of the killing of three police officers at Stringybark Creek in Victoria in October 1878, arguing that he shot the men in self-defence: [...] "... this cannot be called wilful murder <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> compelled to shoot them, or lie down and let them shoot me".|$|E
