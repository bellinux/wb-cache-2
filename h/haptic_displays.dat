The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{possibility}} of multimodal bivariate thematic maps by utilizing auditory and <b>haptic</b> <b>displays.</b> With four different modes of display, the completion time of tasks and the recall (retention) rate were measured in two separate experiments.

For the recall rate, multimodal displays have higher recall rates, with users performing the best on Auditory-Haptic displays.

40|$|To {{meet the}} demands of complex VR {{applications}} state-of-the-art systems generate visual representations of virtual environments combined with acoustical feedback. But in some application areas, for example medicine or virtual prototyping, "seeing" and "hearing" is not sufficient. Thus, additional human perceptual channels have to be stimulated: the haptic senses. Consequently, the Fraunhofer IGD develops concepts on the integration of <b>haptic</b> <b>displays</b> into virtual environments. <b>Haptic</b> <b>displays</b> are devices which areable to feedback reaction forces and tactile stimuli as well as temperature and motion to the user. The additional feedback improves both the impression of reality and the capability to orientate oneself in virtual worlds. Furthermore, the development of two devices, a force feedback and a temperature feedback device, are described. Some of the projects with industrial partners strongly require the integraton of <b>haptic</b> <b>displays.</b> To satisfy these requirements a general approach to integrate <b>haptic</b> <b>displays</b> into our VR system "Virtual Design" will be described in the following chapters.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{ubiquity of}} <b>haptic</b> <b>displays</b> (e. g., smart phones and tablets) necessitates {{a better understanding}} of the perceptual capabilities of the human haptic system. <b>Haptic</b> <b>displays</b> will soon be capable of locally deforming to create simple 3 D shapes. This study investigated the sensitivity of our haptic system to a fundamental component of shapes: edges. A novel set of eight high quality shape stimuli with test edges that varied in sharpness were fabricated in a 3 D printer. In a two alternative, forced choice task, blindfolded participants were presented with two of these shapes side by side (one the reference, the other selected randomly from the remaining set of seven) and after actively exploring the test edge of each shape with the tip of their index finger, reported which shape had the sharper edge. We used a model selection approach to fit optimal psychometric functions to performance data, and from these obtained just noticeable differences and Weber fractions. In Experiment 1, participants performed the task with four different references. With sharpness defined as the angle at which one surface meets the horizontal plane, the four JNDs closely followed Weber’s Law, giving a Weber fraction of 0. 11. Comparisons to previously reported Weber fractions from other haptic manipulations (e. g. amplitude of vibration) suggests we are sufficiently sensitive to changes in edge sharpness for this to be of potential utility in the design of future <b>haptic</b> <b>displays.</b> In Experiment 2, two groups of participants performed the task with a single reference but different exploration strategies; one was limited to a single touch, the other unconstrained and free to explor...|$|E

Introduction A <b>haptic</b> <b>display</b> (or force reflecting interface) is a device which lets the user touch, feel and manipulate virtual environments, rather than just seeing them. As an example, the <b>haptic</b> <b>display</b> of a linear spring must enforce a specific relationship between force and position.

Many such devices have been developed in recent years, including {{but not limited to}} [1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19]. One promising area f [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} Gestalt was {{proposed}} {{in the nineteenth century}} to explain and predict the way that people perceptually group visual elements, and it has been used to develop guidelines for designing visual computer interfaces. In this thesis we seek to extend the use of Gestalt principles to the design of haptic and visual-haptic displays. The thesis begins with a survey of Gestalt research into visual, auditory and haptic perception. From this survey the five most commonly found principles are identified as figure-ground, continuation, closure, similarity and proximity. This thesis examines the proposition that these five principles {{can be applied to the}} design of haptic interfaces. Four experiments investigate whether Gestalt principles of figure-ground, continuation, closure, similarity and proximity are applicable in the same way when people group elements either through their visual (by colour) or haptic (by texture) sense. The results indicate significant correspondence between visual and haptic grouping. A set of haptic design guidelines for <b>haptic</b> <b>displays</b> are developed from the experiments. This allows us to use the Gestalt principles to organise a Gestalt-Taxonomy of specific guidelines for designing <b>haptic</b> <b>displays.</b> The Gestalt-Taxonomy has been used to develop new haptic design guidelines for information displays...|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} growing demand of the {{development}} of Distributed Virtual Environment (DVE), stability of <b>haptic</b> <b>displays</b> in DVE is now an interesting and challenging research problem. In the case of network-based haptic display the criteria for stability are far more complicated and requires the force and kinematic data to be transferred over the communication links. In this thesis, Dead Reckoning Algorithm in haptic simulation is introduced to guarantee stability for any kind of time delays or loss of information over network. Haptic dead-reckoning allows a comparatively simpler, local environment model to serve the haptic rendering while being periodically updated by a more complex and accurate model. Two force calculation models [...] "Complex" and "Simple" are simulated with an order reduction technique in a two user DVE with haptic devices. Force outputs for different types of interaction from both the force calculation models along with the errors between them are investigated. Stability and discrete-time passivity of <b>haptic</b> <b>displays</b> are guaranteed for any kind of delays without sacrificing the total loop gain.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>haptic</b> <b>display</b> for assessing neuro-mechanical pathologies such as hypertonia. An innovative step in our <b>haptic</b> <b>display</b> {{is to give}} clinicians the capacity to translate clinical parameters into a haptic sensation. This could also fulfill {{the need for a}} training system that can help clinicians to better understand the causality of the haptic sensation experienced during physical manipulation of a patient's limb afflicted by a particular impairment, for instance, to find specific probing motion(s) that are better at discriminating between different pathologies. While in current clinical practice the assessment of different aspects of hypertonia are expressed by the subjective judgment of the therapist [4], to our knowledge, there is no scientific literature that has systematically investigated a therapist's perceptual identification of the nature and severity of multi-joint hypertonic phenomena. Some studies have tried to categorize the sensitivity of therapists to non-biological stiffness [36],[37]; however, these studies have been based on identifying the sensitivity of tactile sensations produced by surfaces. Our <b>haptic</b> <b>display</b> allows us to systematically study these conditions.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to this experiment, we are currently using this <b>haptic</b> <b>display</b> to i) assess the capabilities of naïve subjects and expert therapists to correctly identify the nature and severity (see [20],[21]) of hypertonic impairments and to ii) assess how the perception of hypertonia {{is affected by the}} impedance introduced by the virtual connection between a patient and a clinician interacting remotely [35]. The <b>haptic</b> <b>display</b> allows to tackle several practical issues. For example, {{it can be used to}} investigate the effects of transmission delays on haptic perception of abnormal biomechanics or to derive specific probing motions that would enhance recognition of such disorders.|$|R
