This article clearly {{provides a}} right to be free of unlawful searches, but the Court has given the protection for [...] "private and family life" [...] that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. There have been cases discussing consensual familial sexual relationships, and how the criminalisation of this may violate this article.

This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article8 sometimes comprises positive obligations: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a State from interfering with rights, and thus not to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the State to become active, and to do something (e.g. to enforce access for a <b>divorced</b> <b>parent</b> to his/her child).|$|E

Findings indicated that there were three conditions of subjective well‐being of children from <b>divorced</b> <b>parents.</b> The first condition is the condition before the parent`s divorced, whereas the second and the third are the condition after the parent`s divorced. The first condition shows that children from <b>divorced</b> <b>parents</b> have low level of subjective well‐being before their <b>parents</b> <b>divorced.</b> It is mainly because of the parental conflict and the low level of family to spend time together which araised motional attachment. In the second condition, children from <b>divorced</b> <b>parents</b> still have low level of subjective well‐being that mainly because of the parental divorced, parental attitude that never told to their child about the divorced, and the decrease of parental attachment following the divorced.

50|$|In the United States, {{since the}} 1960s, {{there has been}} a marked {{increase}} in the number of children living with a single parent. The 1980 United States Census reported that 19.5% were single parent households. From 1980 to 2009, the percentage of single-parent households jumped to 29.5%.The jump was caused by an increase in births to unmarried women and by the increasing prevalence of divorces among couples. In 2010, 40.7% of births in the US were to unmarried women. In 2000, 11% of children were living with parents who had never been married, 15.6% of children lived with a <b>divorced</b> <b>parent,</b> and 1.2% lived with a parent who was widowed. The results of the 2010 United States Census showed that 27% of children live with one parent, consistent with the emerging trend noted in 2000.

Although adult children of <b>divorced</b> <b>parents</b> rated their parents relationships less positively than did those from intact families, {{there were no differences}} by parental history in their relationship fears.

First, we suggest that many suicide attempts by youths {{can be viewed as}} a strategic action on the part of the youth to resolve conflicts within oneself or with others. Youths have little direct economic or familial power, and in such a situation, self-injury can be used to signal distress or to encourage a response by others. Second, we present evidence for contagion effects. Youths who have a friend or family member who attempts or commits suicide are more likely to attempt or commit suicide themselves. Finally, we show that to the extent we can explain the rise in youth suicide over time, the most important explanatory variable is the increased share of youths living in homes with a <b>divorced</b> <b>parent.</b> The divorce rate is more important for suicides than either the share of children living with step-parents or the share of female-headed households. ...|$|E

To ascertain: (i) clinical and demographic characteristics; and (ii) possible associations between these characteristics and suicide attempt frequency in a selected patient group at Weskoppies Hospital over 4 months. Methods. Fifty adolescent outpatients aged between 13 and 17 years with a history of one or more suicide attempts were interviewed to obtain demographic and clinical features. Chi square and Fisher’s exact tests assessed associations between these features and suicide attempt frequency. Results. Of the subjects, 79 % were aged between 15 and 17 years; they were predominantly female (62 %) and Caucasian (83 %). Mainstream and special education schools were equally represented. Three-quarters had reached grades 8 - 10, and 14 % lived with both biological parents, 33 % in places of safety and 37 % with one <b>divorced</b> <b>parent.</b> The minority of caregivers had a history of alcohol abuse and other substance use. Twenty-nine per cent of the subjects had attempted suicide on more than 10 occasions and 23 % had made a single attempt. The most common methods were wounding (74 %), tablet overdose (34 %) and hanging (20 %). Psychiatric diagnoses included major depressive disorder (64 %), bipolar disorder (38 %), alcohol abuse (18 %) and other substance abuse (24 %). Familial features included depression, substance abuse, antisocial behaviour and suicide. Familial suicidal behaviour included suicide attempts by parents (85 %), siblings (36 %), aunts and uncles (31 %) and cousins (44 %). Physical and sexual abuse was reported in 52 % of families. Conclusion. Many findings and profiles of other studies were confirmed and point to school and home environments, family psychopathology and psychiatric diagnoses as factors associated with adolescent suicide attempts. Associations between the frequency of suicide attempts and the demographic and clinical characteristics were statistically inconclusive...|$|E
