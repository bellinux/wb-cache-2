5|$|The Everglades hosts 1,392 exotic {{plant species}} {{actively}} reproducing in the region, outnumbering the 1,301 species considered native to South Florida. The melaleuca tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia) takes water in greater amounts than other trees. Melaleucas grow taller and more densely in the Everglades than <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> Australia, making them unsuitable as nesting areas for birds with wide wingspans. They also choke out native vegetation. More than $2million {{has been spent}} on keeping them out of Everglades National Park.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} installments, certain {{characters who}} originally {{did not speak}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> language, now do.

Exceptions include Lee Chaolan, Lars, Xiaoyu, and Alisa, who still speak Japanese, as well as Lei and Lee's alter-ego Violet, who still speaks English due to their further character backgrounds despite their actual nationalities.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{spin-off}} video games have also been made for the Final Fantasy series. These spin-off games vary in their relation to the main series; the first, The Final Fantasy Legend games, were marketed as related in North America but {{were considered to be}} the first three games of the SaGa series <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> Japan, and later SaGa games released outside Japan bear no Final Fantasy branding. Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series.|$|E

5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E
5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
40|$|Purposeful species {{introductions}} offer {{opportunities to}} inform {{our understanding of}} both invasion success and conservation hurdles. We evaluated factors determining the energetic limitations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) <b>in</b> both <b>their</b> <b>native</b> and introduced ranges. Our focus was on brown trout because they are nearly globally distributed, {{considered one of the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s worst invaders, yet imperiled <b>in</b> much of <b>their</b> <b>native</b> habitat.

5|$|<b>In</b> both <b>their</b> <b>native</b> and {{introduced}} ranges, C.mutica are also synanthropic, being found abundantly in fouling communities in artificial structures like submerged ropes, fishing nets, pilings, docks, buoys, aquaculture equipment, oil rig platforms, ship hulls, and even offshore wind farms. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> introduced ranges (particularly in Europe), they are primarily and even exclusively found inhabiting artificial structures.|$|R

5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
5|$|In the Third Intermediate Period and the {{following}} Late Period (664–323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell {{to a series of}} outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to the kingship of Egypt. One such group, the Kushite pharaohs of the eighth and seventh centuriesBC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> land of Nubia, beginning a long tradition of sophisticated Nubian temple building. Amid this turmoil, the fortunes of various temples and clergies shifted and the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, but the power of the priesthood in general remained.|$|E
5|$|Like other caprellids, C. mutica are preyed upon {{predominantly}} by {{fish and}} crabs. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> habitats, the predators of Caprellamutica include the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) which consume them in large numbers. Other predators include nudibranchs, starfish, nemertean worms, sea anemones, and hydrozoans. They constitute a valuable food source for these organisms {{due to their}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. They also provide an important link in the food chain between plankton and larger fish. This, {{in addition to their}} relative abundance and fast growth rates, make them a potentially important resource for marine fish feed in aquaculture. Introduced populations of C.mutica have become {{a major part of the}} diets of native wild and farmed fish.|$|E

5|$|Nasib {{was born}} in Damascus in 1888 to father 'Ata al-Bakri. Nasib was the second oldest of five sons. 'Ata was an {{influential}} official {{in the city and}} district councils of Damascus between the 1890s and 1914, {{and was one of the}} most prominent Arabs to serve in the imperial Ottoman court of Sultan Abdul Hamid II in Constantinople. The al-Bakri family were Sunni Muslims and claimed descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad. They were landowners, possessing lands, homes and commercial venues <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> al-Shaghour quarter and in Qaboun, a village in the Ghouta countryside of Damascus. They also owned land in Jaramana, a Druze village outside of Damascus and maintained good relations with the local Druze chiefs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> form).|$|E
5|$|The Brabham {{team was}} founded by Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac, who met in 1951 while both were {{successfully}} building and racing cars <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>native</b> Australia.

There he started driving for the Cooper Car Company works team and by 1958 had progressed with them to Formula One, the highest category of open-wheel racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motor sport's world governing body. In 1959 and 1960, Brabham won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in Cooper's revolutionary mid-engined cars.|$|E
