5|$|Earwigs {{are mostly}} scavengers, {{but some are}} {{omnivorous}} or predatory. The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular. It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing the <b>forceps.</b> The <b>forceps</b> are used {{for a variety of}} purposes. In some species, the <b>forceps</b> have been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The <b>forceps</b> tend to be more curved in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|Abdomen: Cerci are unsegmented and {{resemble}} <b>forceps.</b> The ovipositor {{in females}} is reduced or absent.|$|E
5|$|After {{five to six}} instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's <b>forceps</b> {{will become}} curved, while the females' <b>forceps</b> remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be {{anything}} from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches can burrow {{into human}} ears, causing pain and hearing loss. They may be removed with <b>forceps,</b> {{possibly}} after first drowning with olive oil.|$|E
5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's {{prophylactic}} <b>forceps</b> approach found new life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of the babies born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with <b>forceps.</b> The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an episiotomy.|$|E
5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like <b>forceps,</b> {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. Needle receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the very}} few genera where the workers lay trophic eggs, or {{infertile}} eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying trophic eggs have only been reported in two species; these species are M. <b>forceps</b> and M. gulosa. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only cannibalise each other; this is most likely to happen when no dead insects are available.|$|E
5|$|The {{bills of}} bee-eaters are curved, long and {{end in a}} sharp point. The bill can bite strongly, {{particularly}} at the tip, and it {{is used as a}} pair of <b>forceps</b> with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, and when it is moving on the ground a bee-eater's gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation, the Magill <b>forceps,</b> the Magill laryngoscope blade, and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with <b>forceps</b> and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>forceps</b> or vacuum for delivery. These markers {{are more}} likely to be signals for other {{abnormalities}} as <b>forceps</b> or vacuum are not used in normal deliveries.|$|E
25|$|Obstetric <b>forceps</b> or ventouse {{may be used}} to {{facilitate}} childbirth.|$|E
25|$|Capsulorhexis – A needle {{or small}} pair of <b>forceps</b> {{is used to}} create a {{circular}} hole in the capsule in which the lens sits.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} bipolar option {{does not}} require the {{placement}} of a return electrode because the current only passes between tines of the <b>forceps</b> or other bipolar output device.|$|E
25|$|Foreign body {{vaginitis}} (most common {{foreign bodies}} are retained tampons or condoms) may cause extremely malodorous vaginal discharges. Treatment consists of removal, for which ring <b>forceps</b> may be useful. Further treatment {{is generally not}} necessary.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, further {{advances}} {{were made}} in the field of intratracheal anesthesia. Among these were those made by Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986). Working at the Queen's Hospital for Facial and Jaw Injuries in Sidcup with plastic surgeon Sir Harold Gillies (1882–1960) and anesthetist E. Stanley Rowbotham (1890–1979), Magill developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation. Magill devised a new type of angulated <b>forceps</b> (the Magill <b>forceps)</b> that are still used today to facilitate nasotracheal intubation {{in a manner that is}} little changed from Magill's original technique. Other devices invented by Magill include the Magill laryngoscope blade, as well as several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill.|$|E
25|$|His use of catgut for {{internal}} stitching is still practised in modern surgery. The catgut {{appears to be}} the only natural substance capable of dissolving and is acceptable by the body. Al-Zahrawi also invented the <b>forceps</b> for extracting a dead fetus, as illustrated in the Al-Tasrif.|$|E
25|$|Anaesthetists or anesthesiologists are {{medical doctors}} who specialise in pain relief {{and the use}} of drugs to {{facilitate}} surgery and other painful procedures. They may contribute to the care of a woman in labour by performing epidurals or by providing anaesthesia (often spinal anaesthesia) for Cesarean section or <b>forceps</b> delivery.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} {{diagnosis is}} {{the recovery of}} adult worms either by coughing them up or removing them with <b>forceps,</b> a bronchoscope, or endoscopic instruments. However, worms might be difficult to remove if firmly attached to the bronchial walls. Finding M. laryngeus eggs in the sputum or feces is another sure sign of infection.|$|E
25|$|Some doctors {{believe that}} during a {{caesarean}} section, mechanical cervical dilation {{with a finger}} or <b>forceps</b> will prevent the obstruction of blood and lochia drainage, and thereby benefit the mother by reducing risk of death. The available clinical evidence {{is not sufficient to}} draw a conclusion on the effect of this practice.|$|E
25|$|Hales also {{described}} a {{diverse range of}} work in Haemastaticks including his attempts to find substances {{that could be used}} to dissolve bladder stones or calculi. This aim was unsuccessful but as part of this work he developed a double lumen bladder catheter and devised special <b>forceps</b> to enable the removal of urinary stones.|$|E
25|$|In {{its most}} basic use, the {{endoscope}} is used to inspect the internal anatomy of the digestive tract. Often inspection alone is sufficient, but biopsy is a valuable adjunct to endoscopy. Small biopsies {{can be made with}} a pincer (biopsy <b>forceps)</b> which is passed through the scope and allows sampling of 1 to 3mm pieces of tissue under direct vision. The intestinal mucosa heals quickly from such biopsies.|$|E
25|$|After a {{complete}} examination, the colposcopist determines the areas {{with the highest}} degree of visible abnormality and may obtain biopsies from these areas using a long biopsy instrument, such as a punch <b>forceps,</b> SpiraBrush CX or SoftBiopsy. Most doctors and patients consider anesthesia unnecessary; however, some colposcopists now recommend and use a topical anesthetic such as lidocaine or a cervical block to decrease patient discomfort, particularly if many biopsy samples are taken.|$|E
25|$|Cassidy {{administered}} {{an overdose}} of ether, which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger's tongue {{out of his mouth}} with a pair of <b>forceps,</b> {{and at the same time}} forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} number of births taking place in non-{{clinical}} settings, avoidable clinical factors were not the only consideration. There was an emphasis on the need for health care workers to improve hygiene standards and ensure training in the use of <b>forceps,</b> and to ensure deliveries requiring other forms of intervention were undertaken in hospital. These local enquiries, along with various medical advances (notably the introduction of antibiotics) were credited with a sharp decline in maternal deaths in the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E
25|$|The Pap smear {{can be used}} as a {{screening}} test, but is false negative in up to 50% of cases of cervical cancer. Confirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or precancer requires a biopsy of the cervix. This is often done through colposcopy, a magnified visual inspection of the cervix aided by using a dilute acetic acid (e.g. vinegar) solution to highlight abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Medical devices used for biopsy of the cervix include punch <b>forceps,</b> SpiraBrush CX, SoftBiopsy, or Soft-ECC.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} is sometimes {{classified as a}} psychiatric disorder. However, {{it can also be}} caused by medical problems such as diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, genital mutilation, complications from genital surgery, pelvic trauma (such as from a straddle injury caused by falling on the bars of a climbing frame, bicycle or gymnastics beam), hormonal imbalances, total hysterectomy, spinal cord injury, cauda equina syndrome, uterine embolisation, childbirth trauma (vaginal tearing through the use of <b>forceps</b> or suction or a large or unclosed episiotomy), vulvodynia and cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Surgery was {{a common}} {{practice}} among physicians as treatment for physical injuries. The Egyptian physicians recognized three categories of injuries; treatable, contestable, and untreatable ailments. Treatable ailments the surgeons would quickly set to right. Contestable ailments were those where the victim could presumably survive without treatment, so patients assumed {{to be in this}} category were observed and if they survived then surgical attempts could be made to fix the problem with them. They used knives, hooks, drills, <b>forceps,</b> pincers, scales, spoons, saws and a vase with burning incense.|$|E
25|$|Small trout {{caught on}} a barb-less hook can be {{released}} simply by: grasping the eyelet of the fly, and rotating the eyelet toward the bend (the U-bend). This pulls the point backwards, back through the way it entered. Push the eyelet directly toward the bend until the point {{is removed from the}} fish. Large trout can be grasped gently and <b>forceps</b> can be used to grip the bend and push backwards, away from the direction the hook currently points. If necessary, squirming trout can be held on their backs. This often subdues the fish and provides enough time to remove the hook.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the primary}} food source of {{butterflyfishes}} are the coral polyps themselves or the appendages of polychaetes {{and other small}} invertebrate animals. Their mouths protrude like <b>forceps,</b> and are equipped with fine teeth {{that allow them to}} nip off such exposed body parts of their prey. Parrotfishes eat algae growing on reef surfaces, utilizing mouths like beaks well adapted to scrape off their food. Other fish, like snapper, are generalized feeders with more standard jaw and mouth structures that allow them to forage {{on a wide range of}} animal prey types, including small fishes and invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|In 1828, {{physician}} Philip Syng Physick modified {{an existing}} instrument originally designed by Benjamin Bell for removing the uvula; the instrument, {{known as the}} tonsil guillotine (and later as a tonsillotome), became the standard instrument for tonsil removal for over 80 years. By 1897, it became more common to perform complete rather than partial removal of the tonsil after American physician Ballenger noted that partial removal failed to completely alleviate symptoms in a majority of cases. His results using a technique involving removal of the tonsil with a scalpel and <b>forceps</b> were much better than partial removal; tonsillectomy using the guillotine eventually fell out of favor in America.|$|E
25|$|Skeptic James Randi {{spent about}} an hour in New York being interviewed and taped for the report. James Randi later critiqued ABC for having cherry picked his {{comments}} to show more credibility for the 'faith-healer' than justified. Randi went on to have given scientific explanations for all the activities observed. Randi revealed the natural explanations for activities ranging from putting <b>forceps</b> in the nose, random cutting of the flesh, 'scraping' of the eyeball, the subsequent absence of infection, and other activities one by one as age old parlor tricks. However, he was dismayed that none of his critical comments were shown in the final segment. This was cut down to under 20 seconds of screen time.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, the Baylor College of Medicine {{separated}} from Baylor University under his direction. The DeBakey High School for Health Professions, the Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center and the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston at the Texas Medical Center in Houston are named after him. He {{had a role}} in establishing the Michael E. DeBakey Heart Institute at the Hays Medical Center in Kansas. Several atraumatic vascular surgical clamps and <b>forceps</b> that he introduced also bear his name. DeBakey founded the Michael E. DeBakey Institute at Texas A College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences as a collaboration between Texas A, the Baylor College of Medicine and the UT Health Science Center at Houston to further cardiovascular research.|$|E
25|$|During {{pregnancy}} in the human, hormones such as relaxin remodel this ligamentous capsule {{allowing the}} pelvic bones {{to be more}} flexible for delivery. The gap of the symphysis pubis, normally is 4–5mm but during pregnancy {{there will be an}} increase of at least 2–3mm, therefore, it is considered that a total width of up to 9mm between the two bones is normal for a pregnant woman. The symphysis pubis separates to some degree during childbirth. In some women this separation can become a diastasis of the symphysis pubis. The diastasis could be the result of a rapid birth, or a <b>forceps</b> delivery, or may be a prenatal condition. A diastasis of the symphysis pubis is a cause of pelvic girdle pain (PGP). Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{hospital}} were operating rooms, kitchens, baths, a dispensary, latrines, a mortuary and herb gardens, as doctors {{relied heavily on}} herbs for drugs. The medici could treat any wound received in battle, {{as long as the}} patient was alive. They operated or otherwise treated with scalpels, hooks, levers, drills, probes, <b>forceps,</b> catheters and arrow-extractors on patients anesthetized with morphine (opium poppy extract) and scopolamine (henbane extract). Instruments were boiled before use. Wounds were washed in vinegar and stitched. Broken bones were placed in traction. There is, however, evidence of wider concerns. A vaginal speculum suggests gynecology was practiced, and an anal speculum implies knowledge that the size and condition of internal organs accessible through the orifices was an indication of health. They could extract eye cataracts with a special needle. Operating room amphitheaters indicate that medical education was ongoing. Many have proposed that the knowledge and practices of the medici were not exceeded until the 20th century CE.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, this optimistic {{prediction}} was not fulfilled; {{by the end}} of October, {{the development}} of sepsis made amputation appear inevitable. The French surgeon Auguste Nélaton, known for innovations in surgical tools, was asked to examine Garibaldi. An electrical probe designed by Favre had been used previously, without success, in an attempt to determine if the bullet remained. Nélaton used a normal surgical probe to examine the wound, concluding that Partridge had been mistaken and the bullet was indeed lodged in the joint; he recommended extraction using ball <b>forceps.</b> He later designed a special probe with a tip of unglazed porcelain, which could be introduced into the wound and retain an impression of any bullet present. Using this improved probe, the Italian surgeon Zanetti became convinced of the bullet's presence, and successfully extracted it on 23 November, saving Garibaldi's limb. The triumph of an innovative surgical instrument in this case was just one example of a trend over {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth towards the acceptance of surgery as a craft, with instruments as essential tools of that craft.|$|E
