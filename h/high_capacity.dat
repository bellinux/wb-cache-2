40|$|Contrary {{to most of}} {{the papers}} in the {{literature}} of investment under uncertainty we study models that not only capture the timing, but also the size of the investment. We consider a monopoly setting as well as a duopoly setting and compare the results with the standard models in which the firms do not have the capacity choice. Our main results are the following. First, for low uncertainty values the follower chooses a <b>higher</b> <b>capacity</b> than the leader and for high uncertainty values the leader chooses a <b>higher</b> <b>capacity.</b> Second, compared to the model without capacity choice, the monopolist and the follower invest later in a <b>higher</b> <b>capacity</b> for <b>higher</b> values of uncertainty. However, the leader will invest earlier in a <b>higher</b> <b>capacity</b> for <b>higher</b> values of uncertainty. The reverse results apply for lower values of uncertainty. ...|$|R
