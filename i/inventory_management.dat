5|$|Reviewers {{were less}} enthused about the game's user interface, {{and found that}} many {{gameplay}} details went unexplained. IGN's Jose Otero found the <b>inventory</b> <b>management</b> system, which lacks {{an easy way to}} sort items, to be problematic. Chris Carter from Destructoid noted that the game's intricacies are described in messages on the in-game phone, which he considered difficult to navigate and read, and that the messages were often insufficiently clear and detailed.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and <b>inventory</b> <b>management.</b> He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and <b>inventory</b> <b>management,</b> along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Quest II {{is noted}} for greatly {{expanding}} upon the gameplay {{of the previous}} game, Dragon Quest. The game {{is the first in}} the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an open-ended manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles. Compared with its predecessor, Dragon Warrior II offers a wider array of spells and items and a much larger world. The game also expanded the <b>inventory</b> <b>management</b> system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the <b>inventory</b> <b>management</b> of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E
