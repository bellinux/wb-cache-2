40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of reducing the consumption of electrical energy of the <b>impact</b> <b>screwdriver</b> during the assembly of fixed threaded joints. The recommendations related to a decrease in electrical energy consumption would allow reducing product costs but so far {{there have been no}} such recommendations from the producers of the tool as to the effective operating regimes of the <b>impact</b> <b>screwdrivers</b> in relation to electrical energy consumption and necessary tightening moment of the nut. The aim of the study is to find out the economical operating mode of the electrical <b>impact</b> <b>screwdriver</b> when assembling fixed threaded joints. By varying the set speed of the rotor head and working time of the impact mechanism, there is an opportunity to determine electrical energy consumption of the tool for the given tightening moment. The results of the experiment show that at the same tightening moment obtained the electrical energy consumption of the <b>impact</b> <b>screwdriver</b> is less at a higher starting set speed of the rotor head but shorter operating time of the impact mechanism than at a lower speed of the rotor head and longer operating time of the impact mechanism...|$|R

The objectives {{of this study}} were to measure the ground reaction force of the <b>hand</b> under simulated <b>impact</b> of the forearm and hand complex with different padding conditions of wrist guards and to analyze their impact force attenuation and maximum energy absorption for improved functional efficiency. A total of 15 subjects, wearing a commercial wrist guard, participated in a cable-released <b>hand</b> <b>impact</b> experiment to test four different conditions on the volar aspect of the hand, which include a wrist guard without a volar splint (bare hand), with a volar splint (normal use), with a volar splint and additional viscoelastic polymeric padding, and a volar splint and additional air cell padding. The ground reaction force and acceleration of the hand were measured using a force platform mounted on an anti-vibration table and a miniature accelerometer, respectively. Additional padding on the bare hand could substantially improve the maximum energy absorption by more than 39 %, with no differences with each other. However, only the air cell padding could simultaneously improve the impact force attenuation by 32 % compared with the bare <b>hand</b> <b>impact</b> without compromising the maximum energy absorption.

Part of these stakes are external to the sewerage utility operation, such as social impacts of sewer failures, or social impacts of works. These external impacts are to some extend considered in real life decisions, and should therefore also be taken into account in decision support systems. CARE-S project (2003 - 05 EU 5 th Framework Program), Computer Aided Rehabilitation of Sewer systems, has developed a decision support environment and software prototype, including data management procedures, a set of performance indicators, models describing the condition and evolution of sewers, models describing the risks and consequences of failures, a database describing rehabilitation technologies with their characteristics, an assessment of socio-economic criteria, a long term planning tool, multi-criteria decision tools. The objective is to help utility managers to rehabilitate the right pipe, at the right time, with the right technology. Criteria concern on one <b>hand</b> <b>impacts</b> during rehabilitation works, criteria used for the selection of the best technique for rehabilitating the concerned pipe in a multi-criteria decision making procedure, on the other <b>hand</b> <b>impacts</b> during a failure, criteria used for the selection of pipes candidates for rehabilitation.

30|$|The {{direction}} of the forces that acted across the carpal bones {{at the time of}} injury can be postulated based on the radiological findings. The injury resulted from the hyperextension forces, with the ligaments on the ulnar side giving way first, resulting in the VISI pattern. This contrasts with the more common mechanism of perilunate injury (Mayfield’s classification), where the forces cause disruption of the ligaments from the radial side, resulting in a dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI) pattern [10]. This reverse Mayfield pattern then resulted in the transcapitate and transscaphoid disruptions. This would happen with an axial load on a dorsiflexed hand, with the hypothenar part bearing the deceleration forces. After the ulnar aspect of the <b>hand</b> <b>impacts</b> the ground, there is forced dorsiflexion and intercarpal pronation, followed by the radial deviation. This causes lunotriquetral dissociation {{in the form of a}} lunotriquetral ligament tear or avulsion or triquetrum fracture. Next, the scaphoid comes into contact with the dorsal lip of the distal radial articular surface, resulting in a scaphoid fracture. Thus, ulnar stablizers of the lunate are lost, causing it to tilt volarly. This is a rare mechanism of injury. Not only are ulnar injuries to the carpal bones rare, but they are also poorly understood and diagnosed.|$|R

This study used the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) indicator framework {{to determine whether the}} ecosystem is now recovering. Indicator trends were analysed using various data sources that included government institutions and intergovernmental institutions. The results showed that the overall effect of Driver indicators was negative. This was mainly because of socio-economic pressure such as the need to create more jobs in light of rising national unemployment and the declining contribution of the fisheries sector to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In addition to scientific advice, socio-economic factors also influenced the determination of Total Allowable Catches (TACs). The overall trend of Pressure indicators was positively influenced by the effect of TACs. The TACs reduced the quotas allocated for commercial fishing.
