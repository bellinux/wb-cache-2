25|$|By now, Cöln, Strassburg and Ariadne had sailed from Wilhelmshaven to {{join the}} German defence, while Mainz was {{approaching}} from a different direction. Admiral Maass was still unaware {{of the nature of}} the attack, so <b>he</b> <b>spread</b> <b>his</b> ships in search of the enemy. Strassburg was first to find Arethusa and attacked with shells and torpedoes, but was driven off by torpedo attacks from the destroyers. As Tyrwhitt turned away to the west, Cöln—with Admiral Maass—approached from the south-east and was also chased away by torpedoes. Tyrwhitt signalled Beatty requesting reinforcements, and Goodenough with the four cruisers remaining with him came to assist. The force turned west.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, in a preface for {{the first}} {{exhibition}} of Spanish painter Francisco Riba Rovira (who painted a portrait of her), Stein wrote:I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what Cézanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: <b>he</b> <b>spread</b> <b>his</b> lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted {{at the same time}} on that Cézanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things.|$|E
500|$|Barúa also {{invited the}} {{travelling}} orator Fernando de Mompó y Zayas {{to be one}} of his advisors in 1730. [...] Mompó's origins are cloudy, but he was educated and quite possibly a lawyer. [...] He had acquired a reputation as a troublemaker in Lima. [...] Mompó was imprisoned there, possibly meeting Antequera in prison, but at some point either escaped or was exiled. [...] He eventually made his way to Paraguay, where <b>he</b> <b>spread</b> <b>his</b> ideas about government {{and the role of the}} people, which were considered radical at the time. [...] According to Mompó, the Paraguayans had been within their rights when they overthrew Reyes and defied García Ros; political authority rested on the assent of the común, the community. [...] The power of the people, Mompó said, was greater than even the King or the Pope.|$|E

500|$|At 2:27p.m., Reagan {{exited the}} hotel through [...] "President's Walk" [...] and its T Street NW exit toward his waiting {{limousine}} as Hinckley waited within {{the crowd of}} admirers. The Secret Service had extensively screened those attending the president's speech. In a [...] "colossal mistake", the agency allowed an unscreened group to stand within [...] of him, behind a rope line. Unexpectedly, Reagan passed {{right in front of}} Hinckley. Believing he would never get a better chance, Hinckley fired a Röhm RG-14 [...]22LR blue steel revolver six times in 1.7 seconds, missing the president with all six shots. The first bullet hit White House Press Secretary James Brady in the head and the second hit District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty {{in the back of his}} neck as he turned to protect Reagan. Hinckley now had a clear shot at the president, but the third bullet overshot him and hit the window of a building across the street. As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, the fourth bullet hit Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy in the abdomen as <b>he</b> <b>spread</b> <b>his</b> body over Reagan to make himself a target. The fifth bullet hit the bullet-resistant glass of the window on the open side door of the limousine. The sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less than an inch (25mm) from his heart. [...] Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.|$|E
2500|$|In 1253 Nichiren founded Nichiren Buddhism at Awa province's [...] and, in {{the summer}} of the same year, he came to Kamakura's Nagoe，made his hut, chanted the Daimoku, and wrote his Risshō Ankokuron. From here <b>he</b> <b>spread</b> <b>his</b> new {{religion}} until 1271.|$|E
2500|$|Championnet {{saw that}} he needed to {{evacuate}} Genoa in order to shorten his long front, but the French Directory refused to consider it. Consequently, the French commander could not collect enough troops to defeat Melas near Cuneo. The French government thoroughly plundered Italy yet neglected to feed, clothe or pay its soldiers stationed there. Championnet should have advanced into Piedmont in one powerful force instead of moving in four widely separated columns. At Genola <b>he</b> <b>spread</b> <b>his</b> army across a broad front, while Melas had his army concentrated under his immediate control. He unwisely chose to fight a pitched battle in the plains against an enemy that greatly outnumbered him in cavalry. Napoleon wrote of Championnet, [...] "He distinguished himself in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse, where his {{had been one of the}} principal divisions; there he had been imbued with the false principles of war with which Jourdan's plans were directed. He was brave, full of zeal, active, devoted to his country; he was a good general of division, an indifferent commander-in-chief." ...|$|E

2500|$|While in Italy, Pettoruti was {{influenced}} by the growing Futurist movement, as well as the fourteenth-century Italian Renaissance. [...] While his art reflected at different times futurist, cubist, and abstract qualities, Pettoruti [...] "rejected any categorization of his art." [...] He did not want himself or his artwork to be associated with any one specific movement, since he was constantly altering his style. [...] He worked on space and shape in his compositions, considering color secondary in his paintings. [...] Pettoruti also played around with several mediums. [...] <b>He</b> <b>spread</b> <b>his</b> artistic talent to theater costumes, set designs, and stained glass windows. [...] He became interested in mosaics, exploring the potential mosaics could have on the expansion of his ideas. [...] Not being limited to one medium, Pettoruti incorporated various materials found in garbage dumps into his mosaic to add texture and catch the light in diverse ways. [...] In his early years as an artist, he experimented with [...] "deconstructing ordinary, everyday objects, reconstructing them according to his own rules, and then projecting them into his own artistic universe." [...] This approach to art applied to all of his mediums, including mosaics and painting alike.|$|E

5000|$|... "Proud as a peacock" [...] is {{a saying}} {{that is used}} to mean a vain or self-centered person. The phrase comes from the plumage of the male peafowl (females are peahens). When a male is courting, <b>he</b> <b>spreads</b> <b>his</b> tail feathers, {{sometimes}} five feet in length, out in a fan pattern to attract a female. Thus, someone who is [...] "proud as a peacock" [...] is similarly [...] "strutting his stuff".|$|R
