5|$|American {{alligator}} predation on Florida panthers is rare, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented.</b> Such incidents usually {{involve a}} panther {{trying to cross}} a waterway or coming down to a swamp or river to get a drink. The American alligator is the only known natural predator of the panther. American alligator predation on black bears has also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much of what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> about women's sexuality has been written by men, {{in the context of}} male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E

The species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> only from Chelavur and Nilambur in the Kozhikode and Malappuram Districts of Kerala State. As of 2009, there are 22 Lepiota taxa (21 species and 1 variety) known from Kerala, which is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot.|$|E
5|$|Male {{care for}} infants <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in ruffed lemur societies. During early development, adult males may guard the nests of {{multiple}} core group females, {{as well as}} help care for the infants that were likely fathered by other males. During the season when females practice infant stashing, males effectively lighten the reproductive burden of up to several mothers by guarding, huddling, grooming, travelling, playing with and feeding the young.|$|E

A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers. Between 1894–96, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.|$|E

5|$|The 2004–08 {{volcanic}} activity of Mount St. Helens <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> {{as a continuous}} eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano.

5|$|The gene TGFBR2 {{has been}} implicated in several {{connective}} tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. A study of patients with SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene. Minor features of Marfan syndrome {{has been found in}} 20% of CSF leak patients. Abnormal findings of fibrillin-1 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in these CSF-leak patients, but only one patient demonstrated a fibrillin-1 defect consistent with Marfan syndrome.|$|E
5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of the Greenstead Parish {{boundary}} is Rovers Tye Farm, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> as being established by 1353. A new causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route. This road was turnpiked in 1725, when the road was predominantly rural in nature. In 1841, a prison, known as the House of Correction or County Gaol, was built on the road to alleviate pressure on Colchester Castle, but it only held about 25 or 30 prisoners, both male and female, at any one time.|$|E

50|$|Toxicity occurs due to terpenoid ledol {{found in}} all Labrador tea species. R. groenlandicum has the lowest {{toxicity}} due to lower levels of ledol. Grayanotoxins are also present, but few lethal human cases of poisoning due to grayanotoxins in Labrador tea <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented.</b> However, lethal poisonings <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in livestock.|$|R
50|$|The Maya {{script is}} {{generally}} considered to be the most fully developed Mesoamerican writing system mostly because of its extraordinary aesthetics and because it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> partially deciphered. In Mayan writing, logograms and syllable signs are combined. Around 700 different glyphs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented,</b> with some 75% <b>having</b> <b>been</b> deciphered.

5|$|Ephedrine: Ephedrine, {{known as}} ma huang in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine, originally as an extract of the herb Ephedra sinica, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in China since the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as an antiasthmatic and stimulant. The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China {{began in the}} 1920s, when the American pharmaceutical company Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. Ephedrine exports between China and the West grew from 4 tonnes to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928.|$|E
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented.</b>|$|E
5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates {{following}} interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> {{in a variety of}} other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|E

5|$|Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} that affect a dog's eyesight and can lead to blindness. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in a large number of different dog breeds including both the American and English Cocker Spaniels. The two types of Cockers are susceptible to a specific type of PRA called Progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), symptoms include night blindness leading to total blindness between the ages of three and five. PRCD is the most widespread hereditary retinal disease which may lead to blindness in dogs.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansive}} {{cultural history}} of the park <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> by the 1,000 archeological sites that have been discovered.

Yellowstone was designated an International Biosphere Reserve on October 26, 1976, and a UN World Heritage Site on September 8, 1978. The park {{was placed on the}} List of World Heritage in Danger from 1995 to 2003 due to the effects of tourism, infection of wildlife, and issues with invasive species. In 2010, Yellowstone National Park was honored with its own quarter under the America the Beautiful Quarters Program.|$|E
