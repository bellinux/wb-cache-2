40|$|When a {{dual phase}} metal is ground, which is {{composed}} of the soft matrix and the hard second phase, ground surface roughness {{is affected by the}} shape of the second phase. Ground surface roughness is characterized by autoregressive model and is analyzed by power spectrum. Comparing power spectrum of <b>globular</b> <b>pearlite</b> with that of lamellar perlite shows that lamellar pearlite gives higher power spectrum value. It indicates that ground surface roughness of <b>globular</b> <b>pearlite</b> is better than that of lamellar pearlite. As grain size of a wheel changes from # 60 to # 120, the ground surface roughness of lamellar pearlite is considerably improved. So the power spectrum is applicable for estimating ground surface roughness with more accuracy than the traditional method...|$|E

(2) The grinding forces and roughness of the ground surface show the maximum value in the <b>globular</b> <b>pearlite</b> structure and the minimum value in the lower bainite structure.

40|$|Abstract. Pearlite {{spheroidisation}} of 100 CrMn 6 steel was investigated. This {{process is}} well known and studied during conventional soft annealing. Presented paper describes cementite lamellae fragmentation during accelerated carbide spheroidisation. Mechanism of cementite lamellae fragmentation during conventional soft annealing depends on carbon and iron diffusion in ferrite-cementite system. On the other hand, accelerated carbide spheroidisation relies on partial pearlite austenitization and backward austenite decomposition. Aim of presented experiments was to examine shape evolution of cementite particles during transition from lamellar to <b>globular</b> form. <b>Pearlite</b> spheroidisation is normally quantified by image analysis of 2 D metallographic section. Conventional metallographic observation was used for globular-lamellar particle ratio estimation. However, whole lamellae observation is necessary for spheroidisation process revelation. Ferrite matrix deep etching and cementite separation was performed to study morphological aspects of acceolerated carbide spheroidisation...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of heavily drawn pearlitic wires can reach values exceeding 4 GPa. However, to obtain this effect a careful {{control of the}} drawing process and of the pearlite microstructure is necessary. In the latter case, microstructural investigations should provide information allowing for an optimal design of a failure-free production process. Yet, the number of methods for the characterization of pearlite, despite a large variety of its possible microstructure forms, is limited. This, in turn, causes problems for further improvements of the pearlite properties. It {{is the goal of}} this work to create a tool for extended characterization of the eutectoid. Before this tool is presented, an overview of the possible pearlite microstructures is given. It begins with a review of nucleation and growth models, followed by information about a broadly understood relation between applied heat treatment and its effect on the microstructure of the eutectoid. The subject of pearlite microstructures is then supplemented with information about other variants of the eutectoid, namely hypoeutectoid and globularized pearlite. Subsequently, the currently used methods for microstructure characterization are presented. The chapter closes with a survey of the reports on the link between pearlite microstructure and its performance. After having presented the microstructure-property relationships, the new tool for the description of the eutectoid microstructures is introduced. This begins with an account of the application of the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique for the determination of the link between the ferrite microtexture and the corresponding microstructure as depicted by scanning electron microscope micrographs. This was meant to serve as the base for the application of EBSD for determination of the mean pearlite colony size. The obtained results showed, however, that the pearlite boundary network is far more complex than the concept of pearlite colony. It also became clear that the crystallographic orientation of the ferrite matrix inside a pearlite colony is not constant. In most of the examined colonies orientation gradients were found, often including changes of the orientation of the misorientation axis. Those gradients were found in as-transformed, as well as in severely globularized pearlite. The picture of the eutectoid given by EBSD is further supplemented by examination of hypoeutectoid steels. Inspection of the continuity of the proeutectoid and the eutectoid ferrite showed that two variants can be found: continuous passage and separation by a high angle boundary. Subsequently, a new image analysis method for characterization of pearlite microstructures is presented. This begins with a new routine for the description of the soundness of fully lamellar pearlite. The performed experiments showed that this tool is capable of capturing the effect of carbon content and the austenite decomposition temperature upon the parameter in question. Further, morphologies other than lamellar are considered. For mixed, i. e. globular-lamellar pearlite, a new, automated procedure is proposed for separation of the two morphological components. Additionally a routine is presented for a comprehensive description of the globularized pearlite. Next, results of the experimental validation of the program are presented. This comprised of a microstructural investigation of globularized pearlite, tensile tests and hardness measurements. The performed analysis confirmed the close microstructure-property relationship and supported the application of the Hall-Petch relationship for mixed morphologies. The analysis also pointed out a direct link between the ultimate tensile strength and the hardness of the material.
