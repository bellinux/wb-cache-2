40|$|A {{generalization}} {{is given}} of the author's theory for plasticity phenomena. The theory includes {{the possibility of}} both stress and strain relaxation in the preplastic range. Methods of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are used. The plasticity phenomenon is explained by introducing a physical assumption concerning the phenomenological coefficients. A yield function is proposed which includes the Bauschinger effect and strain hardening. If the free energy f has the form f=f (1) +f (2), where f (1) {{is a function of}} the temperature and the elastic strains and f (2) {{is a function of the}} temperature and the inelastic strains, and if cross effects between the plastic flow and elastic relaxation phenomena may be neglected, the proposed yield function is such that the derivative with respect to time <b>of</b> the <b>deviator</b> <b>of</b> the plastic <b>strain</b> tensor is given by, where F is the yield function, taß is the mechanical stress tensor, and ¿ is a coefficient which vanishes in the preplastic range. If the equations of state may be linearized the proposed yield function reduces to a function which is analogous to a yield function proposed by Freudenthal. If the plastic flow phenomenon is not associated with changes in the microscopic structure of the medium the proposed yield function reduces to the Von Mises function. It follows from the theory that in a first approximation elastic relaxation phenomena in the preplastic range may be described by the equation for Poynting-Thomson media (standard linear solids). An equation which characterizes Schofield-Scott Blair media is also derived from the developed theory...|$|R

The global-in-time estimate of solution of initial boundary value problem is obtained. This estimate is valid for systems of equations of any non-Newtonian fluid. Solvability of initial boundary value problems for such equations is proved under some additional hypothesis. The application of this theory makes it possi-ble to prove the existence of global-in-time solutions of two-dimensional initial boundary value problems for generalized linear viscoelastic liquids, that is, for liquids with linear integral rheological equation, and for third-grade liquids. 1...|$|R

40|$|The r-value of a {{sheet metal}} {{is a measure}} of plastic {{anisotropy}} frequently used for prediction of performance in deep-drawing. It has also figured prominently in the literature for validation of theories where the predicted angular dependence of r is compared with the measured dependence. As plastic anisotropy in sheet metals is caused mainly by the preferred orientations of grains within the polycrystalline metal, it is natural to ask how r would depend on the orientation distribution function (ODF) w which defines the crystallographic texture of the polycrystal. In this paper a general formula relating r to w is derived for weakly-textured sheet metals whose plastic flow behavior is governed by a plastic potential f(oe#w), where oe denotes the <b>deviator</b> <b>of</b> the Cauchy stress.

This characterization identifies the Hencky (or true) strain tensor as the natural nonlinear extension of the linear (infinitesimal) strain tensor $\varepsilon=\mathrm{sym}\nabla u$, which is the symmetric part of the displacement gradient $\nabla u$, and reveals a close geometric relation between the classical quadratic isotropic energy potential \[\mu\,\|\mathrm{dev}_n\mathrm{sym}\nabla u\|^ 2 +\frac{\kappa}{ 2 }\,[\mathrm{tr}(\mathrm{sym}\nabla u) ]^ 2 =\mu\,\|\mathrm{dev}_n\varepsilon\|^ 2 +\frac{\kappa}{ 2 }\,[\mathrm{tr}(\varepsilon) ]^ 2 \]in linear elasticity and the geometrically nonlinear quadratic isotropic Hencky energy\[\mu\,\|\mathrm{dev}_n\log U\|^ 2 +\frac{\kappa}{ 2 }\,[\mathrm{tr}(\log U) ]^ 2 =\mu\,\omega_{\rm iso}^ 2 +\frac\kappa 2 \,\omega_{\rm vol}^ 2 \,,\]where $\mu$ is the shear modulus and $\kappa$ denotes the bulk modulus.

Strain insensitive fiber is used to deliver a light signal to a strain sensitive fiber in an optical phase locked loop sensor configuration. The use <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> insensitive delivery fiber allows for non-integrated measurements <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> {{without the use of}} expensive electronics such as those employed in ODTR techniques. The novelty of the present invention lies in the use <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> insensitive multimode fiber. The inventors had previously developed a similar sensor with strain insensitive fiber, however it was restricted to the use of single or few mode fibers. The use of an optical phase locked loop arrangement allows for the use <b>of</b> multimode <b>strain</b> insensitive fiber...|$|R
40|$|This article {{gives an}} {{overview}} {{on the application}} <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> gauge techniques to the analysis <b>of</b> the <b>strains</b> in composite materials. The orthotropic behaviour of the composite influences the performance <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> gauges that are calibrated for use on isotropic materials. The article considers therefore the typical topics <b>of</b> the <b>strain</b> gauge technology applied to composites with particular reference to the compensation of thermal output, the measurement of the coefficients of thermal expansion, the determination <b>of</b> the <b>strain</b> and stress state, {{the influence of the}} misalignment error, the reinforcement effect, the determination of the stress intensification factor, the analysis of residual stresses by the hole drilling method and the effect of transverse sensitivity on the measurement <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> along the fibres...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — As in Si CMOS, the {{incorporation}} <b>of</b> mechanical <b>strain</b> offers {{the possibility of}} improving the performance of III-V field effect transistors (FETs). Quantifying its potential and providing fundamental understanding of the impact <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> are the goals of this study. This paper reports {{an investigation of the}} impact <b>of</b> uniaxial <b>strain</b> on n-type InAlAs/InGaAs HEMTs with a 70 % InAs channel core. The main impact <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> is found to be a modification of the electron effective mass and mobility. A comparison between the effect <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> in Si and InGaAs suggests that strain engineering can indeed be leveraged to improve transport properties in deeply scaled InGaAs FETs.
