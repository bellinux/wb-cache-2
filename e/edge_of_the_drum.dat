5000|$|Frame {{drumming}} {{has been}} around since neolithic times developing across countries and regions into quite unique instruments with their own variants of drum, playing methods and rhythms. <b>The</b> Riddle <b>Drum</b> is quite distinct from other frame drums today and not musically interchangeable with them. Frame drum skins are thin and tight to create high harmonics when playing with the fingers, also frame drummers tend to play around <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> for a higher tone and a prime quality sought in a drum is lengthy resonance. Frame drumming is also quite a sophisticated form of drumming and can be difficult to learn, while Riddle Drumming is reasonably easy, so much more accessible as folk instruments than frame drums. Riddle Drum skins tend to be thicker and looser than those of frame drum giving them a bass tone, also they tend to be hit near <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> and <b>the</b> free hand pressed against the skin to reduce resonance. The reason the unique playing style developed is most likely because thin, tight skins would not survive the agricultural process and the other uses Riddle Sieves were put too, [...] "filling sacks with grain, holding wool, when carded and ready for the spinning wheel, or feathers plucked three time a year.". Surviving examples of Riddle Sieves from Scotland, France, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Nepal all show heavy wear and tear, skins stretched out of shape from carrying heavy weights, holes tearing into others holes and some with long tears across the skin sown up. So Riddle Drumming became quite distinct from other frame drumming. It also adopted a unique double ended stick held in a pencil grip (or sometimes a leather thong) with the player striking <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> in series <b>of</b> glancing blows (sometimes with both ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stick) rather than directly striking <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> with one end of a stick as done in most forms of stick drumming. Stick drumming may have emerged because the stretching and wear and tear on the sieves made them unplayable with the fingers.

50|$|The PPSh-41 fires the {{standard}} Soviet pistol and submachine gun cartridge, the 7.62×25mm (Tokarev). Weighing approximately 12 pounds (5.45 kg) with a loaded 71-round drum and 9.5 pounds (4.32 kg) with a loaded 35-round box magazine, the PPSh {{is capable of}} {{a rate of about}} 1000 rounds per minute, a very high rate of fire in comparison to most other military submachine guns of World War II. It is a durable, low-maintenance weapon made of low-cost, easily obtained components, primarily stamped sheet metal and wood. The final production PPShs have top ejection and an L type rear sight that can be adjusted for ranges of 100 and 200 meters. A crude compensator is built into the barrel jacket, intended to reduce muzzle climb during automatic fire. The compensator was moderately successful in this respect, but it greatly increased the muzzle flash and report of the weapon. The PPSh also has a hinged receiver to facilitate field-stripping and cleaning the weapon. A chrome-lined bore enables the PPSh to withstand both corrosive ammunition and long intervals between cleaning. No forward grip or forearm was provided, and the operator generally has to grasp the weapon behind the drum magazine with the supporting hand, or else hold the lower <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> magazine. Though 35-round curved box magazines were available from 1942, the average Soviet infantryman in World War II carried the PPSh with the original 71-round drum magazine.|$|E
50|$|The Udu is {{the most}} common and popular drum. This {{instrument}} is also known as Nkwa, Egwe, or Egede, depending {{on the part of the}} country.These drums are not talking drums. Although they produce a sound which is tonal, syncopated, and generally melodious - they have never been known as talking drums and are not spiritual in nature or usage. Igbo people speak. The body of the drum is usually constructed from a hollowed out pear or cotton tree which is very durable yet malleable. The drum is then covered with antelope or cow skin. The hide is fastened tightly to the top and bottom of the instrument with seven to eight studs, and with rope in a decorative manner. The studs are able to be adjusted for tuning purposes and sound accommodation. If the studs are tightened a high pitch is emitted. The opposite effect is heard if the studs are loosened. Typically, more than one Igba is played by several drummers at a time. The drum can be played by using four fingers from each hand. The right hand is used to beat the head of the drum, and the left hand is used to stop the vibration. If the musician stops the vibration closer to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> head,a low pitch will be emitted. If the musician stops the vibration closer to the center, then a higher pitch will be emitted. The Igba can also be played using a curved drum stick, which can be found wrapped in fiber to produce a soft sound,or “naked” to produce hard sound. This drum is very versatile and is usually played during celebrations, festivals, weddings, male and female rites of passage, and sometimes funerals.|$|E

5000|$|Subsequently, Springsteen {{focused more}} on <b>the</b> rock {{elements}} <b>of</b> his music. He initially compressed the sound and developed Darkness on <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> Town just as straightforward as concise musical idiom, for the simple riffs, rock guitar solos and clearly recognizable song structures are dominant. His music has been categorized as heartland rock, a style typified by Springsteen, John Fogerty, Tom Petty, Bob Seger, and John Mellencamp. This music has a lyrical reference to the U.S. everyday and the music is kept rather simple and straightforward. This development culminated with Springsteen's hit album Born in the U.S.A., <b>the</b> title song <b>of</b> which has a constantly repeating, fanfare-like keyboard riff and a pounding drum beat. These sounds fit with Springsteen's voice: it cries to the listener <b>the</b> unsentimental story <b>of</b> a disenchanted angry figure. Even songs that can be argued to be album tracks proved to be singles that enjoyed some chart success, such as [...] "My Hometown" [...] and [...] "I'm on Fire", in which <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> line is formed from subtle hi-hat and rim-clicks-shock (shock at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snare <b>drum)</b> accompanied by synthesizer and Springsteen's soft guitar line. The album, along with some previous records such as [...] "Cadillac Ranch" [...] showed clear rockabilly influences as is evident from his guitar solos, in-fills and vocal styles on these.

5000|$|Waiting for the Sun {{contains}} two songs with military themes: [...] "Five to One" [...] and [...] "The Unknown Soldier". In his 1980 Morrison biography No One Here Gets Out Alive, Jerry Hopkins speculates the song {{seems to be}} a parody <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> naive revolutionary rhetoric heard on the streets spouted by the [...] "hippie/flower child" [...] hordes he saw in growing numbers panhandling outside concert halls, an interpretation strongly supported by the final verse's lines [...] "Your ballroom days are over, baby" [...] and [...] "Trade in your flowers for a handful <b>of</b> dimes." [...] <b>The</b> former line ("Your ballroom days are over baby/Night is drawing near/Shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening/crawl across the years") may have been lifted by Morrison from the 19th-century hymnal and bedtime rhyme [...] "Now the Day is Over" [...] ("Now the day is over/Night is drawing nigh/Shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening/Steal across the sky"). [...] "The Unknown Soldier" [...] is less obtuse but no less compelling and is a good example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group's cinematic approach to their music. In the beginning, as well as after <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, <b>the</b> mysterious sounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organ is heard, depicting <b>the</b> mystery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Unknown Soldier". In <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, the Doors produce <b>the</b> sounds <b>of</b> {{what appears to be a}} marching cadence.

The song ends with Morrison's ecstatic celebration of a war being over, with sounds of crowds cheering and bells tolling. Ironically, as pointed out in the 2010 film When You're Strange, at <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> Morrison's success, his father, an Admiral, was commanding a division of aircraft carriers off <b>the</b> coast <b>of</b> Vietnam. <b>The</b> song was Morrison's reaction to the Vietnam War and the way that conflict was portrayed in American media at the time, with lines such as [...] "Breakfast where the news is read/ Television children fed/ Unborn living, living dead/ Bullets strike the helmet's head" [...] reflecting how news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war was being presented in <b>the</b> living rooms <b>of</b> ordinary people. <b>The</b> band also shot a film for the song, which was released as a single and became the group's fourth consecutive Top 40 hit.The centerpiece of this album was supposed to be the lengthy theatrical piece [...] "Celebration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lizard", but in the end only the [...] "Not to Touch the Earth" [...] section was used. (In a 1969 interview with Jerry Hopkins for Rolling Stone, Morrison said <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epic, [...] "It was pieced together on different occasions out of already existing elements rather than having any generative core from which it grew. I still think there's hope for it.") At <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> [...] "Not to Touch the Earth," [...] Morrison utters his iconic personal maxim, [...] "I am the Lizard King/I can do anything." [...] <b>The</b> opening lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, [...] "Not to touch the earth/not to see the sun" [...] were taken from <b>the</b> table <b>of</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Golden Bough. Krieger's skills with the flamenco guitar can be found on [...] "Spanish Caravan", with Granainas intro and a reworking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> melody from the classical piece Asturias (Leyenda) composed by Isaac Albéniz. The optimistic [...] "We Could Be So Good Together" [...] had been recorded during the sessions for Strange Days, even appearing on an early track listing for the album. A review in Slant Magazine described the song as [...] "categorically pre-fame Morrison," [...] pointing out that the line [...] "The time you wait subtracts from joy" [...] is <b>the</b> kind <b>of</b> hippie idealism <b>the</b> singer had long given up on. [...] "Wintertime Love" [...] (the closest the band ever came to a Christmas song) and the mournful [...] "Summer's Almost Gone" [...] address seasonal themes, while the gentle [...] "Yes, the River Knows" [...] was written by Robby Krieger. In the liner notes to the 1997 Doors retrospective Box Set, Manzarek praises the latter: [...] "The piano and guitar interplay is absolutely beautiful. I don't think Robby and I ever played so sensitively together. It was the closest we ever came to be being Bill Evans and Jim Hall." [...] In the same essay, Mazarek calls [...] "Summer's Almost Gone" [...] "a cool Latino-Bolero kind of thing with a Bach-like bridge. It's about <b>the</b> ephemeral nature <b>of</b> life. A season of joy and light and laughter is coming to an end." [...] While recording [...] "My Wild Love," [...] the band eventually gave up on the music and turned it into work song by getting everyone in the studio to clap their hands, stamp their feet, and chant in unison. Morrison wrote [...] "Love Street" [...] for his girlfriend Pamela Courson, and like all of his other songs about or dedicated to her, there was a hesitancy or biting refusal at the end ("I guess I like it fine, so far").

Much like the pegs in a music box cylinder activate the notes, in a <b>drum</b> sequencer, as <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequencer spins, the pegs run across switches activating machine processes. <b>The</b> placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pegs along <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder determine which switch along <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> it will activate. Where the peg lies along <b>the</b> circular circumference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> determines {{at what point}} in <b>the</b> spin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> <b>the</b> peg will activate the switch. By controlling the timing and sequence <b>of</b> switches, <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> performs repetitive switching operations.|$|R
