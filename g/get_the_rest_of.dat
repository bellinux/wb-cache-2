25|$|In 2009, Stone {{completed}} a feature-length documentary, South of the Border about {{the rise of}} progressive, leftist governments in Latin America, featuring seven presidents: Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Bolivia's Evo Morales, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, Cuba's Raúl Castro, the Kirchners of Argentina, Brazil's Lula da Silva, and Paraguay's Fernando Lugo (all of whom hold negative views of US manipulations in South America). Stone hoped the film would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Western world to rethink socialist policies in South America, particularly as it was being applied by Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Chávez joined Stone for the premiere of the documentary at the Venice International Film Festival in September 2009. Stone defended his decision not to interview Chávez's opponents, stating that oppositional statements and TV clips were scattered through the documentary and that the documentary {{was an attempt to}} right a balance of heavily negative coverage. He praised Chávez as a leader of a movement for social transformation in Latin America (the Bolivarian Revolution), along with the six other Presidents in the film. The documentary was also released in several cities in the United States and Europe in the mid-2010.|$|E

500|$|During Corzine's {{campaign}} for the United States Senate, he made some controversial off-color statements. [...] When introduced to {{a man with an}} Italian name who said he was in the construction business, Corzine quipped: “Oh, you make cement shoes!" [...] according to Emanuel Alfano, chairman of the Italian-American One Voice Committee. Alfano reported that when introduced to a lawyer named David Stein, Corzine said: [...] "He's not Italian, is he? Oh, I guess he's your Jewish lawyer who is here to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> you out of jail." [...] Corzine denied mentioning religion, but did not deny the quip about Italians, stating that some of his own ancestors were probably Italian, or maybe French.|$|E

500|$|To explain each form, Russell {{provides}} illustrations. The {{power of}} mere force {{is like the}} tying of a rope around a pig's belly and lifting {{it up to a}} ship while ignoring its cries. The power of inducements is likened to two things: either conditioning, as exemplified by circus animals which have been trained to perform this-or-that trick for an audience, or group acquiescence, as when the leader among sheep is dragged along by chains to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the flock to follow. Finally, the power of propaganda is akin to the use of carrot and stick to influence the behaviour of a donkey, {{in the sense that the}} donkey is being persuaded that making certain actions (following the carrot, avoiding the stick) would be more or less to their benefit. (Russell 1938:24) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{best known}} case of post-uprising {{departure}} involved {{a group of}} Jewish Combat Organization fighters {{under the leadership of}} Icchak Cukierman and Marek Edelman, who had taken part in both the Ghetto and the Warsaw Uprisings. Originally, the former Ghetto fighters stayed together in a large group, but in the second week of October, some of them moved to a different location. Those remaining stayed in the same place on Promyka Street until mid-November, when they were contacted by Ala Margolis, a courier from the Home Army, who had previously managed to leave the city. Margolis and a [...] "rescue squadron" [...] of five people returned to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the group out. The Germans had begun a systematic search and destruction of ruined houses near the hiding place, which meant time was running out. Dressed as nurses and doctors, with clothes and Red Cross IDs provided by Dr. Lesław Węgrzynowski, director of the Home Army sanitation unit, the rescue squadron and the seven in hiding made {{their way out of the}} city through two German checkpoints. The group consisted of five men and two women: Edelman, Cukierman, Cywia Lubetkin (later, Cukierman's wife), Tosia Goliborska, Julek Fiszgrund, Tuwia Borzykowski, and Zygmunt Warman. The first checkpoint was crossed during dinner, and the Germans did not bother to examine the group, but at the second, an SS officer noticed that Warman, who was lying in a stretcher, was wearing combat boots. He yelled, [...] "These are Polish bandits!", but one of the escorts dressed as a nurse quickly declared that the patients in the stretcher were ill with typhus. The SS soldiers backed off, and the group moved on its way.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years of}} {{kindergarten}} were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade {{with other students}} their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive {{schools around the country}} put new educational ideas into action. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become much more interested in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: [...] "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the town interested in the problem." [...] The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, [...] "The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 9 January 1917, Cornwallis was hit on her {{starboard}} side by a torpedo from German submarine , commanded by Kurt Hartwig, {{in the eastern}} Mediterranean, [...] east of Malta. Some of her stokeholds flooded, causing her to list about ten degrees to starboard, but counterflooding corrected the list. About 75 minutes after the first torpedo hit, another did, also on the {{starboard side}}, and Cornwallis rolled quickly to starboard. Fifteen men {{were killed in the}} torpedo explosions, but she stayed afloat long enough to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the crew off.

2500|$|Rich {{received}} a 75% {{share in the}} Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre from his father, Christopher Rich, upon his death in 1714. [...] At that time, the theatre was, by no means, ready for use, as it was still under construction. By that point, Rich had already begun acting in plays and taking {{a hand in the}} theatrical management. [...] His father had set the reputation and direction of the Lincoln's Inn Theatre during the War of the Theatres in the 1690s, and John Rich continued it. [...] In particular, John Rich exaggerated the theatricality of the Restoration spectacular by creating a new form of hireling drama designed strictly to generate opulent stagecraft. [...] After becoming majority owner of Lincoln's Inn Fields, his control grew as he sought to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the shares. It was the success of Beggar's Opera that allowed him, in the end, to open the new theatre at Covent Garden. John Rich also opened a Beefsteak Club along with his scenic artist, George Lambert.|$|E
