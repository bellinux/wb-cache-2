5000|$|In humans, {{heavy metal}} {{poisoning}} is generally {{treated by the}} administration of chelating agents.These are chemical compounds, such as [...] (calcium disodium <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate)</b> that convert heavy metals to chemically inert forms that can be excreted without further interaction with the body. Chelates are not without side effects and can also remove beneficial metals from the body. Vitamin and mineral supplements are sometimes co-administered for this reason.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than photoprotection. Melanin is able to effectively ligate metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, in many cases much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting {{the rest of the}} cell. This hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} loss of neuromelanin observed in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Gram-negative bacteria, such as E.coli are {{a subject}} to outer cell lysis by osmotic shock {{and the action}} of enzyme {{lysozyme}} and <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> (EDTA), the chelating agent, with subsequent release of periplasmic gap content and spheroplasts containing inner cell content into the sucrose medium. Lysozyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan layer, while EDTA destroys the outer membrane facilitating enzyme's access to the inner layers of the cell wall. The periplasmic enzymes released during the rapture of E.coli outer cell wall include: an alkaline phosphatase, a cyclic phosphodiesterase, an acid phosphatase, and a 5’-nucleotidase. Sucrose-tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-HCl medium {{is essential to the}} preservation of the integrity of the enzymes upon lysis. EDTA aids cell hydrolysis by binds to divalent ions, such as Ca2+, and removing them from the wall thus softening the wall for further lysozyme action.|$|E
5000|$|Gadolinium salts are {{of primary}} {{interest}} for relaxation agents in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI). This technique exploits the fact that Gd3+ has an electronic configuration of f7. Seven is {{the largest number of}} unpaired electron spins possible for an atom, so Gd3+ is a key component in the design of highly paramagnetic complexes.To generate the relaxation agents, Gd3+ sources such as GdCl3∙6H2O are converted to coordination complexes. GdCl3∙6H2O can not be used as an MRI contrasting agent due to its low solubility in water at the body's near neutral pH. [...] "Free" [...] gadolinium(III), e.g. GdCl2(H2O)6+, is toxic, so chelating agents are essential for biomedical applications. Simple monodentate or even bidentate ligands will not suffice because they do not remain bound to Gd3+ in solution. Ligands with higher coordination numbers therefore are required. The obvious candidate is EDTA4−, <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate,</b> which is a commonly employed hexadentate ligand used to complex to transition metals. In lanthanides, however, exhibit coordination numbers greater than six, so still larger aminocarboxylates are employed.|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> to competent cultures of Bacillus subtilis irreversibly inhibited the transformability {{as well as}} the cellular binding of DNA. Our results show that the inhibition of DNA binding by <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> in whole cells, protoplasts, and membrane vesicles is mainly due to a permanent alteration of the DNA receptors. Transformation absolutely requires free magnesium ions, whereas DNA binding is a magnesium-independent step. In contrast to <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate,</b> the absence of Mg 2 + does not irreversibly affect the capacity of the competent cells to be transformed DNA-binding receptors located at the cell surface remain associated with the plasma membrane after protoplasting and after isolation of membrane vesicles. A Mg 2 +-dependent endonucleolytic activity associated with the membrane appears to be responsible for the lower levels of binding by protoplasts in the presence of this ion...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} a comparative {{study on the}} effects of the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate and the chelating agent <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> on purified rotavirus SA- 11 particles. Both chemicals readily inactivated rotavirus at quite low concentrations and under very mild conditions. In addition, both agents modified the viral capsid and prevented the adsorption of inactivated virions to cells. Capsid damage by <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> caused a shift in the densities of rotavirions from about 1. 35 to about 1. 37 g/ml and a reduction in their sedimentation coefficients. Sodium dodecyl sulfate, on the other hand, did not detectably alter either of these physical properties of rotavirions. Both agents caused some alteration of the isoelectric points of the virions. Finally, analysis of rotavirus proteins showed that <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> caused the loss of two protein peaks from the electrophoretic pattern of virions but sodium dodecyl sulfate caused the loss of only one of these same protein peaks...|$|E
40|$|A permeaseless mutant of Escherichia coli, which {{produces}} β-galactosidase constitutively, was treated briefly with <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> {{and then with}} the phospholipases of Bacillus cereus. Cell lysis occurred, as indicated by an increase in β-galactosidase activity and a decrease in absorbancy of the cell suspension. The susceptibility of the cells to attack by <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> and the phospholipases was markedly affected by the age of the cells when harvested. The results suggest that permeability changes may be associated with the activity of a phospholipase that specifically degrades phosphatidyl ethanolamine. A sonic-treatment method for determining the total β-galactosidase content of E. coli cells, which is independent of their age when harvested, is described...|$|E

40|$|The basipetal {{transport}} of the auxin, indoleacetic acid, in sunflower stem sections is markedly suppressed by washing the tissue in <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate,</b> and transport is restored by subsequent application of calcium solutions.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells grown in Mg 2 +-deficient medium acquire nonmutational resistance to the chelator <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> and to the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B; this type of resistance can be reversed by transferring the cells to Mg 2 +-sufficient medium for a few generations. Stable mutants resistant to polymyxin B were isolated and shown to have also gained <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> resistance. Both the mutants and strains grown on Mg 2 +-deficient medium had greatly enhanced levels of outer membrane protein H 1 {{when compared with the}} wild-type strain or with revertants grown in Mg 2 +-sufficient medium. It was determined that in all strains and at all medium Mg 2 + concentrations, the cell envelope Mg 2 + concentration varied inversely with the amount of protein H 1. In addition, the increase in protein H 1 in the mutants was associated with an increase in resistance to another group of cationic antibiotics, the aminoglycosides, e. g., gentamicin. We propose that protein H 1 acts by replacing Mg 2 + at a site on the lipopolysaccharide which can otherwise be attacked by the cationic antibiotics or <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Asbell, Mary A. (University of Georgia, Athens), and R. G. Eagon. Role of {{multivalent}} cations in the organization, structure, {{and assembly}} of the cell wall of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 380 – 387. 1966. —Incubation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> induced the formation of osmotically fragile rods termed osmoplasts. These could be restored to osmotically stable forms by multivalent cations. Only those cells restored by divalent cations normally found in the cell wall were capable of multiplication. The respiration of restored cells, however, was unimpaired, irrespective of whether they were capable of multiplication. Moreover, the permeability characteristics of osmoplasts and restored cells were unimpaired. When multivalent cations were chelated from the cell wall and replaced by sodium, a weakened cell wall and an osmotically fragile cell resulted. This was apparently caused {{by the absence of}} cross-linkages in the cell wall via multivalent cations. Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane buffer compounded the lethal effects of <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate.</b> The lipopolysaccharide component was inferred to be the site of attack by <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate.</b> A mechanism for the synthesis of the lipopolysaccharide sacculus was proposed whereby negatively charged subunits are “trapped” by forming ionic and coordinate bonds intermediated by multivalent cations...|$|E
