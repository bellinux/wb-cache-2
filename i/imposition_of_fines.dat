The preliminary injunction applied to all of Germany and included a fine of €250,000 per ride for non-compliance. If the injunction was breached, Uber's German-based employees could be jailed {{for up to six}} months, in addition to an <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> upon the company.

500|$|Punishment {{for minor}} crimes {{involved}} either <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>fines,</b> beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, {{depending on the}} severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles {{played a major role in}} the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.|$|E
2500|$|William Cobbett (1763–1835) was an English journalist, farmer, social {{commentator}} and reformer, and a prolific author {{of books on}} gardening, household economy, religion, and other topics, including a popular grammar. His self-published Cobbett's Political Register (scornfully nicknamed [...] "two-penny trash" [...] by the political opposition, as it was affordable by labourers of modest means) {{was the most popular}} political journal of the day. Cobbett's sympathy for the working classes, disadvantaged by an economy undergoing wrenching upheavals, endeared him to them and greatly influenced popular opinion, as his unrelenting criticism of corruption and waste in the political establishment provoked government persecution, leading to <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>fines,</b> imprisonment, and self-imposed exile in the United States.|$|E

40|$|A key policy {{objective}} of sustainable economic development, especially in any developing country like Nigeria, {{is to establish}} energy development paths that are both economically efficient and sustainable. However, this depends significantly on full utilization of such resources. Distributed Lag (DL) model, dummy variable regression model and co-integration analyses were used in this paper to evaluate the impact and sustainability of Gas utilization in the Nigerian economy. The structure of gas flaring in Nigeria {{in relation to the}} <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> on flared gas was also examined. The regression results and the co-integration analysis show that utilization of Nigerian natural gas impacts positively on the economy given three-year time lag; it is also sustainable. On the other hand, although the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> on flared gas has the potential to end or reduce flares; it has not significantly led to any structural change (sliding slope) on the level of flares since its imposition in 1984. Hence there is need for government to always employ Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) to evaluate its policy implementations...|$|R

40|$|Genesis 34 is {{notorious for}} its {{report of the}} cruel {{massacre}} of the males among the Hivites by Simeon and Levi in revenge for the rape of their sister, Dinah, by Schehem the Hivites.

In this paper l shall consider several possible alternatives and try to find the most desirable one. Possible choices are as follows: 1.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} of the institutions involved with interventions in irrigation sector development along with the process of intervention in Asia in general and Nepal in particular. The context of irrigation management is then described, and the social and institutional factors affecting performance of farmer and agency-managed irrigation systems are examined. Based on an analysis of 231 farmer-and-agency managed irrigation systems in Nepal, the important result of the study is that farmer-managed irrigation systems with stronger institutional bases such as effective <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>fine,</b> social sanctions and employment of local monitors created a conducive environment for rule-following and mutual trust among the users, and yielded higher irrigation performance. The policy implication of the study is that social and institutional support are important aspects of irrigation management; and thus, improving irrigation management suggests a socio-technical approach emphasizing variations in both physical structure and human dimensions of user activities which can produce productive, equitable, cost-effective and ecologically sound irrigation performance...|$|R

40|$|We {{model the}} dynamic effects of {{external}} enforcement on {{the exploitation of}} a common pool resource.

Low fines stabilize cooperation by preventing a spiral of negative reciprocation. ...|$|R

25|$|Marital rape is not a {{criminal}} offence within Indian legal framework, except during the period of judicial separation of the partners. The marital rape exception has restricted application when the wife has been living separately from the husband, under or without a decree of judicial separation. In such cases, again the husband can be prosecuted but, if convicted, the minimum punishment is imprisonment {{for two years and}} <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> (Section 376B, IPC). This clause was enacted in the year 1983, a watershed in the history of rape law reform in India, when major changes were brought in the law of rape {{for the first time since}} its enactment by the colonial state in 1860. The parliamentary committee that gave final shape to the 1983 amendments was reluctant to treat non-consensual sex between a separated couple as amounting to rape, on the ground that a rape charge might mar the chances of reconciliation between a separated couple and make divorce inevitable. Hence, the minimum sentence stipulated for this category of rape was set much lower than that in general.|$|R
40|$|Computer abuse (CA) by {{employees}} {{is a critical}} concern for managers. Misuse of an organization's information assets leads to costly damage to an organization's reputation, decreases in sales, and <b>impositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fines.</b> We use this opportunity to introduce and expand the theoretic framework proffered by Thong and Yap (1998) {{to better understand the}} factors that lead individuals to commit CA in organizations. The study uses a survey of 449 respondents from the banking, financial, and insurance industries. Our results indicate that individuals who adhere to a formalist ethical perspective are significantly less likely to engage in CA activities than those following a utilitarian ethical framework. In addition, the results provide evidence that employees with individualistic natures are linked to increased CA incidents, whereas collectivist tendencies are associated with decreases in CA behaviors. Our results also show that collectivism acts as a strong moderator that further decreases the relationships between formalism and CA, and utilitarianism and CA. Finally, we offer detailed suggestions on how organizations and researchers can leverage our findings to decrease CA occurrences. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
