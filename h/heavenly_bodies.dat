The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) {{controlled}} {{most of the}} opening of the match with aerial maneuvers against The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Bodies</b> (Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Pritchard). Del Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Bodies</b> gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which Del Ray followed with a moonsault. Del Ray and Morton fought back and forth, with Del Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more, Del Ray hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet. Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Bodies.</b>|$|E

5|$|Back in the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus {{speculated that}} the Universe lacked a center and a circumference. He {{believed}} that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained. These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology {{to the concept of}} an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called aether, which did not cause resistance to the motions of <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies.</b> English philosopher William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void. This concept of an aether originated with ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies</b> moved.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce {{the things that are}} in the universe – the <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies,</b> etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.|$|E
5|$|Later Greek philosophers, {{observing the}} motions of the <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies,</b> were {{concerned}} with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence. The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around a stationary Earth. Normal matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.|$|E

5|$|Newton's {{contribution}} to gravitational theory was {{to unify the}} motions of <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies,</b> which Aristotle had assumed were in a natural state of constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth.

5|$|Tekno Team 2000 {{made their}} WWF debut during a house show at Madison Square Garden on March 19, 1995. They {{defeated}} The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Bodies</b> (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) and repeated the result {{the following night}} at Boston Garden. Their WWF television debut {{took place on the}} May 27, 1995 episode of WWF Superstars; they defeated Barry Horowitz and the Brooklyn Brawler. They were booked to appear in a series of matches against The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Bodies.</b> Del Ray was not able to appear in several of the matches, so he was replaced by Mantaur and Barry Horowitz in several of the matches. Tekno Team 2000 won all of the matches in this series. The WWF teased a storyline in which Tekno Team 2000 was being scouted by Ted DiBiase to join the Million Dollar Corporation, but they did not join the group. Their success led Pro Wrestling Illustrated to rank them among the top ten tag teams in the world.|$|E
5|$|In the Christian world {{prior to}} Galileo's {{conflict}} with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the earth {{was the center of}} the universe and that all <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies</b> revolved around the Earth, or the Tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism. Nevertheless, following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.|$|E

The Rock 'n' Roll Express, who held the belts going into the event, had been feuding with The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Bodies</b> over the title for over a year. The rivalry had been violent at times, including a barbed wire cage match and a Texas deathmatch.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform {{to the principles of}} Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies</b> should circle the Earth, and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing. His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.|$|E
5|$|In Greece, copper {{was known}} by the name chalkos (χαλκός). It was an {{important}} resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as aes Cyprium, aes being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and Cyprium from Cyprus, where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to cuprum, hence the English copper. Aphrodite (Venus in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus was sacred to the goddess. The seven <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies</b> known to the ancients {{were associated with the}} seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.|$|E

Later, Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by the shapes of the five Platonic solids, nested within each other. Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra, and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and other worlds.|$|E
5|$|Watts {{has stated}} that the WWF {{intended}} to have Tekno Team 2000 win the WWF Tag Team Championship after two months in the promotion. After Watts' father, Bill Watts, began booking matches, the team was later sent to developmental territories to improve their skills. They returned to USWA in Tennessee, where they had wrestled a tag team match together in April 1995 under their real names. Competing as Tekno Team 2000, they defeated PG-13 on September 18. They began losing matches, however, while facing PG-13, The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Bodies,</b> and The Bushwhackers. On October 30, Troy and Travis reversed their fortunes and defeated King Cobra and Spellbinder.|$|E
5|$|Well Dunn {{continued}} {{to face the}} top teams in the WWF, including The Smoking Gunns, The Headshrinkers, and the newly formed team of Sparky Plugg and the 1-2-3 Kid. When The Smoking Gunns were unable to compete due {{to the birth of}} Billy Gunn's son, Well Dunn competed against The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Bodies</b> instead; these matches were unusual, as they pitted heel tag teams against each other. As in 1993, Well Dunn lost more matches than they won in each series, but they had occasional victories against established tag teams and were often booked to defeat jobber tag teams.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Body</b> is a 1944 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Alexander Hall and starring William Powell and Hedy Lamarr.

Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies</b> (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.|$|E
5|$|The Steiner Brothers {{were the}} {{audience}} favorites in the WWF Tag Team Championship match, {{as they were}} defending the belts in their hometown. Before the match began, The <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Bodies</b> attacked them. When the match began, the Bodies executed several double-team maneuvers on Rick Steiner. Scott tagged in and {{took control of the}} match. The Bodies soon regained the advantage, and Jim Cornette got involved by hitting Scott in the throat with a tennis racket. Rick tagged back in and hit several Steiner-Lines before Prichard attacked him with Cornette's tennis racket. Del Ray accidentally hit Prichard with a moonsault, however, allowing Scott to hit a Frankensteiner and Rick to get the pin.|$|E
5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|E
