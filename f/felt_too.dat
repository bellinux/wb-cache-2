5|$|On {{arrival at}} the Anhalter Station at Berlin, List <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> {{exhausted}} to continue the journey. After a doctor had diagnosed a lung inflammation his health deteriorated quickly, and he died in a Berlin guesthouse {{on the morning of}} 17 May 1919. He was cremated in Leipzig and his ashes laid in an urn and then buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery, Zentralfriedhof. An obituary of List authored by Berlin journalist Philipp Stauff then appeared in the Münchener Beobachter.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> old to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1746, Linnaeus was once again {{commissioned}} by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of Västergötland. He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August. On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book , published the next year. After returning from the journey the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province Scania. This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> busy.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} nominations, the jury also {{assigned}} two special prizes for games which it <b>felt</b> were <b>too</b> demanding to count as 'family style' games.|$|R
5|$|Nana is {{then asked}} to take Nunung out with her, {{in the hopes that}} the eldest sister will meet a marriageable young man. At a party, while Nana mingles with several men, Nunung sits out every dance and {{eventually}} leaves with Herman. Asked why she has returned home, Nunung tells her grandmother that she <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> old among the younger party-goers and asks why she was told to go. Nenny, again eavesdropping, shouts out that their grandmother is hoping to find her a husband. Though Nunung is initially angered, she understands her grandmother's good intentions.|$|E
5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the top-down perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot of trial and error. With a true top-down view, players would be unable to see characters' faces and bodies. To circumvent this issue, objects in the world were tilted at an angle so that they were more visible in the top-down view. Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the stereoscopic 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging and dropping them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E
5|$|The war to {{the south}} {{influenced}} British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000 defeated Loyalists had migrated from the new United States following independence. The 14,000 Loyalists {{who went to the}} Saint John and Saint Croix river valleys, then part of Nova Scotia, <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> far removed from the provincial government in Halifax, so London split off New Brunswick as a separate colony in 1784. The Constitutional Act of 1791 created the provinces of Upper Canada (mainly English-speaking) and Lower Canada (mainly French-speaking) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.|$|E
50|$|This {{legislation}} {{was introduced to}} provide {{an alternative to the}} USA PATRIOT Act that some <b>felt</b> was <b>too</b> overreaching in its effort to fight terrorism.|$|R
60|$|Peterkin used {{to speak}} very {{strongly}} when talking on this subject, and I observed, from the unusual seriousness of his manner, that he <b>felt</b> deeply <b>too.</b>|$|R

25|$|In many societies, {{such as the}} USSR, the {{distribution}} lead to anger, as it was <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> equal, unfair. In the current U.S., many feel that {{the distribution}} is unfair in being too unequal. In both cases, the cause is unfairness, not inequality, the researchers conclude.|$|E
25|$|The {{changes in}} the non-Olympic sports {{featured}} at the Asian Games were influenced by discussions with organizers, who had suggested the removal of cricket from the program because they <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> few countries played it and because they lacked the infrastructure to host it. However, the OCA disputed the proposed removal of cricket, citing its popularity and viewer interest.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{feared that}} {{continued}} {{involvement in the}} war was a mistake that was endangering Johnson's presidency, but he <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> intimidated by the imposing Johnson to share his true feelings. Strauss immediately regretted withholding his true opinion from Johnson. He resolved that if any president ever sought his advice again, Strauss would tell him the truth regardless of {{what he wanted to}} hear.|$|E
60|$|I {{am afraid}} it was hypocritical in me, but seeing that my aunt felt {{strongly}} on the subject, I {{tried to look}} as if I <b>felt</b> strongly <b>too.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Angel {{looked at}} the {{mechanism}} called Wilmerdings, and <b>felt</b> glad <b>too.</b> (The Angelic conception of duets {{is a kind of}} conversation upon violins.) But he said nothing.|$|R

25|$|The {{pressures}} and temptations {{of being a}} high-profile rock musician and requirements of the spiritual lifestyle which guru Sri Chinmoy and his followers demanded were in conflict, and imposed considerable stress upon Santana's lifestyle and marriage. He was becoming increasingly disillusioned with what he thought were the unreasonable rules that Chinmoy imposed on his life, and in particular with his refusal to allow Santana and Deborah to start a family. He <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> that his fame was being used to increase the guru's visibility. Santana and Deborah eventually ended their relationship with Chinmoy in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Virgin {{began to}} grow {{impatient}} with the album's recording as it went over budget and became behind schedule. The band, however, would not let the company cut corners if it meant compromising the sound. By the time recording was completed, Corgan and Vig <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> emotionally exhausted to mix the record. Corgan suggested that engineer Alan Moulder mix the album, due to his work on Loveless by My Bloody Valentine. Moulder booked two weeks in a studio to mix the album; the mix ended up taking 36 days to complete. Eventually, the album was finished after four months and $250,000 over budget.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{programme}} lasted four series, by {{the start}} of series 3, Cleese was growing tired of dealing with Chapman's alcoholism. He <b>felt,</b> <b>too,</b> that the show's scripts had declined in quality. For these reasons, he became restless and decided to move on. Though he stayed for the third series, he officially left the group before the fourth season. Despite this, he remained friendly with the group, and all six began writing Monty Python and the Holy Grail; Cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions, though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series. Cleese returned to the troupe to co-write and co-star in the Monty Python films Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Monty Python's Life of Brian and Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, and participated in various live performances over the years.|$|E

50|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1992 by Ron Rubright, Bruce Linsmeyer and Chuck Henson, and was meant to provide light {{entertainment}} to gay pride parades that they <b>felt</b> were <b>too</b> serious.|$|R
500|$|... "The series, especially, {{has shown}} that it’s willing to stretch some of these {{emotional}} or philosophical moments out, to really {{get the most out}} of the actors’ performances and give them scenes where they can expand their characters beyond what’s on the page. In a finale that could have <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> scattered—we drop in on every major character of the season who’s still alive—that sense that cooler heads would rather prevent greater war but were thwarted by hotter, younger heads was what united the story".|$|E
500|$|Dwipayana's {{influence}} {{ensured that}} contemporary reviews, especially synopses, repeated the government's {{position on the}} G30S coup. This {{is not to say}} all reviews were positive. Marselli of Kompas, for instance, found that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was highly detailed, with extensive work and quality acting going to represent events accurately. He felt, however, that the film <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> long and, as viewers knew instantly who the good and bad characters were, it became [...] "nothing but a black-and-white portrait without any complex issues", which ignored the underlying problems which had sparked the G30S movement.|$|E
500|$|Star Ocean: First Departure on the PlayStation Portable sold 115,280 {{copies in}} its debut week in Japan, with {{lifetime}} sales of approximately 204,996 copies in the region. It received a 31 out of 40 total score from Japanese magazine Weekly Famitsu, based on individual scores of 8, 7, 8, and 8, earning it the publication's Silver Award. While the editors thought the title's animation and characters were well {{done and the}} story was [...] "charming" [...] they lamented that players could only save their progress at certain points {{such as the world}} map, which they also <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> large and had a limited field of view.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was used}} instead of the only {{existing}} real images, from the TV monitor, which the editors seemingly <b>felt</b> were <b>too</b> grainy for their book. The book publishers did not work for NASA.|$|R
500|$|While the {{presentation}} was received positively, the gameplay received criticism from multiple reviews. [...] More specifically, the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were cited as weak. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker argued the cinematic portions were underpinned by the gameplay, believing that players would more likely {{want to finish}} the game for its storyline than the fun they'll have playing it. Game Revolution's AA White stated [...] "Clock Tower 3 is ultimately one of those games whose cinemas are {{more interesting than the}} actual gameplay and from a gamer's standpoint, that's never a good thing." [...] Critics also agreed that the game <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> short.|$|E
500|$|Evolves map-design {{received}} mixed reviews. Ingenito {{thought that}} Shear was a [...] "beautifully realized" [...] planet, while Marchiafava thought {{that all the}} maps were both detailed and varied. VanOrd thought that Turtle Rock had successfully captured an unsettling atmosphere, and applauded the verticality of the maps. Lathi agreed that the maps were well-designed. However, he criticized them for being [...] "homogeneous", as all the maps <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> similar to each other, and none offered a particularly unique experience that required players to change their tactics. He added {{that the lack of}} variety had significantly lowered Evolves replayability. Meikleham echoed a similar statement, adding that the maps are [...] "bland", and that they did not look different from each other.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot over 20days in September 2012. Filming {{took place in}} Los Angeles, and scenes set at the group home were shot at a former short-stay {{facility}} located near the neighborhood of Sylmar. The film was edited by Nat Sanders as it was filmed. Both the original cut of the film and the shortened director's cut were over 2hours long, whereas Cretton wanted the final cut to be under 100minutes. Sanders said that the original cut of the film <b>felt</b> <b>too</b> heavy and [...] "made you feel pretty depressed about humanity", so a number of scenes were deleted or trimmed to [...] "lighten up" [...] the film's mood, with a final running time of 96minutes.|$|E
