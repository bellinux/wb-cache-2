50|$|The {{dominant}} {{cause of}} soil displacement in frost heaving {{is the development}} of ice lenses. During frost heave, one or more soil-free ice lenses grow, and their growth displaces the soil above them. These lenses grow by the continual addition of water from a groundwater source that is lower in the soil and below the freezing line in the soil. The presence of <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soil</b> with a pore structure that allows capillary flow is essential to supplying water to the ice lenses as they form.|$|E
5000|$|Building on {{permafrost}} {{is difficult}} because {{the heat of the}} building (or pipeline) can thaw the permafrost and destabilize the structure. Three common solutions include: using foundations on wood piles; building on a thick gravel pad (usually 1-2 metres/3.3-6.6 feet thick); or using anhydrous ammonia heat pipes. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System uses heat pipes built into vertical supports to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the Qingzang railway in Tibet employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soil.</b> Permafrost may necessitate special enclosures for buried utilities, called [...] "utilidors".|$|E
50|$|Frost heaving {{requires}} a <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soil,</b> a continual {{supply of water}} below (a water table) and freezing temperatures, penetrating into the soil. Frost-susceptible soils are those with pore sizes between particles and particle surface area that promote capillary flow. Silty and loamy soil types, which contain fine particles, are examples of frost-susceptible soils. Many agencies classify materials as being frost susceptible if 10 percent or more constituent particles pass through a 0.075 mm (No. 200) sieve or 3 percent or more pass through a 0.02 mm (No. 635) sieve. Chamberlain reported other, more direct methods for measuring frost susceptibility. Based on such research, standard tests exist to determine the relative frost and thaw weakening susceptibility of soils used in pavement systems by comparing the heave rate and thawed bearing ratio with values in an established classification system for soils where frost-susceptibility is uncertain.|$|E

50|$|Certain <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soils</b> expand or heave upon {{freezing}} as {{a result}} of water migrating via capillary action to grow ice lenses near the freezing front. This same phenomenon occurs within pore spaces of rocks. The ice accumulations grow larger as they attract liquid water from the surrounding pores. The ice crystal growth weakens the rocks which, in time, break up. It is caused by the expansion of ice when water freezes, putting considerable stress on the walls of containment. This is actually a very common process in all humid, temperate areas where there is exposed rock, especially porous rocks like sandstone. Sand can often be found just under the faces of exposed sandstone where individual grains have been popped off, one by one. This process is often termed frost spalling. In fact, this is often the most important weathering process for exposed rock in many areas.|$|R
50|$|Frost weathering, frost wedging, {{ice wedging}} or cryofracturing is the {{collective}} name for several processes where ice is present. These processes include frost shattering, frost-wedging and freeze-thaw weathering. Severe frost shattering produces huge piles of rock fragments called scree {{which may be}} located {{at the foot of}} mountain areas or along slopes. Frost weathering is common in mountain areas where the temperature is around the freezing point of water. Certain <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soils</b> expand or heave upon freezing as a result of water migrating via capillary action to grow ice lenses near the freezing front. This same phenomenon occurs within pore spaces of rocks. The ice accumulations grow larger as they attract liquid water from the surrounding pores. The ice crystal growth weakens the rocks which, in time, break up. It is caused by the approximately 10% (9.87) expansion of ice when water freezes, which can place considerable stress on anything containing the water as it freezes.|$|R
40|$|The {{base layer}} of a multi-layered {{pavement}} structure {{is often a}} cement-bound material, which combines an aggregate with cement binder.

In geographic areas with low temperatures and significant ground water, the bearing capacity of pavement structures can be reduced by volume deformations from freezing and thawing. Cold winters and <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soil</b> are present in eastern Croatia and in the city of Osijek. Thus, in this paper we examine the frost susceptibility of cement-bound aggregates, made with materials commonly used in Croatia, in accordance with the current Croatian standard HRN U.

Morphometric analysis of 85 lobes subdivided into five different slope orientations indicates a morphogenetic underpinning in which lobe form remains consistent (length-to-width ratio below unity) at different scales and between aspects, however, morpho-biophysical correlations could not provide an explanation for this.

40|$|Frost heave is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in the Arctic, where soil expands {{in the direction of}} heat loss due to ice lens growth upon freezing. It also occurs if a refrigerated structure is buried in unfrozen frost heave-susceptible soil, and thus special considerations are required when designing chilled or LNG pipelines in the Arctic. In the past decades, many theoretical and numerical methods have been developed to predict the frost heave of freezing soil. Among them, the rigid ice model, segregation potential model, and porosity rate function model are the most popular. These frost heave models work well in predicting the soil response during a pure freezing process, but none of these methods consider a thawing and consolidation of soil, which is the opposite but integrated process when the system undergoes the annual temperature cycle. In this study, efforts are made to extend the porosity rate function to the thawing branch based on reasonable assumptions. With the extended model, a fluctuating surface temperature can be applied on top of the soil surface to simulate a continuous changing ambient temperature. The extended model is realized in ABAQUS with user defined subroutines. It is also validated with test data available in the public domain. As an application example, the extended model is utilized to simulate a chilled gas line buried in <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soil</b> to estimate its frost heave over a multi-year operation. ...|$|E
40|$|Frost heave of ice arenas {{has been}} a major problem in the Vancouver area owing to an {{environment}} with plentiful rainfall, freeze-thaw cycles for seven months of the year, and <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soils.</b> This paper presents the case history of a typical skating rink, which suffered excessive, irregulaf heaves in the range of 3 to 8 in. (7. 6 to 20. 3 cm) and resulted in shutdown of operations nine years after construction. The remedial measures involved removal of the frozen soil, replacement with free-draining granular backfill and construction of a thermal barrier at foundation level to prevent passage of frost from the ice-making system into the subsoil. The thermal barrier consists of Styrofoam insulating layers, and an active heating system involving circulation of warm brine through plastic pipes beneath the insu-lation. The brine is warmed by utilizing waste heat from the refrigeration plant, and thus is very eco-nomical in operating costs compared to conventional systems. This paper describes the analysis of the problem, design, and practical construction techniques used to reconstruct the rink with a frost-free sub-base, which allows for year-round operation of a level ice surface with a minimum of maintenance.

Maximum adfreeze stresses {{in the range of}} 150 to 350 kPa under varying rates of frost penetration were measured on steel structural angles embedded vertically in the soil. A limiting value of 350 kPa was attained at a freezing rate of 4 mm per day.

40|$|Frost {{susceptible}} {{soils are}} vulnerable to frost action in seasonal freezing and permafrost regions, such soils may experience large deformations upon temperature changes. Frost heave and soil strengthening occurs as the soils freeze, whereas settlement and thaw weakening is expected during the melting process. Consequently, significant damage to infrastructure in cold regions {{can be caused by}} freezing-thawing cycles. Accounting for soil behavior during freezing and thawing is essential for engineering design and minimizing frost-related damage. 	An elastic-plastic constitutive model for freezing and thawing soils is developed. The constitutive relationship is temperature-dependent, capable of capturing the deformation behavior and strength evolution of the soil subjected to arbitrary loading and thermal boundary conditions. The yielding of the frozen soil is based on hardening plasticity and a critical state framework, with the pore ice content and specific volume as two parameters responsible for hardening and softening of the soil. A modified porosity rate function is adopted to simulate formation of ice lenses in freezing <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soils.</b> The function is implemented into a finite element system with a thermal-hydro-mechanical framework used to capture the multi-physics processes of soil freezing and thawing. The system is calibrated using available frost heave laboratory test data. It {{can be used as a}} tool to solve complex boundary value problems related to engineering practice. Results of the simulations are encouraging, and they indicate a very realistic response of the model to changing thermal boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|Frost-susceptible {{soils are}} {{characterized}} by their sensitivity to freezing that is manifested in heaving of the ground surface. While significant contributions to explaining the nature of frost heave in soils were published in late 1920 s, modelling efforts did not start until decades later. Several models describing the heaving process have been developed in the past, {{but none of them}} has been generally accepted as a tool in engineering applications. The approach explored in this paper is based on the concept of the porosity rate function dependent on two primary material parameters: the maximum rate, and the temperature at which the maximum rate occurs. The porosity rate is indicative of ice growth, and this growth is also dependent on the temperature gradient and the stress state in the freezing soil. The advantage of this approach over earlier models stems from a formulation consistent with continuum mechanics that makes it possible to generalize the model to arbitrary three-dimensional processes, and use the standard numerical techniques in solving boundary value problems. The physical premise for the model is discussed first, and the development of the constitutive model is outlined. The model is implemented in a 2 -D finite element code, and the porosity rate function is calibrated and validated.

40|$|Frost heave and thaw {{weakening}} are {{two common}} concerns in designing and constructing roads throughout cold region areas. Cold regions {{can be defined}} in terms of air temperature and frost penetration by frozen ground engineering. Researchers have been studying frost action in soil for the past 85 years in order to design ways to reduce the costly damage to roads. Conducting the test on <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soil</b> must be done in order to retrieve data for frost heave and thaw weakening modeling in the soil body during a certain freezing-thawing cycle. This paper reviews and discusses the apparatuses used for this purposes. The studied apparatuses are cylindrical and provide heat through one dimension. The studied apparatuses mostly differ in the diameter and length of their cylindrical cell; likewise, temperature gradients differ from one apparatus toanother. In this study the LTU’s apparatus which was primarily designed to investigate the research related questions concerning freezing and thawing phenomena is presented in detail. The theory of segregation potential is applied for evaluation of the frost heave test and the thaw consolidation theory is applied for the thaw test. The main goal of the project is to conduct a series of experimental tests on various types of soil while exposing them to frost action in the apparatus to propose a classification system for the different types of soil in question with respect to their susceptibility to the frost action phenomena.

40|$|Interest in permafrost, or {{seasonally}} frozen ground, {{has been}} increasing over the last decades. Nearly 24 % of the northern hemisphere, is covered with permafrost. Humankind's need for energy and raw materials has pushed technology to operate on these frozen grounds. Construction and operation of infrastructures, such as roads, pipelines, and tunnels on these areas mean engineers {{have to deal with}} frozen soil. In addition, with climate change, permafrost warming and subsequent thawing can trigger or accelerate natural hazards, like rockfalls and debris flows. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in artificial ground freezing for stopping groundwater flow into the construction sites, for example in tunnels, and also for strengthening soil mass to improve stability. There are fundamental differences between frozen soil and unfrozen soil, such as frost heave, thaw settlement, cryogenic suction which yearn for a new body of knowledge in this area. Saturated frozen soil is a mixture of soil grain, ice and unfrozen water. Thermo-hydro-mechanical interaction between different phases of such a mixture is the cause of strengthening of the frozen soil and its volume expansion during freezing. Also, the behavior of frozen soil depends on temperature and confining pressure. A new constitutive model called Elastoplastic Frozen Soil Model, which is based on Modified Cam Clay Model, was developed at NTNU to represent the behavior of frozen soils. The model uses two-stress state concept and is able to represent fundamental and crucial behaviors of frozen soil, such as ice segregation phenomenon, thawing consolidation and thaw settlement, and strength weakening due to pressure. This model has been validated before and here in this thesis, boundary value problems were run to show the validity and capability of the model to correctly represent the real BVPs. A large-scale laboratory experiment, which was run in the 80 s and the 90 s in Canada, was chosen as the BVPs. In this experiment, a chilled pipe was causing heave in a <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soil.</b> This BVPs were successfully modeled and simulated and they showed a good correspondence between numerical simulation and experimental results.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the early stages}} of heave, settlement and fracture of intact frost-susceptible rock by temperature cycling above and below 0 °C, two physical modelling experiments were performed on 10 rectangular blocks 450 mm high of fine-grained, soft limestone. One experiment simulated 21 cycles of bidirectional freezing (upward and downward) of an active layer above permafrost, and the other simulated 26 cycles of unidirectional freezing (downward) of a seasonally frozen bedrock in a non-permafrost region. Heave and settlement of the top of the blocks were monitored in relation to rock temperature and unfrozen water content, which ranged from almost dry to almost saturated. In the bidirectional freezing experiment, heave of the wettest block initially occurred abruptly at the onset of freezing periods and gradually during thawing periods (summer heave). After the crossing of a threshold marked by the appearance of a macrocrack in the upper layer of permafrost, summer heave increased by an order of magnitude as segregated ice accumulated incrementally in macrocracks, interrupted episodically by abrupt settlement that coincided with unusually high air temperatures. In the unidirectional freezing experiment, the wet blocks heaved during freezing periods and settled during thawing periods, whereas the driest blocks showed the opposite behaviour. The two wettest blocks settled progressively during the first 15 freeze-thaw cycles, before starting to heave progressively as macrocracks developed. Four processes, operating singly or in combination in the blocks account for their heave and settlement: (1) thermal expansion and contraction caused heave and settlement when little or no water-ice phase change was involved; (2) volumetric expansion of water freezing in situ caused short bursts of heave of the outer millimetres of wet rock; (3) ice segregation deeper in the blocks caused sustained heave during thawing and freezing periods; and (4) freeze-thaw cycling caused consolidation and settlement of wet blocks prior to macrocracking in the unidirectional freezing experiment. Rock fracture developed by growth of segregated ice in microcracks and macrocracks at depths determined by the freezing regime. Overall, the heave, settlement and fracture behaviour of the limestone {{is similar to that of}} <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Rock fill dams are {{the most}} common kind of dams at hydro power {{stations}} in Sweden. The dams consist of different zones like core, fine filter, coarse filter, rock fill and rip rap. One of the most important parts is the core of the dam, which serves as embankment. The core consists at best of fine grained moraine. Most often the core connects directly against the spillway construction of concrete, which means that the concrete is the only frost protection against the core in the longitudinal direction. The connection between the core and the concrete structure is by experience a weakness zone when it comes to rock fill dams. Geotechnical investigations close to the spillway construction has shown a very low degree of compaction of the soil, which has been explained by hang up effects and difficulties to compact the moraine closest to the concrete structure at the construction stage. Eventually a source to the low degree of compaction might be effects caused by freezing and thawing since freezing take place through the spillway construction into the core of moraine. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate if freezing take place through the concrete construction into the core, and to study effects by possible freezing. The process of freezing requires three basic conditions. The basic conditions required for frost action to occur include a <b>frost-susceptible</b> <b>soil,</b> a supply of water and soil temperatures sufficiently low to cause some of the soil water to freeze. Depending on the frost index, the amount of days with negative temperature, the frost depth will be more or less extensive. The three basic conditions required for frost action to take place are more or less fulfilled at the connection between the core and the spillway structure. Air temperature below zero degrees Celsius will create a difference of temperature per length which will cause a heat flux from the ground surface that is called a thermal gradient. Due to the 0 °C isotherm is getting deeper into the soil, the thermal gradient changes and the frost depth reaches its maximum. When the soil thaws the ice is converted to water. Since the process of freezing has agglomerated more water in the shape of ice than the volume of the pores in the soil may contain, {{there will be a lot}} of excess water in the soil. This excess water must be drained away in order to keep the balance in consideration of the water content of the soil. If the excess water is not drained the strength of the soil will be lowered. When soil freezes the geotechnical properties will be changed. Changes in density, water content and porosity are some examples of differences that might occur. When these properties of the soil are changed changes in micro structure, formation of cracks and changes due to permeability may take place. Mentioned changes will create a zone of weakness and the risk of inner erosion with potential piping will increase. By modeling the frost penetration with Temp/W, a finite element program used to calculate heat flow in geotechnical constructions, effects caused by freezing and thawing in the connection between the core and the spillway construction has been investigated. The analysis has been performed with climate data equal to a winter occurring every period of 50 and 100 year in Luleå respectively Jokkmokk. The calculations did show that freezing will occur through the concrete construction into the core of the dam. Depending on the freezing index and thermal bridges the depth of the frost penetration will differ. Freezing will already occur at a climate data equal to a normal winter for analysis of both Lulea and Jokkmokk. In Lulea the frost depth will differ between 2. 7 - 4. 0 meters depending on the climate data and the distribution of the reinforcement in the concrete structure. Regarding analysis with input corresponding to the conditions in Jokkmokk the frost depth will diversify between 3. 0 - 4. 6 meters depending on the climate data and the distribution of reinforcement at the concrete construction. To reduce the effects of freezing and thawing cut-off walls might be installed at the connection between the core and the concrete structure. In order to prevent freezing heating coils can be installed connected to the spillway structure. Since the problem of freezing and thawing is complexly some generalizations has been made to be able to investigate the three-dimensional problem with a software which handle with two-dimensional analysis, Temp/W. Further studies should be performed based of more careful investigations of the soil properties and the impact of the freezing process regarded to the amplitude of regulation and the ground water level of the dam. Even external circumstances like snow and wind relation should be considered in further analysis. A recommendation is that these investigations should be performed with software where it is possible to create a three-dimensional model in order to get a more realistic analysis.
