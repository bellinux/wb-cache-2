5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 <b>in</b> <b>Brown</b> Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, {{along with one}} further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam <b>in</b> <b>Brown</b> Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn <b>in</b> <b>Brown</b> Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E

5|$|McCarthyism {{declined}} in late 1954 after television journalist Edward R. Murrow and others publicly chastised McCarthy. The controversies over the Bill of Rights that were {{generated by the}} Cold War ushered {{in a new era}} in American Civil liberties. In 1954 <b>in</b> <b>Brown</b> v.

5|$|Not all inhibitors of {{oxidative}} phosphorylation are toxins. <b>In</b> <b>brown</b> adipose tissue, regulated proton channels called uncoupling proteins can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis.

5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling <b>in</b> <b>Brown</b> v.

Although agitation for an end to racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors are green (usually <b>in</b> <b>brown</b> stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb diamonds). In natural diamonds, there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave ultraviolet, but {{the reverse is true}} of synthetic diamonds. Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural diamonds, fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some diamonds, particularly Canadian diamonds, show no fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|Further {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Powell with Brown and Roach {{took place in}} New York during January and February 1955. The tracks cut in January, with arrangements by Neal Hefti, were released as Clifford Brown with Strings. The February sessions yielded the albums Study <b>in</b> <b>Brown,</b> and, combined with tracks from the previous year, Clifford Brown & Max Roach. The latter {{was added to the}} Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. At the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1955 Powell played with Roach and others as backing for Washington. Recordings made of the Brown–Roach quintet at the same event were released decades later.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} {{brought a}} case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School.

The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline <b>in</b> <b>brown</b> pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
5|$|Learned Hand {{remained}} in good {{physical and mental}} condition {{for most of the}} last decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School. These lectures proved to be Hand's last major critique of judicial activism, a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the Lochner ruling. They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court's 1954 decision <b>in</b> <b>Brown</b> v. Board of Education, which in Hand's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling Jim Crow segregation laws. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as The Bill of Rights, the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.|$|E

5|$|Nestlings have dark grey {{or brown}} down, cream to grey bills, cream gapes and orange throats. The plumage of {{juvenile}} birds {{in their first}} moult resembles that of the adult female, but the head and upperparts are streaked and slightly darker. Soon after fledging, juveniles moult into their first immature plumage, and more closely resemble the adult female. The breasts of male birds may have some orange feathers. Birds in their second year moult into a second immature phase, some males of which may resemble adult males, while others retain a more immature brown plumage. Determining the age and sex of birds <b>in</b> <b>brown</b> plumage can be very difficult. Information on exact timing of moulting is lacking, but the replacement of primary feathers takes place over the summer months between December and February.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{challenges}} to government repression came in 1953. An organization named ONE, Inc. published a magazine called ONE.

The case eventually went to the Supreme Court, which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.|$|E

5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision <b>in</b> <b>Brown</b> v. Board of Education to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} {{since the turn of the}} century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E
5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling and {{is due to the}} facilitated diffusion of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found <b>in</b> <b>brown</b> adipose tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown adipose tissue is found in mammals, and is at its highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown adipose tissue is present at birth and decreases with age.|$|E
