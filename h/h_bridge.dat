[...] The full-bridge variant of MMC allows the submodule capacitor to be inserted into the circuit in either polarity. [...] This confers additional flexibility in controlling the converter and allows the converter to block the fault current which arises from a short-circuit between {{the positive and negative}} DC terminals (something which is impossible with any of the preceding types of VSC). [...] Furthermore it allows the DC voltage to be of either polarity (like a LCC HVDC scheme), giving rise to the possibility of hybrid LCC and VSC HVDC systems. However, the full-bridge arrangement requires twice as many IGBTs and has higher power losses than the equivalent half-bridge arrangement.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>H</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is derived}} from the typical {{graphical}} representation of such a circuit. An <b>H</b> <b>bridge</b> is built with four switches (solid-state or mechanical). When the switches S1 and S4 (according to the first figure) are closed (and S2 and S3 are open) a positive voltage will be applied across the motor. By opening S1 and S4 switches and closing S2 and S3 switches, this voltage is reversed, allowing reverse operation of the motor.|$|E

50|$|Drive modules for servomotors are a {{standard}} industrial component. Their design is {{a branch of}} power electronics, usually based on a three-phase MOSFET or IGBT <b>H</b> <b>bridge.</b> These standard modules accept a single direction and pulse count (rotation distance) as input. They may also include over-temperature monitoring, over-torque and stall detection features. As the encoder type, gearhead ratio and overall system dynamics are application specific, {{it is more difficult}} to produce the overall controller as an off-the-shelf module and so these are often implemented as part of the main controller.|$|E
50|$|Another {{latching}} type has a remanent core that {{retains the}} {{contacts in the}} operated position by the remanent magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts. A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet. A polarity controlled relay needs changeover switches or an <b>H</b> <b>bridge</b> drive circuit to control it. The relay may be less expensive than other types, but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit.|$|E
