50|$|The Queensland Railways 2100 class {{first entered}} service in 1970. The class family {{consists}} of the 2100, 2130, 2150 and 2170 classes. It formed the mainstay of Queensland Rail's coal <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> {{the opening of the}} Goonyella line until electrification in the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Local {{goods traffic}} {{remained}} significant until {{the explosion in}} road <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> the 1950s. According to the Official Handbook of Stations the following classes of traffic were being handled at this station in 1956: G, P, F, H & C {{and there was a}} one-ton crane.|$|R
25|$|Prior to 3 November 1975, the pre-Northerner's were hauled by DA class {{diesel-electric}} locomotives. With {{the introduction}} of the Northerner branding, DX class locomotives were assigned to the train's <b>haulage.</b> <b>From</b> the 1990s onwards, DF class locomotives were used infrequently, and, on a more permanent basis DC class locomotives were used.|$|R
50|$|Brown coal <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> the Golpa-Nord {{strip mine}} to Vockerode on {{the stretch of}} the mining railway running past the {{community}} ceased after the power station was shut down. It is still used for special trips to Ferropolis (an industrial museum), so the old signal box has {{been converted into a}} halt.|$|R
50|$|Due to low freight levels, the {{northern}} {{portion of the}} Wairarapa line is currently under review as part of KiwiRail's turnaround plan. In some weeks {{there is only a}} single train on the line, running from Wellington to Napier. The use of the railway by Fonterra for bulk milk <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> Oringi means the Hawke's Bay line is sufficiently busy.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{and goods}} {{services}} were operated by steam <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> inception. In 1961 the 620/720 class diesel railcars {{were introduced to}} provide local suburban service to Maitland on the Hunter line and south to Fassifern and Toronto on the Toronto branch line. Long haul trains to Sydney were operated by steam haulage until their final withdrawal from passenger services in 1971, and from freight trains in 1972.|$|R

50|$|The steam {{locomotives}} {{and passenger}} carriages on the line, which {{were up to}} fifty years old, were gradually replaced by diesel <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> the mid-1950s. Thus, in 1955, DEBG operated a diesel locomotive and, in 1956, six diesel railcar formerly owned by Deutsche Bundesbahn and built in 1936 and 1937. However, the DEBG applied on 7 July 1958 to close all of its tracks in southern Germany. This was resisted {{by the state of}} Baden-Württemberg, in particular.|$|R

50|$|The {{engineer}} of {{the line}} {{was intended to be}} John Rennie, but the project’s City financiers favoured Robert Stephenson, believing that they would also benefit from the knowledge and wisdom of his respected father George. Although, because of the Act, Robert Stephenson had to follow Rennie’s route and use the obscure track gauge of , he was free to choose his own method of propulsion. Drawing on his experience with the Camden Incline on the London and Birmingham Railway he decided upon cable <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> stationary steam engines.|$|R
50|$|In 1901 {{the railway}} line was {{extended}} from East Greta to Stanford Merthyr Colliery {{which was also}} owned by the East Greta Company. This line initially also served Pelaw Main Colliery (owned by J & A Brown) & Heddon Greta Colliery. <b>Haulage</b> <b>from</b> Pelaw Main only lasted a short period as, after the 1905 opening of the nearby J & A Brown owned Richmond Vale Railway, the coal from this colliery was hauled over the RVR line to Hexham. Several small collieries were later opened along the Stanford Merthyr branch.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 a drift was sunk to the Victoria Tunnel seam to {{the north}} of the {{existing}} shafts. This drift was known as Waratah North Colliery (No.3 drift). Similar to No.2 drift this was a mechanised mine & was worked using similar equipment. The coal won from this drift was moved by a conveyor belt to a newly constructed screens & loading point. With the opening of Waratah North coal <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> the shafts ceased & the shafts were then only used for ventilation & a second means of egress from the mine. Waratah North closed on 20 June 1960.|$|R

It {{was followed}} by a coal <b>haulage</b> contract <b>from</b> Duralie Colliery to Stratford Mine from March 2003, then haulage of containers between Casino and Brisbane from May 2003. Another coal contract in the Hunter Valley was won in late 2003 for the <b>haulage</b> of coal <b>from</b> Newstan Colliery, Fassifern to Vales Point Power Station.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the full}} {{opening of the}} line in 1950, {{passenger}} and freight services on the line were hauled by JNR Class D50 2-8-2 steam locomotives, necessary to negotiate the steep gradients on the line of up 25 ‰. A couple of JNR Class 8620 steam locomotives were also used for shunting at Kamaishi Station. JNR Class C58 2-6-2 steam locomotives were also used on both passenger and freight services running {{to and from the}} Yamada Line. Six JNR Class D51 2-8-2 steam locomotives were subsequently transferred to the line, displacing some of the earlier D50s, but steam haulage on the line was entirely replaced by diesel <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> March 1967.|$|R
50|$|The {{proliferation}} of standard gauge railways serving the South Wales mineral areas emphasised the inconvenience {{of the broad}} gauge on the former South Wales Railway lines. Whatever its technical merits, the discontinuity requiring transshipment of loads was a major commercial disadvantage. The Great Western Railway decided to convert the gauge of the SWR lines and its own lines connecting with them. This was done {{in a large scale}} operation in 1872, and in a short space of time the broad gauge had been eliminated on South Wales, enabling the GWR to develop mineral <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> the area to London, West of England and South Coast destinations.|$|R

50|$|The Tumut line opened {{as far as}} Gundagai, {{using the}} contractor's equipment, on 10 November 1885. The line was finally {{extended}} to Tumut on 12 October 1903, and the branch to Batlow opened in 1922, and was extended to Kunama shortly after. The steep Kunama line was mainly used for fruit <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> the orchards surrounding Batlow, until services were suspended in 1983. The line beyond Batlow is formally closed and the line has been lifted. The Tumut line was suspended after flooding in 1984, {{and part of the}} alignment has been destroyed by Hume Highway upgrading works. The substantial Gundagai railway station was restored in the 1990s, and is the longest timber railway station in New South Wales.|$|R
5000|$|Following on {{from the}} success of the initial tours, in 2012 Compass Tours ran a second set of three steam tours, this time to York, under the name of The Roses Express for 3 Wednesdays during April. The tours {{operated}} from Southport on 4 April, Barrow-in-Furness on 11 April and finally Hooton on 18 April, of the 3 only the Southport to York trip was steam hauled throughout with the other 2 having diesel <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> the start to certain locations where the steam engines were attached. Locos used for these trips were LMS Stanier 8F 48151 and LMS Royal Scot 46115 [...] "Scots Guardsman". 48151 worked 4 and 18 April tours with 46115 only working 11 April's service from Barrow-in-Furness.|$|R

5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main <b>haulage</b> <b>from</b> Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|R

On 1 October 1960, therefore passenger services were discontinued between Tiefenbach and Hilsbach and twelve days later, following a derailment, freight traffic was abandoned. The weak track meant that continued operations no longer made sense and in subsequent years the tracks were dismantled on the section.|$|R
