60|$|It {{need not}} be remarked, that, when any one subject {{especially}} occupies the public mind, those known {{to be interested in}} it are compelled to listen to many weary platitudes. Lady Byron's remarks, however, caught my ear and arrested my attention by their peculiar incisive quality, their originality, and the evidence they gave that she was as well informed on all our matters as the best American statesman could be. I had no wearisome course to go over with her as to the difference between the <b>General</b> <b>Government</b> and <b>State</b> <b>Governments,</b> nor explanations of the United States Constitution; for she had the whole before her mind with a perfect clearness. Her morality upon the slavery question, too, impressed me as something far higher and deeper than the common sentimentalism of the day. Many of her words surprised me greatly, and gave me new material for thought.|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of recommended management practices on privately owned rural {{lands in the}} catchments of the Great Barrier Reef {{is central to the}} strategy being employed by Australian Governments to improve the health of terrestrial and aquatic environments in Queensland. The paper describes the results of surveys of rural landholders in the Wet Tropics NRM region of North Queensland. Mail and interview surveys were used to explore landholders land and water management practices, attitudes to natural resource management issues, management objectives, use of information to support management decision making, trust of organisations and individuals and their socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Principal components analyses were used to assess the factors underlying responses to questions about landholders management objectives, trust of others and use of information sources. Three main factors were identified for management objectives which correspond to economic, environmental and social dimensions. The four factors underlying landholders appraisal of information sources were termed enterprise, finance and family, environment groups and media which correspond to the subject matter and accessibility of the various sources. Five factors were identified underlying landholders trust of other people and organisations were related to the primary interests and role of these organisations and people. These were termed productivity groups, <b>government</b> <b>general,</b> <b>State</b> <b>government,</b> neighbours and environment groups. ANOVA tests revealed significant differences in the management objectives, use of information and trust between landholders with differing primary purposes for landownership. The implications for the design and implementation of natural resource management policies and programs are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
