40|$|The Maritime Labour Convention 2006 (MLC, 2006) {{has entered}} into force in August 2013. Shipowners, flag States and port State {{authorities}} {{have an important}} role in the successful implementation of the MLC, 2006. Port State control (PSC) is responsible for ensuring that ships are in compliance with the requirements of the MLC, 2006. In cases of significant non-compliance ships are detained. This paper analyses the MLC, 2006 -related deficiencies that were marked as a ground for <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> inspected in areas under the jurisdiction of the Paris MoU in the period 20 August 2013 until 31 December 2014. 390 recorded detainable deficiencies were related to 33 items, mostly belonging to areas “Accommodation, recreational facilities, food and catering” and “Conditions of employment”. The fact that 220 ships were detained (a total of 39 based solely on the MLC, 2006 -related deficiencies) in 18 port States, suggests that PSC is becoming effective in detecting unacceptable working and living conditions for seafarers on-board. Detention rates on the MLC, 2006 ground vary significantly between port States, indicating that there is a room for harmonisation of PSC procedure...|$|E

50|$|Under Port State Control (PSC), {{inspection}} <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in port {{would be}} taken by Port State Control Officer (PSCO). Annual report of Paris MoU reported that a total of 74,713 deficiencies were recorded during port state control inspections in 2007. These deficiencies resulted in 1,250 detentions in the same year. <b>Detention</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> is the last course of action that a PSCO would take upon finding deficiencies aboard the vessel.|$|R

50|$|Demurrage is a {{fixed sum}} per day or per hour that the {{charterer}} agrees {{to pay for}} any time that the vessel is detained for loading or discharging over the time contractually allowed—usually described as lay days. Sometimes {{the number of days}} the vessel may be kept on demurrage at the agreed rate is fixed by the charter-party. If no demurrage is provided for by the charter-party, and the vessel is not loading or discharging beyond the lay days, the shipowner can claim damages for the loss suffered by the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Taiwan {{protested the}} {{storming}} <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> and {{the arrest of}} the officers, and contested the attempt by Canadian authorities to extradite them to Romania, citing Article 92 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Article 92 states that [...] "Ships shall sail under the flag of one state only and, save in exceptional cases expressly provided for in international treaties or in this Convention, shall be subject to its exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas." [...] Article 97 of the same Law further holds that [...] "no arrest or <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship,</b> even {{as a measure of}} investigation, shall be ordered by any authorities other than those of the flag state." [...] The flag state in this case was the Republic of China, which owns Yang Ming Lines.|$|R

Two days later [...] and Cockatrice were in company for the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the Danish <b>ship</b> George, and the Danish vessels Die Perle and Fortuna.|$|R
5000|$|Strachan ran unsuccessfully for the New South Wales Parliament against Billy Hughes in 1898 (he {{appears as}} [...] "Captain Alistair" [...] in Hughes' 1947 book Crusts and Crusades), but in November 1902 was imprisoned for debt in North Borneo. In 1903 he again tried to enter politics, this time running against Joseph Cook {{for the federal}} seat of Parramatta without success. He unsuccessfully sued the Commonwealth in 1906 for <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> his <b>ship</b> at Daru in Papua, and was charged with illegal {{recruiting}} by the Germans in New Guinea in 1909. He subsequently retired, although he was active in anti-German organisations during World War I {{and ran for the}} state seat of Parramatta in 1917, garnering only 26 votes. He died in Sydney of chronic cystitis in 1922.|$|R
5000|$|The United States of the New Continent (USN) is a {{supranational}} {{union of}} North and South American countries. The USN capital, where the USN Central Government operates, is Washington DC. The union's roots {{date back to}} 2011, when its relations with Australia began to sour over the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> an Australian <b>ship</b> named [...] "The Trinidad". The United States and Canada begin negotiations on merging with South American countries after the Republic of Zaftra is formed in 2015. These talks culminate {{in the creation of}} the USN five years later.|$|R
60|$|I invite your {{attention}} to the correspondence between Her Britannic Majesty's minister accredited to this Government and the Secretary of State relative to the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the British <b>ship</b> Perthshire in June last by the United States steamer Massachusetts for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not rounded in strict right as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of {{the owners of the}} vessel for her detention.|$|R

She was sold to the Australian Shipping Board in 1952 and renamed Coolabah, although she was not reflagged until October 1954. She was assessed at , [...] In November 1956, she was sold to the Cambray Breeze Shipping Co Ltd, Hong Kong and renamed Troon Breeze, but returning to the British flag. On 18 April 1957, Troon Breeze rescued the 25 crew of the Italian steamship , which had caught fire in the Andaman Sea {{off the coast of}} Burma. In March 1958, the owners of Troon Breeze were fined Rp200,000 (then £6,451) for a violation of maritime flag law. She had been detained for about a month at Makassar. [...] On 19 January 1964, Troon Breeze was seized at Samarinda, East Borneo, where she had arrived to load a cargo <b>of</b> lumber. The <b>ship</b> and her 40 crew were detained. The <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> Troon Breeze was stated by the Straits Times to be in retaliation for the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> two Indonesian <b>ships</b> at Hong Kong due to court action against Penai, the Indonesian state shipping company.|$|R
6000|$|There was a pause, {{and then}} the lieutenant, {{with the sort of}} {{hesitation}} that a gentleman is apt to feel when he makes a proposal that he knows ought not to be accepted, called out that those in the boat with him would pay for the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> A more unfortunate proposition could not be made to Captain Truck, who would have hove-to his ship in a moment had the lieutenant proposed to discuss Vattel with him on the quarter-deck, and who was only holding out as a sort of salve to his rights, with that disposition to resist aggression that the experience of the last forty years has so deeply implanted in the bosom of every American sailor, in cases connected with English naval officers, and who had just made up his mind to let Robert Davis take his chance, and to crack a bottle with the handsome young man who was still standing up in the boat. But Mr. Truck had been too often to London not to understand exactly the manner in which Englishmen appreciate American character; and, among other things, he knew it was the general opinion in the island that money could do any thing with Jonathan; or, as Christophe is said once to have sententiously expressed the same sentiment, [...] "if there were a bag of coffee in h---, a Yankee could be found to go and bring it out." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a critical reading of four cases {{that took place}} before nineteenth century Mixed Commissions on the Slave Trade at Sierra Leone, namely the Sinceridade, Activo, Perpetuo Defensor and Maria da Gloria cases. Mixed Commissions were early institutional sites where international law was confronted with victims on a multiple scale. Although they {{had the power to}} emancipate slaves, Mixed Commissions did not do so as a result of rights attributed to slaves as human beings. Rather this article shows that the capacity of Mixed Commissions to emancipate slaves was dependent upon the legality of the search, seizure and <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the slave <b>ship</b> on which slaves were found. This legal link between emancipation and lawful intervention left slaves in a potentially precarious legal position even at the point of “rescue”. However, in two of the cases examined here the worst effects of this precariousness were avoided through slave resistance. This article aims to contribute to ongoing scholarly critiques of international criminal legal histories by interrogating how abolition has been remembered in international law...|$|R
