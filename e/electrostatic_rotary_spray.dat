40|$|The plasma {{spraying}} process {{is used to}} coat surfaces which are subjected to extreme conditions, e. g. rocket nozzles in the aerospace industry. The basic outline of the pro- cess is to inject metal or ceramic particles into a plasma jet generated by an electric arc. The particles are melted by the high temperature and accelerated towards the component to be coated (the substrate) by the high fluid velocities inside the plasma jet. When impacting on the substrate the particles solidify in a few milliseconds to form a strongly bonded coating. At Fraunhofer Chalmers Centre a software for simulating <b>electrostatic</b> <b>rotary</b> bell <b>spray</b> painting is being developed and used in the automotive industry.

40|$|We {{present an}} electrostatically {{actuated}} rotary stage featuring liquid rings, which serve as both mechanical bearings and electric {{connections between the}} rotor and the substrate. The liquid rings are formed by confining a liquid inside hydrophilic grooves and repelling it from the superhydrophobic surfaces outside the grooves. Made of a fluid, the liquid-ring bearing avoids the dry friction of the solid bearings, significantly improving the reliability. Formed as rings, it avoids the resistance of contactangle hysteresis sliding over droplets, and hence dramatically reducing the static friction. Furthermore, surface tension facilitates the self-alignment of the rotor to the substrate and stator during the assembly and provides the stability against drift and shock during operation. Electrically, each liquid ring passes an independent electric signal, allowing a direct electrical path between the substrate and potential components on the rotor. A three-phase <b>electrostatic</b> <b>rotary</b> stage has been design, fabricated, and tested. The minimum torque to initiate the rotation is ∼ 2. 5 nṄm - hundreds of times smaller than droplet-based counterparts. The device has operated successfully by applying sequential voltages of 50 V DC between the rotor and the stators. The electric transmission has been verified by powering an LED on a rotating rotor.

The waste simulant acidity varied between 1 N and 12 N. The waste simulant was neutralized by pre-blending calcium hydroxide with Portland cement and blast furnace slag powders prior to mixing with the simulant for grout solidification.

Formulations for each of these methods are presented along with waste form characteristics and properties. Compositional variation maps for grout formulations are presented which help determine the optimum "recipe" for a particular waste stream. These maps provide a method to determine the proportions of waste, calcium hydroxide, Portland cement, and blast furnace slag that provide a waste form that meets the disposal acceptance criteria. The maps guide researchers in selecting areas to study and provide an operational envelop that produces acceptable waste forms.

40|$|A novel {{design of}} a {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) control moment gyroscope (MCMG) was proposed in this paper in order to generate a torque output with a magnitude of 10 - 6 N∙m. The MCMG consists of two orthogonal angular vibration systems, i. e., the rotor and gimbal; the coupling between {{which is based on}} the Coriolis effect and will cause a torque output in the direction perpendicular to the two vibrations. The angular rotor vibration was excited by the in-plane <b>electrostatic</b> <b>rotary</b> comb actuators, while the angular gimbal vibration was driven by an out-of-plane electrostatic parallel plate actuator. A possible process flow to fabricate the structure was proposed and discussed step by step. Furthermore, an array configuration using four MCMGs as an effective element, in which the torque was generated with a phase difference of 90 degrees between every two MCMGs, was proposed to smooth the inherent fluctuation of the torque output for a vibrational MCMG. The parasitic torque was cancelled by two opposite MCMGs with a phase difference of 180 degrees. The designed MCMG was about 1. 1 cm × 1. 1 cm × 0. 04 cm in size and 0. 1 g in weight. The simulation results showed that the maximum torque output of a MCMG, the resonant frequency of which was approximately 1, 000 Hz, was about 2. 5 × 10 - 8 N∙m. The element with four MCMGs could generate a torque of 5 × 10 - 8 N∙m. The torque output could reach a magnitude of 10 - 6 N∙m when the frequency was improved from 1, 000 Hz to 10, 000 Hz.

40|$|A three-species {{model for}} {{steady-state}} negative corona discharge has been considered, with focus on geometries occurring in electrostatic precipitators and automotive spray painting. The model incorporates electrons {{as well as}} positive and negative ions, which are subject to ionization and attachment reactions. By using the three-species model {{it is possible to}} resolve the ionization region, which is not the case in one-species models for corona discharge, although these are commonly used in applications. In this work, we present an approach to solve the three-species problem by decomposing the domain into a one- and three-species part. This is based on that electrons and positive ions exclusively reside in the ionization region, which typically has a small spatial extent. It is an efficient approach as the one-species model is significantly less computationally demanding than the three-species model. The approach is implemented by coupling a structured finite-volume Newton solver for the one-species model and an unstructured finite-volume solver for the three-species model. The implemented solver is validated by considering a one dimensional test case with coaxial cylinders. The usefulness of the implemented solver is illustrated by solving the three-species problem for a range of geometries of interest to electrostatic precipitators and automotive spray painting. Specifically, we consider electrostatic precipitators with wires that are arranged between parallel plates. The results for these geometries are then used to perform coupled electrostatic-, uidand particle-simulations to determine the particle collection eficiency, which is a performance measure for an electrostatic precipitator. Regarding automotive spray painting, we consider two dimensional analogs of the ABB G 1 <b>rotary</b> <b>spray</b> bell. We indicate that the results from three-species simulations can be used to parametrize boundary conditions for a one-species solver.

The relating processes to the structuration of these photoresists and some applications are presented too. The minimal resolution of the Riston® films {{has been found to be}} 30 µm for lines and trenches, and 40 µm for isolated holes in a 50 µm-thick film. A technique for the structuration of multilevel superimposed cavities has been set up. The verticality of the sidewalls (85. 5 °deg. to 87. 5 °deg) has been measured on film thicknesses between 25 and 100 µm. The SU- 8 process has been studied and is presented. Some optical and mechanical properties have been analysed. We have determined a coefficient of light attenuation of 5. 18 [db/mm] at 365 nm, a coefficient of thermal expansion of 52 [ppm/°C] and a biaxial modulus of 5. 18 GPa. The verticality of the walls depends on the exposure energy and has been found to be higher than 89 °deg. Layers from 750 nm to 2 mm can be exposed in one time, which seems to be the state-of-the art for a UV-photoresist to our knowledge. A specific process for the electroforming in multi-level superimposed cavities has been developed. With an adequate dosage of a leveling agent (coumarin) in the electrolytic Watt bath of nickel, a change in the growth rate of the high and the low level of the mold has been demonstrated. This rate is harmonised to obtain a flat deposition on the top surface of the formed structure. The UV-LIGA techniques developed in this thesis have found applications in the field of the-micromechanics. A flexible gearwheel, whose teeth are bound to the center via three integrated spring, and a multilevel gear system are the main realizations obtained by electroforming.

40|$|This study {{considered}} {{a novel approach}} to selecting isolates of Hyphomycete fungi as mycoinsecticides for biological control of aphids in arable crops in the UK. The approach was designed to select isolates which were compatible with both the biotic and abiotic environment. Aphis fabae was chosen as a representative target aphid for bioassays, based on results of preliminary experiments. Eighteen isolates of fungi were screened at a single concentration of 1 x 10 ⁸ conidia ml⁻¹ against apterous adult A. fabae, which were incubated at 23 °C. Spray applications were made using an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>rotary</b> atomiser in both laboratory and field experiments. Isolates that originated from aphid hosts were most pathogenic to A. fabae. Four isolates were selected for further studies; ARSEF 2879 (Beauveria bassiana), HRI 1. 72 (Verticillium lecanii), Mycotrol strain GHA (B. bassiana) and Z 11 (Paecilomyces fumosoroseus). Isolate HRI 1. 72 was most virulent to A. fabae in dose-response assays compared to other isolates; at concentrations of 1 x 105 conidia ml⁻¹ and above, mortality of aphids due to infection by HRI 1. 72 was 100 %. Isolates of P. fumosoroseus and V. lecanii were able to grow and germinate better in vitro at low temperatures (10 & 15 °C), than isolates of B. bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae. Aphis fabae and Myzus persicae, inoculated with isolate HRI 1. 72 and incubated at 10 °C, succumbed to infection after a significantly shorter period of time compared to other isolates. Rhopalosiphum padi was most resistant to infection by the four isolates compared to five other species of aphid. Aphis fabae, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Sitobion avenae, Metopolophium dirhodum, R. padi and M. persicae were most susceptible to infection by isolate HRI 1. 72. Aphids infected with isolates of V. lecanii often had fungal sporulation on their legs and died attached to leaves on which they were feeding. The isolates Mycotrol strain GHA and ARSEF 2879 were pathogenic to the 7 -spot ladybird Coccinella septempunctata and the generalist parasitoid Praon volucre. The isolates HRI 1. 72 and Z 11 had very little impact on these natural enemies tested. When aphids of A. fabae were co-inoculated with isolates of Hyphomycete fungi and Erynia neoaphidis, most individuals succumbed to infection with E. neoaphidis. A significant number of aphids died within 24 hours of inoculation and {{showed no signs of}} external sporulation. The potential interactions between these natural enemies in the biocontrol of aphids are discussed. The spatial and temporal distribution of aphids and their natural enemies, in field bean and wheat crops, was determined in two field seasons (1997 & 1998). Aphids sampled from the field, after application of Hyphomycete fungi in 1998, mostly succumbed to infection with E. neoaphidis. Epizootics of E. neoaphidis were recorded in both years. Greater numbers of healthy laboratory aphids succumbed to infection with Hyphomycete fungi when they were bioassayed on leaves sampled immediately following spraying (51 - 100 %) compared to 24 hours later (8 - 65 %).

40|$|Present {{studies show}} {{the ability of}} cold spray {{processing}} (prilling) to tailor the morphology of simple or double emulsion-based fluid systems as investigated for two types of air-assisted nozzle geometries under various processing conditions. The spray process parameters varied were: (i) gas to liquid flow rate ratio (GLR), (ii) spraying pressure and (iii) total mass flow rate. The results depicted that the emulsion flow inside the nozzle (liquid cap) {{as well as in}} the spray (outside nozzle) have a distinct impact on the resulting product structure due to the respective flow stresses acting. Increasing the flow stresses either lead to an additional dispersing impact or to separation and coalescence of the disperse fluid phase(s). Besides the process parameters, the material characteristics of the emulsion systems such as viscosity ratio λ of dispersed to continuous phase and the interfacial tension γ were varied in a wider range. The results demonstrated a systematic increase in structure stability for higher λ values within a range of 0. 32 – 30. As representative dimensionless numbers, (a) a critical liquid Weber number Wel,Drop,cr/λ and (b) a critical gas Weber number Weg,Drop,cr/λ were defined to describe the effect of liquid cap-tip and air-assisted spraying, respectively, with respect to preserving the disperse microstructure of the treated emulsions. Above these critical We numbers, the dispersed emulsion phase drops were broken up and drop mean sizes were exponentially decreased due to the flow stresses acting either in the liquid flow inside the nozzle or in the spray filament outside the nozzle. Dynamic viscosity η and dynamic moduli (G′, G″) of treated emulsions increased with decreasing droplet size of the dispersed phase(s) thus altering the spraying performance as well as the properties of the liquid product systems reconstituted from resulting spray-chilled powders. A third critical Weber number Weg,Nozzle,cr was derived for the spray droplet (tertiary droplet) generation by the spray filament breakup providing information of the smallest spray droplet that could be attained, while keeping the dispersed emulsion (secondary) droplets unchanged in size. The impact of Weg,Nozzle on the resulting spray (tertiary) mean drop size was systematically explored for internal (INMIX) and external (EXMIX) liquid-gas mixing air-assisted nozzles. High-speed videography and laser shadowgraphy were applied to visualize liquid spray filament stretching and breakup, as well as the velocity distribution in the sprays. Sufficiently gentle spray conditions for complete preservation of the disperse emulsion structure were only achieved in the Rayleigh filament breakup regime. Accordingly, a pressure controlled rotary “Rayleigh atomizer” was developed to study emulsion spraying by filament stretching and gently spray drop formation, preserving the emulsion (secondary) droplet structure. At the same time pressure adjustment enabled higher throughput rates compared to conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>spraying</b> nozzles for which only centrifugal forces determine filament stretch and throughput rate simultaneously. Filament length and drop size decreased with increasing rotational speed at a given total pressure (centrifugal pressure + static liquid pressure at the nozzle inlet) or flow rate, and the filament length and drop size increased with higher liquid pressures and related throughput rates at a given rotational speed. Chilling solidification of the spray drops was superimposed in selected cases. Prilling (spraying[*]+[*]chilling) was carried out for various emulsion systems in a prilling tower applying average air temperatures of ca. − 10 °C for higher melting fat-continuous emulsions down to − 50 °C for low melting oil- or water-continuous emulsions, in order to produce solid powder particles. The microstructure of the solid particles was analyzed in further detail by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM). Concerning emulsion structure preservation in the sprayed products, the results clearly demonstrated that the disperse structure can differ significantly from the initial emulsion structure if critical flow stress conditions are exceeded. Respective process-structure functions were also quantified. For emulsion-based prilled powders, the applicability and adjustability as functional component carriers for controlled release applications is of big interest in industries such as food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics. For related functional component release experiments we designed an in vitro gastric/duodenal setup. With this, the release kinetics of functional components encapsulated/embedded in dispersed secondary or primary emulsion drop phase(s) were quantified under simulated gastric or duodenal digestion conditions. Accordingly, an iron compound (micronutrient) was encapsulated into the primary and/or secondary dispersed emulsion droplets of simple or double emulsions, and related solid emulsion powder particles were produced through prilling applying our selected air-assist atomizers. In a first testing step, the iron release kinetics for selected products were systematically investigated in the in-vitro gastric system at pH[*]≈[*] 2. 0, and quantified as a function of prill powder particle size, secondary emulsion drop size and prill powder storage time under ambient conditions...|$|R

The primary application of this device is long-range, high-speed linear micropositioning. The future generations of this device include <b>rotary</b> <b>electrostatic</b> micromotors and microgenerators. The development of the first generation of microball-bearing-supported micromachines, including device theory, design, and modeling, material characterization, process development, device fabrication, and device test and characterization is presented. The first generation of these devices is based on a 6 -phase, bottom-drive, linear, variable-capacitance micromotor (B-LVCM). The design of the electrical and mechanical components of the micromotor, lumped-circuit modeling of the device and electromechanical characteristics, including variable capacitance, force, power, and speed are presented. Electrical characterization of BCB polymers, characterization of BCB chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), development of embedded BCB in silicon (EBiS) process, and integration of device components using microfabrication techniques are also presented. The micromotor consists of a silicon stator, a silicon slider, and four stainless-steel microballs. The aligning force profile of the micromotor was extracted from simulated and measured capacitances of all phases. An average total aligning force of 0. 27 mN with a maximum of 0. 41 mN, assuming a 100 V peak-to-peak square-wave voltage, was measured. The operation of the micromotor was verified by applying square-wave voltages and characterizing the slider motion. An average slider speed of 7. 32 mm/s when excited by a 40 Hz, 120 V square-wave voltage was reached without losing the synchronization. This research has a pivotal impact in the field of power microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). It establishes the foundation for the development of more reliable, efficient electrostatic micromachines with variety of applications such as micropropulsion, high-speed micropumping, microfluid delivery, and microsystem power generation...|$|R
40|$|With {{widespread}} use of pesticides in modern agriculture, the impacts of spray drift have become a topic of considerable interest. The drifting of sprays is a highly complex process influenced by many factors. Advances in aerial application technology and {{in our ability to}} measure drift, coupled with the adoption of new technologies for regulating pesticide application have necessitated further research in the pesticide application process. Experiments were conducted to quantify spray drift and describe its movement from aerial applications of pesticide. The effects of spray quality, atomizer type and ground cover were examined. Initial airborne drift amounts were greater than downwind deposits, thus not all of the drifting spray was deposited in the measuring area. Total off-target movement of spray was significantly greater for Fine compared to Coarse <b>sprays.</b> <b>Rotary</b> and hydraulic atomizers, both producing Fine sprays, produced statistically similar off-target movement of sprays. Similarly, no significant statistical differences in spray drift between applications to bare ground and applications to a headed barley crop canopy were not identified. Contrary to expectations, aerial application to bare ground seemed to result in less off-target movement than application to a crop canopy. The vertical spray cloud profiles were similar for all applications with the greatest amount of spray present at the height of release. Spray concentrations diminished from that height upward with diffusion and downward with deposition. The empirical data disagreed with the mechanistic model AgDISP which is currently used in the Canadian regulatory process. The model over-predicted drift deposition by a factor of two to five. Variability in spray deposit values could not be attributed to average differences in meteorological conditions at the time of application. Experiments with appropriate protocols for increased sensitivity may be required to more accurately report subtle differences in drift at distances greater than 200 m from the target area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Swirling jet {{is used as}} a {{means of}} {{controlling}} flames in combustion chamber. Swirl flow offer an interesting field of study for aerospace & mechanical engineers in general and for combustion engineers in particular since it involves complex interaction of recirculation & turbulent mixing, which aid flame stabilization in combustion system. Swirling flow in both reacting & non-reacting conditions occur in wide range of application such as gas turbines, marine combustor burner, chemical processing plants, <b>rotary</b> kilns & <b>spray</b> dryers. Stabilization of flame can be achieved by various techniques. The most common techniques used in modern gas turbine combustors is swirl stabilization in which swirl velocity is imparted to inlet air using vane Swirler. Swirl can reduce combustion length by producing higher rates of entrainment of ambient fluid and fast mixing close to exit nozzle & on boundaries of recirculation zone in strongly swirling zones. Experimental studies show that swirl has large – scale effect on flow fields: jet growth, entrainment & decay and flame size, shape, stability & combustion intensity are affected by degree of swirl imparted to the flow, therefore swirling flows are commonly used to improve & control mixing process. This work present design of combustion chamber. Swirler applicable for producing CRZ (Central Recirculating Zone) to control length & stability of flame. Whole assembly design includes inlet pipes, Swirler, diffuser, expansion chamber, and tailpipe. The core objective {{of this study is to}} present the details of the experimental swirl flow.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{establish}} an efficient and economical industrial process for extraction of a Kaufmann and Tobschirbel orbitide (KT) mixture from flaxseed oil. KTs occur at a low level in flaxseed oil and must be concentrated at least 600 fold to produce a useful commercial concentrate. KT peptides are more polar than most lipids may be separated using solid- or liquid- phase extractants. Extraction protocols were investigated to determine a better approach for KT peptide extraction. Commercial solid-phase extraction methods would require the adaptation of bench-scale silica flash column chromatography. The first approach was to develop methods for separation of peptides using only silica, ethyl acetate and ethanol. Ethyl acetate is known to remove both oil and peptides from silica. Therefore, the ability of low temperature to decrease the peptide elution from silica was studied. The other method utilized liquid-liquid extraction. In order to measure the success of an extraction an analytical method was required to evaluate the separation of peptides from oil. An analytical procedure was developed that readily determined the relative concentration of peptide and lipid. Aqueous and anhydrous ethanol partitioning was used to extract the KT mixture from flaxseed oil. Ethanol solutions between 50 and 100 % in water (v/v) were mixed with flaxseed oil. The oil and peptide content of the extracts were determined using 1 H-NMR. Liquid-liquid extraction using 70 % aqueous ethanol at volume ratio (solvent to oil) of 0. 25 : 1 produced a mole ratio of 2 : 1 (KTs to oil) making it the optimal solvent for KT extraction. In {{the second part of}} this project, the scale of liquid-liquid extraction was increased through several 10 to 30 -fold steps to establish a potential industrial extraction process for recovery of the KT mixture. The feasibility of processing the solvent containing mixed peptides was investigated. Multiple evaporation and adsorption methods were also tested, including falling film evaporation, rotary evaporation, a combination of rotary evaporation and freeze drying, and a combination of <b>rotary</b> evaporation and <b>spray</b> drying. Various experimental methods to enrich and isolate KTs from water-rich fraction were performed. At the end of this project, 3328. 89 g of KT mixture was produced that was suitable for commercial purposes. The increase of extraction scale was 140, 000 fold...|$|R
