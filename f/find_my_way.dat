There were so many styles that I was into at a young age. I didn't want to get locked into just one thing." [...] During his youth, Leto had been a devoted fan of progressive rock and blues music, listening to artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Boz Scaggs. He is inspired by electronic music, including Depeche Mode and The Cure. His major influences also include jazz band Steely Dan, as well as heavy metal groups Mountain, Iron Maiden and Kiss. According to Leto, these artists were commercially viable but also respected for their statements and contributions. He explained that he [...] "never focused on the drummers," [...] saying that he felt more connected to music than a particular drummer.|$|E

[...] "When I was a child," [...] he said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to <b>find</b> <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this."

'May I <b>find</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to the reason to come home/ May I <b>find</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to the foot of your throne.'"

40|$|Background: A cancer {{diagnosis}} elicits greater distress {{than any}} other medical diagnosis, and yet very few studies have evaluated the efficacy of structured online self-help therapeutic programs to alleviate this distress. This study aims to assess the efficacy over time of an internet Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (iCBT) intervention (2 ̆ 7 <b>Finding</b> <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> 2 ̆ 7) in improving distress, coping {{and quality of life}} for individuals with a recent diagnosis of early stage cancer of any type. Methods/Design: The study is a multi-site Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) seeking to enrol 188 participants who will be randomised to either the <b>Finding</b> <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> Intervention or an attention-control condition. Both conditions are delivered online; with 6 modules released once per week, and an additional booster module released one month after program-completion. Participants complete online questionnaires on 4 occasions: at baseline (immediately prior to accessing the modules); post-treatment (immediately after program-completion); then three and six months later. Primary outcomes are general distress and cancer-specific distress, with secondary outcomes including Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), coping, health service utilisation, intervention adherence, and user satisfaction. A range of baseline measures will be assessed as potential moderators of outcomes. Eligible participants are individuals recently diagnosed with any type of cancer, being treated with curative intent, aged over 18 years with sufficient English language literacy, internet access and an active email account and phone number. Participants are blinded to treatment group allocation. Randomisation is computer generated and stratified by gender. Discussion: Compared to the few prior published studies, <b>Finding</b> <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> will be the first adequately powered trial to offer an iCBT intervention to curatively treated patients of heterogeneous cancer types in the immediate post-diagnosis/treatment period. If found efficacious, <b>Finding</b> <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> will assist with overcoming common barriers to face-to-face therapy in a cost-effective and accessible way, thus helping to reduce distress after cancer diagnosis and consequently decrease the cancer burden for individuals and the health system...|$|R
2500|$|The Burning World was {{the first}} Swans album to feature more {{conventional}} pop melodies.

After his sideman stint, he took several members from Delaney & Bonnie to form a new super-group, Derek and the Dominos.

2500|$|Clapton's next group, Blind Faith (1969), was {{composed}} of Cream drummer Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood of Traffic, and Ric Grech of Family, and yielded one LP and one arena-circuit tour.

2500|$|As Nintendo {{released}} its first home video game console, the Family Computer (rereleased in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System), Miyamoto made {{two of the}} most momentous titles for the console and in the history of video games as a whole: Super Mario Bros. (a sequel to Mario Bros.) and The Legend of Zelda (an entirely original title). In both games, Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores, unlike many games of the time. Super Mario Bros. largely took a linear approach, with the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. By contrast, Miyamoto employed nonlinear gameplay in The Legend of Zelda, forcing the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles. The world was expansive and seemingly endless, offering [...] "an array of choice and depth never seen before in a video game." [...] With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto sought to make an in-game world that players would identify with, a [...] "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer." [...] He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves; each Zelda title embodies this sense of exploration. [...] "When I was a child," [...] Miyamoto said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to <b>find</b> <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] He recreated his memories of becoming lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family home in Zeldas labyrinthine dungeons.

2500|$|Puyi came to Beijing on 9 December 1959 {{with special}} {{permission}} from Mao Zedong and lived {{for the next}} six months in an ordinary Beijing residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel. Puyi had the job of sweeping the streets, and got lost on his first day of work, which led him to tell astonished passers-by: [...] "I'm Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing dynasty. I'm staying with relatives and can't <b>find</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home". One of Puyi's first acts upon returning to Beijing was to visit the Forbidden City as a tourist, where he pointed out to other tourists that many of the exhibits were the things he had used in his youth. He voiced his support for the Communists and worked at the Beijing Botanical Gardens. Working as a simple gardener gave Puyi a degree of happiness that he had never known as an emperor, though he was notably clumsy. Behr noted that in Europe people who played roles analogous to the role Puyi played in Manchukuo were generally executed; for example, the British hanged William Joyce ("Lord Haw-haw") only for being the announcer on the English-language broadcasts of Radio Berlin, Italian Communist guerrillas shot Benito Mussolini, and the French executed Pierre Laval, so many Westerners are surprised that Puyi was released from prison after only nine years to start a new life. Behr wrote that the Communist ideology explained this difference, writing: [...] "In a society where all landlord and 'capitalist-roaders' were evil incarnate, it did not matter so much that Puyi was also a traitor to his country: he was, in the eyes of the Communist ideologues, only behaving true to type. If all capitalists and landlords were, by their very nature, traitors, it was only logical that Puyi, the biggest landlord, should also be the biggest traitor. And, in the last resort, Puyi was far more valuable alive than dead". In early 1960, Puyi met Premier Zhou Enlai, who told him: [...] "You weren't responsible for becoming Emperor at the age of three or the 1917 attempted restoration coup. But you were fully to blame for what happened later. You knew perfectly well what you were doing when you took refuge in the Legation Quarter, when you traveled under Japanese protection to Tianjin, and when you agreed to become Manchukuo Chief Executive." [...] Puyi responded by merely saying that though he did not choose to be an emperor, he had behaved with savage cruelty as boy-emperor and wished he could apologize to all of the eunuchs he had flogged during his youth.|$|E
