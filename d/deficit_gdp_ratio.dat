The experience of high government deficits of developed nations in the 1980 s led researchers to analyze {{the reasons for this}} and among other factors they have argued that political variables could also explain budget deficits (Sutter, 2003). This study aims to investigate the effects of the political parties for fiscal deficits in Turkey for 1976 - 2004 period. Our results show that the most important variable in explaining the budget <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> in Turkey is its lagged value. The political dispersion index variable, which measures the effect of the number of parties in the government in power, has proven to have a minor effect. Only the coalition governments with two or more parties are found to have higher budget <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios.</b> Ideology of the governments in power is important for the budget <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> when it is considered with the number of parties in the government in power.

40|$|The Maastricht {{convergence}} criteria set constraints on both monetary and fiscal {{policies in the}} EMU Accession Countries. This paper uses a DSGE model of a two sector small open economy with distortionary taxes to address the following question: How do the Maastricht {{convergence criteria}} modify an optimal monetary and fiscal policy mix in an economy facing domestic and external shocks? We find that targets of the unconstrained optimal monetary and fiscal policy {{are similar to those}} of the optimal monetary policy alone. The constrained policy is characterised by additional elements that penalize fluctuations of monetary and fiscal variables around the new targets which are different from the steady state of the unconstrained optimal monetary policy. Under the chosen parameterization (which aims to reflect the Czech Republic economy) the optimal monetary and fiscal policy violates three Maastricht criteria: on the CPI inflation rate, the nominal interest rate and <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio.</b> Both the stabilization component and deterministic component of the con- strained policy are different from the unconstrained optimal policy. Since monetary criteria play a dominant role in affecting the stabilization process of the constrained policy, CPI inflation and the nominal interest are characterised by a smaller variability (than under the unconstrained policy) at the expense of a higher variability of <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio.</b> The constrained policy is characterised by a deflationary bias which results in targeting the CPI inflation rate and the nominal interest rate that are lower by 1. 3 % (in annual terms) than the CPI inflation rate and the nominal interest rate in the countries taken as a reference. The constrained policy is also characterised by targeting surplus to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> at around 3. 7 %. As a result the policy constrained by the Maastricht convergence criteria induces additional welfare costs that amount to 60 % of the initial deadweight loss associated with the optimal policy. ...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EconomicsSteven P. CassouThis essay empirically {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} between government debt and budget deficits in the United States during a recession {{as opposed to}} an expansion. We use four different budget deficits definitions to develop a more comprehensive insight. We estimate a threshold VAR model on quarterly data from 1947 : Q 1 to 2016 : Q 3 on debt to <b>GDP</b> and budget <b>deficits</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> for the United States. Specification test using LR test rejects the null for a linear VAR against nonlinear VAR. The nonlinear impulse responses indicate, with an increase to budget <b>deficits</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio,</b> government debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> rise faster during a recession {{as opposed to an}} expansion, and tend to move in a counter-cyclical manner with an increase in the output gap. We can thus infer that governments chose economic stability over fiscal balance during recessions. With an increase in government debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio,</b> nonlinear impulse response show budget <b>deficits</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> grow faster during an expansion as opposed to a recession and exhibit counter-cyclicality with an increase in the output gap. All four budget defi cits definitions depict similar pattern. Robustness check, using cyclically adjusted primary budget deficit published by the congressional Budget Office, also con rm the above findings. In this essay, we explore the presence of a long run relationship between the monetary base and the government debt using monthly data from 1942 : 1 to 2015 : 12. We apply formal statistical methods including cointegration and threshold cointegration tests to investigate the presence of a long-run relationship and estimate a threshold vector error-correction model (TVECM henceforth) to analyze the short-run dynamics. We find the presence of a threshold cointegration between the monetary base and government debt. As for the short-run dynamics, TVECM estimates show that the speed of adjustment is significant for the growth in debt equation in both regimes with the signs indicating government adjusting the debt in the short-run. But the U. S. Fed does not change the monetary base, hence we do not find any evidence of debt monetization in the U. S. We evaluate our findings over two sub-samples: 1946 to 2015 and 1946 to 2007 for robustness purposes. Findings from both sub-samples conform to our findings from the full sample. In this essay, we investigate the impacts of growth in the budget deficit and money supply on real interest rate are integral to contemporary macroeconomic policy. We employ threshold VAR and nonlinear impulse responses using quarterly data from 1959 to 2015. We find that growth in money supply and budget deficits have an asymmetric impact on inflation, short-term interest rate, and real interest rates. Growth in money supply and budget deficit tend to make the real interest rate negative in a bad state. In a good state, on the other hand, growth in money supply tend to increase the real interest rate but growth in budget deficits tend to decrease the real interest rate over the forecast horizon...|$|R

A positive TFP shock has a short-lived deterioration in the current account deficit in Greece and no effect thereafter. This deterioration comes as a result of an increase in imports due to the increase in RGDP. Thereafter, the increase in imports is counterbalanced by the effects of increased productivity on foreign investment and exports. On the other hand, the current account deficit in the case of the ROECD group improves in the short run, reflecting the positive productivity effect on investment and exports, but eventually deteriorates once the increased imports effect dominates. This effect is the one that dominates the SP group as well.|$|R

The current account <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> in 2006-2008 was in the double digits and reached its peak {{in the first quarter of}} 2008 at a threatening 18.8%. This was mostly due to rapid loan portfolio growth as Scandinavian banks provided cheap credit in Lithuania.

This led to high inflation of goods and services, as well as trade deficit.|$|R

2500|$|Chrétien {{promised to}} renegotiate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and reform to the {{unemployment}} insurance system. In regards to NAFTA, the Red Book pronounced itself {{in favor of}} a North American free trade zone in principle, but went on to accuse Mulroney of having given away too much to the Americans and Mexicans when he signed NAFTA in 1992, and stated that the Liberal government would renegotiate NAFTA on more favorable terms to Canada within six months of taking office. Failing that, the Red Book promised that Canada would renounce NAFTA. The main emphasis in the Red Book was on a promise to spend $6billion on improving infrastructure in a Keynesian move to fight the recession of the early 1990s. As regarding the debt situation, Chrétien promised in the Red Book to reduce Canada's deficit to 3 per cent of <b>GDP</b> (the same <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> required to enter the European Union) within three years of taking office. Chrétien {{made it clear that the}} 3% <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> would apply only to the federal government, whereas the Maastricht Treaty of 1991 which set out the 3% <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> in order to enter the European Union stated that this applied to all levels of government. The Red Book went on to promise that a Liberal government would achieve its goal of reducing the deficit to 3% of the GDP by cancelling the contract to buy the Sea King helicopters and to privatise Pearson airport in Toronto and by eliminating unspecified [...] "waste" [...] in the government. After the 3% target had been achieved within the first three years of taking office, the Red Book promised that the deficit would be eliminated at some unspecified time in the future. Martin, who had been the leader of the team that had produced the Red Book had wanted to promise to eliminate the deficit altogether, but had been overruled by Chrétien, who had wanted to present the Liberals as the [...] "caring" [...] party that would defend social programs, unlike the [...] "heartless" [...] Tories and the Reform Party who Chrétien claimed wanted to eliminate the deficit within two or three years by gutting social programs with no thought for any suffering that this might cause. Chrétien claimed in his campaign speeches that Reform's plans for eliminate the deficit within two or three years of taking office would cause at least a 25% unemployment rate, if not higher, which Chrétien claimed starkly in a series of speeches would cause a bloody [...] "revolution". Chrétien had personally chosen the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP as it made the Liberals seemed fiscally responsible while at the same time promised that the Liberals would not inflict too much economic pain to achieve that fiscal responsibility. One Liberal candidate Herb Dhaliwal recalled that for Chrétien at time of the 1993 election that the national deficit was not a major issue and that: [...] "His attitude was that the deficit is ok as long as you can manage it". To support its economic claims, the Red Book gave costs for each of the Liberals' policy goalsthe first time a Canadian party had gone to such lengths to prove that its proposals were fiscally responsible.|$|R

We also study rules for setting national tax and spending rates, rules that constrain movements in the <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio.</b> We ask whether these rules are necessary for the common monetary policy to be able to harmonize national inflation rates, and we analyze their effects on national welfare. We also discuss some potential failings of our model (and perhaps NNS models generally); in particular, our model's variance decompositions suggest that productivity shocks may play an inordinately large role, while fiscal shocks (or demand shocks generally) may play too small a role (even when 'rule of thumb' spenders are added). ...|$|R

To shed light on both issues, we present an empirical macrofinance model that combines a no-arbitrage affine term structure model with a set of structural restrictions that allow us to identify fiscal policy shocks, and trace the effects of these shocks on the prices of bonds of different maturities. Compared to a standard VAR, this approach has the advantage of incorporating the information embedded in a large cross-section of bond prices. Moreover, the pricing equations provide new ways to assess the model’s ability to capture risk preferences and expectations. Our results suggest that government deficits affect long term interest rates, at least temporarily: (i) a one percentage point increase in the <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> increases the 10 -year rate by 35 basis points after 3 years; (ii) this increase is partly due to higher expected spot rates, and partly due to higher risk premia on long term bonds; and (iii) the fiscal policy shocks account for up to 13 % of the variance of forecast errors in bond yields...|$|R

30|$|The total tax revenues-to-GDP ratio (TAX_Y); {{the public}} debt-to-GDP ratio (BY); the VAT {{efficiency}} index, i.e., {{the ratio of}} the VAT effective tax rate to the standard VAT rate (VEF). And, last but not least, the twin deficits: the Government <b>Deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> (DEFY) and the Current Account <b>Deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> (CAY). The first two variables (TAX_Y, BY) are associated with the resources available to IOS in order to finance wages, tax breaks, and maintain and develop the underlying public sector infrastructures. As already mentioned, the insider–outsider society relates to the debt sustainability issue, for it explains chronic public deficits along with relatively low growth. 15 Also, it relates to the “common pool property” of public finances, whereby there is an inherent bias towards higher government spending (lower tax revenues), due to the externality present in the financing of specific government goods and services (tax cuts). 16 This externality is generated by the fact that those that enjoy the benefits of specific government benefits (tax cuts) are fewer and possibly different than those that pay for these benefits (share the cost of no tax cuts, such as with debt financing). And, as a result, there is higher demand for spending (tax cuts). In a way, the insider–outsider society incorporates the common pool problem, as the reason that an outsider does not react to the insider behavior, is also due to the free rider apathy of those that share the cost of insiders’ benefits. VEF {{is a measure of the}} efficiency of the tax collection mechanism, related to tax avoidance, especially of professionals’ groups. Prima facie, VEF has a dual relationship with IOS. Presumably, to the extent that higher efficiency implies more funds for state coffers, it benefits insiders. On the other hand, if tax inefficiencies are brought about by tax avoidance, this may be an indication of tax avoiding professionals. Finally, the inclusion of CAY and DEFY reflect the link between IOS and twin deficits. As emphasized in Kollintzas et al. (2012), the workings of the insider–outsider society explain the “twin deficits” formation, as a consequence of demand-side as well as supply-side effects. The former depend on the dominance of income and wealth effects on consumption and therefore imports, possibly associated with legal and illegal rents of insiders, over general Ricardian-type effects. The latter are associated with rents of insiders that may or may not be associated with the budget deficit. For example, high wages in heavily unionized public sector enterprises directly affect the budget deficit and at the same time drive up cost of intermediate products to the private sector and put upward pressure on private sector wages, as well. And, high fees in regulated professions (e.g., lawyers, engineers, architects, pharmacists, notary publics, certified accountants) drive up production costs in the non-traded and, worst, in the traded goods sectors, jeopardizing the competitiveness of the economy and therefore reducing exports.|$|R

This paper attempts to understand India's current fiscal situation, its likely future development, and its impact on the economy in the context of a weak global recovery from the current crisis. The impact of the global crisis has been transmitted to the Indian economy through three distinct channels, namely: the financial sector, exports, and exchange rates. The other significant channel of impact is the slump in business and consumer confidence leading to decrease in investment and consumption demand. The Indian government, to boost the demand, has announced several stimulus packages. However, there is not much room for further fiscal policy action as the consolidated fiscal deficit of the central and state governments in 2009 - 2010 is already about 11 % of the gross domestic product (GDP). Any further increase in the fiscal <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> could invite a sharp downgrading of India's credit rating and a loss of business confidence. The paper reviews the existing theories on the relationship between fiscal deficit and growth. It also analyzes the past trends and policy measures to understand the possible implications for economic recovery and long run growth in the Indian context. It also provides a long-term forecast of the fiscal deficit and public debt burden based on the past trends.

The overall conclusion of sustainability for the 1903 - 2003 period is not maintained for the more recent 1975 - 2003 period, which is characterised by the largest <b>GDP</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>ratios</b> of our sample. This latter period appears to signal a shift to an unsustainable path in Portuguese fiscal policy. Hence, our results suggest that fiscal consolidation efforts must, in fact, be continued in Portugal. fiscal sustainability, sustainability of public debt, intertemporal budget constraint, government deficits and debt, Portugal...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} IMF''s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model to compute shortrun {{multipliers}} of fiscal stimulus measures and long-run crowding-out effects of higher debt. Multipliers of two-year stimulus range from 0. 2 to 2. 2 {{depending on the}} fiscal instrument, the extent of monetary accommodation {{and the presence of}} a financial accelerator mechanism. A permanent 0. 5 percentage point increase in the U. S. <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> raises the U. S. tax burden and world real interest rates in the long run, thereby reducing U. S. and rest of the world output by 0. 3 - 0. 6 and 0. 2 percent, respectively.

40|$|It {{has almost}} become the {{conventional}} wisdom that there should be rules governing the size of the budget deficits, without regard for the impact of such deficits on the macro economy. This is reflected in the push for a balanced budget in the United States and the 3 percent <b>deficit</b> to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> convergence criteria in the Maastricht Treaty (and designed for observance by countries signing up for the single currency). The {{purpose of this paper is}} not to present further arguments against deficit reduction for its own sake or against the balanced budget for that has been done by others. The purpose is rather to consider the arguments which have been done by others. The purpose is rather to consider the arguments which have been advanced in favor of a budget deficit limited by the capital expenditure budget separate from the current expenditure. The structure of this paper is as follows. We first consider some possible rationales for the so-called ‘golden rule' that current expenditure by government should be covered by taxation and capital expenditure may be financed by borrowing. The next section points out the ways in which the government sector should be treated differently from the private sector in matters of deficits and their financing. The application of any ‘golden rule' is dependent on how capital expenditure is conceptualized and measured, and that is discussed in section 4. The next section suggests ways in which the ‘golden rule' may lead to some problems. Section 6 provides some further discussion on the debt stability condition, and section 7 is a brief conclusion. The central point which is at the heart of this paper is the current expenditure and capital expenditure by government have the essentially similarities that they use current resources, have to be financed but do not yield a direct monetary revenue for the government. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper elaborates on the {{relationship}} between sustainability of public debt and the debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> in case the interest rate on public debt exceeds the growth rate of GDP. When the primary surplus relative to GDP positively reacts to a higher debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio,</b> a bounded debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> guarantees sustainability. Further, an unbounded debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> is not compatible with sustainability, even if the primary surplus relative to GDP strictly rises as the debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. Finally, sustainability is excluded if the initial debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> exceeds a critical threshold. Public Debt, Primary Surplus, Inter-temporal Budget Constraint, Sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Surging {{public debt}} since the Great Recession has focused {{increasing}} {{attention on the}} issue of debt sustainability. This paper provides debt sustainability analyses for the Czech Republic and Slovakia by estimating their public debt to GDP, and primary balance to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> up until 2022 under three different projections. The first, labelled the baseline projection, predicts their debt ratios to 2022, if neither their public debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> nor their primary balance to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> change. This projection uses the official forecasts of the key variables. The second projection answers the question of how much the two counties have to consolidate, measured by their primary balance to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios,</b> if they want to hold their public debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> at their current levels. The third projection answers the question of how much the countries have to consolidate if they aim to reattain their December 2008 pre-crisis public debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios.</b> All three projections are made for the same five scenarios, which cover a status quo case, where official forecasts are realized, and both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for growth and consolidation outcomes. The paper`s novelty lies in its development of an existing non-parametric methodology to encompass iterative numerical solution methods to assess public debt sustainability. This allows a richer set of results to be obtained, for example estimates for the required level of the public debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the primary balance to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio,</b> taking account of variables such as nominal interest rates, yields to maturity on public debt, inflation rates and average maturities of debt...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the causal {{relationship between the}} public debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> and economic growth for 31 EU and OECD countries from 1995 to 2013. A {{number of studies have}} tackled this problem, but very few make the transmission mechanism explicit in their analysis. We estimate a panel VAR model that incorporates the long-term real interest rate on government bonds as a vehicle to transmit shocks in both the public debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> and economic growth. We find no causal link from the public debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> to the <b>GDP</b> growth rate, irrespective of the levels of public debt. Rather, we find a causal relation from the GDP growth rate to the public debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio.</b> In high-debt countries, the direct negative impact of economic growth on public debt is enhanced by a rise in the long-term real interest rate, which in turn decreases interest-sensitive demand and leads to a further increase in the public debt to <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|R
