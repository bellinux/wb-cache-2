5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 <b>inducers,</b> such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} {{detection of}} a thin vertical line (target) {{in the presence}} of a slightly thicker collinear, adjacent line (<b>inducer).</b> Sign and strength of contrast of the <b>inducer</b> were varied. Test lines could be either bright or dark. Detection thresholds were obtained through a temporal two-alternative forced-choice (2 AFC) procedure with the method of constant stimuli. When target and <b>inducer</b> had equal contrast polarity, low thresholds of target lines were observed for low <b>inducer</b> contrasts and increased with increasing <b>inducer</b> contrast. With opposite contrast polarity of target and <b>inducer,</b> thresholds were high for low <b>inducer</b> contrasts and decreased for increasing contrast thereof. Our results support the hypothesis that cortical mechanisms with different sensitivity to the sign and strength of contrast participate in the detection facilitation of line contours...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inducer</b> design {{plays an}} {{important}} part in Alternating Current Field Measurement (ACFM). It involves influence analysis of some key parameters on the perturbation of the magnetic field above the crack. Experimental analysis methods are time-consuming, high cost and have experimental errors. Finite element method (FEM) can overcome these shortcomings, and is adopted in this paper to aid design of ACFM <b>inducer.</b> Two kinds of ACFM <b>Inducer,</b> twin coil and U-shaped <b>inducer</b> are proposed, and corresponding numerical simulation models are built.

25|$|Barbiturates {{induce a}} number of hepatic CYP enzymes (most notably CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), leading to exaggerated effects from many prodrugs and {{decreased}} effects from drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes to inactive metabolites. This can result in fatal overdoses from drugs such as codeine, tramadol, and carisoprodol, which become considerably more potent after being metabolized by CYP enzymes. Although all known {{members of the class}} possess relevant enzyme induction capabilities the degree of inhibition overall as well as the impact on each specific enzyme span a broad range with phenobarbital and secobarbital being the most potent enzyme <b>inducers</b> and butalbital and talbutal being among the weakest enzyme <b>inducers</b> in the class.|$|E

25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions.

Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 <b>inducers,</b> can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 <b>inducers,</b> can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis is to verify the hydraulic <b>inducer</b> designs and to determine {{its effect on the}} cavitation characteristics of the pump. To increase the suction capability and cavitation resistance, the <b>inducer</b> is placed in front of the impeller centrifugal pump. Its role is to protect the impeller against the cavitation. The literary part of the thesis analyzes the issue of cavitation, its origin, development and termination of the cavitation bubble with so-called implosion.

40|$|The <b>inducer</b> {{binding site}} of the E. coli lactose {{repressor}} has been examined by in vitro characterization of mutant proteins with amino acid substitutions at the hypothetical <b>inducer</b> binding site (Sams, C. F., Vyas, N. K., Quiocho, F. A. and Matthews, K. S. (1984) Nature 310, 429 - 430). Since the major force for sugar interaction comes from hydrogen bonding between the <b>inducer</b> and the hydrophilic side chains in the <b>inducer</b> binding site of lac repressor, Lys 84, Asp 88, Asp 130 and Asp 274 at the hypothetical <b>inducer</b> binding site were chosen to be substituted. Using site-directed mutagenesis, each site was substituted with four different amino acids that altered side chain length, polarity or charge. In addition, double mutations were introduced at Lys 84 and Tyr 282 sites in order to elucidate the role of Lys 84 in subunit interaction. Through characterizing mutant proteins at the Lys 84 site in vitro, including <b>inducer</b> binding properties, operator binding activities, immunoblotting pattern, and gel filtration behavior, we conclude that Lys 84 {{is at the same}} subunit interface as Tyr 282 and is not involved directly in the <b>inducer</b> binding site. A similar situation applies to Asp 88, which {{does not appear to be}} in the <b>inducer</b> binding site and does not directly contribute energy to <b>inducer</b> binding. The data on mutants at Asp 130 indicate no effect on <b>inducer</b> binding, while mutations at Asp 274 suggest an essential role is played by this amino acid. Based on the fact that mutations at the Asp 274 site did not show any spectroscopic alteration in the presence of <b>inducer,</b> even though the presence of IPTG protected iodide quenching of Trp 220 in the <b>inducer</b> binding site, we propose that this amino acid is essential for the conformational change upon <b>inducer</b> binding. This proposal is strongly supported by the X-ray crystallographic data obtained for periplasmic sugar binding proteins whose sequences show homology to lac repressor core domain. Thus, all the mutational data presented in this study are consistent with the recently proposed structure of lac core protein which is based on sequence alignment and molecular replacement modeling (Nichols, J.

40|$|The crr {{mutation}} {{was shown}} to affect the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system-mediated transient repression of the lac operon, intracellular cAMP levels, and sensitivity to <b>inducer</b> exclusion. Our {{results indicate that the}} presumed crr gene product, factor IIIGlc, plays a direct role in the regulation of <b>inducer</b> exclusion. We propose a mechanism in which <b>inducer</b> exclusion depends on both the level and state of phosphorylation of factor IIIGlc and the level of an <b>inducer</b> exclusion-sensitive transport system. The results of studies on the sensitivity to <b>inducer</b> exclusion of glycerol and maltose in cultures induced for short periods of time on these substrates (resulting in varying degrees of activity of the respective transport systems) support this model of <b>inducer</b> exclusion. Previously, the crp*- 771 mutation has been shown to result in an altered cAMP receptor protein, which has a changed affinity for cAMP, and to affect the sensitivity for <b>inducer</b> exclusion of glycerol. Changes in other functions of the altered cAMP receptor protein were indicated by our results; these changes were in the roles of this protein in (i) the cAMP-dependent initiation of transcription of the lac operon and (ii) the regulation of intracellular cAMP levels and the export of cAMP. We propose that the crp*- 771 mutation has an indirect effect in relieving <b>inducer</b> exclusion in repressed or hypersensitive strains, in which the crp*- 771 mutation allows the synthesis of <b>inducer</b> exclusion-sensitive transport systems to higher levels than the levels found in strains containing wild-type cAMP receptor protein...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When a small frontoparallel surface (a test strip) is {{surrounded}} by a larger slanted surface (an <b>inducer),</b> the test strip is perceived as slanted in the direction opposite to the <b>inducer.</b> This has been called the depth-contrast effect, but we call it the slant-contrast effect. In nearly all demonstrations of this effect, the <b>inducer's</b> slant is specified by stereoscopic signals; and other signals, such as the texture gradient, specify that it is frontoparallel. We present a theory of slant estimation that determines surface slant via linear combination of various slant estimators; the weight of each estimator is proportional to its reliability. The theory explains slant contrast because the absolute slant of the <b>inducer</b> and the relative slant between test strip and <b>inducer</b> are both estimated with greater reliability than the absolute slant of the test strip. The theory predicts that slant contrast will be eliminated if the signals specifying the <b>inducer's</b> slant are consistent with one another. It also predicts reversed slant contrast if the <b>inducer's</b> slant is specified by nonstereoscopic signals rather than by stereo signals. These predictions were tested and confirmed in three experiments. The first showed that slant contrast is greatly reduced when the stereospecified and nonstereo-specified slants of the <b>inducer</b> are made consistent with one another. The second showed that slant contrast is eliminated altogether when the stimulus consists of rea...|$|R
