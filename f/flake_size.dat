40|$|Nowadays many effect {{pigments}} such as pearl or metallic flakes {{are commonly}} used in many commercial products such as electrical devices or car. To help the designer to choose the right color or for color management purposes, not only the color represented using hue, chroma and lightness but also the surface characteristics like gloss or pearliness needs to be quantified. In this study, the visually perceived pearliness is investigated {{to figure out whether}} an observer can perceive the pearliness as an intrinsic surface characteristics and whether the color measurement data using conventional color measurement devices could predict the visual pearliness or not. For the experiment, UV coated polycarbonate samples are prepared having three steps of pearl-pigment densities (2 %, 5 %, 8 %) and average particle sizes (15 μm, 25 μm, 45 μm). Two types of base color are used, i. e. white and pink, and each sample is duplicated. Therefore in total 36 pearly samples are used in the experiment. Apart from the pearly samples, the three samples without pearl flakes are prepared having different gloss levels. All the samples are measured using glossmeter and spectrophotmeter with d/ 8 measurement geometry. Gloss measurement data shows that the gloss increases as the pearl <b>flake</b> densities and <b>sizes</b> are increased. CIELAB L* value decreases as the pearl <b>flake's</b> <b>size</b> increases while CIELAB C* value decreases as the pearl flake density increases when SCE mode data are used for calculation. It means that the pearl <b>flake's</b> <b>size</b> affects the specular reflection component mostly while the pearl flake's density affects the degree of scattering at the flake's surface. The psychophysical experimental data was conducted using the sample samples. Six observers participated and asked to quantify the degree of perceived pearliness of each sample. The result showed that perceived pearliness value is significantly increased as the pearl <b>flake's</b> <b>size</b> increases, which cannot be fully explained by the measurement data. Since this research demonstrated that current color measurement technique cannot explain the perceived pearliness, further research using various measurement devices needs to be conducted in the future. ope...|$|R

Here, we report the fabrication of all-MXene (Ti 3 C 2 Tx) solid-state interdigital microsupercapacitors by employing a solution spray-coating, followed by a photoresist-free direct laser cutting method. Our prototype devices consisted of two layers of Ti 3 C 2 Tx with two different <b>flake</b> <b>sizes.</b> The bottom layer was stacked large-size MXene flakes (typical lateral dimensions of 3 - 6 μm) serving mainly as current collectors.

Compared to Ti 3 C 2 Tx micro-supercapacitors with platinum current collectors, the all-MXene devices exhibited much lower contact resistance, higher capacitances and better rate-capabilities.

Our analyses were specifically designed to assess whether there is an absolute relationship between ever-increasing <b>flake</b> <b>size</b> and increased efficiency and/or loading potential. An alternative hypothesis is merely that only the smallest flakes are inefficient, and it is this factor which has been driving previous statements linking increasing <b>flake</b> <b>size</b> with increased efficiency. Our first set of analyses, using all experimental flakes, determined that a statistically significant relationship existed between increased flake sizes and increased cutting efficiency, as measured by two different efficiency measures (‘Time taken’ and ‘Number of cutting strokes required’).

In this study, the electronic and magnetic properties of quasi zero dimensional silicene nanoflakes (SiNFs) are investigated using first principles calculations. Whilst the zigzag edged hexagonal SiNFs exhibit nonmagnetic semiconducting character, the zigzag edged triangular SiNFs are magnetic semiconductors. One effective method of harnessing the properties of silicene is hydrogenation owing to its reversibility and controllability. From bare SiNFs to half hydrogenated and then to fully hydrogenated, a triangular SiNF experiences a change from ferrimagnetic to very strong ferromagnetic, and then to non-magnetic. Nonetheless, a hexagonal SiNF undergoes a transfer from nonmagnetic to very strong ferromagnetic, then to nonmagnetic. The half hydrogenated SiNFs produce a large spin moment that is directly proportional to the square of the <b>flakes</b> <b>size.</b> It has been revealed that the strong induced spin magnetizations align parallel and demonstrates a collective character by large range ferromagnetic exchange coupling, giving rise to its potential use in spintronic circuit devices.

Using standard procedures, we measure how the MoS 2 concentration and production rate scale with processing parameters. However, we also use recently developed methods based on optical spectroscopy to simultaneously measure both nanosheet lateral size and thickness, allowing us to also study the dependence of nanosheet dimensions on processing parameters. We found the nanosheet concentration and production rates to depend sensitively on the mixing parameters (the MoS 2 concentration, Ci; the mixing time, t; the liquid volume, V; and the rotor speed, N). By optimising mixing parameters, we achieved concentrations and production rates as high as 0. 4 mg/ml and 1. 3 mg/min respectively. Conversely, the nanosheet size and thickness were largely invariant with these parameters. The nanosheet concentration is also extremely sensitive to the surfactant concentration. However, more interestingly the nanosheet lateral size and thickness also varied strongly with the surfactant concentration. This allows the mean nanosheet dimensions to be controlled during shear exfoliation at least in the range ~ 40 - 220 nm for length and ~ 2 - 12 layers for thickness.
