This loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery.Although the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. They have been used for regularly hauling freight only in a few locations (Arakkonam - Renigunta, Kirandul-Kottavalasa and other SER sections). Max. speed 110 km/h.Variants include WAM-4P D (dual brakes), WAM-4P R (??), WAM-4P DB 6P, WAM-4 6P DB HS, and WAM-4 6P D (these are for superfast trains), WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P (some superfasts, passengers), and WAM-4P DB 4P (generally for stopping passengers). The 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all <b>resistors</b> <b>dropping</b> out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with <b>resistors</b> <b>dropping</b> out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too. The WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.|$|R

Almost all current measurements involve measuring the voltage <b>drop</b> across a <b>resistor,</b> using Ohm 2 ̆ 7 s law, in which the discrete nature of charge does not come into play.

Here we report a direct observation of these time-correlated single-electron tunnelling oscillations, and show electron counting in the range 5 fA - 1 pA. This represents a fundamentally new way to measure extremely small currents, without offset or drift.

50|$|The {{simplest}} non-ideal {{current source}} {{consists of a}} voltage source in series with a resistor. The amount of current available from such a source is given by {{the ratio of the}} voltage across the voltage source to the resistance of the resistor (Ohm's law; I = V/R). This value of current will only be delivered to a load with zero voltage drop across its terminals (a short circuit, an uncharged capacitor, a charged inductor, a virtual ground circuit, etc.) The current delivered to a load with nonzero voltage (drop) across its terminals (a linear or nonlinear resistor with a finite resistance, a charged capacitor, an uncharged inductor, a voltage source, etc.) will always be different. It is given by the ratio of the voltage <b>drop</b> across the <b>resistor</b> (the difference between the exciting voltage and the voltage across the load) to its resistance. For a nearly ideal current source, the value of the resistor should be very large but this implies that, for a specified current, the voltage source must be very large (in the limit as the resistance and the voltage go to infinity, the current source will become ideal and the current will not depend at all on the voltage across the load). Thus, efficiency is low (due to power loss in the resistor) and it is usually impractical to construct a 'good' current source this way. Nonetheless, it is often the case that such a circuit will provide adequate performance when the specified current and load resistance are small. For example, a 5 V voltage source in series with a 4.7 kilohm resistor will provide an approximately constant current of 1 mA ± 5% to a load resistance in the range of 50 to 450 ohm.|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that direct determination of electrospray current {{would provide a}} viable method for maintaining spray stability to enable optimal nanospray analysis was tested by building a feedback apparatus capable of reading the current and readjusting the emitter voltage in real time. The apparatus consists of a current-sensing circuit that reads the voltage <b>drop</b> across a <b>resistor</b> located between the high-voltage power supply and the nanospray emitter. A low voltage proportional to the observed current is generated and sent to a data acquisition card. The information is used by a proportional-derivative-integral (PID) algorithm to calculate the magnitude of a low-voltage signal {{that is used to}} control the power supply output. Any variation of current across the sensing resistor is thus counteracted by an opposite-direction variation of the high voltage applied to the nanospray emitter. In this way, the apparatus adjusts the emitter voltage to achieve a preset value of current, which it strives to maintain over time in spite of any possible variation of the parameters influencing the spray regime. Preliminary results have shown that the feedback apparatus is capable of establishing and maintaining stable spray for samples that are usually considered challenging in traditional voltage-controlled analysis, such as those consisting of nucleic acid solutions with high salt loads. For these types of samples, the total ion count recorded in current-controlled mode was significantly more stable than that observed in voltage-controlled mode. At the same time, overall signal intensities and signal-to-noise ratios were also significantly improved. Setting the target nanospray current to a predefined value and letting the apparatus reach the target without operator intervention enabled the acquisition of viable data from solutions containing up to 2. 5 M ammonium acetate, which are ordinarily difficult by traditional manual tuning. A deeper understanding of the current–voltage relationships for samples of very different compositions is expected to enable one not only to predict the target current that should be used for a certain analysis, but also to devise algorithms to change such target as a function of predictable variations of sample properties and analytical conditions. This will allow for optimal performance to be maintained during on-line gradient chromatography in which the nature of the sprayed solution may vary very widely {{during the course of the}} analysis...|$|R
40|$|A circuit {{topology}} {{has been}} designed to guarantee the output of intrinsically safe power for the operation of electrical devices in a hazardous environment. This design uses a MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) as a switch to connect and disconnect power to a load. A test current is provided through a separate path to the load for monitoring by a comparator against a preset threshold level. The circuit is configured so that the test current will detect a fault in the load and open the switch before the main current can respond. The main current passes through the switch and then an inductor. When a fault occurs in the load, the current through the inductor cannot change immediately, but the voltage drops immediately to safe levels. The comparator detects this drop and opens the switch before the current in the inductor has a chance to respond. This circuit protects both the current and voltage from exceeding safe levels. Typically, this type of protection is accomplished by a fuse or a circuit breaker, but in order for a fuse or a circuit breaker to blow or trip, the current must exceed the safe levels momentarily, which may be just enough time to ignite anything in a hazardous environment. To prevent this from happening, a fuse is typically current-limited by the addition of the resistor to keep the current within safe levels while the fuse reacts. The use of a resistor is acceptable for non-battery applications where the wasted energy and voltage <b>drop</b> across the <b>resistor</b> can be tolerated. The use of the switch and inductor minimizes the wasted energy. For example, a circuit runs from a 3. 6 -V battery that must be current-limited to 200 mA. If the circuit normally draws 10 mA, then an 18 -ohm <b>resistor</b> would <b>drop</b> 180 mV during normal operation, while a typical switch (0. 02 ohm) and inductor (0. 97 ohm) would only drop 9. 9 mV. From a power standpoint, the current-limiting resistor protection circuit wastes about 18 times more power than the switch and the inductor configuration. In the fault condition, both the resistor and the inductor react immediately. The resistor reacts by allowing more current to flow and dropping the voltage. Initially, the inductor reacts by dropping the voltage, and then by not allowing the current to change. When the comparator detects the drop in voltage, it opens the switch, thus preventing any further current flow. The inductor alone is not sufficient protection, because after the voltage drop has settled, the inductor would then allow the current to change, in this example, the current would be 3. 7 A. In the fault condition, the resistor is flowing 200 mA until the fuse blows (anywhere from 1 ms to 100 s), while the switch and inductor combination is flowing about 2 A test current while monitoring for the fault to be corrected. Finally, as an additional safety feature, the circuit can be configured to hold the switch opened until both the load and source are disconnected...|$|R

A logic high will initiate the test. A logic low will terminate the test. In the event that an external signal is connected to the test jig while local operation occurs, the local control takes precedence over remote control. Once a DVT has been locked in the ZIF socket and the DIP switches are selected, the Push-to-Test button may be depressed. Momentarily depressing the button will initiate a test with a minimum 400 ms duration. At the same time a PBCLOCK and PBLATCH pulses will be initiated and the power rails + 12 V, + 8 V, and - 6 V will be ramped to full voltage. The time at which the power rails reach the full voltage is about 13 ms and it is synchronized with bypass capacitors placed on COMP input of U 20 and U 22 and on the output of U 23 voltage regulators. The voltage rails are supplied to a {+-} 10 % window comparator. A red LED indicates the rail is below or above 10 % of the design value. A green LED indicates the rail is within acceptable limits. For DDT with a 5 pF and 10 pF feed back capacitor, the + 12 V and + 8 V rails are current-regulated to 19 rnA and 22 rnA respectively and the - 6 V rail is short-circuit protected within the regulator. For DUT with a 22 pF feed back capacitor the current regulation is the same as above except that the + 8 V rail is current regulated to 43 rnA. The power rails are supplied to the DUT via a 10 {Omega} <b>resistor.</b> The voltage <b>drop</b> across this <b>resistor</b> is sensed by a differential amplifier AD 620 and amplified by a gain of 10. An external BNC connection is provided from this point to allow for current measurements by the vendor. The current value for each rail is calculated by measuring the voltage value at this point and divided by (10 * 10 {Omega}). The next stage inverts and amplifies the voltage signal by a factor of 5 for + 12 V and - 6 V rails and by a factor of 1 for + 8 V rail. For DUT with 22 pF feed back capacitor the amplification factors are same as above except that the amplification factor for + 8 V rail is a gain of 2. An offset null potentiometer is provided between the AD 620 and the inverting stage which eliminates device offset current errors. The inverted and amplified voltage is presented to two window comparators. One of them compares the inverted and amplified voltage to the low threshold point and the other one compares the inverted and amplified voltage to the high threshold point. If the inverted and amplified voltage is within the low and high threshold points, both the low and the high current LEDs illuminate green indicating the current is within acceptable limits. If the inverted and amplified voltage is below the low threshold point or above the high threshold point, the low current LED or the high current LED illuminates red, respectively, indicating the current is outside acceptable limits...|$|R
