40|$|Prior work {{suggests}} that {{the potential benefits of}} mixed <b>initiative</b> <b>management</b> of multiple robots are mitigated by situational factors, including workload and operator expertise. In this paper, we present an experiment where allowing a supervisor and group of searchers to jointly decide the correct level of autonomy for a given situation (“mixed initiative”) results in better overall performance than giving an agent exclusive control over their level of autonomy (“adaptive autonomy”) or giving a supervisor exclusive control over the agent’s level of autonomy (“adjustable autonomy”), regardless of the supervisor’s expertise or workload. In light of prior work, we identify two elements of our experiment that appear to be requirements for effective mixed initiative control of large-scale robotic teams: (a) Agents must be capable of making progress toward a goal without having to wait for human input in most circumstances. (b) The operator control interface must help the human to rapidly understand and modify the progress and intent of several agents...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- The lynx (L y u 1 yri. v) {{had been}} {{eradicated}} in the German Alps {{by the middle}} of the 19 th century. Since the early 1970 s thcre have been several attempts to initiate the re-introduction of lynx into the German Alps. but none of the projects could be carried out because of the still very con-troversial attitudes towards the species, and because of competition between institutions. Natural re-colonization of the German Alps by lynx can be expected sooner or later from Switzerland or Aus-tria. Although lynx are already present in some parts of Germany outside the Alps, neithcr an orga-nized monitoring system nor compensation regulations for losses of livestock exist. For a successful comeback of lynx into Germany, including the German Alps, more efforts than a year-round protec-tion by the federal hunting law i b needed. <b>Initiative</b> <b>management</b> actions and intensive public cduca-tion are necessary to obtain and secure public acceptance of the lynx.

Using {{the concept of}} “Net Benefits ” as our dependent variable we describe and explain why a KMS-enabled knowledge sharing initiative worked in some plants and failed in some other plants of the same firm. The study {{is divided into two}} parts. The first is quantitative and aims to outline, 1) whether knowledge sharing has occurred, 2) the effects of knowledge sharing on cost items and price, and 3) the effects on profit. The statistical findings imply that the following phases must be accomplished, 1) knowledge sharing through the use of the KMS, 2) managing the conversion of knowledge, and 3) improving profit margins. Using a qualitative case study we derived analytically eight factors, associated with different phases, appearing to distinguish between success and failure in sharing knowledge and converting it into financial performance: 1) the local perception of the sharing initiative, 2) aspiration and strategic ambitions, 3) the view on internal competition, 4) the view {{on the nature of the}} knowledge shared, 5) <b>initiative</b> <b>management</b> and control, 6) local communication, 7) the ability to manage the strategic implications of learning, and 8) corporate control mechanisms...|$|E

The Omidyar Fellows Program's {{theory of}} change envisioned the {{creation}} of a community of leaders through which innovative and adaptive interventions are implemented in dynamic, interconnected island environments, and transform the State of Hawaiʻi. Pre-developmental or formative evaluation activities provided feedback on this system change initiative to enable adaptation and change. Evaluation data in two major groups, program and cohort impact, were collected and analyzed {{over the course of the}} 15 -month program and six month post program periods. Consistent with the developmental evaluation approach, the evaluator took on the perspective, lens and context of an "insider" despite Fellow perceptions as a 3 rd party. Two primarily utilitarian work products were produced: (a) a formative evaluation of the program near term impacts on Cohort I, including analyses of program design elements and activities and impacts of such program design on Cohort I; and (b) a program formative evaluation framework in which subsequent program, including cohort, data can be collected and analyzed for short (by cohort), mid (three to five years) and long term (five plus years) developmental evaluative learning and adaptation.

40|$|Metso One Factory <b>Initiative</b> <b>management</b> made a {{decision}} to implement lean into its processes in order to eliminate waste, reduce lead times and manage all value streams in a more efficient way. In this thesis the initial stages of a lean transformation including pilot projects and lean tools research in Metso One Factory were studied and documented. Lean tools were researched using many literary sources and their suitability for Metso’s purposes was evaluated. Suitable tools were collected into One Factory Lean Toolbox including a summary of the tool’s theory and for some tools a template ready to use in practice. Two product groups in need of improvement were selected as pilot projects by upper management and their purpose was to become proof of concept in the lean transformation. It was found that not all lean tools are suitable for a global One Factory Lean Toolbox because some may be too specific for One Factory’s purposes. With the help of a toolbox the selected lean tools are available for all One Factory staff in an easy-to-understand form. The lean pilot projects revealed many interesting problems and bottlenecks in the process. When these problems were discovered solutions could be drafted and a better flow to the process was achieved. They lead to many big improvements in the order-to-delivery process of the two selected product groups. The project team managed to shorten the lead times, cut the costs, and lower the inventory value. While this thesis was finalized the two factories still have ongoing improvement projects related to the pilots...|$|E

40|$|Provision of a {{comprehensive}} annual reports fromnon-profit organizations (NPOs) is crucial {{in order to enhance}} credibility, build community trust and demonstrate their responsiveness towards stakeholders. Existed for the benefit of public as the principal objective, NPOs highly depend on the external environment to ensure sustainability of operations. However, since NPOs are subjected to minimum regulatory requirement, this situation triggers some major problems which reduce NPOs value and reputation. Hence, the objective {{of this study is to}} examine the relationship between social enterprise <b>initiative,</b> <b>management</b> commitment and financial vulnerability with the level of information disclosed in the annual report of NPOs in Malaysia. Content analysis was employed as a method to assess the annual reports of 205 NPOs registered with Registrar of Societies (ROS) in Malaysia for the financial year 2011. Findings of this study revealed that the total disclosures among sample NPOs was weak especially the disclosures in Balance Sheet (BS) and Statement of Financial Activities (SOFA). Within the three major component of total disclosures, NPOs disclosed a relatively high nonfinancial information as compared to the financial information. With regards to the independent variables tested, the study found that social enterprise initiatives and management commitment are significantly associated with the level of information disclosed in annual report. In adverse, financial vulnerability was found insignificant to the overall disclosures. Of relevance, statistical analysis also revealed that most of the NPOs in Malaysia were in financially vulnerable condition. In addition, commitment anticipated from the non-profitmanagers are quite low among the sample NPOs. Overall, the findings provide a useful information to regulators to continuously improve the nonprofit sector through developing more comprehensive framework and practices in assisting preparation and presentation of NPOs annual reports...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{when the}} Private Finance Initiative was {{developed}} {{as the primary}} method for delivering major public capital projects, there has been concern {{about the quality of}} many of the products. Initially, it was the architectural community that raised doubts, but it has subsequently been joined by user groups. As the contractual period is over 30 years, there are issues such as ongoing maintenance, facilities management and operational factors, that need to be balanced with design quality. This paper will report on a research project being carried out with a metropolitan local authority in England, which is replacing its entire sheltered housing stock in one Private Finance Initiative project. The principal aim of the local authority is that it should receive these buildings as assets, rather than liabilities {{at the end of the}} 30 year period. The research work to date has been based on two stages of a three stage selection of the preferred bidder from the original six consortia. The aims of this paper are to review the Private Finance <b>Initiative</b> <b>management</b> processes in relation to architectural design quality at each of the selection stages, including the generation and application of the design assessment criteria, and the role of user groups; and evaluate the outcomes against the objectives of maximising design quality within workable financial models. The methodology is that the researcher is based in the local authority project team, and has therefore been able to use participant observation techniques in the management processes, which include competitive dialogue and user consultation. The design assessment criteria were developed from the academic literature and refined at each selection stage. A comparative analysis of the design assessment criteria with intermediate and final designs, will assist in identifying the status of design quality in the selection of the preferred bidder...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1980 ’s  Swedish {{county council}} {{managers}} has been preoccupied with planning and implementing organisational change in order to alleviate the financial problems and to create more efficient production systems.  Many of these efforts to change have implied changing the systems for management accounting and control, changes that have been inspired both by market-oriented ideologies and by the governance principles of large corporations in the private sector. Literature on manage­ment accounting and control indicates however, that management is unintentionally contributing to the creation of organisational inertia and conservatism. This contradiction is formulated as a change dilemma; ”How can managerial principles that make organizations subject to  bureaucratization and inertia be used as important strategies for organizational change?” The purpose of the study is thus to analyze the use of management control systems as organizational change strategies in health care, employing a change perspective on management control. When used as a change strategy,  management accounting and control becomes manifest as management control initiatives. Actors handle these control inititatives by organising themselves around the issue at hand. This organising process ends or fades away when there are no need for further attention to the control initiative. Empirical studies were made in the councils of Västerbotten, Sörmland and Upp­sala counties. Management control initiatives investigated were performance-related pay, quality improvement work, systematic planning procedures, provider/purchaser-models, downsizing projects and profit center systems. The systems for management accounting and control appeared to structure health care organisations in terms of spatial structuring temporal structuring and actor categorization. The management control initiatives introduced were structured as extraordinary organising processes delimited in terms of space, time and involved actors. Actors in the administrative norm system participated with the intention to change the organisation, while those in the medical norm system aimed at just handling the <b>initiative.</b> <b>Management</b> control initiatives can therefore be seen as passing opportunities to change, passing {{in the sense that the}} organising processes are temporary by nature, opportunities in the sense that temporary re-coupling can be used to  achieve long-term change.  One such opportunity is the formulation of control initiatives; the possibility of using simple and standardized change strategies can be useful, but only if they are also linked to the medical norm system. A second opportunity is the temporary organising processes; if the project form of organising change can also be conveyed to the medical norm system, management control initiatives could result in short, intense courses of events that actually change things. The third opportunity  s the recurrent  cyc ica  pro­ perties  of  management  accounting  and control  systems, enabling  recurrent  activities around the same themes, thereby keeping them alive.
