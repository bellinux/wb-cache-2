5|$|The Quraysh {{veterans}} grew {{impatient with}} the deadlock. A group of militants led by ‘Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd (who {{was thought to be}} equal to a thousand men in fighting) and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl attempted to thrust through the trench and managed to effect a crossing, occupying a marshy area near the hillock of Sala. 'Amr challenged the Muslims to a duel. In response, Ali ibn Abi Talib accepted the challenge, and was sent by Muhammad to fight. Both the fighters <b>got</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dust as the duel became intense. Finally, the soldiers heard scream(s) which hinted decisive blows, but it was unclear which of the two was successful. The slogan, 'Allahu Akbar' (God is the greatest) from the dust confirmed Ali's victory. The confederates were forced to withdraw in a state of panic and confusion. Although the Confederates lost only three men during the encounter, they failed to accomplish anything important.|$|E

In the {{three weeks of}} uncertainty before the government was formed, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Giolitti’s ban {{on the use of}} firearms. In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army. Government building were burned as well as flour mills and bakeries that refused to lower their prices when taxes were lowered or abolished. Eleven people were killed on December 10, 1893, in Giardinello after a rally that asked for the abolition of taxes on food and disbandment of the local field guards (guardie campestri). The protestors carried the portrait of the King taken from the municipality and burned tax files. On December 17, 1893, many people were wounded when troops fired on a manifestation in Monreale. Another 11 protestors were killed in Lercara Friddi on December 25. On January 1, 1894, 20 people were killed and many wounded in Gibellina and Pietraperzia. On January 2, there two dead in Belmonte Mezzagno and the next day 18 dead and many wounded in Marineo. Two days after, on January 5, thirteen dead and many wounded closed the series in Santa Caterina.|$|E

5|$|Having blocked Jourdan, Archduke Charles {{began moving}} troops south {{to oppose the}} Army of Rhin-et-Moselle as early as 21 June. He {{received}} the news that Moreau was across the Rhine on the 26th. Leaving 25,351 foot and 10,933 horse under Wartensleben and 27,000 more around Mainz, the archduke raced south. The last units of the Moreau's army made it across the Rhine on 29 June, though Delaborde remained guarding {{the west bank of}} the Rhine for a time. For a few days the French enjoyed a numerical superiority of 30,000 to 18,000 over their opponents. Moreau then made the remarkable decision to switch the positions of two of his wings; Desaix now led the Left Wing while Saint-Cyr commanded the Center. He also reorganized his army, reassigning some regiments that <b>got</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> confusion of the river crossing. Army of Rhin-et-Moselle expanded its bridgehead in a semicircle. Desaix moved downstream (north), Ferino moved upstream (south) and Saint-Cyr operated in the hills, ready to support either wing. The French irruption caused Fröhlich and Condé to retreat up the Rhine and Kinzig Rivers while Sztáray and the Swabians fell back to Freudenstadt.|$|E
5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason {{trying to find out}} which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed to be set as the team <b>got</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and barely made it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E

25|$|Nunes also {{solved the}} problem of finding the day with the {{shortest}} twilight duration, for any given position, and its duration.

They could find {{a solution to the problem}} of the shortest day, but failed to determine its duration, possibly because they <b>got</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> details of differential calculus which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using differential calculus.|$|E

On the left, the 3rd Division attacked Guillemont Station, Delville Wood and Longueval, with the 8th Brigade on the right attempting to occupy ground south of the railway. The troops of the 8th Brigade were held up, then fell back to Waterlot Farm, repulsing a German counter-attack later in the morning. Further north, a battalion also tried to bomb down trenches from Waterlot Farm, either side of the Guillemont road and the railway, to the station. The advance was soon stopped by machine-gun fire from Ginchy and the ground to the north-east, forcing the troops to withdraw; the 9th Brigade attacked Delville Wood and Longueval as part of the Battle of Delville Wood.|$|E
