5|$|After {{intercontinental}} compatibility tests, Petersen and Bermudes {{suggested that}} bioluminescence and compatibility were independent since bioluminescence {{seemed to be}} <b>geographically</b> restricted. This suggested that the ability or potential to interbreed must have been preserved since separation of P.stypticus into <b>geographically</b> isolated areas.|$|E
5|$|G. Geopolitically part of Europe, but <b>geographically</b> part of Asia.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen are {{the only}} senior team in the third largest city in Scotland, a city which is {{relatively}} remote, <b>geographically,</b> from other large population centres, {{and as a result}} have a large catchment area of potential supporters. The average attendance in the 2015–16 Scottish Premiership is currently 13,530.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the old and}} new bridges are <b>geographically</b> {{mostly in}} Arkansas, as the state lines were {{determined}} prior to the shift west of the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|Chromium is mined as {{chromite}} (FeCr2O4) ore. About two-fifths of the chromite ores and concentrates in {{the world}} are produced in South Africa, while Kazakhstan, India, Russia, and Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped chromite deposits are plentiful, but <b>geographically</b> concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geographically</b> the {{majority}} of the stations are located in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Rajasthan has successfully been attempting to attract solar development. Rajasthan and Gujarat share the Thar Desert, along with Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geographically,</b> {{churches are}} {{organized}} into conferences led by conference superintendents. In their spiritual roles, superintendents function as bishops, {{and in their}} administrative roles they act as chief executive officers of their conference. All conference leaders are elected by their local conference but are accountable to the General Superintendent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geographically,</b> the Magyar invasions {{interfered}} with the previously highly influential contacts between Central Europe and centers of Byzantine Christianity. It {{may have been the}} decisive factor that steered Poland toward the Western (Latin) branch of Christianity by the time of its adoption in 966.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in Albania and Serbia respectively. These regions are also considered <b>geographically</b> part of Macedonia. They are referred to by ethnic Macedonians as follows, but typically are not so referred to by non-partisan scholars.|$|E
5|$|Over the ages, the <b>geographically</b> {{important}} {{town has}} been the site of many conflicts, particularly between the English and Welsh. The Angles, under King Offa of Mercia, took possession in 778.|$|E
5|$|Texas's {{population}} density is 90.5people per squaremile which is {{slightly higher than}} the average {{population density}} of the U.S. as a whole, at 80.6people per squaremile. In contrast, while Texas and France are similarly sized <b>geographically,</b> the European country has a population density of 301.8 people per square mile.|$|E
5|$|The Armenian dialect {{spoken in}} Jerusalem is highly distinctive, {{because it was}} <b>geographically</b> {{relatively}} isolated {{from the rest of}} the Armenian-speaking world, and Arabic has a significant influence on it. Those Armenians whose ancestors came from Turkey following the 1915 genocide speak Turkish-influenced Western Armenian.|$|E
5|$|The {{business}} is further divided <b>geographically</b> with separate businesses {{focused on the}} U.S. and other international markets. Two-thirds of the total invested assets come from Europe and Switzerland with the final one-third coming mainly from the Asia-Pacific region.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} Macedonia is {{commonly}} split <b>geographically</b> into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the Macedonian Question. The terms {{are used in}} non-partisan scholarly works, although they are also used in ethnic Macedonian literature of an irredentist nature.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 20 subspecies, but the precise number is disputed. These taxa {{can be divided into}} three main groups; these may have been <b>geographically</b> {{isolated}} from each other until relatively recently. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the group ranges overlap.|$|E

5|$|A Corded Ware culture princely burial {{was found}} in Szczytna, Subcarpathian Voivodeship. The grave, well-secured three meters below the surface, {{contained}} a man's skeleton and a funerary gift collection of highly valuable copper decorations, containers, stone tools and arrowheads. The uniquely equipped burial of a warrior-chief has close analogies with finds from Transylvania, a testimony to <b>geographically</b> extensive contacts of Corded Ware culture nomadic people.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are <b>geographically</b> close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are <b>geographically</b> close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen {{have rarely}} {{played in the}} same {{division}} as their <b>geographically</b> closest rivals: Peterhead, Brechin City, Montrose, Arbroath, Elgin City, and Forfar Athletic, so rivalries have tended to come from further afield. Currently, Aberdeen have a minor rivalry with Inverness Caley Thistle, {{due to the fact}} both Aberdeen and Inverness are the two largest settlements in the north of Scotland. This is known as the North derby and has arisen since Inverness were first promoted to the SPL in 2004.|$|E
5|$|After {{accepting}} {{the position of}} premier, Rutherford selected a <b>geographically</b> diverse cabinet on September 6: Edmonton's Charles Wilson Cross as Attorney-General, Calgary's William Henry Cushing as Minister of Public Works, Medicine Hat's William Finlay as Minister of Agriculture and Provincial Secretary, and Lethbridge's George DeVeber as Minister without Portfolio. Rutherford kept for himself the positions of Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Education.|$|E
5|$|All former {{republics of}} the Soviet Union, which were <b>geographically</b> {{situated}} in Europe, would later compete in the contest on their own in the 1990s and 2000s: Russia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, except Kazakhstan, with four of the countries going on to win one of the contests: Estonia, Latvia, Russia, and Azerbaijan. Ukraine was the first ex-USSR country to win twice.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} <b>geographically</b> diverse states, Oklahoma {{is one of}} four to harbor more than 10 {{distinct}} ecological regions, with 11 in its borders – more per square mile than in any other state. Its western and eastern halves, however, are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity: Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half contains three. Although having fewer ecological regions Western Oklahoma contains many rare, relic species.|$|E
5|$|Area {{commands}} {{were the}} major operational and administrative formations of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) between 1940 and 1954. Established {{in response to}} the outbreak of World WarII, they underpinned the Air Force's <b>geographically</b> based command-and-control system {{for the duration of the}} conflict and into the early years of the Cold War, until being superseded by a functional control system made up of Home, Training, and Maintenance Commands.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} RAAF's {{reorganisation}} from a <b>geographically</b> based command-and-control {{system to}} one based on function, No.4 Maintenance Group was superseded by Maintenance Command on 1October 1953. In September 1959, No.1 AD came {{under the control of}} Support Command, formed when Maintenance Command was amalgamated with Training Command. Between June 1950 and October 1960, No.1 AD maintained a detachment at RAAF Station Tocumwal, New South Wales, to store obsolete aircraft awaiting disposal.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} most {{informative}} sequence of dinosaur-bearing {{rocks in the}} world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana. This formation, when compared with the older (approximately 75Ma) Judith River/Dinosaur Park Formations (from Montana and Alberta respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil beds are <b>geographically</b> limited, covering only part of one continent.|$|E
5|$|Bedfordshire is {{a county}} in the East of England. It is bounded by Hertfordshire to the south-east, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Northamptonshire to the north, and Buckinghamshire to the west. It has an area of , and a {{population}} estimated in 2016 at 640,000, with an increase of 11% over the previous ten years. <b>Geographically,</b> it is mainly rural, but still the fourteenth most densely populated county of England, with over half the population living in the two largest built-up areas, Luton and Bedford.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham fans {{consider}} their main rivals to be Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours <b>geographically,</b> {{with whom they}} contest the Second City derby. Lesser rivalries exist with fellow West Midlands clubs Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion. According to a 2003 Football Fans Census survey, Aston Villa fans thought of Birmingham City as their main rivals, though this was not always the case.|$|E
5|$|British dishes include {{fish and}} chips, the Sunday roast, and bangers and mash. British cuisine has several {{national}} and regional varieties, including English, Scottish and Welsh cuisine, {{each of which has}} developed its own regional or local dishes, many of which are <b>geographically</b> indicated foods such as Cheddar cheese, Cheshire cheese, the Yorkshire pudding, Arbroath Smokie, Cornish pasty and Welsh cakes.|$|E
5|$|Coal balls {{were first}} found in England, {{and later in}} other parts of the world, {{including}} Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, the former Czechoslovakia, Germany, Ukraine, China, and Spain. They were also encountered in North America, where they are <b>geographically</b> widespread compared to Europe; in the United States, coal balls have been found from Kansas to the Illinois Basin to the Appalachian region.|$|E
5|$|Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue {{has eight}} tracks and four island platforms, with trains {{entering}} from both compass north and south. It {{is located at}} the corner of Stillwell and Surf Avenues in Coney Island, the site of the former West End Terminal. <b>Geographically,</b> the station is the southernmost terminal in the New York City Subway system.|$|E
5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not <b>geographically</b> accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more <b>geographically</b> inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geographically,</b> Protestantism is {{concentrated}} in the northern, central and eastern parts of the country. These are mostly members of the EKD, which encompasses Lutheran, Reformed and administrative or confessional unions of both traditions {{dating back to the}} Prussian Union of 1817. Roman Catholicism {{is concentrated}} in the south and west.|$|E
5|$|Hyacinthoides non-scripta forms a clade {{with three}} other species – H.hispanica, H.paivae and H.cedretorum – centred on the Iberian Peninsula. H.paivae is {{restricted}} to a small area of north-western Iberia (Galicia and neighbouring parts of Portugal), while H.cedretorum is found in mountainous areas of western North Africa (Morocco and Algeria). Within Iberia, H.non-scripta and H.hispanica are <b>geographically</b> separated by the Duero river. The genus also contains seven further species, mostly distributed further east in the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Tycho Brahe {{demonstrated}} that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere {{by measuring the}} parallax of the Great Comet of 1577 from observations collected by <b>geographically</b> separated observers. Within the precision of the measurements, this implied the comet {{must be at least}} four times more distant than from the Earth to the Moon.|$|E
5|$|John Day Fossil Beds National Monument is a U.S. National Monument in Wheeler and Grant {{counties}} in east-central Oregon. Located within the John Day River basin and {{managed by the}} National Park Service, the park {{is known for its}} well-preserved layers of fossil plants and mammals that lived in the region between the late Eocene, about 45million years ago, and the late Miocene, about 5million years ago. The monument consists of three <b>geographically</b> separate units: Sheep Rock, Painted Hills, and Clarno.|$|E
