In May 2014, the library hosted a tour for journalists and officials from all levels of government. Halifax mayor Mike Savage stated that the new library is [...] "not simply something that’s nice to have. It is important and critical {{to the future of}} our city.

500|$|During the action, Tiger {{was hit by}} six German shells, {{the most}} {{significant}} {{of which was a}} [...] shell that burst on the roof of 'Q' turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun's breech mechanism and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. Tigers repairs were completed on 8 February. Like the rest of the battlecruisers, Tigers own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 [...] shells fired, scoring one hit each on Seydlitz and [...] Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy: Lord Fisher criticised Pelly's performance, calling him a [...] "" [...] and adding [...] "The Tigers gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to {{have had a lot of}} practice.". In a memorandum of 11 February 1915 Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through Tigers part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: [...] "In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and I am quite ready to make the fullest allowance for them. My chief aim is to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> next action shall be a complete success." [...] The ship was given a refit in December 1915.|$|E
500|$|In October 1960 a preparatory Commission for the {{upcoming}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties scheduled for November that year was held from October 121, with the Albanian delegation being led by Hysni Kapo and Ramiz Alia. Alia later recalled that [...] "the aim of the Soviets was to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> Party did not come out against their party and Khrushchev, did not bring the fight out in the open, and speak about Bucharest and the contradictions which existed. To this end, they created around our delegation a harsh and dangerous atmosphere, in which open threats were combined with cunning flattery." [...] Hoxha once again communicated via radiogram, writing to Kapo on October 13 that, [...] "We are not of the same opinion as those {{who are trying to}} smooth out the problems by means of phrases in resolutions or declarations... We are for carrying the matter through to the end. If this is not understood, it means that the danger which the Khrushchev group represents for the world communist movement is not understood. It does not depend on us whether this group should continue in power or not, but it is essential that we, should expose this group with Khrushchev at the head, as they deserve... we shall not allow ourselves to be impressed by those who say: 'How can one attack the glorious Soviet Union or the great Communist Party of Lenin for the faults of a few rascals?' We say: Precisely to defend the Soviet Union and the Party of Lenin, these 'rascals' must be exposed, and there must be no toning down of criticism or covering up of the deviationists." ...|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, Indigenous {{feminism}} is set {{apart from other}} Indigenous rights movements, such as Indigenous liberation theory, because those theories have [...] "not been attentive to the gendered ways in which colonial oppression and racism function for men and women, or to the inherent and adopted sexisms that some communities manifest." [...] There are some within Indigenous communities who choose not to identify as feminist and therefore {{distance themselves from the}} mainstream feminism. There are many reasons for this choice, however, Kim Anderson argues that ifWestern {{feminism is}} unpalatable because it is about rights rather than responsibilities, then we should all take responsibility seriously and ask if we are being responsible to all members of our societies. If we are to reject equality in favour of difference, then {{we need to make sure}} those differences are embedded in systems that empower all members. If we see feminism as being too invested in Western liberalism and individual autonomy, then we need to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> collectivist approaches serve everyone in the collective. And if we want to embrace essential elements of womanhood that have been problematic for Western feminists [...] then we have to ensure that these concepts don't get stuck in literal or patriarchal interpretations.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after his}} death, his grave became a shrine. One teenaged girl in North Belfast {{set up a}} shrine to Wright in her bedroom {{complete}} with his photographs.

Gunmen at a paramilitary display in Portadown in 2000 told journalists: [...] "He [...] did {{what he had to do}} to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> faith and culture were kept intact." [...] Wright was also taken up as an inspiration by Johnny Adair and the UDA West Belfast Brigade. In the immediate aftermath of Wright's killing Adair told his main gunmen Stephen McKeag and Gary Smyth that they had a free hand to [...] "avenge" [...] Wright's death, with McKeag almost immediately launching a machine gun attack on a bar in a mainly Catholic area despite the UDA being officially on ceasefire. The West Belfast Brigade would later reference Wright as a true loyalist who had been a victim of the UVF in a leaflet circulated to foment a feud between the UDA and the UVF. Despite this the two men had had a fractured relationship during Wright's life and according to Adair's sometime girlfriend Jackie [...] "Legs" [...] Robinson, Adair had told her that Wright was a [...] "bastard" [...] when the UVF leader attended a party at Robinson's house. Robinson wrote the incident off as jealousy on Adair's part as Wright was already well established as a leading figure in loyalism by that stage whilst Adair was still making his name.|$|E

These documents I threw to Zambo in the evening, and also my purse, which contained three English sovereigns.
