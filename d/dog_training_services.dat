40|$|In 2012, {{there were}} almost 70 million dogs in America, which {{resulted}} {{in an increase in}} demand for pet <b>services,</b> including <b>dog</b> <b>training</b> (American Veterinary Medical Association, 2012). Based on statistics from the U. S. Pet Market Outlook 2013 - 2014, consumer spending for non-medical pet services will exceed $ 20 billion, growing at about 6. 0 % annually (Packaged Facts, 2013). Dog sports such as agility have become increasingly popular, which has increased the demand for <b>dog</b> <b>training</b> facilities and instructors that offer sports training classes in addition to traditional obedience classes (Kalter & Sprung, 2013).

By conducting industry and regional analyses that focus on the local consumer demands, how their needs are currently being met, and what the potential market is, a business model can be developed for the use of entrepreneurs in this niche service market. To help determine the market for <b>dog</b> <b>training,</b> a confidential survey was distributed to dog owners in Raleigh, North Carolina with questions focusing on five main topics: participant demographics, <b>dog</b> demographics, prior <b>training,</b> desired future training, and limitations. By having a better understanding of the market needs in the area, entrepreneurs can develop their business services around the customer demands and limitations and increase their likeliness of success...|$|R

With seed {{money from the}} Medfield Lions Club, {{students}} in the Animal Care Program determined that hearing <b>dogs</b> could be <b>trained</b> to become [...] "ears" [...] {{for people who are}} deaf or hearing impaired. In 1987, after training over 400 hearing dog [...] "teams," [...] The Hearing Ear Dog Program expanded to <b>train</b> <b>service</b> <b>dogs</b> to become the [...] "arms and/or legs" [...] for people with physical disabilities. In 1989, to reflect these new services, The Hearing Ear Dog Program changed its name to New England Assistance Dog Services (NEADS). NEADS began the Prison PUPs Partnership in 1998, in which prison inmates foster and <b>train</b> <b>service</b> <b>dog</b> puppies for one to two years. In 2000, NEADS expanded its services to include the training of social facilitated therapy <b>dogs</b> <b>trained</b> to assist children living with autism.

Attack <b>dogs</b> are <b>trained</b> to interpret a situation and react accordingly. In formal <b>training,</b> the <b>dogs</b> are exposed to gunfire, traffic and other distractions to increase their effectiveness. Attack training is condemned by some as promoting ferocity in dogs; a 1975 American study showed that 10% of dogs that have bitten a person received attack <b>dog</b> <b>training</b> at some point. <b>Dogs</b> <b>trained</b> for military use as attack dogs, most often called patrol <b>dogs,</b> can be <b>trained</b> to perform explosives detection as well.

In my thesis I have described the basic <b>dog</b> <b>training</b> and another training focused to special activities as the searching of explosive materials and mines is. I did not describe the all dogs basic exercises which the dog must handle safely because this theme is very extensive but only such excercise which I consider as important for explosive materials searching in practises.
