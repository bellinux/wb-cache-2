The chemical kinetics of three main reactions that take place when a <b>gypsum</b> <b>board</b> is exposed at elevated temperatures: evaporation of free moisture content, dehydration of chemically bound water and crystal mesh reorganization were investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry measurements under non isothermal conditions and in an inert atmosphere.
