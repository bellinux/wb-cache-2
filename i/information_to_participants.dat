40|$|Strong recent {{focus on}} {{unconscious}} processes has {{increased interest in}} subliminal stimulation and similar experimental technologies. Assumptions about the persistence of effects of unconscious stimulation are generally conservative, referring to seconds or minutes (Silverman, 1977; Velmans, 1991). In Study I, five experiments (N = 365) showed complex effects of unconscious stimulation ten days after subliminal exposure, implying that persistence estimates need reevaluation. Experimental stimuli were "mommy and I are one" (MIO) and "mommy and I are dissimilar" (MIDIS), and neutral control stimuli. Effects consisted of higher correlations between measures pertaining to the self-mother relationship and measures of psychological adjustment. These ethically problematic findings prompted investigation in Study II of whether debriefing <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>participants</b> could prevent persistent effects of subliminal stimuli, an issue not previously investigated. Two experiments (N= 188) tested two kinds of <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>participants</b> following subliminal MIDIS or control stimulation. Results showed different persistent effects depending on participant sex. Simple information about the stimulus was effective in preventing these, but elaborate information describing the effects and mechanisms for them was not. The findings have implications for ethical recommendations for subliminal research, and suggest that this unexplored area requires more attention. In Study III, a theoretical account for the persistent effects is presented, based on unconscious activation of a relational schema containing goal motivation. Unless the goal is fulfilled or activation dissipates due to attributability or irrelevance of the goal, the activation will be maintained (motivated maintenance). Being unconscious, the influence results in automatic schematic processing of environmental cues, including perceptual, judgment, and behavioral biases. These in turn interactively maintain the activation of the schema (interactive maintenance). The discussion includes the conclusion that previous estimates of the persistence of unconscious stimulation effects need revision. Theoretical and empirical questions concerning the studies are discussed and ethical research implications are considered...|$|E

40|$|Like other markets, {{the plea}} {{bargaining}} market uses a pricing mechanism to coordinate market functions and to communicate critical <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>participants,</b> information that permits rational decisionmaking {{in the face}} of uncertainty. Because plea bargaining plays such a prominent role in the administration of criminal justice, and because the pricing mechanisms inherent in plea bargaining can - like pricing mechanisms generally - both explain past conduct by market participants and predict future conduct, close scrutiny of the pricing mechanisms at work in plea bargaining is amply justified. This Article explores several features of the plea bargaining system in light of economic insights borrowed from basic price theory. That analysis suggests several structural flaws of the plea market that could, in theory, be amenable to reform efforts. Those flaws include an oversupply of penal leniency, overreliance on wholesale pricing mechanisms, and a devaluation of factual innocence resulting from procedural time-constraints on the effective use of exculpatory evidence...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Security of routing {{protocols}} {{is a critical}} issue, {{as shown by the}} increasing number of attacks on the Internet’s routing infrastructure. One often overlooked aspect of security is privacy. In the context of a routing protocol we mean the ability of a router to keep information such as its routing policies private. BGP does this to some extent through design. An Autonomous System’s policies are not explicitly revealed to other participants in the routing protocol. Nevertheless, BGP still reveals {{a great deal of information}} about the Internet and its participants. We propose a privacy-preserving routing protocol called STRIP that reveals very little <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>participants</b> in the protocol. For instance, participants can find shortest-paths to destinations in the network without ever learning the path lengths. Such privacy could be useful for a range of reasons: preserving the proprietary information captured in a routing policy, or preventing an attacker from gaining valuable information about the network. We show the feasibility, performance, and costs of STRIP with simulations and implementations of the protocol. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: eConsultations {{constitute}} {{an effective means}} to inclusive and informed participation of citizens and society in policy, decision and law formation processes, and {{an answer to the}} democratic deficit. eConsultation platforms need to support all stages of consultation processes including agenda setting and topics raising, legislation proposal publicity, notification of developments, proposal debate and commentary, collection, analysis and synthesis of views. In this paper we present the design of an open platform assisting policy makers and the civil society in the set-up, enactment, management and federation of inclusive and informed consultations. The proposed platform employs semantic techniques, such as semantics, content annotation and summarization to support the consultation processes and provide targeted and digested <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>participants,</b> and facilitates tailoring of eConsultation procedures by offering basic eConsultation activities as building blocks, which can be combined according to contextual needs.

40|$|A multi-secret sharing {{scheme is}} a {{protocol}} to share {{more than one}} secret among a set of participants, where each secret may have a distinct family of subsets of participants (also called ‘access structure’) that are qualified to recover it. In this paper we use an information-theoretic approach to analyze two different models for multi-secret sharing schemes. The proposed models generalize specific models which have already been considered in the literature. We first analyze {{the relationships between the}} security properties of the two models. Afterwards, we show that the security property of a multi-secret sharing scheme does not depend on the particular probability distribution on the sets of secrets. This extends the analogous result for the case of single-secret sharing schemes and implies that the bounds {{on the size of the}} <b>information</b> distributed <b>to</b> <b>participants</b> in multi-secret sharing schemes can all be strengthened. For each of the two models considered in this paper, we show lower bounds on the size of the shares distributed <b>to</b> <b>participants.</b> Specifically, for the general case in which the secrets are shared according to a tuple of arbitrary (and possibly different) access structures, we show a combinatorial condition on these structures that is sufficient <b>to</b> require a <b>participant</b> <b>to</b> hold <b>information</b> of size larger than a certain subset of secrets.
