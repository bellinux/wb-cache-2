25|$|It {{was through}} his musical {{interests}} that White met his future wife, Jane Felix (1869-1943), sometime in 1891-92. She was a schoolteacher, and his diaries contain notes about his taking her on dates to concerts in at nearby Denison University and in Columbus, Ohio. White recorded no other love interests in his diaries, and on June 14, 1893 he married Felix in Newark at the unusual hour of 6 am. Family records offer {{no indication of}} why the ceremony was held at that time, but within an hour after they exchanged vows White and his bride boarded a train bound for Chicago where they attended the World's Columbian Exposition.

It was there that he first encountered photography as a public medium. Not only were there multiple very large exhibits showing photographers from around the world, there were many camera and darkroom equipment manufacturers displaying and selling their latest goods, dozens of portrait studios and even on-the-spot documentation of the Exposition itself.

This paper focuses on the experiences of faculty and the responses of students {{who took part in}} several <b>immersion</b> service-learning <b>courses</b> taught between 2005 and 2007 during the Winter term at Elon University in North Carolina. Four major themes were identified as being significant in these immersion service-learning courses: 1) sharing living space impacts the student-faculty relationship, 2) immersion faculty leaders are placed in multiple roles with multiple opportunities for role modeling, 3) immersion faculty experience their own transformative learning, which often further complicates their roles as leaders, and 4) immersion faculty leaders often experience role conflict in maintaining leadership roles and assessing student work in <b>immersion</b> <b>courses.</b> We conclude that while the role conflicts must be negotiated faculty modeling service behavior may have stronger lessons for students and their future civic engagement than other on-campus service learning <b>courses.</b> <b>Immersion</b> service-learning describes <b>courses</b> where students and faculty participate together in a service project {{for an extended period of}} time, workin...|$|R
