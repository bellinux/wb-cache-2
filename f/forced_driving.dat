5000|$|At {{first the}} model {{had a new}} petrol engine with 1395 cc and 29 kW (39 hp) at 3800 rpm to 1400 Fiat, and had a manual 4-speed transmission. A 1.5 ton truck was newly developed, which was offered from 1951 in a flatbed and chassis for special bodies. It was powered by the engine of the prior year {{featured}} Fiat 1400s. The engine {{was already in the}} car Fiat 1400 was just sufficient, and with the 3.1 tons it had real trouble. Once in motion, the Fiat 615 was indeed 80 km/hr fast, but with <b>forced</b> <b>driving</b> it had poor fuel efficiency. There was a reason that the 1100 Fiat ELR far built until 1954. The somewhat weaker beast of burden was, with its 1.1 liter and 28/30 PS (at 4400 rpm) a little lame, but it had fully loaded a ton to move less weight, so was more economical. It therefore retained its loyal following who forgave its manageable liveliness out of habit, especially as it came with start-up to a peak of over 90 km/hr and thus was significantly faster than the Fiat 615 with its maximum of 78 km/hr. With high pressure, therefore a suitable diesel engine was developed by Fiat: a swirl chamber engine (Ricardo System) based on the 1.9 liter engine for the [...] "big" [...] Fiat in 1900 and the new SUV Fiat Campagnola. (This engine was a hubvergrößerte variant of the 1400 engine.) The new diesel engine (type 305) was later also available in either sedan 1400 from 1952 in addition to the Fiat 615 N (N = Nafta = Diesel) and one year in Fiat Campagnola and Fiat. Although the experiment of the Fiat 615 built 1.9 L gasoline engine proved to be stronger and with faster drive spurt, confined themselves to the diesel, the Type 615 N. Only Steyr in Austria until 1958 offered the Fiat 615 as gasoline, as Steyr 260 with its own 50 hp 2 L gasoline engine from the car Steyr 2000. The Fiat 615 N was a very modern vehicle that in Italy, initially had no competition. The export ran well at the beginning, missing, or half-hearted development left the Fiat 615 N (and especially its successor) over the years become increasingly rare even in Italy. In Zastava in Yugoslavia, the Fiat 615 was built with a petrol engine under license. However, not as the beginning of the Fiat, with the 1.4 L 4-cylinder engine, but with the much stronger torque 1.9 liter engine (type 105) with 47 hp at 3500 RPM, as well as in the, also at Zastava built under license, Campagnola was used. It is unclear whether the successor (from about 1963, as Fiat 615 N1) only with the 1.9 liter petrol engine (such as 615 B) was built, with a diesel engine.|$|E

A multi-faceted {{introduction}} {{on current}} state and development trends of tumbler screening technology was proposed, which included that {{the origin and}} development of the tumbler screening machines, a comparison between tumbler screening machines and rotary vibration screens, the structure design and analysis, especially the screen mesh cleaning technology and specific machine applications. The status and development trends of tumbler screening machines in China and abroad especially in German were analyzed. The developing direction of future tumbler screening machines and the situation of Chinese businesses producing tumbler screening machines development were introduced. The Origin and Development Tumbler screening is a special form of screening machine among many other structures, and it is named after the rocking motion of its circular screen. Tumbler screening machines adopt mechanical eccentricity and offset angle <b>forced</b> <b>driving</b> mode. The entire cylindrical screen box makes rocking motion driven by the rocking shaft, and thus the machine belongs to mechanical rocking motion screens. The basic structure of the tumbler screening machines is developed in 1999 [1], the German inventor G. Kainz was granted the patent in Europe. Then, several technica...|$|E
40|$|Singapore has an age-based {{mandatory}} retirement {{policy for}} taxi drivers. In 2006, the upper age limit of mandatory retirement was raised from 70 to 73 years for healthy, older taxi drivers. Retirement from taxi driving in Singapore {{often results in}} simultaneous retirement from work and <b>forced</b> <b>driving</b> cessation due to limited private vehicle ownership. While both retirement from work and driving cessation {{have been found to}} have negative implications for health and wellbeing in Western countries, {{little is known about the}} effects of mandatory retirement and driving cessation for healthy professional drivers in an Asian context. This study aimed to explore the mandatory retirement experience of older Singaporean taxi drivers, aged 70 - 73 years. In-depth interviews were conducted within a descriptive phenomenological approach with 23 older Singaporean taxi drivers who were retired or retiring drivers. Findings showed the experience to be dominated by retirement from work issues rather than by driving cessation. Three themes described the experiences: 2 ̆ 7 stories of taxi driving 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 feeling lost in retirement 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 contradictions of growing old in Singapore 2 ̆ 7. Taxi driving was a valued role. Despite an expected retirement, most participants were not prepared for the retirement transition. They struggled with emotional adjustment, financial vulnerability, identity, reduction in life-space and meaningful activity participation. Participants felt under-valued despite having personal achievements and support from family and 2 ̆ 7 successful ageing 2 ̆ 7 policies. Work remained a preferred activity despite limited re-employment opportunities. The unique context of expected but forced retirement, financial need in a non-welfare system, high cultural value on work, and limited options for productive or meaningful activities and roles, predisposed this sub-group of older Singaporean men to be vulnerable retirees in terms of identity and wellbeing issues. Support for a stressful late-life transition is indicated for continued health and wellbeing. Copyrigh...|$|E

Themes shaping stakeholder responses to change were organisational history and tradition, institutional support and politics, and concerns for legitimacy of the organisation. Stakeholders also had homogenous and heterogeneous responses, based on self-interest, symbolic predispositions and sense of collective identity. A discussion situating the findings in the broader sport context is provided, as well as suggestions for future research and practice.

Transient analysis is performed in order to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the EMFA. The distribution of static magnetic flux is obtained using the finite element method (FEM). The governing electric and kinematical equations are solved using the time difference method (TDM). Fabrication and experiments were performed in order to prove the applicability of HGCB for overall class. In comparing the experiment with simulated data, it is confirmed that analysis of the dynamic characteristics of EMFA is appropriate for design.
