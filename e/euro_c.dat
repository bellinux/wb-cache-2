In planning future national health policy actions, inter – regional assessments play an important role. The {{purpose of the study}} was to analyze similarities and differences in premature mortality between Serbia, EURO A, EURO B, and <b>EURO</b> <b>C</b> regions in 2000. Methods Mortality and premature mortality patterns were analysed according to cause of death, by gender and seven age intervals. The study results are presented in relative (%) and absolute terms (age-specific and age-standardized death rates per 100, 000 population, and age-standardized rates of years of life lost – YLL per 1, 000). Direct standardization of rates was undertaken using the standard population of Europe. The inter-regional comparison was based on a calculation of differences in YLL structures and with a ratio of age-standardized YLL rates per 1, 000. A multivariate generalized linear model was used to explore mortality of Serbia and Europe sub-regions with ln age-specific death rates. The dissimilarity was achieved with a p ≤ 0. 05. Results According to the mortality pattern, Serbia was similar to EURO B, but with a lower average YLL per death case. YLL patterns indicated similarities between Serbia and EURO A, while SRR YLL had similarities between Serbia and EURO B. Compared to all Europe sub-regions, Serbia had a major excess of premature mortality in neoplasms and diabetes mellitus. Serbia had lost more years of life than EURO A due to cardiovascular, genitourinary diseases, and intentional injuries. Yet, Serbia was not as burdened with communicable diseases and injuries as were EURO B and <b>EURO</b> <b>C.</b> Conclusion With a premature mortality pattern, Serbia is placed in the middle position of the Europe triangle. The main excess of YLL in Serbia was due to cardiovascular, malignant diseases, and diabetes mellitus. The results may be used for assessment of unacceptable social risks resulting from health inequalities. Within intentions to reduce an unfavourable premature mortality gap, it is necessary to reconsider certain local polices and practices as well as financial and human resources incorporated in the prevention of disease and injury burden. </p...|$|E

A key {{requirement}} for the new members to join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is real and financial convergence to European Union (EU) levels. This paper expands the analysis in [Kocenda, E., Macroeconomic convergence in transition economies, Journal of Comparative Economics 29 (2001) 1 - 23] and [Kutan, A., Yigit, T., Nominal and real stochastic convergence of transition economies, Journal of Comparative Economics 32 (2004) 23 - 36] by investigating the convergence of the new EU members to these standards. Using panel unit root techniques, we find strong evidence of real stochastic convergence for all new members, which indicates that they adjust to Euro-area output shocks. However, the degree of nominal convergence is idiosyncratic. The Baltic states exhibit the strongest monetary policy and price-level convergence, suggesting that {{they are ready to}} adopt the Euro.

40|$|Background: Listeriosis {{is caused}} by Listeria monocytogenes, a gram {{positive}} and ubiquitous bacterium. The sources of infection with this foodborne pathogen are typically dairy or ready-to-eat foods. It is a rare disease, mostly occurring in risk groups such as elderly, pregnant women and immunocompromised people. Listeriosis is widely underreported in most countries and no global estimation of the disease burden has been conducted until now. The objective {{of this study is}} therefore to estimate the annual global number of human illnesses, deaths and Disability-Adjusted Life Years due to listeriosis by synthesizing existing information and knowledge through a systematic literature review. Methods: Data on listeriosis were retrieved through a search of peerreviewed and grey literature (published from 1990 - 2012) via search terms developed in line with the MeSH nomenclature. National surveillance data were reviewed where available. A multi-level meta-analysis was conducted to calculate listeriosis incidences, number of deaths and DALYs by WHO sub-region and by age group. PERT distributions were used to model uncertainty. To deal with missing data, back-calculations from meningitis to listeriosis-related meningitis were performed. Results: A total of 12 665 references were identified. After excluding duplicate titles, the dataset was reduced to 8049 unique references. After title and abstract screening, 368 papers were retained for extraction and 128 were included in the review. Listeriosis incidence data have been identified for six of the 14 WHO sub-regions. The preliminary median incidence estimates (by 100, 000 inhabitants) are 0. 31 (range = 0. 05 - 0. 80) for AMRO A, 0. 40 for AMRO B, 0. 38 (range = 0. 02 - 1. 30) for EURO A, 0. 03 (range = 0. 00 - 0. 15) for EURO B, 0. 17 (range = 0. 00 - 0. 37) for <b>EURO</b> <b>C</b> and 0. 30 (range = 0. 07 - 0. 60) for WPRO A. Proportions of perinatal cases are 17 % (range = 12 - 91) for AMRO A, 21 % for EURO A (range = 0 - 59), 18 % for <b>EURO</b> <b>C</b> and 12 % for WPRO A (range = 6 - 19). The case fatality ratio is 15. 9 % (range = 8. 3 - 67. 0) in AMRO A and 28. 3 % (range = 9. 0 - 52. 5) in EURO A. In all sub-regions, listeriosis is linked with co-morbidities. Conclusions: Listeriosis is a rare but deadly disease. Considerable efforts are required to fill the lack of data in developing countries. Key messages: - This is the first study aiming to calculate the global burden of listeriosis. - The results will help decision-makers to prioritize their actions in the area of foodborne diseases...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain why a low and declining saving rate should be a problem in a world of free capital flows and {{increasing}} wealth. In Italy consumer households’ saving have been the main driver of economic stability and growth, funding investments and public debt, and despite international turbulences Italy was acknowledged as a high saving country until the early 1990 ’s. Ever since, however, households saving rate plunged, in spite of an increasing financial wealth, and our aim is to explain why: we suggest two main causes. The first is related to the economic policies implemented to deal with four major economic events, prompted by economic misalignments: a) the 1992 ’s currency crisis, b) the run-up to the <b>Euro,</b> <b>c)</b> the 2006 ’ turning point, preceding the 2008 ’s crisis, and d) the 2009 ’s public debt crisis and the following policy of fiscal consolidation. These four events were dealt with economic policies which overlooked the huge income and saving shifts from households to government and private sectors: rising tax burden, especially indirect taxes, freezing of nominal public expenditures and falling real wages were the main policy instruments, while a decreasing households’ income and saving was a primary consequences. Households have been struggling to smooth their standard of life drawing on their saving and wealth, but the effort became all the more difficult as the saving rate was falling below a critical level, increasing the probability of negative saving and debt. Gross national saving turned less than aggregate investment, prompting an increasing borrowing from abroad and a corresponding negative current account. The second cause is structural and covers two crucial issues: the first is the deep economy impacts of a changing age structure, as a consequence of a sudden fertility drop. The second issue is related to the falling households size composition jointly with the rising share of quasi-fixed costs necessary for a decent life. We show how and why a well designed Welfare State could help to restore income stability and saving, tackling the widespread problem of changing age structure in most countries...|$|E

Since 2011, all Diesel cars are equipped with a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and respect European standards (Euro 6) for particulate matter emissions which combine a limit number (PN: 6. 0 × 10 ^ 11 particulates/km) with a limit mass (PM: 4. 5 mg/km).

Collections were carried out during various engine operations and three driving cycles (NEDC, WLTP and ARTEMIS). Characterizations were performed with TEM coupled with EDX analysis and were focused on the physical size distribution, the morphology, the mass and the chemical compositions of particles emitted during cold and hot start and also during DPF regenerations for Diesel vehicles. Diesel engines equipped with DPF mainly emit particles during cold start and DPF regenerations. During cold start particles emitted are mainly carbon soot. During the DPF regenerations, PM size distributions are classified as bimodal, mainly consisting of the nucleation and accumulation modes. Typically, these particles are composed of a complex mixture of soot and droplet like particles. The increase of engine speeds during cycles resulted in increase of fractions of metal contents (Ni, Fe, Cr, Mn [...] .) in particulate matters.

Group E was the most expensive group (1830 Euro), followed by Group D (768 Euro), Group A (546 <b>Euro),</b> Group <b>C</b> (461 <b>Euro),</b> and Group B (390 Euro). Antiepileptic drugs accounted for the major costs in Groups B, C, D, and E, while the cost of EEG and neuroradiological imaging was more prominent in Group A. Conclusion: The direct cost of epilepsy in Turkey varied depending on the severity of the condition and response to the treatment. Drugs played a significant role in the cost...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTAs {{epidemiological}} data concerning varicella in Germany were not available, a retrospective {{study was conducted}} to investigate the impact of the disease, focusing also on economic aspects. A representative German-wide sample of 1334 unvaccinated varicella cases was obtained in 1999 from randomly selected paediatric (P) and general, as well as internal, mainly adult (A), practices. Following representative weighting, the median age was 5 years, with 90 % of cases aged < 12 years. The highest incidence was in children aged 5 – 6 years. Varicella-related complications occurred in 5. 7 % of patients, and accounted for 0. 1 hospital days/case on average. Certificates of sick leave were issued for 1. 3 sick days/case, with 0. 6 days paid by health insurance funds to parents caring for their sick child, and 0. 7 days paid by the employer. With an annual incidence of 760 000 diagnosed cases in Germany for the year 1999, this amounts to an annual cost of <b>c.</b> 150 million <b>Euro,</b> with <b>c.</b> 50 million <b>Euro</b> paid by the statutory health insurance system. It was concluded that universal varicella vaccination in Germany would provide essential clinical improvements for patients and prevent hospital admissions. In addition, significant economic benefits can be expected, mainly because of the high level of indirect health costs in Germany...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The smoking {{effects on}} wages has been {{examined}} in this work using different econometric methodologies {{with the use of}} European Community Household Panel (ECHP) datasets. We employ econometric tools like Instrumental Variable technique, Heckman correction factor, Endogenous Switching and matching estimates. The initial results from regression estimates (OLS and IV methods) revealed that the wage gap between smokers and non-smokers ranges 1 % to 22. 7 %. Moreover, endogenous switching and matching estimator also showed a negative average treatment effect of approximately 47 % and 4. 3 % to 6. 9 % respectively. Thus smokers observed less wage effects is explained in part by real effects on their health status and a measure of unobserved preferences. Keywords.
