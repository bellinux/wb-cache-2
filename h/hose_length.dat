5000|$|To achieve optimal loading in a {{straight}} rubber hose the fibres must be positioned under an angle of approximately 54.7 angular degrees, {{also referred to as}} the magic angle. The magic angle of 54.7 exactly balances the internal-pressure-induced longitudinal stress and the hoop (circumferential) stress, as observed in most biological pressurized fiber-wound cylinders, like arteries. If the fiber angle is initially above or below 54.7, it will change under increased internal pressure until it rises to the magic angle where hoop stresses and longitudinal stresses equalize, with concomitant accommodations in hose diameter and <b>hose</b> <b>length.</b> A hose with an initially low fiber angle will rise under pressure to 54.7, inducing a hose diameter increase and a length decrease, whereas a hose with an initially high fiber angle will drop to 54.7, inducing a hose diameter decrease and a length increase. The equilibrium state is a fiber angle of 54.7. In this situation the fibres tend to be loaded purely in tension, so ~100% of their strength resists the forces acting on the hose due to the internal pressure. (The magic angle for cylindrical shapes of 54.7 angular degrees is based on calculations in which the influence of the matrix material is neglected. Therefore, depending on the stiffness of the rubber material used, the actual equilibrium angle can vary a few tenths of degrees from the magic angle.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Forest {{fires are}} an ancient phenomenon. Appear, however, with devastating {{frequency}} and intensity {{over the last}} 30 years. In our country, the climatic conditions {{in combination with the}} intense relief, favor their rapid spread. Considering the fact that environmental conditions provided for decades even worse (increased temperature, drought and vegetation), then the problem of forest fires in our country, is expected to become more intense. This paper aims to focus on developing an optimization model for the opening up of the forest mountainous areas taking into account the prevention and suppression of forest fires. Research areas are the mountainous forest complex of W. Nestos of Drama Prefecture, the university forest of Taxiarchis – Vrastama of Chalkidiki Prefecture and the forest complex of Lailias of Serres Prefecture. The percentage of forest protection area can be reached by fire hose is examined under the light whether the total <b>hose</b> <b>length</b> corresponds to the actual operational capacity to reach a fire source. The most important forest technical infrastructures to prevent fire are road networks (opening up) for fire protection and buffer zones.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the modeling of a pneumatic system {{devoted to a}} teleoperation application. The study deals with the specific problem of the additional dynamics introduced by the air <b>hose</b> <b>length</b> when the servovalves are located far from the pneumatic cylinder. The physical modeling of each component of the system leads to either a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or a set of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). We show that a classical expansion around a working point provides a model consisting of a finite set of ODEs. A second aspect of this work relates {{to the use of}} this model within a bilateral teleoperation scheme. In order to design a two-channel teleoperation controller, a model reduction is required.

40|$|Virtual {{prototyping}} (VP) {{of complex}} machines requires the realistic representation of components to perform robust analyses and simulations. In many cases, machines are an assembly of rigid and flexible components. Although modern three-dimensional CAD {{systems can be}} considered powerful tools for modelling solids or surfaces representing rigid bodies, they are not adequate to model soft material components, especially a realistic visualisation of physical behaviour. This drawback motivated the present research work. In particular, this paper describes an approach and the related knowledge-based software system (FlexSim) developed to create virtual prototypes facilitating product development in cases of flexible parts like cables, pipes and wires. The resulting VP tool integrates the CAD technology and the dedicated structural simulation methods to automatically model and validate three-dimensional functional sub-groups having flexible parts. The system application is shown on metallic reinforced elastomer hoses used for hydraulic power transmissions. For this purpose, a finite-element approach has been implemented to find hose configurations for given boundary conditions determined by mounting positions. Pipe fittings are selected and automatically assembled and the optimal <b>hose</b> <b>length</b> and its ideal spatial disposition are calculated. Simulations of behaviour allow the rapid optimisation of a solution. The system has been tested on agricultural harvest machines and mining equipment, which widely employ hydraulic transmissions for moving groups of components. As a result, the number of physical prototypes, the lead-time due to the trial-and-error activities and the product development costs can be significantly reduced...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{contributes to}} the LNG supply chain {{by the development of}} a validated calculation model for corrugated flexible hoses or pipes developed for LNG Transfer. The model builds upon experience gained by TNO Technical Sciences (Fluid Dynamics) in a large number of flow tests carried out on hoses in a large range of diameters from 4 to 18 -inch. LNG transfer rates are in general relatively high as the time involved should be limited from economical point of view. In large scale offshore LNG transfer, flow rates up to 5000 m 3 /h are applied and in future flow rates up to 10. 000 m 3 /h are foreseen. Typical values mentioned for offshore operations in tandem transfer range from 50 to 150 meters <b>hose</b> <b>length</b> and hose diameter up to 20 -inch. The pressure losses in LNG offshore transfer, but also in smaller scale applications, can be considerable. The pressure loss depends on flow rate, length of the hose, internal diameter and internal hose corrugation geometry. High pressure losses will impose additional requirements on LNG pumps and might result in cavitation at the downstream end of the hose as the average pressure drops below vapor pressure. Furthermore the impact of local boiling phenomena due to heat-ingress and cavitation, possibly effected by vortex shedding along the internal corrugations, is not known. Once the gaps in the data base are filled a validated prediction model is available, which can be used in guidelines and standards. So far the EN 1474 (part 2 : Design and testing of transfer hoses) does not specify a maximum allowable pressure loss and the prescription of the requirement for the test is limited: "Flow rate testing (ambient or cryogenic) : demonstrate that the hose is capable of operating at its maximum flow rate and confirm the predicted head loss " The final goal of the project is to obtain a validated prediction model for the calculation of pressure losses in LNG transfer with flexible multi-composite and metal hoses based on input of parameters as operating conditions and hose geometry. Also input for guidelines and standards in LNG transfer with flexibles such as EN 1474 will be generated, which can be used in for qualification of LNG equipment...|$|E
40|$|Framo Engineering has {{replaced}} tanker loading unit (TLU) by a Framo submerged loading (FSL) system at Draugen, with 257 m water depth, in summer 2012. In recent years {{a lot of}} activities {{of oil and gas}} companies including drilling and exporting of oil and gas have been performed in deep and ultra deep waters. The increasing water depth also means {{that it is necessary to}} develop the riser technology to access these depths. The main purpose of this master thesis was the development of the existing FSL system and considering the feasibility of the system for operating in deep water (1000 m). The first challenging step of this master thesis was to modify the existing FSL system RIFLEX model for deep water. It included modification of the existing steel riser, the buoyancy tank, the loading hose and the pick-up system. Based on DNV-OS-F 201 standard, the thickness of steel riser was selected to resist internal and external overpressure as well as the other design criteria mentioned in DNV standard. The buoyancy tank length was changed in order to provide the required top tension as well as a reasonable offset. The loading <b>hose</b> <b>length</b> was increased as the system offset as well as tanker offset in 1000 m water depth and harsh environment is much larger than in the Draugen with 257 m water depth and moderate environment. After creating the preliminary submerged loading system model, the global analysis of the deep water submerged loading system was conducted in SIMA. Subsequently, the sensitivity studies with respect to different parameters were performed in order to ensure that the theoretical models and numerical approximations represent the real physical behaviour of the submerged loading system model. Finally, based on the obtained results in previous analyses, the deep water submerged loading system was modified and the global analysis results were presented in this report. It must be noted that this design procedure is an iterative process. Therefore, in order to present the final submerged loading system model, fatigue and VIV analyses of the system must be executed that are out of scope of this master thesis. The modified submerged loading system model sustained lower axial tension and bending moment when the buoyancy tank length decreases to 18. 6 m and also the buoyancy tank diameter increases to 7. 5 m compared to the preliminary model when the buoyancy tank had 42. 6 m length and 5 m diameter. Moreover, Catchwheel system was proposed as the pick-up system for the deep water submerged loading system. Although, the Catchwheel system has to be designed and verified in more details, it is a simple and well-performed system which can be easily replaced and repaired because it is located close to the sea surface. Finally, it was concluded that the submerged loading system is feasible for 1000 m water depth. However, more verification as well as fatigue and VIV analyses of the presented system are necessary to obtain the final submerged loading system model. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{rheological}} {{and material}} parameters determining the pumpability of fresh self-compacting mortar {{have been studied}} in full-scale (70 m Ø 50 mm rubber hose and screw pump with max capacity 7 m 3 /h). Concrete pressure gradient over the <b>hose</b> <b>length</b> (dp/dx) and flow rate were measured to quantify pumpability. The rheological properties of the pumped mortars were measured with a ConTec BML viscometer. Finally, the rheological properties of the slip layer that occurs in vicinity of {{the wall of the}} hose during pumping was studyed as matrix phase (paste and filler < 0. 125 mm) in a parallel plate rheometer. Five different concrete mixes were investigated showing that slump flow is not suitable for differentiating pumpability. Interpretation of rheological data was, moreover, complicated since the measured values of plastic viscosity and yield stress were altered simultaneously from mix to mix. The data imply that both yield stress and plastic viscosity govern pumpability. Increased plastic viscosity of mortar and paste was found to correlate with decreased mortar pumpability. No clear trends could be found for mortar yield stress. Increased paste yield stress was, however surprisingly, related to increased pumpability. The plastic viscosity seemed, however, to dominate yield stress when the two factors varied simultaneously within the given workability range. These parameters should, therefore, not be studied independently. Increased hysteresis area calculated from the paste measurements correlated well with reduced pump flow, also indicating a relation to the rheology of the slip layer. The predicted pressure losses were 5 - 7 times higher than the measured values. This indicates that {{one or more of the}} premises of the Buckingham-Reiner equation are erroneous in these tests, like inhomogeneous fluid and slippage. The existence of a plug is due to yield stress which was observed in both matrix and mortar. The combination of instrumented steady state pumping, concentric viscometre, parallel plate viscometer and visualized boundary flow rate were used to estimate slip layer thickness. The modified Buckingham Reiner equation resulted in slip zone thickness in the order of 0. 6 – 1 mm. The thicknesses were not sensitive to variations in matrix yield stress, whereas plastic viscosity had a major effect as shown in plots of slip zone viscosity vs slip zone thickness. At the slip zone thickness corresponding to the matrix rheology, the calculated specific viscosities (Pa•s/m) were all similar to the lowest values reported by Kaplan (2001). The average rates of shear in the thinnest slip zone were estimated to be as high as 1000 [s- 1]. This is much higher than those used in the parallel plate viscometer [100 s- 1] and future parallel plate viscometre test made in conjunction with studies of this kind should be carried out to 1000 [s- 1]. Based on a few flow profile calculations and comparison with visualized profiles it seems reasonable to assume that the rheological properties of the concrete are not constant, but vary over the cross section of the tube and possibly also along the tube due to factors such as tixotropic behaviour, possibly shear thickening, stiffening, wall effects and/or segregation under shear. Some investigations of effect of pumping on compressive strength were made by measuring strength on cubes made from concrete before and after pumping. These showed negligible effects of pumping on strength. Further research recommendations are given. © Copyright SINTEF Building and Infrastructure 201...|$|E
30|$|Later, Johnson and Workman (1992) used {{attribution}} {{theory to}} study the effect of provocative clothing and sex of observer on attributions of sexual harassment. Undergraduate men and women viewed {{a photo of a}} young woman dressed in provocative (dark suit jacket, low cut blouse, short skirt, dark hose, high heels) or non-provocative (dark suit jacket, high cut blouse, below the knee skirt, neutral hose, moderate heels) clothing. Both men and women rated the provocatively dressed model as more likely to be sexually harassed and to provoke sexual harassment. However, the dress effects could be due to any one or any combination of blouse style, skirt <b>length,</b> <b>hose</b> color, or shoe style. Soon after, Johnson and Workman (1994) expanded their research on sexual harassment, sex of observer, and victim dress to include attributions of blame for an incident and likelihood of future harassing behaviors. Attribution theory again guided their research. As compared to a non-provocatively dressed woman, respondents judged that a provocatively dressed woman could have prevented the incident, was more likely to have provoked the incident, was more likely to have inadvertently done something to bring about the advances, and had a supervisor who was more likely to make complementary appearance comments and was more likely to expect to date the woman. As in their previous study, it was unclear whether it was specific aspects of dress that led to these results or whether it was an overall (gestalt) appearance of provocativeness that caused the results.|$|R
