50|$|The {{third and}} last part, <b>Dopotutto,</b> è amore - sei storie per il terzo millennio (It’s love, after all - six stories {{for the third}} millennium) is a {{portrait}} of unusual, alternative romantic relationships or love in general. These were the first tales Vassalli had written, back in 2000 and 2001, and they break with traditional, stereotypical ideals of love life, romance and infatuation, exploring feelings such as disappointment, jealousy, sexual desire and various forms of perversion. In this part, for example, we are told about Sebastiano, a writer who feels a sweet affection towards a Nigerian prostitute who begs his help after she’s been beaten {{by one of his}} previous client. This casual meeting, anyway, won’t be the only occasion Sebastiano and the girl’s lives will cross, as the writer will discover later on in the tale. Moreover, another story is about a pedophile called Leonid, who briefly recalls the crimes that will lead him to the electric chair.|$|E
