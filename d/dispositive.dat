The analysis shows that although a small Part of the conspiracy constructions can rightfully be understood as counter-conspiracy <b>dispositives</b> raised bottom up, in the majority of the cases a blurring can be noted between counter-conspiracy <b>dispositives</b> and conspiracy <b>dispositives.</b> This can be explained by the fact that - parts of - the seemingly counter-conspiracy <b>dispositives</b> were initiated, adopted and instrumentalized by actors from 'above': actors from the Dutch political and cultural establishment.

The international social world of disasters has elaborated <b>dispositives</b> in order to put in order the anticipated chaos generated by disasters. This ordering process notably consists in trying to match spaces, roles and identities. When a disaster strikes on a territory, inhabitants become “affected people” when they pass thro ugh the tent where there are given this status, and then “displaced people” when there are conveyed in the truck that drives them to their new places. These <b>dispositives</b> are elaborated on ways of thinking identities in situation of crisis strongly linked t o spatial representations. The ethnographic inquiry realized on different sites where <b>dispositives</b> of disaster management are put in place in Latin America shows that the coincidence between spaces, roles and identities are far from systematic and that peo ple often have the possibility to reintroduce a certain level of critique, taking their distance with the roles they were attributed and discussing the geography of order.

This concept of rural – that opened the field of rural sociology – {{can be seen as}} an historical construction: it was elaborated by hybridizing the model of modernisation and the disappearing peasant worlds; it was actually a political and cultural compromise that gave a place to rural populations in the modernity mainly in reference to public goods. Today the dominant paradigm is one of market competition but it must also be articulated to public goods especially environmental goods at the global level. This is an on-going process that leads to a great variety of policies, rules, organisations (<b>dispositives)</b> that concern life (from animal to global change) and contribute to define new ruralities.

40|$|As {{a result}} of wars and other serious armed {{conflicts}} in first and foremost Syria, an increasing inflow of refugees has been witnessed in Europe during 2015. The European Union agency Frontex, which was constructed in 2005, has become a central institution in dealing with refugee and migration issues in Europe. The role of Frontex has grown including risk analyses, sharing of information between member states, training of border control guards, and operative actions. In order to legitimize these activities, an ideological and political basis is constructed involving a categorization of refugees and other migrants into different groups characterizing refugees and migrants as ‘irregular migrants’.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis Who Am I? Subjectivities in the Society of Accountability aims {{to demonstrate that}} accountability {{is one of the}} most powerful processes of subjectivation in our contemporary era. The background is constituted by ordinary daily practices, born from the propagation of digital media in the last twenty years. Accountability is defined as the peculiar anthropotechnic that derives from the extension of the subject in the form of the account. Account is defined as every extension of the subject in the digital world, so that these extensions are univocally attributable to a singular physical body of a singular human being. The concept of subjectivity is considered as outlined by Michel Foucault in the period 1977 - 1984. The dissertation also aims to demonstrate that the society of control, investigated by Foucault and Gilles Deleuze, finds its present fulfillment in the form of the society of accountability. Accountability is considered in three moments, connected by a circular movement instead of a causal sequence. The first moment describes how <b>dispositives</b> act on subjects. The scene of address is constituted by the request of performativity made by <b>dispositives</b> to the subject. This request takes place in the account, to be understood as the interface between <b>dispositives</b> and subjects. Secondly, the same process is taken in consideration from the point of view of the subject, who is invited to answer the question: Who am I? Thus the subject understands him/herself as a subjectivity without ground, because the hermeneutics of the self, derived from <b>dispositives,</b> finds the foreclosure of the referent as its foundation. In a third moment accountability is considered from the point of view of the statements (énoncés). The conversion of statements into information, and the statistical inferences operated on it (basically, the processes related to big data), are the focus of this moment. The outcome of this analysis is a second hermeneutics of the subject, characterised by the discourse of the master. Convergences and divergences between this (digital) hermeneutics, the Christian hermeneutics derived from the confession and the Cartesian moment are explored in order to outline the actual accountability as pastoral power and discourse of the master at the same time. In conclusion, accountability is considered as a possible ethics. If anomie and anonymity are excluded as far as they exclude the scene of address, and consequently the very possibility of existence of a bios, the valorisation of opacity is identified as the grounding of a possible ethical action based on freedom, an exercise of freedom to be understood as resilience to the complete panoptical visibility and the consequential proceduralisation of the scene of address.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{interlaced}} re-building of communication, movement, and information due to {{the integration of the}} wireless telephony in the daily life. The core of the theoretical part of the dissertation consists in the construction of a dispositif model that explains wireless telephony constitution, usage, and impact. The model outlines technology, subjects, usage, perception, representation, and socio-cultural frames. The reciprocal interactions between the mobile telephony apparatus, human subjects (as designers and users), and various usage programs (mobile communication, information and orientation, personal assistant, supervising, and entertainment) lead to the rebuilding of communication, information, entertainment, and supervising “arrangements”. Further, in a historical chapter dealing with the constitution of the dispositif, avatars of communication and mobility structures are presented in connection with the underlying transformations from science to technical implementation and diffusion. It is argued that the current mobile telephony represents a mature and functional phase of a manifold dispositif, which has historically constituted through redefinition and creative rebuilding of programs and structures belonging to earlier avatars and competing <b>dispositives.</b> The empirical part of the dissertation examines the results of the quantitative online study conducted to validate and correct the theoretical model and to identify the formative effects of the dispositif. Findings indicate that the usage of wireless telephony creates a specific communication structure featuring particular purposes, content, situations, actions and partners, which is mainly oriented toward spatial and temporal coordination of communicators. The analysis also concentrates on the relation between mobile communication (verbal and written) and other communication forms enabled by face-to-face contacts or technical <b>dispositives.</b> Two positioning analyses of the existing communication forms in the situational and affective field (conducted through Multidimensional Scaling), show that the usage and perception of mobile telephony and SMS are subjects of interaction with the usage and perception of face-to-face communication, fixed telephony, and e-mail. Thus, concurrent and complementary <b>dispositives</b> continuously influence each other by ingeniously manipulating their programs for competitive purposes. Concerning the constitution of communicative mobility, the effect of technology usage on movement is reinforced mainly at the attitudinal/representational level. Particular localization patterns and chronotypes structured by technology usage are revealed. Other results relate to the images and attitudes towards technology and its users and to several social effects of mobile telephony usage, such as the strengthening of close family relations and the extension of the network of acquaintances...|$|R

From the standpoint of government of self, the design of social networks establishes a competition for attention that tends to favor the neoliberal culture of performance. In terms of social organization, the way in which users intertwine their connections is paralleled by the neoliberal paradigm of spontaneous market order. Furthermore, the use of personal information on these users, encompassing all their activities within the networks, in order to set up databases to attract advertisers reflects the neoliberal tendency of colonization of the different realms of existence by economic forces. However, the tensions that accompany neoliberal governmentality in social networks reveal its limitations, opening the possibility for these networks to also act as instruments of resistance to neoliberalism...|$|R

On the other side, the idea of the human animal as human being appears only in Modernity, within the different <b>dispositives</b> that constitute what Foucault called the modern biopower.

40|$|In this paper, I {{discuss some}} of Esposito’s {{reflections}} on biopolitics {{in order to}} contribute {{to a better understanding of}} this matter. In my view, Roberto Esposito’s theorization on this subject cannot be fully understood without taking into consideration his view on modern political philosophy, the need to deconstruct the hegemonic immunitary paradigm that negates life in order to protect it, and the persistence of theologico-political apparatuses that separate life in zones of different value. Therefore, Esposito will deconstruct political philosophy and develop a genealogical research on modern biopolitics that has immunization as hermeneutic key. Furthermore, theologico-political <b>dispositives</b> like personhood imply a form of violent immunization. Now, if life has to be immunized in order to be preserved, it is also on this ground that a new philosophy of the common can emerge. In this sense, Esposito elaborates a philosophy of the third person or the Impersonal, both within Life and Thought, as a way out from the Immunitarian stance that sacrifices Life to its own preservation. The reach of this proposal will be discussed in the last part of the paper...|$|R
