Lipids and retinoids were extracted and quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and reversed phase HPLC, respectively. The data demonstrate that while <b>fenretinide</b> is an inhibitor of the activities of these three enzymes, that 3 -keto-HPR is a more potent inhibitor of all three enzymes, potentially mediating most of the in vivo beneficial effects of <b>fenretinide.</b> However, while MPR does not affect SCD 1 and DES 1 activity, it is a potent specific inhibitor of BCO 1.

In an attempt to characterize the mechanism of action of <b>fenretinide,</b> cDNA array filters were screened to identify apoptotic genes regulated in response to treatment of SH-SY 5 Y cells with <b>fenretinide.</b> Expression of the stress-induced transcription factor, GADD 153, was up-regulated at both the protein and mRNA levels in response to <b>fenretinide.</b> Overexpression of GADD 153 increased apoptosis in the presence and absence of <b>fenretinide,</b> whereas reduced expression of GADD 153 by expression of antisense DNA abrogated the response to <b>fenretinide.</b> Although <b>fenretinide</b> is a partial retinoic acid receptor (RAR) -beta/gamma agonist, RARbeta/gamma antagonists did not block the induction of GADD 153 by fenretinide; conversely, the induction of GADD 153 was blocked by antioxidants. Enzyme inhibitors were used to identify pathways mediating the ROS-dependent effects of fenretinide: inhibitors of phospholipase A(2) and lypoxygenases (LOX), and specific inhibitors of 12 -LOX, but not 5 -LOX or 15 -LOX, inhibited the induction of ROS, apoptosis, and GADD 153 in response to <b>fenretinide.</b> The inhibition of ROS and apoptosis was reversed {{by the addition of}} the 12 -LOX products, 12 (S) -hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12 -HpETE) and 12 (S) -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12 -HETE). <b>Fenretinide</b> did not increase free arachidonic acid levels, but increased LOX activity without a detectable increase in 12 -LOX protein.

Case presentation: On Day 4 of a scheduled 5 -day-infusion of intravenous <b>fenretinide,</b> the patient developed a fever, acetaminophen was started, ceftriaxone initiated for possible bacteremia, and <b>fenretinide</b> level doubled from 56 to 110  μM. Over the next three days, although blood cultures remained negative, the patient’s condition deteriorated rapidly.

40|$|<b>Fenretinide</b> induces {{apoptosis}} in malignant gliomas in vitro. This two-stage phase II {{trial was}} conducted to determine the efficacy of <b>fenretinide</b> in adults with recurrent malignant gliomas. Patients and Methods Twenty-two patients with anaplastic gliomas (AG) and 23 patients with glioblastoma (GBM) whose tumors had recurred after radiotherapy {{and no more than}} two chemotherapy regimens were enrolled. <b>Fenretinide</b> was given orally on days 1 to 7 and 22 to 28 in 6 -week cycles in doses of 600 or 900 mg/m 2 bid. Results Six of 21 (29 %) patients in the AG arm and two of 23 (9 %) patients in the GBM arm had stable disease at 6 months. One patient with AG treated at 900 mg/m 2 bid dosage had a partial radiologic response. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6 weeks for the AG arm and 6 weeks for the GBM arm. PFS at 6 months was 10 % for the AG arm and 0 % for the GBM arm. Grade 1 or 2 fatigue, dryness of skin, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia were the most frequent toxicities reported. The trial was closed after the first stage because of the inadequate activity at the <b>fenretinide</b> doses used. The first-administration mean plasma Cmax for <b>fenretinide</b> was 832 360 ng/mL at the 600 mg/m 2 bid dosage and 1, 213 261 ng/mL at the 900 mg/m 2 bid dosage. Conclusion <b>Fenretinide</b> was inactive against recurrent malignant gliomas at the dosage used in this trial. However, additional studies using higher doses of the agent are warranted based on the tolerability of the agent and the potential for activity of a higher <b>fenretinide</b> dosage, as suggested in this trial.

40|$|Many {{eyes will}} be drawn to the article {{reported}} {{in this issue of}} the Journal by Veronesi et al. (1), who tested the effect of the vitamin A analogue <b>fenretinide</b> on the prevention of second breast malignancies in women with early breast cancer. Veronesi et al. randomly assigned nearly 3000 women to receive either <b>fenretinide</b> orally or no treatment (control group) for 5 years and followed them for a median of 8 years. There were totals of 136 contralateral and 221 ipsilateral second malignancies that appear equally likely to occur in the <b>fenretinide</b> or control group. In addition to this overall finding, the article highlights a possible treatment–covariate interaction, wherein <b>fenretinide</b> appears {{to reduce the risk of}} second cancers in premenopausal women but appears to increase the risk in postmenopausal women. The trial appears to be well designed and conducted. There is no obvious source of bias or error that would explain the ob...|$|E
40|$|Purpose : <b>Fenretinide,</b> a {{synthetic}} form of retinoid, induced apoptosis even in chemotherapy resistant cell lines. A phase II study was hence conducted to evaluate toxicity {{and efficacy of}} <b>fenretinide</b> in metastatic renal cancer. Methods : Eligibility included unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), adequate organ function and Zubrod performance status ≦ 2. Prior immunotherapy and a maximum of one prior chemotherapy regimen were allowed. <b>Fenretinide</b> was administered at a dose of 900 mg/m 2 twice daily orally for 7 days in a 21 -day cycle. Toxicity was assessed {{at the start of}} each cycle, and response every 2 cycles. Results : Nineteen eligible patients enrolled of which fifteen had visceral/bone metastases. Seventeen patients had prior nephrectomy and 11 had prior immunotherapy. 76 cycles of therapy were delivered. Therapy was very well tolerated with few severe toxicities consisting of thrombosis in 1 individual and grade 3 fatigue, nausea and diarrhea in 1 patient. 5 patients had grade 2 nyctalopia and 3 patients had transient grade 2 visual toxicity. No objective responses were noted. Stable disease was seen in seven of nineteen cases (37 %, 90 % C. I. 0. 21 – 0. 59). Median time to progression was 1. 5 months and median duration of stable disease was 5. 8 months (90 % C. I. 3. 0 – 8. 4). Median survival was 10 months. Tumor <b>fenretinide</b> levels were obtained in three patients and were in {{the lower end of the}} therapeutic range. Conclusion : <b>Fenretinide</b> was well tolerated but demonstrated minimal activity that was consistent with results of intratumoral drug measurements.

40|$|Endoplasmic {{reticulum}} (ER) malfunction, {{leading to}} ER stress, {{can be a}} consequence of genome instability and hypoxic tissue environments. Cancer cells survive by acquiring or enhancing survival mechanisms to counter the effects of ER stress and these homeostatic responses may be new therapeutic targets. Understanding the links between ER stress and apoptosis may be approached using drugs specifically to target ER stress responses in cancer cells. The retinoid analogue <b>fenretinide</b> [N-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) retinamide] is a new cancer preventive and chemotherapeutic drug, that induces apoptosis of some cancer cell types via oxidative stress, accompanied by induction of an ER stress-related transcription factor, GADD 153. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that <b>fenretinide</b> induces ER stress in neuroectodermal tumour cells, and to elucidate the role of ER stress responses in fenretinide-induced apoptosis. The ER stress genes ERdj 5, ERp 57, GRP 78, calreticulin and calnexin were induced in neuroectodermal tumour cells by <b>fenretinide.</b> In contrast to the apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic drugs vincristine and temozolomide, <b>fenretinide</b> induced the phosphorylation of eIF 2 α, expression of ATF 4 and splicing of XBP- 1 mRNA, events that define ER stress. In these respects, <b>fenretinide</b> displayed properties similar to the ER stress inducer thapsigargin. ER stress responses were inhibited by antioxidant treatment. Knockdown of ERp 57 or ERdj 5 by RNA interference in these cells increased the apoptotic response to <b>fenretinide.</b> These data suggest that downregulating homeostatic ER stress responses may enhance apoptosis induced by oxidative stress-inducing drugs acting through the ER stress pathway. Therefore, ER-resident proteins such as ERdj 5 and ERp 57 may represent novel chemotherapeutic targets...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{trials have}} {{revealed}} that N-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4 HPR; <b>fenretinide),</b> a synthetic retinoic acid derivative, is a highly active and promising therapeutic and chemopreventive agent. <b>Fenretinide</b> shows biological activity against numerous cancer types in vitro and in preclinical studies. Clinical trials have shown that <b>fenretinide</b> induces a significant reduction of second breast cancer in premenopausal women. Several studies on different neoplasms are ongoing, such as breast and ovarian cancer, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, head and neck and skin cancers and others. It has minimal side effects in humans, so that trials in young women at high-risk of breast cancer and ovarian and {{for the prevention of}} other tumor types such as lung cancer could be envisaged. Here we review some ongoing clinical trials and evaluate the possible mechanisms underlying the secondary chemopreventive effects of 4 HPR. In particular we report basic and translational data on the anti-angiogenic "angiopreventive" properties of <b>fenretinide,</b> its anti-invasive activity, its ability to induce apoptosis and to generate or enhance production of reactive oxygen species as possible molecular bases for a chemopreventive action in patients...|$|E
40|$|Retinoids, {{the natural}} and {{synthetic}} analogs of vitamin A, are growth-inhibiting and differentiation-inducing agents and show clinical promise as chemopreventive and antineoplastic agents. <b>Fenretinide,</b> a new synthetic retinoid, has antitumor activity in certain in vitro and in vivo model systems and was relatively nontoxic in phase I trials. Based on these data, we designed a phase II study of <b>Fenretinide</b> involving 31 patients with advanced breast cancer [15] and melanoma [16], two cancers shown to be responsive to this agent in preclinical models. <b>Fenretinide</b> was inactive in patients with advanced disease. Toxicity was mild, and reversible. Mucocutaneous side effects occurred in 16 (52 %) patients. Nyctalopia developed in three patients one of whom developed decreased B-wave amplitude of the scotopic electroretinogram. The minimal toxicity and significant activity in preclinical studies make this an attractive agent for future breast cancer chemoprevention studies...|$|E
