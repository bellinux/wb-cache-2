40|$|Radar systems use Pulse Compression {{techniques}} {{to enhance the}} long range detection capability of long duration pulse and the range resolution capability of short pulse. Frequency and phase modulation techniques are used to increase the BW of long duration pulse to achieve better range resolution with limited peak power. Towards this purpose Linear FM chrip is the very common form of waveform. This waveform has a matched ﬁltered Response (or ACF) with side lobe level is about - 13 dB. It may be improve by using methods such as windowing, adaptive ﬁltering and optimization techniques. Windowing is used in LFM pulse Compression to reduce the side lobes. But the output SNR can be reduced by 1 to 2 dB due to windowing, this leads to reduce the false alarm rates in object detection applications. Using a train of <b>stepped</b> <b>frequency</b> pulses is an eﬃcient method that achieves large overall Bandwidth {{and at the same}} time, maintains narrow instantaneous bandwidth. In this method a <b>frequency</b> <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>step</b> is added between successive pulses. One of the benefits of this method is that it allows us to use the duration between pulses to control the mid frequency of the other narrow band components of the radar system. Introducing <b>frequency</b> <b>step</b> between consecutive pulses is an efficient method to enhance the bandwidth of pulse train. The large value of <b>frequency</b> <b>step</b> gives large total bandwidth and better range resolution. However, if the product of <b>frequency</b> <b>step</b> and pulse width becomes more than one, the <b>stepped</b> <b>frequency</b> pulse-train ACF experiences unwanted peaks, referred to as “grating lobes”. A way to reduce these grating lobes is to use LFM pulses of some bandwidth B in place of the ﬁxed frequency pulses. We can derive a relationship between <b>frequency</b> <b>step,</b> bandwidth and pulse duration such that nulls are placed at points where the grating lobes have been located by analyzing ambiguity function and ACF expression...|$|R

40|$|Background: Running {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{branches}} of athletics. Running has several physiological benefits, such as a higher maximal oxygen consumption, increased muscle mass and reduced blood pressure. There have been plenty of discussions about what the most efficient running technique might be, should you use a short step length and a high <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> or vice versa. It is generally known that you can increase your running speed by increasing your <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> or your <b>step</b> length, and also both. However, maximal speed is achieved by increasing your <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> rather than your step length. For endurance runners it is important to have a good running economy, because runners with a good running economy use less energy while running, and therefore require less oxygen than a runner with poor running economy. Previous research have not found any correlations between the length of the leg with <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> or <b>step</b> length.   Aim: The aim of this study was to examine whether there are any significant correlations between the length of the leg in relation to the <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> or the <b>step</b> length while running in different speeds.   Method: 15 trained males participated in this correlation study. All participants’ leg length were measured with a measuring tape. Three running trials, with the speeds of 12, 16 and 20 km/h were performed on a treadmill during 1 minute each. Between each trial the participants rested for 3 minutes. The trials were recorded with a video camera, and the participants individual <b>step</b> <b>frequency,</b> <b>step</b> length and heel or fore foot strike were collected. Persons coefficient of correlation test was used to analyze if there were any significant correlations between the length of the leg with <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> and <b>step</b> length. Also a paired samples T test was performed to see if there was a significant increase between <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> and <b>step</b> length with the speeds.   Result: There were no significant correlations (p> 0, 05) found between the length of the leg and the <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> or the length of the leg and step length in any of the different speeds. The paired samples t-test showed a significant (p< 0, 001) increase in <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> and <b>step</b> length with the different speeds.   Conclusion: In conclusion, according to the present study, there were no significant correlations found between the length of the leg with <b>step</b> <b>frequency</b> or <b>step</b> length, which is in consensus with previous research.   Therefore, it is not advisable to predict an individual’s step length based on their leg length. There are various factors involved in determining a person’s step length and <b>step</b> <b>frequency,</b> and this study showed that running speed is one important factor. This information may be useful for runners and their coaches to apply, so they avoid making interventions involving alternations in the runners step length based on their body dimensions, such as leg length. ...|$|R

Additionally {{frequency shift keying}} realized by well defined <b>frequency</b> <b>steps</b> of the laser used for the light sheet generation in the measuring plane allows an absolute online calibration of the Doppler shift evaluation in the over-all DGV set-up for the velocity field analysis. Thus the uncertainty of velocity field measurements can be reduced and the absolute velocity measurement accuracy increased. Based on the application of frequency shift keying to the emission frequency of the lightsheet generating laser, the Doppler shift of the scattered light is evaluated by analyzing image sequences, while well defined <b>frequency</b> <b>steps</b> allow an online calibration including seeding and absorption cell influences as well as camera characteristics for each individual pixel. Furthermore it is possible to perform time resolved velocity field measurements with a spatial and temporal resolution depending on the resolution and frame rate of the CCD camera and the available laser power in the laser light sheet. Applying the self-calibrating FSK technique with a temporal resolution limited by a sequence of four images time resolved velocity measurements on a spinning disc were realized with a temporal resolution down to 0. 4 s when using a conventional CCD camera with a frame rate of 10 Hz...|$|E
