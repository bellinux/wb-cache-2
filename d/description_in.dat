Guillain had reported on some of these features prior to their full <b>description</b> <b>in</b> 1938.

5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni is an extinct rodent of María Madre Island, Nayarit, Mexico.

5|$|Plesiorycteropus, {{also known}} as the bibymalagasy or Malagasy aardvark, is a {{recently}} extinct eutherian mammalian genus from Madagascar. Upon its <b>description</b> <b>in</b> 1895, it was classified with the aardvark, but more recent studies have found little evidence to link it to aardvarks or any other order of mammals. Molecular evidence instead suggests that it is related to the tenrecs. Two species are currently recognized, the larger P.madagascariensis and the smaller P.germainepetterae. They probably overlapped in distribution, as subfossil remains of both species have been found in the same site.|$|E

In 1893 the ornithologists Edward Newton (brother of Alfred) and Hans Gadow described more fossils of the Rodrigues parrot, including a skull and limb bones. Remains of the species are scarce, and subfossils have been discovered in caves on the Plaine Corail and in Caverne Tortue.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H. Smith, based on specimens collected in Nor Yungas Province, Bolivia, {{on the road to}} La Paz to Coroico. They published a short <b>description</b> <b>in</b> Latin in a 1958 Mycologia publication, followed by a more detailed <b>description</b> <b>in</b> English later that year. According to Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán, the species Psilocybe acutissima (described by Roger Heim in 1958), and Psilocybe isauri (described by Singer in 1959) are synonyms, as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the type material of all three. Singer considered P.isauri a species distinct from P.yungensis because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface. Smith named the variety P.yungensis var. diconica for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) papilla. Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to P.acutissima was a papillate cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these morphological variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.|$|E

5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika <b>description</b> <b>in</b> Mahabharata is rooted in the group of seven females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E

5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit <b>description</b> <b>in</b> terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully covariant theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1892, the Carabane {{school was}} one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns {{belonging}} to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60students. A school infrastructure <b>description</b> <b>in</b> the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.|$|E
5|$|Harclay had {{deployed}} his men on foot to {{hold the}} bridge from the northern side. Additional forces were placed at a nearby ford, though contemporary sources do not specify {{the exact location of}} this ford. The royal pikemen were deployed in a schiltron formation, a tactic learned from the Scots in the Scottish wars. The formation proved effective against the oncoming cavalry. The rebels divided into two columns; one led by Hereford and Roger de Clifford, attacking the bridge on foot, the other under Lancaster, trying to cross the ford by horse. According to a graphic <b>description</b> <b>in</b> the chronicle the Brut, Hereford was killed as he crossed the bridge by a pikeman hiding underneath, who thrust his spear up through the Earl's anus. Clifford was also severely injured, and that column of the army fell into disarray. Lancaster's party fared little better; under heavy archery fire his cavalry was cut off before it even reached the ford, and was forced to retreat. This event shows an early – if not entirely novel – effective use of the longbow against cavalry, a tactic which was to become central to future English military success.|$|E
