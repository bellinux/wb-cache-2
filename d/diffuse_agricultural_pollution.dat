The multiple stressors to which amphibians are exposed in the ﬁeld, such as predation pressure, can make agrochemicals far more deadly than when they act in isolation.

The mean N application rate over the catchment was 350. 2 kg N ha(- 1), but this rate varied spatially and temporally. The N leaching loss rate varied from 8. 1 to 52. 7 kg N ha(- 1) under different land use regimes. The average N leaching loss rate was 13. 4 kg N ha(- 1) over the whole catchment, representing about 3. 8 % of the total N inputs. The N export rate through stormflows was 28. 8 kg N ha(- 1), about 8. 2 % of the total N inputs. Seasonal patterns showed that 95 % of N exports through stormflows occurred during July to September in 2002. Overall, the maximum riverine N exports were 12. 1 % of total N inputs and 15. 5 % of the inorganic fertilizer N applied.

40|$|Diffuse {{nutrient}} and pesticide {{pollution is}} a major global and growing pressure on water quality and poses risks to aquatic ecosystems, human health and water resources. Due to threats to water quality, the costs of water treatment and the recalcitrance of some pollutants to traditional water treatment techniques, there is increased focus on the potential to mitigate <b>agricultural</b> <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution</b> through catchment management. Water quality models {{have the potential to}} be applied as decision support tools to identify mitigation measures that can reduce <b>agricultural</b> <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution</b> but, to date, insufficient consideration has been given to the uncertainties of water quality model predictions and the impacts of farm-based mitigation measures on multiple pollutants and at a daily temporal resolution. To address these shortcomings, and the need to identify mitigation measures that can reduce <b>agricultural</b> <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution,</b> the soil and water assessment tool model was applied to identify the impacts of farm-based mitigation measures on diffuse nitrate, total phosphorus and metaldehyde pollution at a daily time-step within the River Wensum catchment in the East of England. Prohibiting metaldehyde application in areas where the slope exceeded 2 % was the most effective option to mitigate diffuse metaldehyde pollution, whilst introducing a red clover cover crop reduced nitrate losses by 19. 6 % and implementing buffer strips of 6 m width reduced total phosphorus losses by 16. 9 %. Results also highlighted the need to consider the impacts on multiple pollutants and the degree of uncertainty associated with model predictions when evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures. According to model predictions, a catchment management based approach does have the potential to reduce <b>agricultural</b> <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution,</b> the risk of water quality non compliance and the subsequent need for raw water treatment.

40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution</b> {{is a major}} concern across much of the South West. Sedimentation and {{excessive}} nutrient inputs from agricultural land to local watercourses have resulted in failure to achieve “good ecological status” across many water bodies as part of the European Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) (WFD). Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) is a new approach that has been piloted across England. It promotes a move to “upstream thinking” and tackling point and diffuse pollution at source with the implementation of built measures and by encouraging changes in land use practices and farming methods. There has been a distinct lack of monitoring of these measures at a catchment scale, particularly the monitoring of smaller watercourses. The use of Benthic macro-invertebrates as a tool for assessing organic pollution is well documented, with the use of RICT (River Invertebrate Classification Tool) software allowing site specific un-impacted conditions to be defined. Traditionally physical and visual methods have been used to quantify the volume of fine sediment deposited in water courses. The PSI index (Proportion of Sediment sensitive Invertebrates) is an alternative methodology that can assess the degree of sedimentation by assessing the proportion of sediment sensitive macro- invertebrate families present, to describe {{the extent to which the}} surface of river beds are composed of, or covered by fine sediments. Willand stream is a small tributary of the River Culm in Devon and is located in the heart of a CSF priority catchment area. Four carefully selected sites were monitored over several months to assess the degree of sedimentation and nutrient status with the use of traditional visual and physical methods, in combination with Benthic macro-invertebrates as tools. From the study there were elevated levels of sedimentation and nutrient enrichment with distance upstream. Elevated levels of total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P) and total suspended solids (TSS) were present at the upstream sites with no study sites achieving “good ecological status” for macro-invertebrates. Physical and visual methods also supported this deterioration of stream ecological health, with the upstream sites having the highest % cover of fine sediments and the highest suspendable bed sediment concentrations. By building an ecological and water quality baseline across catchments nationwide we can begin to understand and monitor the impact of CSF measures in reducing <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution</b> to local watercourses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{recurrent}} {{shortcomings of}} water policy in France is {{the control of}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution.</b> Numerous lacunae and incoherencies in the French Rural, Public Health, and Environmental Codes have hindered the effective implementation of efficient protection measures. In this paper, we underline {{the extent to which}} these incoherencies have hampered the emergence of cooperative agreements (CAs) between farmers and drinking water service providers. The theoretical framework of institutional resource regimes (IRRs) provides a key to understanding the failure of public policy to impose restrictions on agricultural land use rights and to encourage voluntary arrangements concerning agricultural practices. The IRR framework was applied before 2005 to 12 cases of public attempts to negotiate a reduction in polluting practices. Our study enabled us to characterise the lack of extent and coherence of the water sector's IRR in France. Since 2005, regulatory changes have extended the scope of this IRR with a view to making water, agriculture and health policies more coherent. We discuss the complexity of the new approach, and question its capacity to mobilise the actors concerned around the territorial reorganisation of agriculture aimed at reducing diffuse pollution.

40|$|For the {{development}} of a sustainable agricultural industry, the Government of Manitoba has been continuously improving programs, policies and regulations aimed at the control of <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution.</b> Manitoba’s pig industry {{is one of the most}} important in Canada and is the most valuable agricultural sector in the Province. However, this industry has been under scrutiny for manure management and its potential implication for the eutrophication of several waterways and waterbodies. One of the challenges of trying to implement regulations or recommendations to control agricultural pollution is to evaluate the economic impacts on the livestock sector. Therefore, the main objective of this project was to propose a framework for the economic evaluation of the impacts of the new phosphorus P regulations. To demonstrate the new regulations, manure application rates were assessed with the help of three different nutrient management options: N-based nutrient recommendations, up to two times crop P 2 O 5 removal and up to one times crop P 2 O 5 removal.

40|$|Contamination {{of surface}} waters with {{pathogenic}} micro-organisms {{is an area}} of growing importance in the context of <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution.</b> Hydrological pathways linking farmed land to receiving waters may operate as vectors of disease transmission. Runoff from grassland systems may be particularly important. In this chapter, we synthesize and evaluate recent and contextual studies relating to the issue. The chapter is necessarily wide ranging and interdisciplinary but we have focused largely on the hydrological, soil-based, and microbiological perspectives. The potential for pathogen presence in livestock wastes is demonstrated through prevalence studies, and subsequent loading of grasslands with contaminated wastes generates a potential surface store of pathogens. These microbes may then be transferred to the wider environment when source and transport drivers are combined in, for example, precipitation events. The delivery of contaminated agricultural drainage waters into first order streams may impact the quality and ecological balance of watercourses if the micro-organisms of concern are still viable. This chapter evaluates both die-off and transfer processes operating from source through to the end point receptors in surface waters. Gaps in knowledge are identified and appear to be due to the contribution of heterogeneity and hydrological complexity of agricultural catchments and the complications of prevalence data derived via a range of methodologies...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the causes of <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution</b> from a very different perspective to that adopted in traditional water quality models: rather than prediction of time-series of water quality parameters at a point, we focus explicitly upon identifying the risky parts of drainage basins using an approach that combined hydrological risk (a measure of how well connected {{a point in the}} drainage basin is) with production risk (a measure of the likelihood of a particular land use producing a particular risk). This is undertaken in a GIS framework, integrating data up from a very small spatial scale (25 m 2) to entire catchments (over 1000 km 2) in order to compare the relative risk of different points in the catchment. This is then followed by downscaling into the riskiest sub-catchments, tributaries, and eventually ﬁelds, to prioritise where to focus alternative land management practices. The model is driven by basic digital data resources. As the model is time-integrating but space-disaggregating, we need to obtain spatial datasets for model validation. Thus we used distributed surveys (of for example ﬁsh populations) to show that the models estimates of spatial variation in risk match available ﬁeld evidence. Given the impetus from the Water Framework Directive and the need to develop catchment-sensitive farming, we believe that this approach could be a major new framework for management of diffuse pollution...|$|E
40|$|Whilst a {{large body}} of plot and {{field-scale}} research exists on the sources, behaviour and mitigation of diffuse water pollution from agriculture, putting this evidence into a practical, context at large spatial scales to inform policy remains challenging. Understanding the behaviour of pollutants (nutrients, sediment, microbes and pesticides) and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies over whole catchments and long timeframes requires new, interdisciplinary approaches to organise and undertake research. This paper provides an introduction to the demonstration test catchments (DTC) programme, which was established in 2009 to gather empirical evidence on the cost-effectiveness of combinations of diffuse pollution mitigation measures at catchment scales. DTC firstly provides a physical platform of instrumented study catchments in which approaches for the mitigation of <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> water <b>pollution</b> can be experimentally tested and iteratively improved. Secondly, it has established national and local knowledge exchange networks between researchers and stakeholders through which research has been co-designed. These have provided a vehicle to disseminate emerging findings to inform policy and land management practice. The role of DTC is that of an outdoor laboratory to develop knowledge and approaches that can be applied in less well studied locations. The research platform approach developed through DTC has brought together disparate research groups from different disciplines and institutions through nationally coordinated activities.

40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution</b> {{remains a}} notable global {{pressure}} on water quality, posing risks to aquatic ecosystems, {{human health and}} water resources {{and as a result}} legislation has been introduced {{in many parts of the}} world to protect water bodies. Due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, water quality models have been increasingly applied to catchments as Decision Support Tools (DSTs) to identify mitigation options that can be introduced to reduce <b>agricultural</b> <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution</b> and improve water quality. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the River Wensum catchment in eastern England with the aim of quantifying the long-term impacts of potential changes to agricultural management practices on river water quality. Calibration and validation were successfully performed at a daily time-step against observations of discharge, nitrate and total phosphorus obtained from high-frequency water quality monitoring within the Blackwater sub-catchment, covering an area of 19. 6 km 2. A variety of mitigation options were identified and modelled, both singly and in combination, and their long-term effects on nitrate and total phosphorus losses were quantified together with the 95 % uncertainty range of model predictions. Results showed that introducing a red clover cover crop to the crop rotation scheme applied within the catchment reduced nitrate losses by 19. 6 %. Buffer strips of 2 m and 6 m width represented the most effective options to reduce total phosphorus losses, achieving reductions of 12. 2 % and 16. 9 %, respectively. This is one of the first studies to quantify the impacts of agricultural mitigation options on long-term water quality for nitrate and total phosphorus at a daily resolution, in addition to providing an estimate of the uncertainties of those impacts. The results highlighted the need to consider multiple pollutants, the degree of uncertainty associated with model predictions and the risk of unintended pollutant impacts when evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation options, and showed that high-frequency water quality datasets can be applied to robustly calibrate water quality models, creating DSTs that are more effective and reliable...|$|R
40|$|We hypothesise {{that climate}} change, {{together}} with intensive agricultural systems, {{will increase the}} transfer of pollutants from land to water and impact on stream health. This study builds, for the first time, an integrated assessment of nutrient transfers, bringing together a) high-frequency data from the outlets of two surface water-dominated, headwater (~ 10 km 2) agricultural catchments, b) event-by-event analysis of nutrient transfers, c) concentration duration curves for comparison with EU Water Framework Directive water quality targets, d) event analysis of location-specific, sub-daily rainfall projections (UKCP, 2009), and e) a linear model relating storm rainfall to phosphorus load. These components, in combination, bring innovation and new insight into the estimation of future phosphorus transfers, which was not available from individual components. The data demonstrated two features of particular concern for climate change impacts. Firstly, {{the bulk of the}} suspended sediment and total phosphorus (TP) load (greater than 90 % and 80 % respectively) was transferred during the highest discharge events. The linear model of rainfall-driven TP transfers estimated that, with the projected increase in winter rainfall (+ 8 % to + 17 % in the catchments by 2050 s), annual event loads might increase by around 9 % on average, if agricultural practices remain unchanged. Secondly, events following dry periods of several weeks, particularly in summer, were responsible for high concentrations of phosphorus, but relatively low loads. The high concentrations, associated with low flow, could become more frequent or last longer in the future, with a corresponding increase in the length of time that threshold concentrations (e. g. for water quality status) are exceeded. The results suggest that in order to build resilience in stream health and help mitigate potential increases in <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> water <b>pollution</b> due to climate change, land management practices should target controllable risk factors, such as soil nutrient status, soil condition and crop cover...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of rivers on the groundwater quality in alluvial aquifers can be twofold: direct and indirect. Rivers {{can have a}} direct influence via recharge and an indirect one by controlling the distribution of fine-grained, organic-carbon rich flood deposits that induce reducing conditions. These direct and indirect influences were quantified for a large alluvial aquifer on the Swiss Plateau (50 km 2) in interaction with an Alpine river using nitrate as an example. The hydrochemistry and stable isotope composition of water were characterized using a network of 115 piezometers and pumping stations covering the entire aquifer. Aquifer properties, land use and recharge zones were evaluated as well. This information provided detailed insight into the factors that control the spatial variability of groundwater quality. Three main factors were identified: (1) <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution</b> sources; (2) dilution processes resulting from river water infiltrations, revealed by the δ 18 O H 2 O and δ 2 H H 2 O contents of groundwater; and (3) denitrification processes, controlled by the spatial variability of flood deposits governed by fluvial depositional processes. It was possible to quantify the dependence of the nitrate concentration on these three factors at any sampling point of the aquifer using an end-member mixingmodel,where the average nitrate concentration in recharge from the agricultural area was evaluated at 52 mg/L, and the nitrate concentration of infiltrating river at approximately 6 mg/L.

40|$|International audienceIn Europe, 30 % of {{groundwater}} bodies {{are considered to}} be at risk of not achieving the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 'good status' objective by 2015, and 45 % are in doubt of doing so. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution</b> {{is one of the main}} pressures affecting groundwater bodies. To tackle this problem, the WFD requires Member States to design and implement cost-effective programs of measures to achieve the 'good status' objective by 2027 at the latest. Hitherto, action plans have mainly consisted of promoting the adoption of Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES). This raises a number of questions concerning the effectiveness of such schemes for improving groundwater status, and the economic implications of their implementation. We propose a hydro-economic model that combines a hydrogeological model to simulate groundwater quality evolution with agronomic and economic components to assess the expected costs, effectiveness, and benefits of AES implementation. This hydro-economic model can be used to identify cost-effective AES combinations at groundwater-body scale and to show the benefits to be expected from the resulting improvement in groundwater quality. The model is applied here to a rural area encompassing the Hesbaye aquifer, a large chalk aquifer which supplies about 230, 000 inhabitants in the city of Liege (Belgium) and is severely contaminated by agricultural nitrates. We show that the time frame within which improvements in the Hesbaye groundwater quality can be expected may be much longer than that required by the WFD. Current WFD programs based on AES may be inappropriate for achieving the 'good status' objective in the most productive agricultural areas, in particular because these schemes are insufficiently attractive. Achieving 'good status' by 2027 would demand a substantial change in the design of AES, involving costs that may not be offset by benefits in the case of chalk aquifers with long renewal times...|$|E

A strong linear relationship was found between natural fluorescence intensity and slurry concentration. The ratio of indices of tryptophan-like and fulvic/humic-like fluorescence (TI:FI) varied between 2 and 5 {{for a range of}} slurries sampled from Devon farms and allowed slurry to be distinguished from uncontaminated drainage waters (TI:FI < 1). Incidental losses of slurry, indicated by significantly enhanced TI:FI ratios, high TI and high ammonium levels, occurred via the drain flow pathway of the drained lysimeters during the first small event following slurry-spreading. The maximum estimated loss from a single lysimeter was 2 - 8 kg or 0. 004 - 0. 016 % of the applied slurry. In the second larger storm event, some five weeks later, significantly enhanced TI:FI ratios in the drain flows were not associated with high TI but with high nitrate levels and, compared to the earlier storm, an increase in the humification index. This implies the loss of slurry decomposition products during this event but further work is needed to validate this. There was no significant enhancement of TI:FI in the surface/throughflow pathways of the drained or undrained lysimeters in either of the events. The observed change over a period of weeks in the strength and nature of the fluorescence signal from spread slurry restricts quantification of slurry losses to those immediately after slurry spreading. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates the utility of fluorescence as an indicator of slurry in drainage waters and the importance of field drains in <b>diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution...</b>|$|E

Nitrate concentrations can vary greatly over the yearly hydrological cycle, but following mechanisms that are still poorly understood, given the very complex structure in terms of hydrogeological and hydrological exchanges between groundwater and surface network. This results in a close relationship between the quality of the groundwaters and that of the rivers also used for drinking water supply.

Thus the benefits of intercepting NO 3 [...] N could be offset by enhanced emissions of the potent greenhouse gases, nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4), from buffer strips and wetlands. This research aimed to: (1) quantify the direct N 2 O emissions from an irrigated buffer strip (IBS), using nitrate-rich agricultural drainage water, compared to a non-irrigated control (CP); (2) improve the understanding of N 2 O production and consumption within soils using controlled soil monolith experiments; (3) assess the effectiveness of a small (60 m 2) instream wetland at intercepting and removing diffuse NO 3 [...] N pollution, and quantify pollution swapping in the form of CH 4 and N 2 O emissions; (4) assess the production of CH 4 and N 2 O within the sediment, and their emissions as well as inorganic-N concentrations in the overlying water column in response to temperature and turbulence, using intact wetland sediment and membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS).

40|$|<b>Diffuse</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution</b> {{presents}} {{a major challenge}} to global water quality management, requiring the adoption of new land management practices such as constructed agricultural wetlands.

Therefore this research examines the potential for agricultural wetlands to ‘swap’ local improvements in water quality, for (1) increased pollution to groundwaters and (2) to the atmosphere. GHG exchanges from an agricultural wetland (area 0. 032 ha) in Cumbria, UK were monitored over an 18 month period, using floating gas chambers, ebullition traps and diffusive gas exchange models. While the wetland was a net sink of particulate C and N, mean net releases of CO 2 (2249 – 5724 mg m- 2 d - 1), N 2 O (0. 93 – 2. 04 mg m- 2 d - 1) and CH 4 (169 - 456 mg m - 2 d - 1) were significantly greater than those from adjacent riparian land. Wetland releases of CH 4 were most significant in terms of potential atmospheric impact compared to other wetland GHG releases. Shallow groundwater samples extracted from a piezometer network surrounding the study site, illustrated that retained sediments acted as a source of NH 4 -N and DOC to surface and local groundwaters but mitigated leaching and outward transport of NO 3 -N to surface and groundwaters. Field and laboratory microcosm experiments demonstrated that pollutant swapping of GHGs and nutrients may be increased during periods of reduced water oxygen content associated with eutrophic conditions. In wetland designs with water depths > 0. 5 m, anoxic conditions may perpetuate in lower water column zones and facilitate increased CH 4 and NH 4 -N production and storage. Additionally, microcosm studies identified that disturbance of bottom sediments by stormflow may elicit heightened GHG and nutrient releases. Therefore the net impact of wetland construction in catchments may need reconsiderations, with respect to the potentially detrimental effects on water and the atmosphere. However upscaling of observations suggests that wetland implementation in the UK is unlikely to significantly increase GHG budgets. Use of shallower wetlands with vegetation or inlet baffles may reduce CH 4 emissions by encouraging oxidation and protecting sediments from storm flows...|$|E
40|$|The {{need and}} growing {{interest}} on raw water sources protection {{is a great}} concern in river basin planning and management. Problems related to drinking water sources can range from shortage of water to water quality degradation mainly due to intensive urbanisation and industrial policies as well as uncontrolled agricultural practices. The river Cavado basin, located in the north-western region of Portugal, has a very intensive use for water supply, irrigation and hydropower generation. New water supply project serving the Oporto Metropolitan Area, with one million people and a design flow of 2. 7 m 3 /s, will introduce new challenges in the river water quality management. Since the river Cavado flow regime is artificially controlled by reservoirs, a flow discharge policy is needed. Moreover, the consideration of wastewater loads in the basin  wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent discharges, untreated industrial wastewater discharges and <b>agricultural</b> <b>diffuse</b> <b>pollution</b>  must be considered to guarantee adequate river water quality for drinking water supply purposes. This paper illustrates {{the application of a}} decision support system (DSS) methodology in the river basin, and describes the results obtained from the simulation of the river water quantity and quality, considering various planning scenarios, in order to establish operational standards at the new water treatment plant (WTP) ...|$|R

40|$|Wallonia (Southern Region of Belgium) {{implemented}} the Nitrates Directive through a first actions plan in 2002 {{followed by a}} second action plan in 2007. It designated vulnerable zones and introduced various mandatory practices {{in order to reduce}} the nitrate contamination risk.. In Wallonia, nitrate-related problems are obvious in several groundwater bodies and their trends over the past 30 years are worrying. The main part of the contamination level is due to <b>agricultural</b> <b>diffuse</b> <b>pollution.</b> Nevertheless, some pollution peaks are observed mainly coming from domestic sewage. In order to assess the global effectiveness of all the mitigation practices, we have been developing a hydrological model spatially distributed using a 1 km² grid cell on the whole Region (16 900 km²). The EPICgrid model represents the root zone and the vadose zone. In Wallonia, groundwater tables are more than 30 m deep in 8 % of the territory. It is therefore of major importance to fill the gap between the root zone and the groundwater bodies. It allows us to assess the nitrate transfer time and forecast the mitigation measures’ effect in time, space and amplitude. On the ground, runoff and sediment yield are modelled at the small watershed scale. This report presents an complete analysis of the mitigation measures implemented in Wallonia and their effects forecasted until 2015...|$|R
