25|$|Ball {{was never}} {{considered}} an especially effective U.S. Senator {{in terms of}} gaining patronage for Delaware. He became a rival of T. Coleman du Pont, the former President of E. <b>I.</b> <b>du</b> Pont de Nemours and Company and the effective leader of the Republican Party in Delaware. Du Pont had hoped to be the Republican candidate for U.S. President in 1920, but his efforts began to collapse when Ball deserted him after the first ballot at the 1920 Republican National Convention. Then, in 1922, Ball failed to support du Pont as he sought a full term in the U.S. Senate himself. By 1924 du Pont {{thought he had a}} score to settle and defeated Ball for their party’s nomination for a full term in 1924.|$|E
25|$|Buck {{was elected}} Governor of Delaware in 1928, {{defeating}} Democrat Charles M. Wharton. During this term the New York Stock Market crashed, signaling {{the beginning of}} the Great Depression. Fortunately, about the same time, Alfred <b>I.</b> <b>du</b> Pont had begun an effort to provide financial relief to those in the most need. Having failed to get such relief enacted by the Delaware General Assembly, on November 1, 1929 du Pont began mailing out personal checks of sixteen dollars to some eight hundred people. After spending some $350,000 of his own money, du Pont, appointed by Buck as Chairman of the Old Age Welfare Commission, persuaded the General Assembly to take over the program in late 1930. As the economic situation continued to worsen, Buck called the General Assembly into session in November 1932 and also persuaded them to pass a $2 million emergency relief measure.|$|E
25|$|Edward Ball {{was born}} at Ball's Neck in Northumberland County, Virginia and educated in the one-room Shiloh Schoolhouse. After {{completing}} primary school, he convinced his father to let him quit school and get a job. He had always been obsessed with making money; at one time, he prospected for gold in Alaska. However, when Ball's older sister, Jessie Ball became the third wife of Alfred <b>I.</b> <b>du</b> Pont in 1921, Edward was given {{the chance of a}} lifetime. He began working for his brother-in-law in 1923 at the lofty salary of $5,000 a year, and moved to Delaware where he was publicly named manager of the Clean Food Products Company. Privately, he was Mr. du Pont’s confidential business partner and became a shrewd financier and caretaker of the du Pont de Nemours estate fortune. After Jessie & Alfred moved to Florida in 1926, Edward joined them.|$|E
