40|$|AbstractSince {{the phase}} out of Halon {{extinguishers}} in the 1980 s, hot aerosol fire suppression technology has gained much attention. Unlike traditional inert gas, foam, water mist and Halon fire suppression <b>agents,</b> hot aerosol <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> {{do not need}} to be driven out by pressurized gases and can extinguish class A, B, C, D and K fires at 30 to 200 g/m 3. Generally, hot aerosol <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> technology has developed from a generation I oil tank suppression system to a generation III strontium salt based S-type system. S-type hot aerosol <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> technology greatly solves the corrosion problem of electrical devices and electronics compared to potassium salt based generation I & II hot aerosol <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> technology. As substitutes for Halon agents, the ODP and GWP values of hot <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> aerosols are nearly zero, but those fine aerosol particles can cause adverse health effects once inhaled by human. As for configurations of hot aerosol <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> devices, fixed or portable cylindrical canisters are the most common among generation II & III hot aerosol fire extinguishers across the world, while generation I hot aerosol fire suppression systems are integrated with the oil tank as a whole. Some countries like the U. S., Australia, Russia and China, etc. have already developed standards for manufacturing and quality control of hot aerosol <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> and norms for hot aerosol <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> system design under different fire protection scenarios. Coolants in hot aerosol fire suppression systems, which are responsible for reducing hot aerosol temperature to avoid secondary fire risk are reviewed for the first time. Cooling effects are generally achieved through vaporization and endothermic chemical decomposition of coolants. Finally, this review discussed areas applying generation I, II or III hot aerosol fire suppression technologies. The generation III hot aerosol <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> system is most applicable, especially in areas involving delicate electrical and electronic equipments.

50|$|Despite their effectiveness, {{chemical}} fire extinguishing agents {{are not without}} disadvantages. In the early 20th century, carbon tetrachloride was extensively used as a dry cleaning solvent, a refrigerant and as a <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent.</b> In time, it was found carbon tetrachloride could lead to severe health effects. From the mid-1960s Halon 1301 was the industry standard for protecting high-value assets {{from the threat of}} fire. Halon 1301 had many benefits as a fire suppression agent; it is fast-acting, safe for assets and required minimal storage space. Halon 1301's major drawbacks are that it depletes atmospheric ozone and is potentially harmful to humans. Since 1987, some 191 nations have signed The Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. The Protocol is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion. Among these were halogenated hydrocarbons often used in fire suppression. As a result, manufacturers have focused on alternatives to Halon 1301 and Halon 1211 (halogenated hydrocarbons). A number of countries have also taken steps to mandate the removal of installed Halon systems. Most notably these include Germany and Australia, the first two countries in the world to require this action. In both of these countries complete removal of installed Halon systems has been completed except for a very few essential-use applications. The European Union is currently undergoing a similar mandated removal of installed Halon systems.|$|E

5000|$|The solid {{compound}} {{found inside}} the aerosol generator units uses environment friendly, naturally occurring potassium salts to extinguish fire by inhibiting the chemical chain reactions in the flame on a molecular level. On activation, the compound {{is transformed into}} a condensed aerosol consisting mainly of (K2CO3), (...) (vapor), N2 and CO2. The gas-type properties of the aerosol facilitate its even distribution in the protected volume as well as its flow into the natural convection currents of combustion. The solid particles of potassium salts, which are of a few microns in size, are suspended in an inert gas that displays a high surface to reaction mass ratio. When the aerosol reacts with the flame, Potassium radicals (K*) are formed mainly from the disassociation of (K2CO3). The K*s bind to other flame free radicals (hydroxyls - OH-) forming stable products such as KOH. This action extinguishes fire without depleting the ambient oxygen content. KOH reacts further in the presence of CO2 and forms (K2CO3). It is a sustainable approach that challenges conventional firefighting technologies of cooling, starvation or smothering. The physical and chemical characteristics of the technology do not pose a threat to humans or the environment. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has listed FirePro technology in its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) under the stratospheric ozone protection provisions of the Clean Air Act. The Green Label scheme recommends that they are ozone-friendly and do not contain CFC’s.

40|$|With highly {{accelerated}} {{developments in}} computing and communications technology, society's overall dependence on this equipment {{is becoming increasingly}} acute. In areas such as critical electronic data processing centres and telecommunication hubs, {{one of the main}} protection objectives is to achieve minimum operational disruption, as downtime resulting from a fire condition could lead to huge financial losses. Minimising negative impact on an organization and the need for a sound basis in the decision making process are the fundamental reasons why companies implement fire risk management for their essential information technology systems. For many years a key element used to protect these critical assets was the installation of a fixed Halon 1301 gas extinguishing system. Often, the mere presence of a computer was sufficient justification to install such a system and little thought was given to any systematic fire risk assessment of the installation. This led to the use of Halon 1301 where other <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> systems and protection techniques could have been applied with equal effectiveness and at comparable costs. The cessation of production of halon {{as a result of the}} Montreal Protocol gave fresh impetus to the development of suitable alternative <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents.</b> It also offered fire protection engineers an opportunity to re-evaluate existing loss control techniques and to examine alternative fire protection strategies. However, it is argued in this study, that an appropriate level of automatic fire protection can only be determined by the use of a suitable quantitative risk assessment and a number of such methodologies are critically examined. There are a significant number of contributing factors that must be considered when deciding which fire suppression system to select for a new installation or whether to retrofit fire suppression on a legacy platform. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a methodology to quantify any fire suppression technology by its life cycle cost and then to apply informed technical opinion into this system. The results of this assessment procedure offer a number of possible fire engineering solutions including a quite diverse range of automatic <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> techniques and these are discussed and evaluated in detail. Inevitably, a high proportion of such critical risks will require the installation of an automatic fire suppression system. The main halocarbon and inert replacement <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> are therefore critically compared and contrasted for their suitability in protecting these facilities. A complete review of these <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> was conducted which focused on suppression mechanisms; quantification of their performance and qualities; interaction with a fire and potential damage to electrical equipment from the release of a given agent. It is shown that all the post-halon <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> are deficient in some important areas. Major issues such as the formation of thermal decomposition products, the protection of continuously energized electrical circuits and the adequacy of the specified design and extinguishing concentrations have generally not been adequately addressed. Unfortunately, some of these issues are not even resolved in the current gaseous <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> standards which offer minimal advice from either a design or installation standpoint. This study demonstrates that existing international design standards are deficient in some fundamental areas and that, in a number of circumstances, systems installed to these standards are inadequate to fully protect the hazard in question. A number of recommendations are presented to address some of these deficiencies. Finally, a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology for the selection of suitable <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> is proposed. Initially, this attempts to synthesize the results derived from the critical <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> review and then applies an application weighting factor based on expert consensus to provide a final score for a particular suppression mechanisms suitability to protect a given application...|$|R
40|$|Research in {{microgravity}} (low-gravity) combustion promises innovations {{and improvements}} in fire prevention and response for human-crew spacecraft. Findings indicate that material flammability and fire spread in microgravity are significantly affected by atmospheric flow rate, oxygen concentration, and diluent composition. This information can lead to modifications and correlations to standard material-assessment tests for prediction of fire resistance in space. Research on smoke-particle changes in microgravity promises future improvements and increased sensitivity of smoke detectors in spacecraft. Research on <b>fire</b> suppression by <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> and venting can yield new information on effective control of the rare, but serious fire events in spacecraft...|$|R
