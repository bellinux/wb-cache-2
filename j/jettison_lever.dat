50|$|A {{special feature}} of the XP-55 was a {{propeller}} <b>jettison</b> <b>lever</b> located inside the cockpit to prevent the pilot from hitting the propeller during bailout. The jettison device was invented by W. Jerome Peterson {{while working as a}} design engineer for Curtiss-Wright.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to this design over {{the more traditional}} system of placing one engine on each wing, the most important being power from two engines with the frontal area (and thus drag) of a single-engine design, allowing for higher performance. It also keeps {{the weight of the}} twin powerplants near, or on, the aircraft centerline, increasing the roll rate compared to a traditional twin. In addition, a single engine failure does not lead to asymmetric thrust, and in normal flight there is no net torque, so the plane is easy to handle. The choice of a full [...] "four-surface" [...] set of cruciform tail surfaces in the Do 335's rear fuselage design, included a ventral vertical fin-rudder assembly to project downwards from the extreme rear of the fuselage, {{in order to protect the}} rear propeller from an accidental ground strike on takeoff. The presence of the rear pusher propeller also mandated the provision for an ejection seat for safe escape from a damaged aircraft, and designing the rear propeller and dorsal fin mounts to use explosive bolts to jettison them before an ejection was attempted â€” as well as twin canopy <b>jettison</b> <b>levers,</b> one per side located to either side of the forward cockpit interior just below the sills of the five-panel windscreen's sides, to jettison the canopy from atop the cockpit before ejection.|$|R
