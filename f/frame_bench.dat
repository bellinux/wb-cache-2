5|$|Cave 21 is {{approached}} {{through a}} small crevice from cave 20, {{in the absence of}} any direct approach. Its living space has a veranda of fairly large size. There is also an inner cell with a grooved door <b>frame.</b> Seating <b>benches</b> have been cut into shallow spaces both in the cell and in the veranda.|$|R
50|$|Slotted angle (also {{sometimes}} referred to as slotted angle iron) is a system of reusable metal strips used to construct shelving, <b>frames,</b> work <b>benches,</b> equipment stands and other structures. The name derives, first, from the use of elongated slots punched into the metal at uniform intervals to enable assembly of structures fixed with nuts and bolts, and second, from the longitudinal folding of the metal strips to form a right angle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} <b>frame</b> a test <b>bench</b> for {{reluctance}} synchronous motors is presented. The connection schemes {{corresponding to the}} steady state and dynamic regimes are detailed. The acquisition program, special designed and carried out, is also presented. The paper ends with a few suggestive experimental results...|$|R
60|$|She {{followed}} him into the gloomy, smoky, dingy room. Bare yellow <b>benches</b> <b>framed</b> an empty square of brown linoleum. A labouring man with his wife and a child sat waiting with the stolid patience of the poor in one corner. They were starting on some Saturday afternoon excursion, and had mistimed their train. Maude Selby and Frank Crosse took the other corner. He drew a jeweller's box from his pocket and removed the lid. Something sparkled among the wadding.|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of the thermo-mechanical unit of a cryogenic cooler may originate a resonant excitation of the spacecraft <b>frame,</b> optical <b>bench</b> or components of the optical train. This may result in degraded functionality of the inherently vibration sensitive space-borne infrared imager directly associated with the cooler or neighboring instrumentation typically requiring a quiet micro-g environment. The best practice for controlling cooler induced vibration relies {{on the principle of}} active momentum cancellation. In particular, the pressure wave generator typically contains two oppositely actuated piston compressors, while the single piston expander is counterbalanced by an auxiliary active counter-balancer. Active vibration cancellation is supervised by a dedicated DSP feed-forward controller, where the error signals are delivered by the vibration sensors (accelerometers or load cells). This can result in oversized, overweight and overpriced cryogenic coolers with degraded electromechanical performance and impaired reliability. The authors are advocating a reliable, compact, cost and power saving approach capitalizing on the combined application of a passive tuned dynamic absorber and a low frequency vibration isolator. This concept appears to be especially suitable for low budget missions involving mini and micro satellites, where price, size, weight and power consumption are of concern...|$|R
50|$|The {{substantially}} intact Elgin Vale sawmill is {{an exceptional}} {{example of a}} steam driven softwood sawmill, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. Located adjacent to a creek for water and {{in close proximity to}} well timbered areas, the mill is positioned below sloping ground to assist the movement of logs. Internally, the layout and the sequence designed to maximise the efficient movement and cutting of logs within the sawmill remain: the long open-sided tin and timber shed, log ramp, breakdown saw, number one and two saw, <b>frame</b> saw, docking <b>benches,</b> waste chute, rails and trolleys. Below the main floor are the boiler, engine and attached drive equipment that provide the power for the operations on the main floor.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the effect of forces applied to pedals and cranks on the strain imposed to an {{instrumented}} bicycle motocross (BMX) frame. Using results from a finite element analysis to determine the localisation of highest stress, eight strain gauges were located on the down tube, the seat tube and the right chain stay. Before the pedaling tests, static loads were applied to the <b>frame</b> during <b>bench</b> tests. Two pedaling conditions have been analysed. In the first, the rider was in static standing position on the pedals and applied maximal muscular isometric force to the right pedal. The second pedaling condition corresponds to three pedaling sprint tests at submaximal intensities at 150, 300 and 550 W on a cycle-trainer. The results showed that smaller strain was observed in the pedaling condition than in the rider static standing position condition. The highest strains were located in the seat tube and the right chain stay near the bottom bracket area. The maximum stress observed through all conditions was 41 MPa on the right chain stay. This stress was 11 times lower than the yield stress of the frame material (460 MPa). This protocol could help to adapt the frame design to the riders as a function of their force and mechanical power output. These results could also help design BMX frames for specific populations (females) and rider morphology...|$|R
5000|$|It {{took three}} days for {{investigators}} to recover {{all of the}} victims from the building. They removed the fire debris in five-gallon buckets as they sifted through the collapsed second floor. The debris included wooden pallets, statues, piles of furniture, mobile homes, and mannequins. The makeshift hallways {{on the first floor}} were constructed of [...] "aggregates of salvaged and scavenged materials, such as pianos, organs, windows, wood benches, lumber, and innumerable other items stacked next to and on top of each other." [...] The live-work spaces were separated by a variety of things, including [...] "wooden studs, steel beams, doors, window frames, bed <b>frames,</b> railings, pianos, <b>benches,</b> chairs, intact motorhomes and trailers, portions of trailers, corrugated metal sheeting, tapestries, plywood, sculptures, tree stumps and tree limbs." [...] Investigators concluded that the fire originated in northwest area of the ground floor, but were unable to pinpoint the cause of the fire due to the extreme damage to the building and its contents.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a natural}} bowl where the outdoor theater would be located along 45th Street. The seats for the {{audience}} faced west, the stage was located near {{the foot of a}} swale and a hill with trees would provide a natural backdrop. Des Moines landscape architect Francis Asbury Robinson finalized the details and the theater was constructed in 1931. The master plan was to be carried out in two phases. The first phase called for seating to be constructed in the “lower portion” near the stage. An “upper portion” for seating would be built in stage two and has never been built. A reflecting pool was built between the seating area and the stage. A dressing room was constructed to the southwest of the stage. Initially, the seating was composed of wood benches with backs. They were replaced in 1934 with benches made of wood slats with a back that were mounted in wrought iron <b>frames.</b> The new <b>benches</b> were bolted to concrete blocks set in the ground. Funds for the new benches were provided by the Works Progress Administration. There was also a small frame structure {{in the back of the}} seating area that was used as a projection booth for films. It was not part of the original designs for the theater and it was last known to exists in 1955.|$|R
