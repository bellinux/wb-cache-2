5|$|Sigmund Freud {{may have}} been among the first to stress the {{potential}} effect of loss of the mother on the developing child, but his concern was less with the actual experience of maternal care than with the anxiety the child might <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> loss of the nourishing breast. As little of Freud's theory was based on actual observations of infants, little effort was made to consider the effects of real experiences of loss.|$|E
500|$|Earlier in the episode, Homer and June Bellamy {{attend an}} in-store {{appearance}} {{as part of}} the promotion for the new character Poochie. They are asked a question of internal consistency, like the show's fans do all the time; Homer says to the fan who asks the question, [...] "Why would a man whose shirt says 'Genius at Work' spend all his time watching a children's cartoon show?" [...] This is again a reflection on how the writers <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fans obsessing about internal consistency.|$|E

"Some kind of {{artifice}} that Hollywood can provide, {{that is so}} {{wide and}} has a graphic story-line about {{it as well as}} some humor about it, and to show the beauty, the scariness, the sexiness and the loneliness that one's success can be, 'cause everybody's dreaming about Hollywood, no matter what. The expectation can be very dangerous, and maybe for somebody like Madonna, who might be at a point, to realize that to be on the top is maybe not that important. That's what I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> video." ...|$|E

500|$|At Paleyfest {{in early}} 2007, Steve Carell later {{recalled}} that {{he enjoyed the}} episode [...] "because it spoke {{to the fact that}} Michael is not a homophobe; he just doesn't understand the world. They are two very different things. It's not that he's intrinsically racist or homophobic or sexist, he just doesn't have a frame of reference. He's not capable of understanding. And once he does glean some understanding he misinterprets it into something altogether. But I think at least the way I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character is he's a decent heart, a decent person and he's just trying his best." ...|$|E

No, I don't have any regrets about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Robert Christgau, The Lost Tapes {{abandons}} the thug {{persona of}} Nas' previous work {{in favor of}} more sensitive, nostalgic, and autobiographical lyrics. Slate magazine's David Samuels interpreted [...] "a message that begins with a rejection of the materialism of his ... rival Jay-Z" [...] and [...] "the home truth about how most kids in the projects <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> real-life gangstas who live in their neighborhoods", citing [...] "No Idea's Original" [...] as an example. New York Daily News writer Jim Farber commented on his lyrical observations, [...] "Nas focuses on linear scenarios and on human motivations ... "unlike many hard rappers, Nas' tales of ghetto horror are not covert boasts but expressions of true fear". Farber took note of [...] "a cinematic tale of self-destruction in 'Drunk by Myself,' and a compelling autobiography narrated from the womb in 'Fetus.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{opened in}} 3,929 theaters in the United States and Canada on May 16, 2008. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film a PG. To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered {{a shot of}} a fallen helmet {{to make clear that}} it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made {{numerous}} edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining [...] "When you sit down and you're watching it, and you see the kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're doing all of these things because you're essentially making the film for yourself. When you start showing it to an audience, that then influences how you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} siege of Riverrun, Weiss noted about Brienne and Jaime's reunion that [...] "Jaime didn't expect to see Brienne {{necessarily}} ever again, he certainly didn't expect to see her marching into his military camp. And his relationship is obviously very complicated, and fraught, and has undercurrents that he's uncomfortable with feeling." [...] Benioff continued about Brienne's escape, [...] "It's these two who are not quite sure how they <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other, and he lets her go. He'd be well within his rights to send his men after her, to capture her, and it wouldn't be that hard to capture her since she's being slowly rowed away by Podrick, but he doesn't. She might technically be an enemy now that she's serving Sansa Stark, who is still obviously a suspect in Joffrey's murder, but she's not Jaime's enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> young people who listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's {{like you have a}} choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{perceived}} adversaries, Bessie showed neither patience nor respect, {{especially those}} {{with whom she had}} once shared common ground on the far left. Apart from her attacks on Bevan, she displayed particular scorn for the future Labour Party leader Michael Foot, whose practice in the 1950s of writing articles attacking the Labour leadership for right-wing newspapers was, she thought, disloyal. A much reported exchange between her and Churchill has her accusing him of being drunk, and him concurring but adding: [...] "My dear you are ugly, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be ugly"—or similar words. There is no reliable evidence that any such exchange took place; despite its popularity, commentators are generally sceptical. According to the columnist Simon Hoggart, similar stories involving other figures had been circulating for years; he concluded: [...] "If it sounds true, if it echoes something we <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> politician, then it will cling to him or her as if bonded with superglue".|$|E
500|$|Upon Blaine's first appearance, Criss {{described}} his character {{as being a}} [...] "very charismatic, put-together, composed guy." [...] He stated that although Blaine is gay, he is not [...] "overly queeny, and not too butch either," [...] and that while his sexuality is a [...] "huge part of who he is", {{it is not a}} major facet of how he wishes to be perceived. Due to similarities which stem from their shared sexuality, Blaine [...] "sees a lot of himself in Kurt, in terms of experiences and the way they <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world around them. He feels the need to impart his knowledge, be a source of strength for him, and really help him through what he's going through." [...] Initially, Criss felt that the most important element of his character was to give Kurt [...] "someone he can relate to", and demonstrate that Kurt could have [...] "a young out male friend, a support system".|$|E

2500|$|Miyamoto, and Nintendo as a whole, {{do not use}} focus groups. Instead, Miyamoto {{figures out}} if a game is fun for himself. He says that if he enjoys it, others will too. He elaborates, citing the {{conception}} of the Pokémon series as an example, [...] "And that's the point – Not to make something sell, something very popular, but to love something, and make something that we creators can love. It's the very core feeling we should have in making games."

2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I {{want you to do}} is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." ...|$|E

2500|$|Her use of {{repetition}} is ascribed to her search for {{descriptions of the}} [...] "bottom nature" [...] of her characters, such as in The Making of Americans where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as [...] "As I was saying" [...] and [...] "There will be now a history of her." [...] Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with [...] "too much association". Social judgement is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power {{to decide how to}} think and <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> writing. Anxiety, fear and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative.|$|E
2500|$|Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream was {{inspired}} by both [...] "Happy House" [...] and [...] "Christine" [...] because they were pop songs with dark subject matter. He stated: [...] "That's the idea, yeah—to use the conventional way of constructing a pop song to communicate what I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world and my take on relationships. It's a twist that makes it darker than it seems. When we were growing up, Siouxsie and the Banshees were {{doing this kind of}} stuff—they were getting in the charts with songs about mental hospitals! [...] "Happy House"? That was nearly number fucking 10 in the charts! 'Christine, the strawberry girl, Christine, banana split lady'—they were writing about a girl with schizophrenia! They were getting in pop magazines and on TV; they were getting played on daytime radio. It's fucking subversive! They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream".|$|E

One question asked by the interviewer was: [...] "How {{do you deal with}} the Jews who are besieging al-Aqsa and are scattered around it?" [...] which was translated as: [...] "How do you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Jews?" [...] MEMRI cut out {{the first part of the}} reply and combined it with the answer to the next question, which, Whitaker claimed, made [...] "Arabs look more anti-semitic than they are". Carmon admitted this was an error in translation but defended combining the two replies as both questions referred to the same subject. [...] Carmon rejected other claims of distortion by Whitaker, saying: [...] "it is perhaps reassuring that you had to go back so far to find a mistake... You accused us of distortion by omission but when asked to provide examples of trends and views we have missed, you have failed to answer." [...] Carmon also accused Whitaker of [...] "using insults rather than evidence" [...] in his criticism of MEMRI.|$|E
