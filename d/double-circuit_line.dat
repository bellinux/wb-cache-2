Previous research on induced voltage {{has been focused}} on single-circuit lines in the distribution system. However, the <b>double-circuit</b> <b>lines,</b> referred to as parallel distribution lines, are widely used in distribution systems because they have significant economic and environmental advantages over single-circuit lines. Therefore, a study on the induced voltage in <b>double-circuit</b> <b>lines</b> is needed. This paper presents a method of calculating the induced voltage in a parallel distribution system using four-terminal parameters and vector analysis. The calculation method is verified by the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) simulation...|$|R

The problem is when cross-country faults occur, which means that fault is incepted in the protected zone and also outside {{at the same time}} or after short break. For such a situation the differential protection may trip external faults incorrectly or may not trip internal faults. This situation should be analyzed and suggestions for protection improvement proposed. Signals for tests originated from ATP-EMTP simulations.

A novel algorithm which is called bounded data uncertainties (BDU) for digital relaying is proposed. The proposed method is an enhanced least-square algorithm, which unlike classical least-square, it allows perturbations in data matrix and measurements or observations. MATLAB programs have been developed to compare the BDU with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithm. The results show the superiority of BDU over DFT method. An existing three-phase <b>double-circuit</b> <b>line</b> between Kuala Krai (KKRI) and Gua Musang (GMSG) substations has been selected as a case study for conversion to six-phase single-circuit system. Using the configuration line data provided by TNB, parameters of six-phase line are calculated. The calculation of parameters of line is also carried out using software package PSCAD/EMTDC. The results from MATLAB and PSCAD programs have revealed that the positive-sequence inductive reactance of six-phase single-circuit is higher than the three-phase <b>double-circuit</b> <b>line.</b> Furthermore, the results of MATLAB show that the maximum fault current occurs for phases a-b-d-f fault. Based on the maximum fault current, the necessary components have been obtained to construct the six-phase prototype. The prototype is successfully developed which resembles six-phase line of the KKRI-GMSG. The phase difference of voltages of the six-phase prototype has been successfully validated by LabVIEW software package.

40|$|This paper puts {{forward a}} novel {{algorithm}} for locating faults on <b>double-circuit</b> transmission <b>lines</b> using two-end unsynchronized current measurements. The algorithm {{does not require}} line parameters, which is a radical step forward compared to existing approaches, which require this information, {{so it can be}} considered as a settings-free algorithm. Only the positive-sequence current phasors during the fault are processed for determining the sought distance to fault and the synchronization angle, limiting thus the amount of data needed to be transferred from each line terminal. The proposed algorithm is derived by applying the Kirchhoff's voltage law around the parallel circuits loops during the fault. The algorithm is applicable for both transposed and untransposed <b>double-circuit</b> <b>lines</b> and is independent of the fault type. Evaluation studies using reliable Alternative Transients Program-Electromagnetic Transients Program simulation data verify that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is very high under various fault resistances, fault locations, and source impedances. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|In modern power {{transmission}} systems, the <b>double-circuit</b> <b>line</b> structure is in-creasingly adopted. However, {{due to the}} mutual coupling between the parallel lines it is quite challenging to design accurate fault location algorithms. Moreover, the widely used series compensator and its protective device introduce harmonics and non-linearities to the transmission lines, which make fault location more difficult. To tackle these problems, this dissertation is committed to developing advanced fault location methods for double-circuit and series-compensated transmission lines. Algorithms utilizing sparse measurements for pinpointing the location of short-circuit faults on double-circuit lines are proposed. By decomposing the original net-work into three sequence networks, the bus impedance matrix for each network {{with the addition of}} the fictitious fault bus can be formulated.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} non-pilot {{distance}} protection of a double-circuit transmission line. Negative {{impact of the}} reactance effect, appearing in measuring a fault loop impedance, on operation of the relay is discussed. An adaptive algorithm allowing one to prevent the relay from mis- or mal-operation caused by the reactance effect is introduced. The algorithm is designed for a standard availability of measurements {{from one end of}} the <b>double-circuit</b> <b>line,</b> i. e. when three-phase voltage and current from the faulted line circuit, and additionally zero-sequence current from the healthy line circuit, are provided as the relay input signals. The algorithm is based on changing the position of the distance relay characteristic in such a way that the reactance effect is effectively compensated for. For this purpose the shift vector is determined in on-line relatively simple calculations. The delivered adaptive algorithm has been tested using current and voltage signals obtained from simulation of varies faults using the ATP-EMTP software program. Selected results of the evaluation are presented.

Constrains {{on the availability of}} land and planning permission for overhead transmission lines have renewed interest in techniques to increase the power carrying capacity of existing right-of-ways (ROW). Six-phase transmission appears to be the most promising solution to the need to increase the capability of existing transmission lines and at the same time, respond to the concerns related to electromagnetic fields. One of the main advantages of sixphase transmission is that a six-phase line can carry up to 73 % more electric power than a three-phase <b>double-circuit</b> <b>line</b> on the same transmission right-of-way. However, this conversion will have impacts on the power system operations. In this project, the digital load flow, short circuit, and transient stability cases of the IEEE Test Systems and 19 -Bus TNB Kelantan System is investigated in time domain considering conversion of three-phase double-circuit to six-phase single-circuit transmission system by using Power System Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transient and Direct Current PSCAD/EMTDC program. These studies were performed in sufficient detail to determine how the six-phase conversion will affect steady state operation, fault current duties, and system stability.
