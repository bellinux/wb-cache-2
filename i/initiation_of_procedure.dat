40|$|General {{administrative}} procedure act contains legal norms that are valid for all identical cases. In {{addition to the}} general, there are special {{administrative procedure}}s, customized to the specific administrative areas. Procedure initiation is regulated. Administrative procedure can be initiated {{at the request of}} the proponent and ex officio. When the official determines that the conditions for the conduct of administrative procedure are met, before making a decision, all the facts and circumstances relevant to the resolution of administrative matter have to be identified. When there are no legal requirements for the initiation of procedures, the official shall make a decision to reject the application of the party. The procedure is initiated ex officio when stipulated by law or when protection of public interest requires it. When initiating procedure ex officio, the public authority shall take into consideration the petition or other information that indicate the need to protect the public interest. In such cases the applicant is not a party, and the official is obliged to notify the applicant, if initiation of procedures is not accepted ex officio. Based on the notification, the applicant has a right to complain, including the situation when there is no response within the prescribed period of 30 days. Public authority may, therefore it is not obliged to, initiate administrative procedure by public announcement only in a situation where the parties are unknown, while it is obliged to initiate procedure by public announcement when this method of initiating the procedure is prescribed by law. <b>Initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> with public announcement occurs in rare cases. Due to the application of efficiency and cost-effectiveness principle, two or more administrative procedures can be merged into one procedure by a conclusion. The condition for this is that the rights or obligations of the parties are based on the same legal basis and on the same or similar facts. Modification of the application of a party is possible before rendering a decision of first instance, provided that the amendment request is based on the same facts. A party may withdraw their application, without the obligation to provide reasons for it. In such a situation a decision to terminate the procedure is made. The settlement is in its legal nature a special kind of contract between the parties in a procedure, expressing their free will as a way of completion of administrative procedure. The settlement as a prerequisite for making the decision to terminate the procedure is not possible if it is contrary to law, public interest or the rights of third parties...|$|E

To determine the relationship between patient characteristics and the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> a claim <b>procedure.</b> DESIGN: Descriptive. METHOD: Between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2005, 500 patients with a bile-duct injury were referred to the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, 454 of whom in the period up to 31 December 2004. Of these, 403 received a mailed questionnaire about the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> legal claims for damages. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed and returned by 278 patients (69 %), a representative cohort ofthe 500. Of these, 53 (19 %) had submitted a claim for damages.

Patients were excluded if they were candidates for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Treatment involved one of two mechanical thrombectomy devices. Retrieval was augmented by low-dose intra-arterial tPA if needed. Outcome was measured by using the Modified Rankin score.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} forced molting on plasma levels of {{thyroxine}} (T 4), triiodothyronine (T 3), and adrenal cholesterol and total adrenal steroid content were studied. Commercially avail-able strains of Single Comb White Leghorn (SCWL) hens, reared and maintained under commercial conditions, {{were used in}} the three trials. The hens were moved to environmentally modified facilities prior to the forced molt which was accomplished by reducing daylength and by withdraw-ing feed and water. Egg production ceased within one week <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> this <b>procedure.</b> The hens were sampled either daily or on alternate days for up to 22 days beginning at the time of feed removal. Plasma T 4 initially decreased upon removal of feed, but increased above control levels by the sixth day of feed withdrawal. Plasma T 3 levels remained relatively constant throughout the feed withdrawal period. Resumption of feeding with a fortified ground corn ration resulted in a de-crease in T 4 and concomitant increase in T 3. Changes in adrenal cholesterol and total adrenal steroids were not consistent. However, there was a trend toward increased total adrenal steroids during feed withdrawal, and an increase in adrenal cholesterol upon the resumption of feeding...|$|R

40|$|It {{needs to}} be {{stressed}} that the opponents of compulsory vaccination programmes for children, which are nowadays preferred by many states, are not unanimous in their arguments against such policies. Since its very beginnings, this preventive medical measure has, among other things, induced 'scientific objections' to its effectiveness and safety, conscientious objections (of religious and philosophical origin) and objections to restrictions imposed by the state with respect to human freedoms and bodily integrity.

Materials and Methods: A total of 60 patients requiring root canal treatment were chosen. 30 known diabetic patients with fasting blood sugar (FBS) = 100 – 120 mg/dl were in Group 1 while others non-diabetic patients with FBS ≤ 100 mg/dl were placed in Group 2. After <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> endodontic <b>procedures</b> and biomechanical preparation, 15 patients were chosen randomly to place calcium hydroxide paste or chlorhexidine gel, as intracanal medicament in both groups. The pain was recorded on day 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 posttreatment using verbal rating scale. Result: A total of 10 of 60 patients developed interappointment flare-up, of which 5 (16. 6 %) were diabetics, and 2 (6 %) were nondiabetic patients. The results comparing the interappointment flare-ups between the groups were statistically nonsignificant (P - 0. 2179).
