50|$|Edmonds et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} a {{significant}} percentage of deaths are associated with <b>equipment</b> <b>failure</b> (35%) or misuse (35%), while the diving fatalities workshop of 2012 found that <b>equipment</b> <b>failure</b> per se was uncommon. This is not necessarily contradictory, as they include incompetent operation under <b>equipment</b> <b>failure</b> and <b>specify</b> overlap between malfunction and misuse.|$|R

50|$|The first {{published}} history of predicting spacecraft <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> {{occurred on the}} 12 Rockwell/U.S. Air Force Global Positioning System Block I (Phase 1) satellites using non-repeatable transient events (NRTE) and GPS Kalman filter data from the GPS Master Control Station, between 1978 and 1984 by the GPS Space and Ground Segment Manager. NRTEs were isolated to the GPS satellites after mission operations support personnel replayed the real-time satellite telemetry ruling out RF and land-line noise caused from poor Eb/No or S/N and data acquisition and display system processing problems. The GPS satellite's subsystem equipment vendors diagnosed the NRTEs as systemic noise that preceded the <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> because at the time, {{it was believed that}} all <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> occurred instantaneously and randomly and so <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> could not be predicted (e.g. <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> exhibited memoryless behavior). Rockwell International GPS Systems Engineering Manager ordered a stop to predicting GPS satellite <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> in 1983 claiming it wasn't possible and the company was not on contract to do so. The prognostic analysis that was completed on the GPS satellite telemetry was published quarterly contractually as a CDRL to the GPS Program Office personnel and a wide variety of Air Force subcontractors working on the GPS program.|$|R

These assessments strongly consider <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> and the events that most influenced operations. Moreover, fault impacts and reliability calculation results are analyzed using an indexing process. This process allows Guangzhou Metro to obtain quantitative and comparable results and analyze them to evaluate the performance of devices over time.|$|R
