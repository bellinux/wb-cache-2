We extend the chosen standard to model the CoT for IaaS and PaaS.

Although international political economy treats states as its unit of analysis, the number of states is endogenous. This is highly pertinent for Africa, which has far more states relative to its population than other regions. Africa's many small states face acute difficulties of supplying the core public good of enforced justice and I apply the new economics of lawlessness developed by Dixit to show the consequences. I argue that due to the difficulties of supplying this key public good from within the state, Africa needs to have more recourse to the international provision: both through inter-state cooperation within the region, and through <b>global</b> <b>provision.</b> Copyright The author 2008.

However, a substantial percentage of children develop CKD early in life, with congenital renal disorders such as obstructive uropathy and aplasia/hypoplasia/dysplasia being responsible for almost one half of all cases. The most favored end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment modality in children is renal transplantation, but a lack of health care resources and high patient mortality in the developing world limits the <b>global</b> <b>provision</b> of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and influences patient prevalence.

These contradictory positions are {{the starting point}} of our article.

In the second part of our article, we identify reasons for the limited articulation of global social policy. We sketch social policy theories which have been developed for the national level and discuss their relevance for global social policy. In doing so, we highlight limited industrialization at the global level, the weakness of global trade unions and churches, the dominance of liberal international organizations, the veto power of powerful national governments and the weakness of (Scandinavian) welfare states in global politics as possible reasons for the rather fragmentary existence of global social policy...|$|R

40|$|Current vehicle {{navigation}} systems usually rely {{on global}} real-time traffic information. They suggest the best paths to travelers through {{an independent and}} selfish-routing mechanism. Existing studies show that such systems have a great potential to cause traffic congestions oscillating among several alternative corridors, i. e., iteratively leading exceeding traffic into light traffic corridors and making congestion on one and then another {{within a short time}} period. To address this issue, this research proposes a local information provision strategy, given travelers are still guided by an independent and selfish-routing mechanism. The coverage of the real-time information provision is identified by the minimum bounding rectangle, and the ellipse method respectively. The benefits of the proposed strategy in system level are investigated by the simulation studies built upon the Borman expressway network. The simulation results indicate that as the local travel time information provision strategy is used, it may save 10 – 25 % of the system travel time resulting from <b>global</b> information <b>provision</b> strategy under medium or high network traffic loads. Moreover, the sensitivity analyses indicate that the merits of the local travel time information provision strategy are more significant as the penetration of smart vehicles increases over the network.

40|$|The {{effects of}} new {{outpatient}} referrals on {{the dynamics of}} <b>global</b> <b>provision</b> in a surgical service has not previously been defined. Because of managerial pressure to reduce the time interval between general practitioner referral and first specialist assessment, many services are now faced with additional outpatient loads without any clear idea of the effect that this additional burden will have on overall practice. In an attempt to define the logistic implications of a new outpatient load, 293 patients, referred from primary care to a general urological service, were followed for a further two interactions with the secondary care team. 'One-stop' visits with in-clinic investigation and an active discharge policy were employed to assist with efficient patient management. Of the original patients, 28 % required investigations not available in the clinic, with cost and logistic implications for support services. In all, 32 % of the patients needed further follow-up appointments, despite the active discharge policy. This necessitated 95 people being seen in additional clinic time. Of the patients referred, 37 % needed inpatient treatment; 46 % being day case procedures, the remainder constituting a variable case mix. This work necessitated 7. 1 operating sessions and an additional 75 inpatient bed days for every 100 new patients referred. A model for determining the resource requirements for a surgical outpatient load is proposed...|$|R

They run without an aim for profit but are based on the ethos of providing a common good considered to be of public interest. In most middle and low-income countries, these publicly owned and managed water providers can be inefficient as a result of political interference, leading to over-staffing and low labor productivity.Ironically, the main losers from this institutional arrangement are the urban poor in these countries. Because they are not connected to the network, they end up paying far more per liter of water than do more well-off households connected to the network who benefit from the implicit subsidies that they receive from loss-making utilities.The fact that we are still so far from achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation shows that public water authorities, in their current state, are not working well enough.Yet some are being very successful and are modelling the best forms of public management.

The rhetoric of global pub-lic goods underscores the notion that sending foreign aid overseas can deliver benefits at home as well. As in standard analyses of public goods, under-supply can occur due to free-riding, and public action can improve efficiency. But other cases depart from the standard anal-ysis. We consider {{cases in which the}} content of global public goods may be controversial, and where welfare may be a function of multi-ple public goods consumed simultaneously. In this setting, free-riding may be encouraged and strategic policymakers may choose the quality of public goods to either “crowd out ” or “crowd in ” the provision of other public goods. The formal analysis is illustrated with discussion of two recent initiatives to provide global public goods: the failed pro-posal to start an Asian Monetary Fund in 1997 and the World Bank’s announcement in 1996 that it is becoming a “Knowledge Bank ” that spreads information on international development policy. 1...|$|R

In response, palm oil production is rapidly expanding which promotes {{economic growth in}} producing countries but also leads to serious environmental and social problems such as destruction of tropical forests, climate change and threats to small-holder livelihoods. For these reasons, palm oil production and use have become highly controversial. However, the global character of palm oil production and consumption, the number of different actors involved and its multiple uses makes promotion its sustainability highly complex. Individual nation-states can no longer control and regulate a global flow like palm oil and alternative governing networks appear involving private companies and NGOs. Acknowledging the roles of such governance networks with different forms of power means that relying only on {{economic and political power}} to explain current dynamics in the palm oil sector is inadequate. In global networks like palm oil supply, encompassing transnational material flows and multiple actors, the relevance of each actor relates to his position in the network. Power in global palm oil supply is therefore not only related to their position in the (vertical) supply chains, but also to their role in the horizontal networks. New forms of power in networks arise from steering the networks (programming) and from connecting different networks (switching).
