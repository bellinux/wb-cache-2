2500|$|The Japanese beachheads {{from which}} the Kokoda {{campaign}} was launched were located about three key positions along a [...] stretch of the north coast of New Guinea: Gona to the west, Buna {{to the east and}} Sanananda–Giruwa in the centre. Roughly [...] northeast of Port Moresby, it approximates to the most direct line from there to the north coast. The settlements are located on a thin coastal strip that separates the sea from a tidal forest swamp of mangroves, nipa and sago. Rivers flowing across the broad, flat, coastal plain from the Owen Stanley Range disappear into the swamps and discharge to the sea through many coastal creeks. The coastal strip is rarely more than a few hundred yards at its widest, to little more than a <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> separating the swamp from the sea. The few paths through the swamp were seldom more than [...] wide.|$|E
2500|$|Stocking {{density is}} {{an issue in the}} welfare of {{commercial}} turkeys and high densities are a major animal welfare concern. [...] Permitted stocking densities for turkeys reared indoors vary according to geography and animal welfare farm assurance schemes. [...] For example, in Germany, there is a voluntary maximum of 52kg/m2 and 58kg/m2 for males and females respectively. [...] In the UK, the RSPCA Freedom Foods assurance scheme reduces permissible stocking density to 25kg/m2 for turkeys reared indoors. [...] Turkeys maintained at commercial stocking densities (8 birds/m2; 61kg/m2) exhibit increased welfare problems such as increases in gait abnormalities, hip and foot lesions, and bird disturbances, and decreased bodyweight compared with lower stocking densities. [...] Turkeys reared at 8 birds/m2 have a higher incidence of hip lesions and <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> dermatitis than those reared at 6.5 or 5.0 birds/m2. [...] Insufficient space may lead to an increased risk for injuries such as broken wings caused by hitting the pen walls or other turkeys during aggressive encounters and can also lead to heat stress. The problems of small space allowance are exacerbated by the major influence of social facilitation on the behaviour of turkeys. If turkeys are to feed, drink, dust-bathe, etc., simultaneously, then to avoid causing frustration, resources and space must be available in large quantities.|$|E

Furthermore, some exhibit a bipedal stance for some behaviors and may walk a few steps bipedally. [...] Pangolins are also good swimmers.|$|E
25|$|The large, fleshy phalangeal <b>foot</b> <b>pads,</b> {{the small}} {{interphalangeal}} <b>foot</b> <b>pads,</b> {{the presence of}} only reticulate scales {{on the underside of}} the foot (which increases flexibility), and curved foot claws of Confuciusornis are all traits shared with modern tree-dwelling, perching birds, suggesting that Confuciusornis itself may have had a similar lifestyle.|$|R

50|$|Domestic {{animals have}} apocrine glands {{at the base}} of each hair follicle, but eccrine glands only in <b>foot</b> <b>pads</b> and snout.

Eccrine glands on their <b>foot</b> <b>pads,</b> like those on palms and soles of humans, did not evolve to cool either but rather increase friction and enhance grip.|$|R

50|$|The {{first two}} rounds were close, with Alexio utilising better boxing skills but Cikatić using his {{powerful}} low kicks to his advantage.

Adult bush rats are smaller than the Australian swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus) and in addition, the bush rat's <b>foot</b> <b>pads</b> are a pink colour, whereas the swamp rat's <b>foot</b> <b>pads</b> are dark brown. The feet are pentadactyl with all digits clawed. The bush rat exhibits sexual dimorphism; the males are larger than the females in the species.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules of}} the bout were disputed between both fighters {{right up to the}} day of the fight. Alexio, who had competed {{exclusively}} under American kickboxing rules, wanted both fighters to wear <b>foot</b> <b>pads</b> and low kicks to be illegal. Cikatić, a Muay Thai fighter, wanted low kicks as well as the Thai clinch to be allowed. In the end, low kicks were allowed and Alexio wore <b>foot</b> <b>pads,</b> and knees and the clinch were banned. The duration of the fight was set at eight, three-minute rounds.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{allergic}} encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced {{with equal}} incidence {{in groups of}} rats {{regardless of whether the}} route of brain vaccine injection was intracutaneous and into hind <b>foot</b> <b>pads</b> or intraperitoneal. Rats which were injected intracutaneously and into hind <b>foot</b> <b>pads</b> either developed EAE within 10 – 16 days or showed signs of what we have termed `adjuvant disease'. Intraperitoneally injected animals that failed to develop demyelinating disease showed almost diffuse proliferative peritonitis, but those with EAE had a more circumscribed granulomatous proliferation in the upper part of abdomen. Suppression of EAE was obtained when the oily suspension of mycobacteria without brain was injected intraperitoneally within 11 days after the inoculation of brain in adjuvant mixture intradermally and into <b>foot</b> <b>pads.</b> No suppression of EAE was seen when adjuvant alone was injected intraperitoneally 12 or 14 days after brain in adjuvant mixture.

50|$|Trick skiing uses small, oval-shaped water skis. Beginners {{generally}} use two skis {{while more}} advanced skiers use one. The shorter, wider Trick ski has a front binding facing forward and a back binding facing at a 45°. It has a smooth bottom that {{allows it to}} turn over the surface of the water. According to official 2013 Tournament Rules for 3-event competition in the United States and the Pan-Am Games, skis used in the Tricks event must be a single ski without fins, although molded rails/grooves less than 1/4 in are allowed, as are a <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> cemented to the ski as a place for the rear foot; in addition, the ski must float with all bindings, fins, etc., installed. The ski's configuration allows the skier to perform both surface and air tricks in quick succession.|$|E

50|$|Most epizoochorous burs {{attach to}} {{hair on the}} body or legs of the host animal, but a special class of epizoochorous bur {{is known as the}} trample-bur (or trample-burr). Several species of Tribulus, Harpagophytum, and Grielum produce fruit in the form of trample-burs. As the name suggests, they attach {{themselves}} to the animal when trampled. They may hook onto the legs of animals as the large hooks of Harpagophytum do, sometimes causing serious injury, but sometimes hooking onto the leg of say, an ostrich, apparently without causing discomfort. It also might penetrate a hoof or <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> or the tires of a vehicle, only to be shed after being carried for a considerable time and distance; most Tribulus and Grielum species are specialised for such attachment, variously being flat, but with upward-directed spikes as in say, Grielum humifusum, or shaped like a caltrop as in some species of Tribulus that have achieved the status of cosmopolitan weeds by sticking to the tires of aircraft.|$|E
