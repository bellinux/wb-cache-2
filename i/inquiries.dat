A references committee will conduct <b>inquiries</b> into policy issues referred to it by the Senate.

30|$|<b>Inquiry</b> is the {{predominant}} means used by scientists to generate science knowledge; however, {{there is no}} single definition of <b>inquiry.</b> Hanauer et al. (2009) proposed that scientific <b>inquiry</b> exists on a continuum and that <b>inquiry</b> is best operationalized through the context and overall pedagogical goals. For example, the pedagogical goal of the <b>inquiry</b> experience could be to develop new knowledge or the goal could be for the student to gain personal and cultural knowledge about the process of <b>inquiry.</b> Similarly, Chinn and Malhotra (2002) claimed that science <b>inquiry</b> exists on a continuum based on scientific authenticity. They define authentic <b>inquiry</b> as the complex activity that scientists perform to generate new scientific knowledge. Chinn and Malhotra (2002) listed cognitive processes involved in <b>inquiry</b> such as the generation or research questions, engaging in planning procedures, or finding flaws within experimental strategies and compare these processes between authentic and simple <b>inquiry.</b> For example, in the case of generating research questions, in authentic <b>inquiry</b> scientists generate their own questions, whereas in simple <b>inquiry</b> a research question is provided to the student.|$|R

40|$|Curriculum reform {{emphasizes}} the importance of <b>inquiry</b> instruction for learners. For inquiry-oriented curriculum to occur, attention must be focused on teacher education. Using a mixed-methods design, I investigated if and how groups of student teachers who receive different types of exposure to <b>inquiry</b> differ in their understanding of <b>inquiry</b> instruction. Preservice teachers' descriptions of <b>inquiry</b> experiences in their teacher-preparation program contextualized the results. Considerable effort was given in the first phase of this study to establish {{the reliability and validity of}} the Strategic Demands of <b>Inquiry</b> questionnaire. Participants were from McGill University, Montreal, and included preservice teachers in the Bachelor of Education program, Continuing Education students enrolled in an inquiry-based course, and Honours Psychology students engaged in research. Data sources included the Strategic Demands of <b>Inquiry</b> questionnaire and an interview schedule. Groups who had different types of exposure to the <b>inquiry</b> approach varied in how they understand <b>inquiry</b> instruction. Fourth-year Elementary preservice teachers held more sophisticated conceptualizations of the <b>inquiry</b> approach and greater appreciation for the components involved in carrying out an <b>inquiry</b> curriculum compared to first-year Elementary preservice teachers. After the completion of an inquiry-oriented course, Continuing Education students (including experienced teachers) were similar to fourth-year Elementary student teachers in conceptualizing and identifying important components of <b>inquiry</b> instruction. First-year Elementary and Secondary student teachers were different in their views of <b>inquiry</b> instruction. Finally, Honours Psychology students, who were engaged in scholarly research, held sophisticated conceptualizations of the <b>inquiry</b> approach. However, they did not use this knowledge of the <b>inquiry</b> method as extensively as fourth-year preservice teachers to identify important aspects of <b>inquiry</b> instruction. Therefore, although experience with the <b>inquiry</b> method may be necessary for conceptualizing <b>inquiry</b> as a pedagogical approach, it is not sufficient to enable undergraduates to identify important aspects of planning, enacting, and evaluating an <b>inquiry</b> curriculum. These findings point to the importance of the Bachelor of Education program in advancing knowledge about <b>inquiry</b> instruction. Fourth-year student teachers reported experiences with the <b>inquiry</b> approach that influenced their understanding of this method.

They reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate; Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings; the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed; and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a danger area at too high a speed.
