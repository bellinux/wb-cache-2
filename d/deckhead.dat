5|$|On 10 November Belfast {{was taken}} off the {{northern}} patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at Rosyth. On 21 November, Belfast was {{to take part in the}} force's first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58am she struck a magnetic mine while leaving the Firth of Forth. The mine broke Belfasts keel, and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms. Twenty officers and men required hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion, and a further 26 suffered minor injuries. One man, Painter 2nd Class Henry Stanton, was hospitalised but later died of a head injury, having been thrown against the <b>deckhead</b> by the blast. The tugboat Krooman, towing gunnery targets for the exercise, released her targets and instead towed Belfast to Rosyth for initial repairs.|$|E
25|$|Much of this {{equipment}} {{can be controlled}} from the wheelhouse or bridge. Smaller trawlers have wheelhouses, where electronic equipment for navigation, communications, fish detection and trawl sensors are typically arranged about the skipper's chair. Larger vessels have a bridge, with a command console at the centre and a further co-pilot chair. Modern consoles display all the key information on an integrated display. Less frequently used sensors and monitors may be mounted on the <b>deckhead.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding. Even {{if one of the}} steel tubes were damaged, the repair work required was relatively simple and could be done by ground crew at the airfield. Damage to a stressed skin structure, as used by the Spitfire, required more specialised equipment to repair. The old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of Hurricanes with relatively basic equipment under field conditions. Crated Hurricanes were assembled at Takoradi in West Africa and flown across the Sahara to the Middle East theatre and, to save space, some Royal Navy aircraft carriers carried their reserve Sea Hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies, which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and <b>deckhead</b> for reassembly when needed.|$|E
50|$|A {{bulkhead}} is {{an upright}} wall within {{the hull of}} a ship or within the fuselage of an aeroplane. Other kinds of partition elements within a ship are decks and <b>deckheads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|While most {{of these}} toasts are self-explanatory, [...] "a bloody war or a sickly season" [...] refers to the desire and {{likelihood}} of being promoted when many people die: during war or sickness.The Navy traditionally makes the loyal toast seated, due to the evident danger of low <b>deckheads</b> on wooden sailing ships.|$|R
50|$|Walls {{are called}} {{bulkheads}} or ceilings, while the surfaces {{referred to as}} ceilings on land are called overheads or <b>deckheads.</b> Floors are called soles or decks. The toilet is traditionally called the head, the kitchen is the galley. When lines are tied off, this may {{be referred to as}} made fast or belayed. Sails in different sail plans have unchanging names, however. For the naming of sails, see sail-plan.|$|R
2500|$|In Royal Navy service, {{because of}} the limited hangar deck height in several classes of British carrier, many Corsairs had their outer wings [...] "clipped" [...] by [...] to clear the <b>deckhead.</b> The change in span brought about {{the added benefit of}} {{improving}} the sink rate, reducing the F4U's propensity to [...] "float" [...] {{in the final stages of}} landing. Despite the clipped wings and the shorter decks of British carriers, Royal Navy aviators found landing accidents less of a problem than they had been to U.S. Navy aviators, thanks to the curved approach they used: British units solved the landing visibility problem by approaching the carrier in a medium left-hand turn, which allowed the pilot to keep the carrier's deck in view over the anhedral in the left wing root. This technique was later adopted by U.S. Navy and Marine fliers for carrier use of the Corsair.|$|E

50|$|When {{a contact}} had been {{confirmed}} as a hostile submarine, the SCO manually fired the Mortar Mk 10 from the SCR upon receiving the {{order from the}} captain in the operations room. The firing was done {{by means of a}} pistol grip and trigger mounted to the <b>deckhead</b> immediately behind the operators.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>deckhead</b> is the {{underside}} of a deck in a ship. It bears the same relationship to a compartment on the deck below as does the ceiling to the room of a house.

50|$|Baled {{goods are}} stowed on single dunnage at least 50 mm thick. The bales must be clean {{with all the}} bands intact. Stained or oily bales are rejected. All fibres can absorb oil and are liable to {{spontaneous}} combustion. As a result, they are kept clear of any new paintwork. Bales close to the <b>deckhead</b> are covered to prevent damage by dripping sweat.|$|E

5000|$|In Royal Navy service, {{because of}} the limited hangar deck height in several classes of British carrier, many Corsairs had their outer wings [...] "clipped" [...] by 8 in to clear the <b>deckhead.</b> The change in span brought about {{the added benefit of}} {{improving}} the sink rate, reducing the F4U's propensity to [...] "float" [...] {{in the final stages of}} landing.

50|$|The {{boats were}} powered by two MAN лю6V49/48 {{four-stroke}} atmospheric reversive diesels (2000 hp each at 465 rev/min) that drove two fixed pitch propellers together with two Electrosila PG-72/35 electric motors (550 hp at 275 rev/min), connecting by BAMAG (Berlin-Anhaltische Maschinenbau AG) type friction clutches. Delivery {{of the engines}} for the third boat was constantly delayed and eventually it was equipped with domestically produced ones. For underwater propulsion energy was supplied by 124 APA 38-MAK-760 accumulators, equipped with K-5 hydrogen burners. The batteries lacked the traditional central walkway, instead using special service trolleys suspended from the <b>deckhead.</b> This design significantly decreased {{the height of the}} battery compartment, freeing space for the crew. The electrical system omitted the complicated layout common on earlier Soviet designs, and was simple and reliable. All connections were insulated and the bulkhead feedthroughs were designed to withstand the same pressure as the bulkheads themselves. It had better maneuverability than other smaller Soviet, German, British and Italian submarines (e.g. the British U-class submarines, the German Type VII submarines and the Italian Acciaio-class submarine).|$|E
5000|$|In present-day American {{waterfront}} usage, a stevedore {{is usually}} a person or a company who manages the operation of loading or unloading a ship. In the 1800s, the word was usually applied to black laborers or slaves who loaded and unloaded bales of cotton and other freight on and off riverboats. In Two Years Before the Mast (1840), the author Richard Henry Dana, Jr. describes the steeving of a merchant sailing ship in 1834. This was the process of taking a mostly-full hold and cramming in more material. In this case, the hold was filled with hides from the California hide trade up to four feet below the <b>deckhead</b> (equivalent of 'ceiling'). [...] "Books" [...] composed of 25-50 cattle skins folded into a bundle were prepared, and a small opening created {{in the middle of}} one of the existing stacks. Then the book was shoved in by use of a pair of thick strong pieces of wood called steeves. The steeves had one end shaped as a wedge which was placed into the middle of a book to shove it into the stack. The other ends were pushed on by means of block and tackle attached to the hull and overhead beams and hauled on by sailors.|$|E
