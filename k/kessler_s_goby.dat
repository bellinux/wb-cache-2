We investigate {{the influence of}} interfacial treatment on the matrix–filler interaction using a melt mixing process to fabricate robust and highly stretchable dielectrics. Silicone oil and silane coupling agent are studied as possible solutions to enhance the compatibility between the inorganic fillers and polymer matrix. Morphology, thermomechanical and dielectric behavior of the prepared specimens are studied. Results show that specimens filled with silicone oil coated particles have promising dielectric and thermal properties. The mechanical properties reveal a stiffness enhancement by 67 % with a high strain at break of 900 %. The relative permittivity of the specimens prepared with silicone oil increased by 45 % as observed from the dielectric analysis. H. Saleem, M. Thunga, M. Kollosche, M.

40|$|Various predator-prey, host-pathogen, and {{competitive}} interactions can combine to cause density dependence in population growth. Despite this possibility, most empirical tests for density-dependent interactions {{have focused on}} single mechanisms. Here we tested the hypothesis that two mechanisms of density dependence, parasitism and a shortage of refuges, jointly influence the strength of density-dependent mortality. We used mark recapture analysis to estimate mortality of the host species, the bridled goby Coryphopterus glaucofraenum). Sixty-three marked gobies were infected with a copepod gill parasite Pharodes tortugensis), and 188 were uninfected. We used the spatial scale at which gobies were clustered naturally (4 m 2) as an ecologically relevant neighborhood and measured goby density {{and the availability of}} refuges from predators within each goby 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> neighborhood. <b>Goby</b> survival generally declined with increasing density, and this decline was steeper for gobies with access to few refuges than for gobies in neighborhoods where refuges were common. The negative effects of high density and refuge shortage were also more severe for parasitized gobies than for gobies free of parasites. This parasite has characteristics typical of emerging diseases and appears to have altered the strength of a preexisting density-dependent interaction...|$|R

40|$|In 1997, the Charles Stark Draper Laboratories {{commenced}} {{a project}} with {{the objectives of}} reducing the risk, cost and time associated with obtaining time critical battlefield reconnaissance data. The Wide Area Surveillance Projective, or WASP, is a small autonomous flyer, which is launched contained in an artillery shell, and then deployed over the battlefield to capture images. The first phase of this project involved identifying and solving the challenges associated with designing a device capable of surviving launch loads of 15, 000 g’s. The second phase of WASP is currently addressing the manufacturing and flight control issues. The focus of this thesis is on the structural design and manufacture of the WASP vehicle, particularly the aft fuselage section and the wings. The aft section is not only subjected to high impulsive inertial loads, but its weight (being aft {{of the center of}} pressure) has a substantial effect on the controllability of the vehicle. Finite element models of this section as well as test specimens are produced to optimize the design. The wings are required to be stiff aerodynamic surfaces, and are folded {{along the side of the}} vehicle so as to take up minimal volume. Several different manufacturing procedures are explored to provide a robust set of wings that match all of the specified requirements. All of these pieces need to be as light as possible; therefore they are manufactured in advanced composite materials. by Seth Stovack <b>Kessler.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

40|$|In mid- 1990 <b>s</b> racer <b>goby,</b> Babka gymnotrachelus, {{penetrated}} to the Vistula and Western Bug {{rivers in}} Poland through the canal connecting the Baltic and the Black Sea basins, namely the Vistula and Dnieper drainages. In early 2000 s, the species was reported from Polish {{section of the}} Strwiąż River that is an affluent of the Dniester River that drains to the Black Sea basin. According to the Polish legislation, the racer goby has been enlisted in as an alien invasive species that may pose threat to local biota. Our analysis of the mtDNA cytochrome b diversity revealed that the Vistula/Western Bug and Strwiąż populations are different genetic units. First one originated from the Dnieper River, while the second derives from the Dniester River. According {{to the results of}} mismatch analysis, both are in the stage of demographic and spatial expansion. The haplotype frequencies in population from the Vistula/Western Bug differ significantly from those in the source population in Dnieper, suggesting founder effect, possibly due to human-mediated introduction of low number of individuals. On the other side, the population in Strwiąż does not differ in structure from the one in Dniester, providing a hint towards spontaneous range expansion. Interpretation of our results in light of historical data lead to the conclusion that presence of racer goby in Strwiąż was probably overlooked in previous, spatially limited, studies. Thus, in Strwiąż the species should not be treated as alien, contrary to its status in the Vistula drainage. This double origin of racer goby populations in Poland creates a peculiar situation for national legislation procedures as one population is alien and invasive, while the other one is not. In light of our findings, the population from Strwiąż should be recognised as a special case. Steps should be undertaken to raise public awareness to prevent translocation of the gobies between the rivers to prevent deterioration of the evolutionarily isolated genetic pools of the Dnieper and of the Dniester basins. Our results illustrate the need for case studies upon genetic population structure, following appearance of new species in previously unoccupied water bodies, even on local scale.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The annual and interannual {{variability}} in the subthermocline equatorial Pacific is studied in a simulation of the tropical Pacific for the 1985 – 94 decade using a primitive equation high-resolution model. The study focuses on temperature variability and vertical energy fluxes. Similar to the observations made by W. <b>S.</b> <b>Kessler</b> and J. P. McCreary, the annual harmonic of vertical isotherm displacements presents phase lines sloping downward {{from east to west}} with off-equatorial maxima. Estimates of zonal and vertical phase speeds, the location of the maxima of isotherm displacements, and an analysis of ernergy fluxes suggest the presence of l 5 1 Rossby waves. The simulated field is somewhat more trapped toward the equator than the observations. A linear simulation is carried out for the vertical standing modes with characteristics derived from the OGCM simulation. In the linear simulation, high-order meridional mode Rossby waves are more prominent than in the OGCM simulation. However, the (l 5 1) Rossby wave in the linear model shares many characteristics with the one in the OGCM simulation. It is the result of both the reflection of surface-forced Kelvin waves on the eastern boundary and of direct forcing at the surface. On interannual timescales the simulation also presents vertical propagation of Rossby waves from the eastern boundary, but not as deep as for the annual cycle and in a much thinner beam.

Remodeling of {{the cardiac}} sodium channel, connexin 43, and plakoglobin at the {{intercalated}} disk {{in patients with}} arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Heart Rhythm 10 (3), 412 - 419 (2013). Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is a heart muscle disease characterized by a progressive replacement of the ventricular myocardium with adipose and fibrous tissue. This disease {{is often associated with}} mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins in the majority of patients. Based on results obtained from recent experimental models, a disturbed distribution of gap junction proteins and cardiac sodium channels may also be observed in AC phenotypes, secondary to desmosomal dysfunction. The study from Noorman et al. examined heart sections from patients diagnosed with AC and performed immunohistochemical analyses of N-cadherin, PKP 2, PKG, Cx 43 and the cardiac sodium channel NaV 1. 5. Altered expression/distribution of Cx 43, PKG and NaV 1. 5 was found in most cases of patients with AC. The altered expression and/or distribution of NaV 1. 5 channels in AC hearts may play a mechanistic role in the arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death in AC patients. Thus, NaV 1. 5 should be considered as a supplemental element in the evaluation of risk stratification and management strategies. However, additional experiments are required to clearly understand the mechanisms leading to AC phenotypes...|$|R
