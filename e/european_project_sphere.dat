40|$|Abstract. The catastrophic floods {{recently}} {{occurring in}} Europe warn {{of the critical}} need for hydrologic data on floods over long-time scales. Palaeoflood techniques provide information on hydrologic variability and extreme floods over long-time intervals (100 to 10, 000 yr) and {{may be used in}} combination with historical flood data (last 1, 000 yr) and the gauge record (last 30 – 50 yr). In this paper, advantages and uncertainties related to the reconstruction of palaeofloods in different geomorphological settings and historical floods using different documentary sources are described. Systematic and non-systematic data can be combined in the flood frequency analysis using different methods for the adjustment of distribution functions. Technical tools integrating multidisciplinary approaches (geologic, historical, hydraulic and statistical) on extreme flood risk assessment are discussed.
