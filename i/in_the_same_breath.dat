His ultimate impression from the English-dubbed version was that the film {{could easily have been}} set in present-day New York. Chris Beveridge of Mania.com said that the film [...] " [...] out like a much expanded episode but without feeling like its being padded to do so", generally praising the plot along with Vincent's characterization and Spike's expanded portrayal. Jamie Russell, writing for the BBC, gave it 4 out of 5 stars, saying it was [...] "good enough to deserve mention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>breath</b> as Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Spirited Away". The most praise went to the use of live-action camera angles.

[...] Other newspapers of the time, including the Los Angeles Times, Toronto Star, Chicago Tribune and web magazine Salon generally shared opinions with other reviewers: several praised the plot and animation, while others were mixed. Others, including the Toronto Star and Newark Star-Ledger, noted its connection to science fiction films.|$|E

GameSpot summarised that the game was [...] "complex and rewarding" [...] and GameSpy praised the game for [...] "the simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens [...] make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started". Crispy Gamer, while acclaiming the game [...] "spectacular" [...] and [...] "lovingly historical", criticised the documentation and concluded that the game falls apart due to its bad AI.

6000|$|Although, however, Burke's unflinching {{reverence for}} the constitution, and his {{reluctance}} to lay a finger upon it, may now seem clearly excessive, as it did to Chatham and his son, who were great men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right, or to Beckford and Sawbridge, who were very little men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right, we can only be just to him by comparing his ideas with those which were dominant throughout an evil reign. While he opposed more frequent parliaments, he still upheld the doctrine that [...] "to govern according to the sense, and agreeably to the interests, of the people is a great and glorious object of government." [...] While he declared himself against {{the addition of a}} hundred knights of <b>the</b> shire, he <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>breath</b> protested that, though the people might be deceived in their choice of an object, he [...] "could scarcely conceive any choice they could make, to be so very mischievous as the existence of any human force capable of resisting it."[1] To us this may seem very mild and commonplace doctrine, but it was not commonplace in an age when Anglican divines--men like Archbishop Markham, Dr. Nowell or Dr. Porteus--had revived the base precepts of passive obedience and non-resistance, and when such a man as Lord Mansfield encouraged them.

500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot. Johnnie Moyes said that [...] "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." [...] Moyes said that Brown was [...] "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist Neville Cardus commented [...] "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." [...] Ray Robinson said that Brown was [...] "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that [...] "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>breath</b> as Archie Jackson's". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket—he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.|$|E

The extent of the indigenisation process is also of interest to the study.

Real time linguistic data were collected and analysed, using linguistic levels as base to access the extent to which Nigerian indigenous languages have been able to influence the English language. The finding shows that codemixing is an important part of the Nigerian communication process and has enabled the vernacularisation of the English language to a very large extent. This has produced a new spatial identity that reveals the Nigerian’s domination of the colonial English language...|$|R

However, there is not enough known about the relation between the specific qualities of art and its possible contribution to social cohesion. This study tries to find an {{answer to the question of}} how art participation and social cohesion are related and whether governments – <b>in</b> <b>the</b> framework of this study the government of the Province of Drenthe – have chosen the right instrument for enhancing social cohesion by opting for an art participation policy. Wouldn’t sports for example, be better suited for such policy goals? It is argued that art as a form of play has a discerning effect on people's attitudes with regard to unknown others. Empirical data seem to indicate this. The second part is a study of what the effects of art participation on social cohesion have been within the framework of Drenthe’s cultural participation policy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period 2009 - 2012. This will show that cultural projects are not necessarily binding elements of themselves. There are indications that, if certain conditions are met, art that challenges perceptions may lead to a bridging attitude, whereas art that confirms perceptions rather seems to strengthen existing relations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Our aim was {{to compare}} the {{apparent}} diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of normal abdominal parenchymal organs and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> patients with <b>breath</b> hold (BH) and free breathing (FB) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients underwent both BH and FB DWI. Spherical region of interest (ROI) {{was placed on the}} right hepatic lobe, spleen, pancreas, and renal cortices. ADC values were calculated for each organ on each sequence using an automated software. Image noise, defined as the standard deviation (SD) of <b>the</b> signal intensities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most artifact-free area of the image background was measured by placing the largest possible ROI on either the left or {{the right side of the}} body outside <b>the</b> object <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recorded field of view. SNR was calculated using the formula: SNR=signal intensity (SI) (organ) /standard deviation (SD) (noise). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in ADC values of the abdominal organs between BH and FB DWI sequences (p> 0. 05). There were statistically significant differences between SNR values of organs on BH and FB DWIs. SNRs were found to be better on FB DWI than BH DWI (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Free breathing DWI technique reduces image noise and increases SNR for abdominal examinations. Free breathing technique is therefore preferable to BH DWI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evaluation of abdominal organs by DWI...|$|R

60|$|It is not {{contended that}} the act of Parliament did not {{expressly}} ordain an inquiry. It is not asserted that this inquiry was not, with equal precision of terms, specially committed, under particular regulations, to the Court of Directors. I conceive, therefore, the Board of Control had no right whatsoever to intermeddle in that business. There is nothing certain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> principles of jurisprudence, if this be not undeniably true, that when, a special authority is given to any persons by name to do some particular act, that no others, by virtue of general powers, can obtain a legal title to intrude themselves into that trust, and to exercise those special functions in their place. I therefore consider the intermeddling of ministers in this affair as a downright usurpation. But if the strained construction by which they have forced themselves into a suspicious office (which every man delicate with regard to character would rather have sought constructions to avoid) were perfectly sound and perfectly legal, of this I am certain, that they cannot be justified <b>in</b> declining <b>the</b> inquiry which had been prescribed to the Court of Directors. If the Board of Control did lawfully possess the right of executing the special trust given to that court, they must take it as they found it, subject to <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> regulations which bound the Court of Directors. It will be allowed that the Court of Directors had no authority to dispense with either the substance or the mode of inquiry prescribed by the act of Parliament. If they had not, where <b>in</b> <b>the</b> act did the Board of Control acquire that capacity? Indeed, it was impossible they should acquire it. What must we think of the fabric and texture of an act of Parliament which should find it necessary to prescribe a strict inquisition, that should descend into minute regulations for the conduct of that inquisition, that should commit this trust to a particular description of men, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>breath</b> should enable another body, at their own pleasure, to supersede all the provisions the legislature had made, and to defeat the whole purpose, end, and object of the law?

6000|$|Mr. Hastings, by his {{confidence}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support derived from this source, {{or from the}} habits of independent power, is carried to such a length as to consider a motion to obey the Court of Directors as a degradation of <b>the</b> executive government <b>in</b> his person.

Major Scott, his agent, enters so much into the principles of Mr. Hastings's conduct as to tell your Committee that in his opinion Lord Clive would have sent home Mr. Bristow a prisoner upon such an occasion.

This alone is sufficient to show the situation of <b>the</b> Company's servants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subordinate situations, when the mere claim of a right, derived from the sovereign legal power, becomes fatal not only to the objects which they pursue, but deeply wounds that reputation both for ability and integrity by which alone they are to be qualified for any other.|$|R
