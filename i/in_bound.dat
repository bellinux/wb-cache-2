5|$|When {{published}} <b>in</b> <b>bound</b> volumes, {{the legislative}} history documents are placed in separate volumes {{apart from the rest}} of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, {{the legislative history}} materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only a House or Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985–87), the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the House or Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more readily accessible source for some of these materials, like committee reports, than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Kellex {{had made}} {{researchers}} at the Bakelite Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, aware of Nix's unsuccessful efforts with powdered nickel barriers. To Frazier Groff and other researchers at Bakelite's laboratories <b>in</b> <b>Bound</b> Brook, New Jersey, it seemed that Nix was not {{taking advantage of the}} latest techniques, and they began their own development efforts. Both Bell and Bound Brook sent samples of their powdered nickel barriers to Taylor for evaluation, but he was unimpressed; neither had come up with a practical barrier. At Kellogg's laboratory in Jersey City, New Jersey, Clarence A. Johnson, who was aware of the steps taken by the SAM laboratories to improve the Norris-Adler barrier, realized that they could also be taken with the Bakelite barrier. The result was a barrier better than either, although still short of what was required. At a meeting at Columbia with the Army in attendance on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed switching the development effort to the Johnson barrier. Urey balked at this, fearing that this would destroy morale at the SAM Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a meeting on 3 November 1943, and he decided to pursue development of both the Johnson and Norris-Adler barriers.|$|E

Informally the Schrödinger-type operators we consider are of the form L+μ⋅∇+ν where L is a uniformly elliptic second order differential operator, μ is a vector-valued signed measure belonging to Kd, 1 and ν is a signed measure belonging to Kd, 2. In this paper, we establish two-sided {{estimates for the}} heat kernels of Schrödinger-type operators <b>in</b> <b>bounded</b> C 1, 1 -domains and a scale invariant boundary Harnack principle for the positive harmonic functions with respect to Schrödinger-type operators <b>in</b> <b>bounded</b> Lipschitz domains...|$|R

25|$|Bound in Blood is a first-person shooter {{in which}} the player can control one of two characters; Ray McCall, or his brother Thomas. Whereas in the {{original}} Call of Juarez, the player controlled alternating characters from level to level, <b>in</b> <b>Bound</b> in Blood, most levels offer the player the choice of which character they wish to play as, with each character having a slightly different style of gameplay. The character which the player does not choose {{is controlled by the}} AI {{for the duration of the}} level. There are also occasional levels through which the player must play with a specific character. In many levels, there will be times where the brothers will have to directly help one another, such as Thomas helping Ray to reach a high platform, or Ray kicking down a door for Thomas. Most levels are played through in the same manner, irrespective of which character is chosen, with the only difference being that of style. Occasionally, however, the brothers will separate within a level, and, as such, the level design will be different depending on which character the player is using.|$|E
