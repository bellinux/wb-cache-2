50|$|Giant hogweed is a {{biennial}} or monocarpic perennial, {{the plants}} usually begin dying {{after they have}} set seed. It usually flowers in its second year from late spring to midsummer, with numerous white flowers clustered in an umbrella-shaped head that is up to 80 cm in <b>diameter</b> <b>across</b> its <b>flat</b> top. The plant produces 1,500 to 100,000 flattened, 1 cm-long, oval, dry seeds that have a broadly rounded base and broad marginal ridges. Tall dead stems may mark its locations during winter.|$|R
40|$|Wave {{energy is}} the most {{abundant}} source of renewable energy in the World. For the last two decades, engineers have been investigating and defining different methods for power extraction from wave motion. Two different turbines, namely Wells turbine and impulse turbine with guide vanes, are {{the most commonly used}} around the world for wave energy power generation. The ultimate goal is to optimize the performance of the turbine under actual sea conditions. This project investigates the transient flow over the non-twisted turbine blade with NACA 0015 airfoil, Hexagonal hub (0. 1 m <b>diameter</b> <b>across</b> the <b>flats)</b> and chord length of 47 mm, under real sea conditions. The flow over the turbine is unconventional partly because of the unique blade shape and partly because of the transients caused by the oscillatory motion. Initially this project will use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the flow with a view to optimising the blade design under steady state conditions with the varying tip speed ratios from 3 - 6 and finally the optimized design obtained according to the angle of the attack and torque calculated. The optimised design is given basing on the co efficient of power (Cp) calculations...|$|R
