500|$|Primarily {{a central}} midfielder, {{although}} he is also capable of playing on the left, in a holding role, or even as an attacking midfielder, Pogba {{has been described by}} his club Manchester United as a [...] "powerful, skilful, and creative" [...] player who has [...] "an eye for goal and a penchant for the spectacular." [...] In Italy, he gained the nicknames Il Polpo Paul ("Paul the Octopus") for <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> that look like tentacles during tackling or running and [...] "Pogboom" [...] for his explosive playing style and energy on the pitch. A large, quick, hard-working and physically strong player, he excels in the air, and is also known for his stamina, as well as his powerful and accurate striking ability from distance; he has also drawn praise for his finesse, technique, flair, and dribbling skills. His characteristics and playing role in midfield have led him to be compared with former France international Patrick Vieira.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Powell's size ( [...] tall, {{weighing}} [...] ), he has fast initial acceleration. Coupled with comparatively high stiffness in his ligaments and tendons, <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> {{provide a}} long stride of 2.6 metres with rapid progression between each stride.|$|E
2500|$|The pair is {{commonly}} described as people from two countries, the [...] "Long-legged Country", and the [...] "Long-armed Country". [...] As the names suggest, {{the inhabitants of}} these two countries possess unusually lengthy arms and legs. [...] The two work {{together as a team}} to catch fish by the seashore. [...] In order to do this, the long-armed man, tenaga, climbs onto the back of the long-legged man, ashinaga. [...] The ashinaga then wades out into the shorewaters, staying above water with <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs,</b> while the tenaga uses his long arms to grab fish from his partner's back.|$|E
60|$|Cap'n Bill halted {{long enough}} to grab the man around <b>his</b> <b>long</b> neck {{with one hand and}} around <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> with the other hand. Then he raised the Blueskin in the air and threw him far over the wall. A moment later they had unfastened the gate and fled into the open country, where they headed toward the low {{mountain}} whose outlines were plainly visible in the moonlight.|$|R
60|$|The old Duc de Marny {{was sitting}} on the edge of his bed, with <b>his</b> <b>long,</b> thin <b>legs</b> {{dangling}} helplessly to the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us have {{everything}} in its due order." [...] Holmes thrust <b>his</b> <b>long</b> thin <b>legs</b> out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.|$|R
2500|$|Kitchener {{was worried}} that, {{although}} his moustache was bleached white by the sun, {{his blond hair}} refused to turn grey, {{making it harder for}} Egyptians to take him seriously. His appearance added to his mystique: <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> made him appear taller, whilst a cast in his eye made people feel he was looking right through them. Kitchener, at 6'2", towered over most of his contemporaries. Sir Evelyn Baring, the de facto British ruler of Egypt, thought Kitchener “the most able (soldier) I have come across in my time”. In 1890, a War Office evaluation of Kitchener concluded: [...] "A good brigadier, very ambitious, not popular, but has of late greatly improved in tact and manner...a fine gallant soldier and good linguist and very successful in dealing with Orientals" [...]|$|E
60|$|Old Jolyon put the Will in {{his breast}} pocket, and James twisted <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> regretfully.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} and {{stretched}} <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> and his long arms, and smiled as he gaped.|$|E
6000|$|... “You are a humbug!” laughed Morgan, passing an arm {{into his}} tutor’s. He leaned against him looking oft {{at the sea}} again and {{swinging}} <b>his</b> <b>long</b> thin <b>legs.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'E'll gall an' chafe an' lame an' fight -- 'e smells most awful vile; [...] 'E'll lose 'isself {{for ever}} {{if you let}} 'im stray a mile; [...] 'E's game to graze the 'ole day long an' 'owl the 'ole night through, [...] An' when 'e comes to greasy ground 'e splits 'isself in two. [...] O the oont, O the oont, O the floppin', droppin' oont! [...] When <b>'is</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> give from under an' 'is meltin' eye is dim, [...] The tribes is up be'ind us, and the tribes is out in front -- [...] It ain't no jam for Tommy, but it's kites an' crows for 'im.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{does she}} do it? I don't {{understand}} it at all," [...] said Peter, as he scratched <b>his</b> <b>long</b> left ear with <b>his</b> <b>long</b> left hind <b>leg.</b>|$|R
60|$|Without {{another word}} {{he turned and}} strode away as fast as <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> could carry him.|$|E
60|$|Rufus {{stretched}} out <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> on the floor, and fixed his shrewd grave eyes steadily on Amelius.|$|E
60|$|He sprang on ahead, and {{was soon}} making after the boy as rapidly as <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> would carry him.|$|E
5000|$|Standing 6 foot 1 inch [...] and {{weighing}} about 200 pounds , Bithorn {{was a hard}} throwing pitcher who commanded attention when he began his delivery with a distinctive windup, raising <b>his</b> <b>long</b> left <b>leg</b> {{high in the air}} and throwing a blazing fastball toward home plate.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence. All {{the other}} men present drifted away to carry the {{recovered}} silver to their comrades, or to consult the proprietor about the queer condition of affairs. But the grim-faced colonel still sat sideways on the counter, swinging <b>his</b> <b>long,</b> lank <b>legs</b> and biting his dark moustache.|$|R
50|$|He {{was known}} as El Zancudo (The Mosquito) on account of <b>his</b> very <b>long</b> <b>legs.</b> He played a total of 676 {{official}} games, scoring 88 goals. A testimonial game against Chilean side Universidad Católica to honor his retirement was suspended after the Chilean side's defender Raimundo Tupper committed suicide {{a few days before}} the game in San José.|$|R
60|$|Rufus crossed <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs,</b> {{and nodded}} his head in silent approval. Instead of taking offence, Amelius {{considered}} a little.|$|E
60|$|But {{when the}} youth reached Grand Street he beheld Ferris making for {{downtown}} {{as rapidly as}} <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> would carry him.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he started}} for the old brier patch as fast as <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> could take him, and after him ran Granny Fox.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{we come to}} the handsomest {{member of}} the family, Longfoot the Kangaroo Rat, so called because of <b>his</b> <b>long</b> hind <b>legs</b> and tail {{and the way in which}} he sits up and jumps. Really he is not a member of the Rat branch of the family, but closely related to the Pocket Mice. You see, he has pockets in his cheeks." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charlot made no answer. He drained his goblet {{and set it}} {{down with}} a bang. Then he flung himself into a chair, and {{stretching}} out <b>his</b> <b>long,</b> booted <b>legs</b> he began to hum the refrain of the [...] "Marseillaise." [...] Thus a few moments went by. Then there came a sound of steps upon the creaking stairs, and the gruff voice of the soldier urging the ladies to ascend more speedily.|$|R
60|$|So did {{the third}} visitor, Fawcett, the horsebreaker, who leaned back, <b>his</b> <b>long,</b> thin <b>legs,</b> with their box-cloth riding-gaiters, thrust {{out in front}} of him, tapping his {{protruding}} teeth with his riding-whip, with anxious thought in every line of his rugged, bony face. Publican, exquisite, and horsebreaker were all three equally silent, equally earnest, and equally critical. Montgomery, seated in the midst of them, looked from one to the other.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stop, you white-livered hound!' {{cried the}} robber, {{shouting}} after Toby Crackit, who, {{making the best}} use of <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs,</b> was already ahead. 'Stop!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're very {{comfortable}} here, Lynch," [...] said the doctor, stretching <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> before the fire, and putting his dirty boots upon the fender.|$|E
60|$|On a railing, {{stretching}} out <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> and observing the passers-by, sat her cousin, Martin Stone. He got down {{as she came}} up.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit {{sat in his}} secretest {{place in}} the dear Old Briar-patch with one of <b>his</b> <b>long</b> hind <b>legs</b> all swelled up and terribly sore because of the fine wire fast around it and cutting into it. He could hear Farmer Brown's boy going around {{on the edge of}} the dear Old Briar-patch and {{stopping}} every little while to do something. In spite of his pain, Peter was curious. Finally he called Danny Meadow Mouse.|$|R
60|$|With a {{tremendous}} spring from <b>his</b> <b>long</b> hind <b>legs</b> Limberheels leaped, while Peter Rabbit stared, his mouth wide open with astonishment. He hadn't dreamed {{that any one}} could jump so far in proportion to his size as this slim, trim little cousin of Danny's. Later, after Limberheels had jumped for Peter's benefit until he was tired and had gone to hunt for a lunch of grass seeds, Peter wanted to know all about Limberheels.|$|R
60|$|With, that, Grandfather Frog {{suddenly}} jumped. It was a great, long, beautiful jump, {{and with}} <b>his</b> <b>long</b> hind <b>legs</b> straight out behind him, Grandfather Frog {{disappeared in the}} Smiling Pool so neatly that he made hardly a splash at all, only {{a whole lot of}} rings {{on the surface of the}} water that grew bigger and bigger until they met the rings made by Little Joe Otter and then became all mixed up.|$|R
60|$|Saxon {{burst out}} laughing, {{and leaned back}} in his seat with <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> {{stretched}} straight out and his hands in his breeches pockets.|$|E
60|$|Josiah Crabtree {{was running}} {{with all the}} speed of <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs,</b> and the two lads soon found that they had all {{they could do to}} keep him in sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "D-don't like Red Brook Seedlings, Sam? D-don't like 'em?" [...] said Jethro. He had parted {{his blue}} coat tails and seated {{himself on the}} stoop, <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> hanging over it.|$|E
60|$|Carrier had {{resumed his}} {{interesting}} occupation of picking <b>his</b> teeth: <b>his</b> <b>long,</b> thin <b>legs</b> were stretched out before him; from beneath his flaccid lids he shot swift glances upwards, whenever Martin-Roget in his restless pacing crossed and recrossed {{in front of}} the open door. But anon, when the latter came to a halt under the lintel and with his foot almost across the threshold, young Lalouët was upon him in an instant, barring the way to the inner sanctum.|$|R
60|$|So it {{was that}} Whitefoot saw all that happened. He saw Whitey {{suddenly}} sail out on silent wings from that stump and swoop with great claws reaching for some one. And then he saw who that some one was,--Shadow the Weasel! He saw Shadow dodge in the very nick of time. Then he watched Whitey swoop again and again as Shadow dodged {{this way and that}} way. Finally both disappeared amongst the trees. Then he turned {{just in time to see}} Jumper the Hare bounding away with all the speed of <b>his</b> wonderful, <b>long</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He sat {{within the}} halo of yellow light shed by two tallow candles, whose sconces were two empty bottles, and contemptuously he eyed the youth in black, {{standing}} with white face and quivering lip {{in a corner}} of the mean chamber. Then he laughed again, and in a hoarse voice, sorely suggestive of the bottle, he broke into song. He lay back in <b>his</b> chair, <b>his</b> <b>long,</b> spare <b>legs</b> outstretched, <b>his</b> spurs jingling to the lilt of his ditty whose burden ran: ...|$|R
