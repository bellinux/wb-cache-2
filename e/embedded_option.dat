50|$|In {{the context}} of an MBS or {{callable}} bond, the <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> relates primarily to the borrower's right to refinance the debt at a lower interest rate. These securities must therefore pay higher yields than noncallable debt, and their values are more fairly compared by OAS than by yield. OAS is usually measured in basis points (bp, or 0.01%).|$|E
50|$|Exchangeable bond (or XB) {{is a type}} {{of hybrid}} {{security}} consisting of a straight bond and an <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> to exchange the bond for the stock of a company other than the issuer (usually a subsidiary or company in which the issuer owns a stake) at some future date and under prescribed conditions. An exchangeable bond is different from a convertible bond. A convertible bond gives the holder the option to convert bond into shares of the issuer.|$|E
50|$|Extendible bond (or {{extendable}} bond) is {{a complex}} bond with the <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> for a holder to extend its maturity date {{by a number of}} years. Such a bond may be considered as a portfolio of a straight, shorter-term bond and a call option to buy a longer-term bond. This relatively rare type of bond works to the advantage of investors during periods of declining interest rates. Pricing of the extendible bond will be similar to that of a puttable bond.|$|E
40|$|In {{times of}} market turmoil {{volatility}} increases and stock values {{and interest rates}} decrease, so that the risks in the balance sheets of insurance companies increase. An important part of these risks {{is due to the}} guarantees that are embedded in insurance policies. Life insurers sell products like unit-linked, profit sharing and variable annuity products. These contracts contain guarantees to the policyholders. Such contracts embedded in the insurers’ liabilities are called <b>embedded</b> <b>options.</b> The value and cash flow of these contracts are respectively relevant for the balance sheet and the profit and loss account. Typically in periods of volatile markets, the value of these <b>embedded</b> <b>options</b> increase, so that the insurance company must hold a larger liability value on the balance sheet {{in order to be able}} to pay out future cash flows. The valuation of these <b>embedded</b> <b>options</b> in insurance liabilities is therefore important to insurers for risk management applications. In this thesis we consider various topics regarding the valuation of these <b>embedded</b> <b>options.</b> Numerical Analysi...|$|R

50|$|An <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> is a {{component}} of a financial bond or other security, and usually provides the bondholder or the issuer {{the right to take}} some action against the other party. There are several types of options that can be embedded into a bond. Some common types of bonds with embedded options include callable bond, puttable bond, convertible bond, extendible bond, exchangeable bond, and capped floating rate note. A bond may have several options embedded if they are not mutually exclusive.|$|E
50|$|For mortgage-backed securities, a {{projected}} prepayment rate {{tends to be}} stated; for example, the PSA assumption for a particular MBS might equate a particular group of mortgages to an 8-year amortizing bond with 6% mortality per annum. This gives a single series of nominal cash flows, as if the MBS were a riskless bond. If these payments are discounted to net present value (NPV) with a riskless zero-coupon Treasury yield curve, the sum of their values will tend to overestimate the market price of the MBS. This difference arises because the MBS market price incorporates additional factors such as liquidity and credit risk and <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> cost. The Z-spread of a bond {{is the number of}} basis points (bp, or 0.01%) that one needs to add to the Treasury yield curve (or technically to Treasury forward rates), so that the NPV of the bond cash flows (using the adjusted yield curve) equals the market price of the bond (including accrued interest). The spread is calculated iteratively.|$|E
5000|$|Callable and putable bonds can {{be valued}} using the lattice-based approach, as above, but {{additionally}} allowing {{that the effect}} of the <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> is incorporated at each node in the tree, impacting the bond price and / or the option price as specified. https://books.google.com/books?id=wF8yVzLI6EYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Valuation+of+fixed+income+securities+and+derivatives These bonds are also sometimes valued using Black-Scholes. Here, the bond is priced as a [...] "straight bond" [...] (i.e. as if it had no embedded features) and the option is valued using the Black Scholes formula. The option value is then added to the straight bond price if the optionality rests with the buyer of the bond; it is subtracted if the seller of the bond (i.e. the issuer) may choose to exercise. http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-414-financial-management-summer-2003/lecture-notes/lec20_options2.pdf http://www.numa.com/derivs/ref/calculat/cb/calc-cbb.htm http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/inv2ed/ill33p6.xls For convertible and exchangeable bonds, a more sophisticated approach is to model the instrument as a [...] "coupled system" [...] comprising an equity component and a debt component, each with different default risks; see Lattice model (finance)#Hybrid Securities.|$|E
50|$|Some {{corporate}} bonds have an <b>embedded</b> call <b>option</b> {{that allows the}} issuer to redeem the debt before its maturity date. These are called callable bonds. A less common feature is an <b>embedded</b> put <b>option</b> that allows investors to put the bond back to the issuer before its maturity date. These are called putable bonds. Both of these features are common to the High Yield market. High Grade bonds rarely have <b>embedded</b> <b>options.</b> A straight bond that is neither callable nor putable is called a bullet bond.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Indian {{corporates}} {{and institutions}} have issued {{a large number}} of exotic bonds with a variety of <b>embedded</b> interest rate <b>options.</b> Pricing the <b>embedded</b> interest rate <b>options</b> is a pre-requisite for valuing these bonds. The pricing of interest rate options is quite complex and depends crucially on the dynamics of interest rates. International studies show that no model of these dynamics is valid world-wide. Drawing on the author’s earlier study of Indian interest rate dynamics (Varma, 1996), this paper expounds a practical methodology for pricing interest rate options in India and valuing bonds with <b>embedded</b> interest rate <b>options.</b> The Black-Derman-Toy model (Black et al., 1994) is shown to be the most attractive tool for valuing interest rate options in India. A real-life application of the proposed approach shows its practical usability in valuing complex instruments with multiple <b>embedded</b> <b>options.</b> This also serves to show that <b>embedded</b> <b>options</b> in bonds {{can make a big difference}} to their valuation...|$|R
5000|$|Option-adjusted spread (OAS) is {{the yield}} spread {{which has to}} be added to a {{benchmark}} yield curve to discount a security's payments to match its market price, using a dynamic pricing model that accounts for <b>embedded</b> <b>options.</b> OAS is hence model-dependent. This concept can be applied to a mortgage-backed security (MBS), or another bond with <b>embedded</b> <b>options,</b> or any other interest rate derivative or option. More loosely, the OAS of a security can be interpreted as its [...] "expected outperformance" [...] versus the benchmarks, if the cash flows and the yield curve behave consistently with the valuation model.|$|R
5000|$|Once calibrated, the {{interest}} rate lattice is then used in the valuation of various of the fixed income instruments and derivatives. The approach for bond options is described aside—note that this approach addresses the problem of pull to par experienced under closed form approaches; see [...] For swaptions the logic is almost identical, substituting swaps for bonds in step 1, and swaptions for bond options in step 2. For caps (and floors) step 1 and 2 are combined: at each node the value {{is based on the}} relevant nodes at the later step, plus, for any caplet (floorlet) maturing in the time-step, the difference between its reference-rate and the short-rate at the node (and reflecting the corresponding day count fraction and notional-value exchanged). For callable- and putable bonds a third step would be required: at each node in the time-step incorporate the effect of the <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> on the bond price and / or the option price there before stepping-backwards one time-step. (And noting that these options are not mutually exclusive, and so a bond may have several options embedded; hybrid securities are treated below.) For other, more exotic interest rate derivatives, similar adjustments are made to steps 1 and onward.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{the value of}} the <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> in U. S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). The option value exhibits significant time variation that is correlated with periods of deflationary expectations. We use our estimated option values to construct an <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> price index and an <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> return index. We then use our <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> indices as independent variables and examine their statistical and economic significance for explaining the future inflation rate. In most of our regressions, our <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> return index is significant even in the presence of traditional inflation variables, such as the yield spread between nominal Treasuries and TIPS, the return on gold bullion, the VIX index return, and the lagged inflation rate. We conduct several robustness tests, including alternative weighting schemes, alternative variable specifications, and alternative data samples. We conclude that the <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> in TIPS contains useful information for future inflation, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Our results should be valuable to practitioners, monetary authorities, and policymakers alike.

Uncertainty comes from prices, which is summarized in a state variable that follows a Brownian motion. Preferences have a multiple-prior utility representation where the set of priors consist of a family of Brownian motions with unknown drift and common variance.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the reactions of}} equity holders and bondholders to the announcement of 427 preferred stock issues. We document an average equity announcement effect of – 0 : 65 %.

The equity market reaction is negatively influenced by convertibility (and the moneyness of the <b>embedded</b> <b>option)</b> and by the firm’s accounting treatment of the issue (specifically if the issue is classified as equity). We find that average credit default swap spreads decrease by 50 basis points after the issue announcement. This decrease is also larger for more creditworthy and transparent firms.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} dimension {{reduction of}} the risk drivers that determine <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> values by using the class of State Space Hidden Markov Models. As embedded options are typically valued by nested Monte Carlo simulations, this dimension reduction leads to a major reduction in computing time. This {{is especially important for}} insurance companies that are dealing with many <b>embedded</b> <b>option</b> valuations {{in order to determine the}} market value of their liabilities. To achieve the dimension {{reduction of the}} risk driver process, this thesis proposes a specifi c Hidden Markov Model approach. An overview on current methods for state and parameter inference within this class of models is presented. For the state-of-the-art CPF-SAEM method insights are obtained by investigating an example of the dimension reduction model. Furthermore, the satisfactory behavior of this HMM approach is investigated in more detail for multiple (market) cases. Lastly, the dimension reduction model is applied to calibration of the Heston model parameters to market data. It is shown that this approach avoids over fitting issues and results in a more stable model than direct calibration of the parameters.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the valuation of equity-linked annuities with mortality risk under a double regime-switching model, which provides a way to endogenously determine the regime-switching risk. The model parameters and the reference investment fund price level are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-time, observable Markov chain. In particular, the risk-free interest rate, the appreciation rate, the volatility and the martingale describing the jump component of the reference investment fund are related to the modulating Markov chain. Two approaches, namely, the regime-switching Esscher transform and the minimal martingale measure, are used to select pricing kernels for the fair valuation. Analytical pricing formulas for the <b>embedded</b> <b>options</b> underlying these products are derived using the inverse Fourier transform.
