Thus, we incubated different ratios of CBM-SUMO to Accellerase® 1500 for 1  h and calculated the increase in cellulase activity. CBM-SUMO was used in place of CBMCBHI because the previous experiment showed that the cellulase activity improvement of the former construct was the same or higher for ratios (w/w) 5 : 1 or less of CBM:enzyme. As shown in Figure  2 C, there was a steady activity improvement reaching values as high as 30 % when a ratio of 1 : 1 (w/w, CBM-SUMO:enzyme) was used. No reducing sugar could be detected when only CBM-SUMO was incubated with the substrate. We observed an enhancement of about 5 % even when the ratio was as small as 1 : 100.
