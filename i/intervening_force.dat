5000|$|Another common {{misconception}} about siphons, is {{that because}} the atmospheric pressure is virtually identical at the entrance and exit, the atmospheric pressure cancels, and therefore atmospheric pressure can't be pushing the liquid up the siphon. But equal and opposite forces may not completely cancel {{if there is an}} <b>intervening</b> <b>force</b> that counters some or all of one of the forces. In the siphon, the atmospheric pressure at the entrance and exit are both lessened by the force of gravity pulling down the liquid in each tube, but the pressure on the down side is lessened more by the taller column of liquid on the down side. In effect, the atmospheric pressure coming up the down side doesn't entirely [...] "make it" [...] to the top to cancel all of the atmospheric pressure pushing up the up side. This effect can be seen more easily in the example of two carts being pushed up opposite sides of a hill. As shown in the diagram, even though the person on the left seems to have his push canceled entirely by the equal and opposite push from the person on the right, the person on the left's seemingly canceled push is still the source of the force to push the left cart up.|$|E

40|$|Three defendants, the Standard Oil Company, Parker, their lessee, and Powell, a contractor, negligently removed an {{underground}} storage tank and allowed a large quantity of gasoline to spill and flow {{on a city}} street. The fire department was summoned. After the street had been washed, a fireman {{at the direction of}} the fire chief touched a lighter to the street to test the effectiveness of the washing. The resulting fire damaged plaintiff’s automobile. The trial court held Standard, Parker, Powell, the fireman, and the fire chief liable. Upon appeal by defendants Standard, Parker, and Powell to the Supreme Court of Kansas, held: Affirmed. The act of the fireman in touching his lighter to the pavement was not so unrelated to the negligent spilling of the gasoline as to constitute the sole proximate cause of the fire. The negligent spilling of the gasoline and the touching of the lighter to the pavement were both proximate causes of the fire and the damage. It has frequently been recognized that there may be more than one proximate cause of an injury. In most jurisdictions the first wrongdoer, even though his act has merely set the stage on which the second wrongdoer contributes to the plaintiff’s injury, is no longer relieved from liability. The courts argue that the second negligent act is merely a means by which the first wrongful act becomes harmful. One of the tests in delimiting liability in such a case is whether the later negligent act was itself foreseeable. Thus, it is generally held that a defendant will not be relieved of liability by an <b>intervening</b> <b>force</b> which could reasonably have been foreseen, or by an <b>intervening</b> <b>force</b> which is a normal incident of the risk involved...|$|E

40|$|In {{counterinsurgency}} wars with large-scale {{foreign military}} interventions, {{under what conditions}} do in-country allies comply {{with the demands of}} foreign <b>intervening</b> <b>forces</b> and under what conditions do allies dismiss foreign demands? By examining thousands of primary source documents drawn from foreign interventions in Vietnam, Afghanistan (U. S. S. R.), Sri Lanka, Afghanistan (U. S.), and Iraq, the study uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze 460 specific requests from foreign allies to their in-country counterinsurgency partners, measuring conditions affecting in-country allied compliance with (or defiance of) foreign requests. Revisiting definitions of 2 ̆ 2 power 2 ̆ 2 in international relations and moving beyond underspecified explanations of alliance politics, this study theorizes that certain structures inherent in this type of counterinsurgency partnership influence the behavior of in-country allies. Specifically, the study argues that five factors influence the likelihood of in-country compliance with foreign allied demands, including: 1) the potential unilateral ability of <b>intervening</b> <b>forces</b> to implement the requested policy; 2) the alignment of allied preferences over the policy; 3) the capacity of the host government; 4) wartime complications; and 5) the presence of an acute enemy threat. These variables interact with each other to produce a complex set of incentives for allied cooperation or defiance. In particular, the study argues that whether or not allied interests converge or diverge over a proposed policy interacts with the unilateral ability of <b>intervening</b> <b>forces</b> to implement the policy. For example, if allied preferences converge and the foreign ally can implement the request unilaterally, the host ally has an incentive to free-ride and is unlikely to comply. Conversely, if allied interests diverge and the foreign ally can implement the request unilaterally, the in-country regime has an incentive to participate in order to avoid being undermined by its ally acting unilaterally. Overall, the study found remarkable consistency across this subset of wars, with approximately 1 / 3 of foreign requests complied with, 1 / 3 complied with in part, and 1 / 3 left unfulfilled. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} use of the military instrument for initiating a state-building process in fragile states as a foundation for stability and basic security. This is done by analysing the position of the armed intervening parties in Afghanistan in the 2001 - 2011 period as an empirical and qualitative single-case study. Owing to their weak governmental institutions, instability and lack of basic security, fragile state can represent serious security risks. Events taking place far from national borders of developed states governed by the rule of law can therefore affect the national security situations of those states. Whatever the motive for an armed intervention, before it commences the question must be asked as to whether the intervention force is fit-for-purpose regarding the tasks to be carried out and whether there is a large enough support base, not only for the invasion, but also for the long-term process required for the political consolidation of military results. The <b>intervening</b> <b>force</b> must be capable of kneading this harmonisation into a workable and integrated strategy, giving as much confidence as possible to the legitimate and broadly supported leadership and ownership of the fragile state that was subject of the interventio...|$|E
40|$|The USSR {{intervention}} in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989 {{and the current}} Allied US-led {{intervention in}} the same country have many different characteristics but {{also a lot of}} common features. The causes and the final goals for setting them in motion differ as much as their initial approaches but {{with the passage of time}} they have both grown into counterinsurgency operations. Both of them have gone into their tenth year, although the respective political elites have expected a quick and short intervention. Equally so, although militarily superior, the intervening forces have soon become operationally inferior, so that due to misunderstanding the environment, insufficient coordination and weak interior allies, with inadequate political framework, insufficient engagement of resources and inaccessible ground, all in all, finally limited to maintaining status quo. The political part has failed in the first place. The withdrawal has had devastating consequences for the Soviets. The present American withdrawal is a two-edged sword because the majority of tasks have not been fulfilled and there can be no doubt as to whether the long term deployment is not the right solution. It is important to analyze and compare the two operations in order to be able to detect the successful steps as well as the opportunities missed and draw conclusions on the continuation of the Allied operation; for the Allies, as stated correctly by the historian Paul Robinson, have found themselves in a position quite similar to the Soviet case. The purpose of the research is twofold. First, to analyze the essential characteristics of the political dimension of counterinsurgency operation through the activity of the <b>intervening</b> <b>force</b> towards counterinsurgency operation centers of gravity; the second is to offer recommendations for the correct use of the principles of counterinsurgency operation...|$|E

40|$|Debates {{about whether}} or not to engage in {{interventions}} to stabilize and rebuild states that have suffered extreme events, such as wars and large-scale natural disasters include questions {{about whether or}} not the <b>intervening</b> <b>force</b> can complete the mission. Intervening is a complex task that faces considerable political and military obstacles, even when the intervention is welcome. The situation is only more complex and difficult when the force is not welcome. This requires the reconstruction, and often construction, of governance capacity in the situation when all, or nearly all, capacity has been destroyed, but the situation is rapidly changing. To be effective, the missions and the governance structures that those missions are trying to build must have not only the capacity to govern, but also the resilience to respond and adapt to that changing environment. This research examines the relationship between resilience, capacity, and a mission’s effectiveness. Capacity is the total amount of resources available to the mission, including the funds, materiel, and personnel that each organization devotes to the effort of completing mission tasks. Resilience is the mission’s ability to identify changes in the environment and adapt to them. Effectiveness is the mission’s ability to meet its formally stated goals, as well implicitly understood goals. Analyzing these relationships requires first answering these questions: •	Who are the actors? •	What are the system rules? •	What are the patterns of interaction? •	How do actors select actions? •	How do actors select which actors with whom they will interact? •	What are the patterns of variation in the data covered in the preceding questions? The data to answer all of these questions is gathered both from existing data sources, including situation and newspaper reports, and from interviews with the individuals involved in the decision making during two reconstruction efforts: the 1992 - 2002 UN intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the on-going UN intervention in Haiti, which began in 2004. The research constructs models of these events using qualitative systems analysis, network analysis, statistical analysis, and simulation analysis to show that increasing resilience increases effectiveness, after controlling for capacity...|$|E

40|$|Bolstering local {{perceptions}} of legitimacy in armed intervention {{has emerged as}} an important feature of increasingly complex international peace and statebuilding efforts. Yet, previous research has only begun to explore what local legitimacy entails to those involved in, and affected by, armed intervention. This dissertation advances an understanding of local legitimacy as a perception-based, relational phenomenon. Through this lens, it examines armed intervention in Afghanistan (2001 - 2014). In particular, this dissertation studies how the relationship between Afghan citizens and <b>intervening</b> armed <b>forces</b> interacts with, and shapes, perspectives on local legitimacy held by the main 'interveners' and those 'intervened upon'. This dissertation consists of an introduction, which situates the study in a wider context, and four essays. Beginning with the organizational perspectives of the main intervening actors in Afghanistan, Essay I finds that the UN and NATO initially conceptualized problems of local legitimacy as principally the consequence of a fragile Afghan state, and not as failings of the intervention. When negative dimensions of intervention became increasingly recognized, principal responsibility for the legitimacy process shifted away from intervening authorities and onto the Afghan state. Similarly, Essay II shows how key U. S. military doctrine, over time, reconceptualized the formal duty of <b>intervening</b> <b>forces</b> in the local legitimacy process, ultimately considering it contingent on, and subordinate to, the will and capabilities of host-state authorities and the local population. Turning thereafter to firsthand accounts from the field, Essay III and Essay IV together contrast personal perspectives on the intervention held by U. S. Army Officers and Afghan citizens. Essay III finds that personal experiences of noncombat contact with Afghans reinforced the Officers' sense of duty toward the local population. Conversely, Essay IV suggests that the local legitimacy of <b>intervening</b> <b>forces</b> became increasingly contested among Afghans, due largely to the perceived intensification of foreign intrusion on 'everyday' life. Taken together, {{the findings of this}} dissertation lay the foundation {{for the development of a}} new concept, the host-citizen contract. In so doing, it provides a social contract framework to better understand the complex dynamics of local legitimacy in Afghanistan, and beyond...|$|R

40|$|Click on the DOI link below {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Practice style {{variation}}, or variation {{in the manner in}} which physicians treat patients with a similar disease condition, has been the focus of attention for many years. The research agenda is further intensified by the unrealistic assumption that by reducing variation, quality will be improved, costs will be reduced, or both. There is a wealth of literature that identifies differences in health care use of many kinds, in apparently similar communities. Attempts have been made by many scholars to identify the determinants of variation in terms of differences in the population characteristics (e. g. age, sex, insurance, etc.) and geographical characteristics (e. g. distance to provider, number of physicians, number of hospital beds, etc.). When significant differences in use rates prevail after controlling for differences in population characteristics, it is often attributed to 'uncertainty', or the fact that there is no consensus on what constitutes the optimum treatment process. It is suggested by this literature that the greatest variation can be found in the circumstances where there is the most 'uncertainty'. In this work, a physician resource demand model is proposed in which it is suggested that, during the diagnosis and treatment process, physicians demand resources consistent with the clinical needs of the patients, modified by the <b>intervening</b> <b>forces</b> under which they practice. These <b>intervening</b> <b>forces,</b> or constraints, are categorized as patient agency constraints, organizational constraints and environmental constraints, which are characterized as 'induced variation'. It is suggested that when all of the variables that constitute these constraints are identified, the remaining variance represents 'innate variance', or practice style differences. It is further suggested that the more completely this model is specified, the more likely area differences will be attenuated and the smaller will be the residual variance. peer reviewe...|$|R
