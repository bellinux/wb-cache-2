25|$|From the {{application}} protocol point of view, TLS {{belongs to a}} lower layer, although the TCP/IP model is too coarse to show it. This means that the TLS handshake is usually (except in the STARTTLS case) performed before {{the application}} protocol can start. In the name-based virtual server feature being provided by the application layer, all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the ClientHello message. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> in hosting environments because it means either sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different IP address for each of them.|$|E

2500|$|To fix {{carbon dioxide}} into sugar {{molecules}} {{in the process}} of photosynthesis, chloroplasts use an enzyme called RuBisCO. RuBisCO has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen, so at high oxygen concentrations, RuBisCO starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors. This has the end result of ATP energy being wasted and [...] being released, all with no sugar being produced. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem,</b> since O is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis, causing issues down the line in the Calvin cycle which uses RuBisCO.|$|E
