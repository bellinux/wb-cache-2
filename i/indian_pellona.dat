50|$|The {{stream is}} an {{important}} seasonal freshwater artisanal fishery producing an annual catch, as of 2016, of about US$500,000 from an average weekly catch of 5 to 15kg by each fisherman. In the lower reaches of the stream, this low catch of smaller immature fish is evidence of lack of management of the fishery. Less than 1% {{to as much as}} 10% of the local population may be engaged at least part-time as fishermen, most are men. Full-time fishermen earn about US$1,000 to 2,000 per year, which is below the poverty line. Gill nets, cast nets, long lines, fish hooks and line sets, spears, traps and traditional fishing boats are used. The catch includes Snapper (Aha-an), Flagtail (Aligaman), Crab (Alimango), Red-tailed goby (Anga), Squaretail mullet (Balanak), Goby (Batinga), Silver perch (Bugaong), Otomebora Mullet (Bunak), Indo-Pacific Tarpon (Buwan-buwan), Loach goby (Dalapakan), Mountain bass (Damagan), <b>Indian</b> <b>pellona</b> (Ibis), Flathead grey mullet (Gisaw), Gourami (Gurami), Mudfish (Halu-an), Shrimp (Hipon, Goby (Iswil), Carp (Karpa), Eel (Kasili), Spotted Scat (Kikilo), Mullet (Muli), Cyprinidae (Pait), Catfish (Pantat), Rock goby (Pigok), Mangrove red snapper (Tadlungan), Tilapia. The fishing season is the dry season, November to May, in the mid and upper ranges of the stream and flood season, June to October, in its lower reaches when large fish are being washed down.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the incidence of isopod parasites in clupeids, with special emphasis on the <b>Indian</b> <b>pellona</b> fish, Pellona ditchela. Two species of isopods, Joryma hilsae and Joryma sawayah were found infecting this fish. The isopods of the genus Joryma are typical Indo-Pacific genus, found infecting the gills of marine fishes. However, {{this is the first}} report of these two species in <b>Indian</b> <b>pellona,</b> P. ditchela along the Bay of Bengal off Chennai coast, India. The prevalence (%) of J. hilsae and J. sawayah in P. ditchela recorded during the present investigation were 17. 7 and 32. 3 respectively. Cymothoids are common isopod parasites of marine fishes and their infection can cause serious damages to the fishes...|$|E
