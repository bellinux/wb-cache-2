500|$|Neal Purvis and Robert Wade wrote a {{draft of}} a remake of the 1969 British crime comedy The Italian Job which was {{rejected}} by Paramount. Screenwriting team Donna and Wayne Powers were subsequently commissioned to write a remake. The duo viewed the original film, which neither <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> only once [...] "because [...] {{wanted to get a}} sense of what it was about" [...] in regards to its tone. Over the course of two years and through 18 drafts, they developed a screenplay which was described by director F. Gary Gray as [...] "inspired by the original." [...] Gray, Powers and Powers, and executive producer James Dyer identified the most prominent similarities as the trio of Mini Coopers used by the thieves, as well as the titular heist involving the theft of gold bullion. Some sequences of the film were storyboarded and previsualized by Gray before production began.|$|E
500|$|Tess Harper was {{performing}} {{on stage in}} Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford {{was so impressed with}} her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, [...] "She walked into the room and even before she spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand. Tender Mercies was Harper's feature film debut, and she was so excited about the role she bit her script {{to make sure it was}} real. When filming ended, Duvall gave her a blue cowgirl shirt as a gift with a card that read, [...] "You really were Rosa Lee".|$|E
500|$|In 1887, the British {{palaeontologist}} Harry G. Seeley {{described a}} fossil synsacrum (fused vertebrae {{attached to the}} pelvis) from the Isle of Wight, an {{island off the coast}} of southern England. Though he compared it with those of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, he concluded that it belonged to a bird (though more dinosaur-like than any known bird), which he named Ornithodesmus cluniculus. The British geologist John W. Hulke suggested later that year that Ornithodesmus was a pterosaur, finding it similar to fossils that he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> but Seeley disagreed. In his 1901 Dragons of the Air, the first popular book about pterosaurs, Seeley reported another specimen (NHMUK R176 at the Natural History Museum in London, formerly BMNH), found by the reverend William Fox in Atherfield on the Isle of Wight, and acquired by the British Museum in 1882. Specimen NHMUK R176 had been assigned to the species Ornithocheirus nobilis by the English naturalist Richard Lydekker in 1888, but Seeley considered it another species of the genus Ornithodesmus, which he now considered pterosaurian. Seeley named the new species O. latidens; latus is Latin for [...] "wide" [...] and dens means [...] "tooth", a name originally used by Fox and his friends. Seeley presumably assigned the new species to the existing genus due to similarities between their sacra, but with little explanation.|$|E

The benefits of retrieval practice would be reflected in an advantage of new questions over quiz-only questions. If prequestions add to this benefit, then weekly quiz performance would be greater for postquestions compared to new questions.|$|R

2500|$|In {{discussing}} Abulafia's poetry, Peter Cole states: [...] "Above all, Todros’s work {{is distinguished}} by its freshness and candor: {{he managed to}} introduce a vivid (though not always straight forward) personal dimension into his verse that went well beyond anything medieval Hebrew poetry <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> him. He filled the classical conventions with irony, turned them on their heads, or did away with them altogether and created new poetic space in which to work." ...|$|E

Ford enjoyed what he described as a [...] "natural and uninhibited" [...] conversation with Brezhnev during the tour, and his only regret about it was {{that he did not have}} more time to see and explore the city: to him, Vladivostok was reminiscent of San Francisco. Kissinger also saw the resemblance, noting that Vladivostok [...] "bore little resemblance to the teeming, hyperactive metropolises of Japan and Korea" [...] he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> arriving in the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|Unkei ( [...] ; c. 1150– 1223) was a Japanese {{sculptor}} of the Kei school, which {{flourished in}} the Kamakura period. He specialized in statues of the Buddha and other important Buddhist figures. Unkei's early works are fairly traditional, similar in style to pieces by his father, Kōkei. However, the sculptures he produced for the Tōdai-ji in Nara show a flair for realism different from anything Japan <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> Today, Unkei is {{the best known of}} the Kei artists, and many art historians consider him its [...] "most distinguished member".|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} whether there was {{intentional}} homoerotic content between K/S in the show, and in particular in the episode [...] "Amok Time", Star Trek's writer D.C. Fontana replied, [...] "In answer to your question, NO — there were no homosexual double-entendres in the script — at least none that were deliberate. If some viewers chose to read that into the dialogue, etc., that's their point of view, but certainly not ours. Writer Theodore Sturgeon was trying to reveal Spock's inner human in a struggle with what his culture, his upbringing and his half-human/half-Vulcan heritage had instilled in him about emotion and controlling it in an out-of-control situation. It also was a peek into the Vulcan culture that no one <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> That's ALL we were doing. I've heard this nonsense (especially about Kirk/Spock) for years. There is no basis to it. I hope this answer is helpful to you" ...|$|E
2500|$|A long detour to [...] {{served to}} show that there was no land {{connection}} between New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at [...] before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at [...] by [...] This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century. With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment. In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between 53° and 57°S to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered Roché Island renaming it Isle of Georgia, and discovered the South Sandwich Islands (named Sandwich Land by him), the only ice-clad land he <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>before</b> crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between 55° and 60°. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the 60th parallel, and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and without economic value.|$|E
2500|$|George Loddiges' {{tropical}} hothouse range {{made use}} of recently invented curvilinear iron glazing bars and central heating systems, which together with his own inventions, enabled many new species of tropical plant to be introduced into cultivation, or flower {{for the first time}} in Europe. Visiting the hothouses on 30 March 1822, the Quaker pharmacist William Allen, his Cousin Emily Birkbeck and Anna Hanbury noted: We all went to Loddiges Nursery to see the camellias which are now in full bloom and very beautiful ! There is quite a forest of them: his hot-houses are, perhaps, the most capricious in the world: one off them is forty feet high: in this there is a banana tree which nearly reaches the top. A few years later, in 1829, Jacob Rinz (a visitor from a Frankfurt nursery) commented: never shall I forget the sensation produced by this establishment. I cannot describe the raptures I experienced on seeing that immense palm house. All that I <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> of the kind appeared nothing to me compared with this. I fancied myself in the and especially at that moment when Mr Loddiges had the kindness to produce, in my presence, a shower of artificial rain. Such conditions were ideal for tropical orchids, several of which were named in honour of George Loddiges, including Loddiges' dendrobium.|$|E
