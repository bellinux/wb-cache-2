5|$|Each {{account is}} {{closed with a}} {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in the}} text as a tail-piece. These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye <b>for</b> <b>detail,</b> style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E

5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was complicated and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye <b>for</b> <b>detail</b> and used a hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour blocks for a single image. He {{went on to become the}} preeminent wood engraver and colour printer in Britain during the second half of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|For pharmacology, Shen {{wrote of}} the {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as the}} proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern <b>for</b> <b>detail</b> and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E
5|$|The book on Lappland was {{published}} in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using the photos and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many of the photos resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions of the photos, but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the goahtis, and {{the richness of the}} Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as the bent knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls. Bauer's eye <b>for</b> <b>detail</b> and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic documentation of the era.|$|E

5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye <b>for</b> <b>detail.</b> Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed he cared deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E

25|$|Fuzzy-trace theory, a dual {{process model}} {{of memory and}} reasoning, was also derived from Gestalt psychology.

25|$|Although spiritual {{direction}} {{is not necessarily}} connected with the sacrament, the sacrament of penance has throughout the centuries been one of its main settings, enabling the Christian to become sensitive to God's presence, deepen the personal relationship with Christ, and attend to {{the action of the}} Spirit in one's life. In the 20th century, during the Second Vatican Council, new approaches were taken in the presentation of this sacrament, taking into account the concern of scrupulosity, or the exaggerated obsessive concern <b>for</b> <b>detail.</b> This further distinguished the role of penance from forms of psychotherapy.|$|E

By January 1935, a wooden mock-up had been finished, and although a number of suggestions <b>for</b> <b>detail</b> changes were made, construction of the prototype was approved, and a new specification (F.36/34) was written around the design.
