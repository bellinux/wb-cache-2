25|$|The {{geographic}} location of Billings {{was essential to}} its economic success. Billings's future as a major trade and distribution center was basically assured from its founding as a railroad hub due to its {{geographic location}}. As Billings quickly became the region's economic hub it outgrew the other cities in the region. The Billings trade area serves over a half million people. A major trade and distribution center, the city is home to many regional headquarters and corporate headquarters. With Montana having no sales tax, Billings is a retail destination for much of Wyoming, North and South Dakota as well as much of Montana east of the Continental Divide. $1 out of every $7 spent on retail purchases in Montana <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>spent</b> in Billings. The percentage of wholesale business transactions done in Billings is even stronger, Billings {{accounts for more than}} a quarter of the wholesale business for the entire state, these figures do not include Billings portion of sales for Wyoming and the Dakotas. Billings is an energy center; Billings sits amidst the largest coal reserves in the United States as well as large oil and natural gas fields.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem is}} further {{exacerbated}} by inadequate resources and trained personnel. Many rural areas – {{where most of}} China's HIV-positive population resides – {{do not have the}} capacity to monitor patients' CD4+ cell counts and viral load. In some cases, the physical infrastructure exists, but staff do not have the skills or reagents to use it. Human resource capacity is a major constraint on China's ability to deliver HIV prevention and care. Many health workers and educators have poor knowledge of HIV and hold their own biases and stigmas towards those at risk or infected with HIV. A substantial proportion of the funds allocated to HIV prevention and control <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>spent</b> on establishing training centers and in building the capacity of health workers so that they can deliver better services. But many of those willing to work in rural areas do not have formal medical qualifications to begin with, which limits their abilities to understand the complexities of treating HIV patients. Furthermore, health services rely heavily on user fees, which often encourages health workers to do additional, chargeable services that many people living with HIV/AIDS cannot afford.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{criticism}} is that money <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>spent</b> on the rich {{at the expense of}} the poor. Critics contend that it does not serve any of the townships of Gauteng where the transport problem is severe and where the majority of the people live. However, supporters maintain that the train was never meant to be an alternative to mass public transport; instead, it was intended to reduce pressure on Johannesburg's overloaded highway system. Figures released by the Gauteng provincial government in 2003 indicated that the project would do little to relieve traffic on the over-used Ben Schoeman Highway (one of the major motivations for the project), as traffic volumes would be higher when the Gautrain was completed and operating at full capacity in 2010. Leftist political groupings like the SACP and labour movements like COSATU branded the Gautrain as a train for the rich and called on government not to proceed with the project. A national parliamentary oversight body, the Transport Portfolio Committee, held public hearings in November 2005 and subsequently advised Cabinet to scrap or postpone the project. However, National Cabinet decided on 7 December 2005 to financially support Gautrain.|$|E
25|$|Benefits versus cost. The {{intention}} of locating US persons and their non-US financial accounts was to increase tax {{revenues from the}} interest, dividends, and gains of those assets. The majority of assets located was expected be the international equivalent of standard checking and savings accounts, where the applicable interest was less than 0.5% during 2015. The majority of that income is already (by tax treaty) attributable to the country where it resides. (IRS Form 1116 is normally used to credit foreign taxes upon passive income.) Another source from which FATCA intends to raise revenue is {{in the identification of}} a wider population of US persons. However, the majority (82%) of overseas US persons filing owe no tax to the US (due to tax treaties). At the congressional hearing on 26 April 2017, Congressman Mark Meadows stated that according to FATCA's drafters themselves, FATCA would, at most, reduce tax evasion by less than 1% (i.e. recoup less than $1billion out of an estimated $100billion in lost revenue). In contrast, he said, normal enforcement activities create a return of $20 for every $1 spent. Because $200million <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>spent</b> to implement FATCA in FY2017, the IRS commissioner’s own estimates show that just shifting the money from FATCA to general enforcement would increase tax revenues by over $1billion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the Food Stamp Program as laid out in its {{implementation}} was to assist low-income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to Peter H. Rossi, a sociologist whose work involved evaluation of social programs, [...] "the program rests {{on the assumption that}} households with restricted incomes may skimp on food purchases and live on diets that are inadequate in quantity and quality, or, alternatively skimp on other necessities to maintain an adequate diet". Food stamps, as many like Rossi, MacDonald, and Eisinger contend, are used not only for increasing food but also as income maintenance. Income maintenance is money that households are able to spend on other things because they no longer have to spend it on food. According to various studies shown by Rossi, because of income maintenance only about $0.17–$0.47 more <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>spent</b> on food for every food stamp dollar than was spent prior to individuals receiving food stamps.|$|E

[...] "Together we must stop the practices that feed corruption or undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of national institutions." [...] The international aid is tied to a mechanism that will regularly review how it <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>spent,</b> and to guarantees from Kabul that it will seriously take on its deep-rooted corruption problems – what the conference called a roadmap of accountability. Kabul must also demonstrate efforts to improve governance and finance management, and safeguard the democratic process, {{rule of law and}} human rights – especially those of women. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed the need for reform to safeguard changes achieved in Afghanistan.

2500|$|In January 1861 Leskov {{moved to}} Saint Peterburg where he stayed at Professor Ivan Vernadsky's along with Zemlya i volya member Andrey Nechiporenko and met Taras Shevchenko. For {{a short while}} he moved to Moscow and started {{to work for the}} Russkaya Retch newspaper, all the while {{contributing}} to Otechestvennye Zapiski. In December he left Russkaya Retch (for personal, rather than ideological reasons) and moved back to Saint Peterburg where in January 1862 he joined the staff of the Northern Bee (Severnaya ptchela), a liberal newspaper edited by Pavel Usov. There Leskov met journalist Arthur Benni, a Polish-born British citizen, with whom he forged a great friendship and later came to defend, as leftist radicals in Petersburg started to spread rumours about his being [...] "an English spy" [...] and having links with the 3rd Department. For Severnaya ptchela Leskov (now writing as M. Stebnitsky, a pseudonym he used in 1862–1869) became the head of the domestic affairs department, writing sketches and articles on every possible aspect of everyday life, and also critical pieces, targeting what was termed nihilism and [...] "vulgar materialism". He had some support at the time, from several prominent journalists, among them Grigory Eliseev, who wrote in the April, 1862, Sovremennik issue: [...] "Those lead columns in Ptchela make one pity the potential that <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>spent</b> there, still unrealised elsewhere." [...] At a time of intense public excitement, as D. S. Mirsky pointed out, Leskov was [...] "absorbed by the public interest as much as anyone, but his eminently practical mind and training made it impossible for him to join unreservedly any of the very impractical and hot-headed parties of the day. Hence his isolation when, in the spring of [...] 1862, an incident occurred that had a lasting effect on his career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Scalia wrote a {{concurrence}} (which {{was joined}} by Justice Clarence Thomas), where he agreed that the case had to be reversed but held that the Court had not gone far enough, [...] "If this Court is to decide cases by rule of law rather than show of hands, we must surrender to logic and choose sides: Either Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968), should be applied to (at a minimum) all challenges to the governmental expenditure of general tax revenues in a manner alleged to violate a constitutional provision specifically limiting the taxing and spending power, or Flast should be repudiated. For me, the choice is easy. Flast is wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdiction that this Court has repeatedly confirmed are embodied in the doctrine of standing." [...] He said the problem was because [...] "We have alternately relied on two entirely distinct conceptions of injury in fact, which for convenience I will call 'Wallet Injury' and 'Psychic Injury.' ...Psychic Injury...has {{nothing to do with}} the plaintiff's tax liability. Instead, the injury consists of the taxpayer’s mental displeasure that money extracted from him <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>spent</b> in an unlawful manner. ...this conceptualizing of injury in fact in purely mental terms conflicts squarely with the familiar proposition that a plaintiff lacks a concrete and particularized injury when his only complaint is the generalized grievance that the law is being violated. ...We have never explained why Psychic Injury was insufficient in the cases in which standing was denied, and we have never explained why Psychic Injury, however limited, is cognizable under Article III."
