The standoff continued, as heavily armed militants had retreated into the basement using women and children as human shields, according to the Pakistan Army spokesman. The militants in the basement resisted with machine guns, shoulder-fired rockets, and Molotov cocktails. In a last interview with Geo TV during the operation, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, who was hunkered <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> claimed {{that his mother had}} been wounded by gunfire and was quoted as saying, [...] "The government is using full force.

500|$|Talk {{of doing}} a {{crossover}} with Millennium {{had been going on}} even when both shows were still on the air. After Millennium was cancelled, however, The X-Files staff realized that a crossover made sense. Despite this, writing the story proved difficult. The writers of the episode did not know whether to write an episode that dealt solely with wrapping-up Millennium or if they should feature elements of Millennium intermixed within an X-Files investigation. The writers eventually went with the latter. Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, explained that from the planning stages of the episode, the staff's intentions were not to focus solely on a wrap-up for Millennium, but rather to answer the question of [...] "what would happen if Frank Black came into Mulder and Scully's world?" [...] Gilligan also maintains that the episode was not solely written to bring closure to the Millennium arc, but also as a way to finally write an episode of The X-Files about zombies. He explained: [...] "It wasn't about the plot as much as getting [...] <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of this creepy old house with these zombies climbing up out of the ground, and having to [...] in the head." [...] According to Gilligan, another part of the inspiration for the episode was the fear surrounding the perceived Year 2000 problem. This was an issue for both digital and non-digital documentation and data storage situations which resulted from the practice of abbreviating a four-digit year to two digits. However, many people believed that it would signal a disaster or potentially the end of the world. Gilligan later joked that he was [...] "proud to say I never bought into any of that Y2K BS for a minute!" ...|$|E

On one side are shelves, filled with balls of marline, ratlin-stuf, seizing-stuff, spun-yarn, and numerous twines of assorted sizes. In another direction you see large cases containing heaps of articles, reminding one of a shoemaker's furnishing-store--wooden serving-mallets, fids, toggles, and heavers: iron prickers and marling-spikes; in a third quarter you see a sort of hardware shop--shelves piled with all manner of hooks, bolts, nails, screws, and thimbles; and, in still another direction, you see a block-maker's store, heaped up with lignum-vitae sheeves and wheels.|$|R

2500|$|Because of the smoke, dusk {{came early}} to {{the centre of}} Berlin. At 18:00 hours, while Weidling and his staff {{finalized}} their breakout plans in the Bendlerblock, three regiments of the Soviet 150th Rifle Division, under cover of a heavy artillery barrage and closely supported by tanks, assaulted the Reichstag. All the windows were bricked up, but the soldiers managed to force the main doors and entered the main hall. The German garrison, of about 1,000 defenders (a mixture of sailors, SS and Hitler Youth) fired down on the Soviets from above, turning the main hall into a medieval style killing field. Suffering many casualties, the Soviets got beyond the main hall and started {{to work their way}} up through the building. The fire and subsequent wartime damage had turned the building's interior into a maze of rubble and debris amongst which the German defenders were strongly dug in. The Soviet infantry were forced to clear them out. Fierce room-to-room fighting ensued. As May Day approached Soviet troops reached the roof, but fighting continued inside. Moscow claimed that they hoisted the Red Flag {{on the top of the}} Reichstag at 22:50, however Beevor points out that this may have been an exaggeration as [...] "Soviet propaganda was fixated with the idea of the Reichstag being captured by 1 May". Whatever the truth, the fighting continued as there was still a large contingent of German soldiers <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> The Germans were well stocked with food and ammunition and launched counter-attacks against the Red Army, leading to close fighting in and around the Reichstag. Close combat raged throughout the night and the coming day of 1 May, until the evening when some German troops pulled out of the building and crossed the Friedrichstraße S-Bahn Station, where they moved into the ruins hours before the main breakout across the Spree. About 300 of the last German combatants surrendered. A further 200 defenders were dead and another 500 were already hors de combat, lying wounded in the basement, many before the final assault had started.|$|E

60|$|After Velasquez <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Prado {{we wanted}} Goya, {{and more and}} more Goya, who is as Spanish and as unlike Velasquez as can very well be.

There, striving with their strangeness, we found a young American husband and wife who {{said they were going to}} Egypt, and seemed so anxious to get out of Spain that they all but asked us which turning to take. They had a Baedeker of 1901. which they had been deceived in at New York as the latest edition, and they were apparently making nothing of the Goyas and were as if lost <b>down</b> there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> They were <b>in</b> doubt about going further in a country which had inveigled them from Gibraltar as far as its capital. They advised with us about Burgos, of all places, and when we said <b>the</b> hotels <b>in</b> Burgos were very cold, they answered, Well they had thought so; and the husband asked, Spain was a pretty good place to cut out, wasn't it? The wife expected that they would find some one in Egypt who spoke English; she had expected they would speak French in Spain, but had been disappointed. They had left their warm things at Gibraltar and were almost frozen already. They were as good and sweet and nice as they could be, and we were truly sorry to part with them and leave them to what seemed to be a mistake which they were not to blame for.|$|R

60|$|Mother, it {{has been}} the hottest weather here that I ever experienced, and still {{continues}} so. Yesterday and last night was the hottest.

I was quite wet with sweat this morning when I woke up, a thing I never remember to have happened to me before, for I was not disturbed in my sleep and did not wake up once all night. Mother, I believe I did not tell you that on the 1st of June (or a while before) the O'Connors, the friends I took my meals with so long, moved to other apartments for more room and pleasanter--not far off though, I am there every day almost, a little--so for nearly two months and a half I have been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habit of getting my own breakfast in my room and my dinner at a restaurant. I have a little spirit lamp, and always have a capital cup of tea, and some bread, and perhaps some preserved fruit; for dinner I get a good plate of meat and plenty of potatoes, good and plenty for 25 or 30 cents. I hardly ever take any thing more than these two meals, both of them are pretty hearty--eat dinner about 3--my appetite is plenty good enough, and I am about as fleshy as I was in Brooklyn. Mother, I feel better the last ten days, and at present, than I did the preceding six or eight weeks. There was nothing particular the matter with me, but I suppose a different climate and being so continually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospitals--but as I say, I feel better, more strength, and better in my head, etc. About <b>the</b> wound <b>in</b> my hand and the inflammation, etc., it has thoroughly healed, and I have not worn anything on my hand, nor had any dressing for the last five days. Mother, I hope you get along with the heat, for I see it is as bad or worse in New York and Brooklyn--I am afraid you suffer from it; it must be distressing to you. Dear mother, do let things go, and just sit still and fan yourself. I think about you these hot days. I fancy I see you <b>down</b> there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> I suppose you have your coffee for breakfast; I have not had three cups of coffee in six months--tea altogether (I must come home and have some coffee for breakfast with you).|$|R

He said this with such a strange dreadful snarl that for the moment his face seemed quite changed. But presently when he recovered himself he got quite cheerful again, and said that it was perhaps unseemly in him, as the guest of the American people, to say anything against them. It is strange how Uncle always refers to himself as the guest of the American people. Living in this poor place, in these cheap surroundings, it seems so odd.

Generally, I dawdled over my breakfast and I solemn took the trouble to ring the bell for the table to be cleared away; but on that morning for some reason hidden in the general mysteriousness of the event I did not dawdle.

I mention this little fact with pride, because it proves that during the thirty or forty days of my tenancy I had produced a favourable impression. For a fortnight past I had been spared the unattractive sight of the domestic slave. The girls in that Bessborough Gardens house were often changed, but whether short or long, fair or dark, they were always untidy and particularly bedraggled as if in a sordid version of the fairy tale the ashbin cat had been changed into a maid.
