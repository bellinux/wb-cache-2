Given {{one last chance}} by the bullying, intimidating Hunsecker, he schemes to plant a false rumor in a rival column that Dallas is a dope-smoking Communist, then {{encourages}} Hunsecker to rescue Dallas's reputation, certain that the headstrong boyfriend will reject Hunsecker's favor and end up looking bad to Susan.|$|E
5|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat destruction. Since the arid, spiny forests in which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, it <b>is</b> <b>losing</b> habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|A major subplot {{involves}} George (Richardo Keens-Douglas), a French {{teacher and}} former intimate of Zero's. George <b>is</b> <b>losing</b> his sight to cytomegalovirus and {{is taking a}} drug that is manufactured by a company that, {{as a member of}} ACT UP, George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this, his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him.|$|E
5000|$|One of Halperin's famous quotes is: [...] The NATO {{doctrine}} {{is that we}} will fight with conventional forces until we <b>are</b> <b>losing,</b> then we will fight with tactical weapons until we <b>are</b> <b>losing,</b> and then we will blow up the world.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1 June 1974 {{issue of}} Record Mirror, {{a review of}} The Psychomodo album stated: [...] "The great merit of Steve Harley's {{insanity}} though is that it's laid bare here for every lost blimp to indulge. The Psychomodo: [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>losing</b> my head, I've <b>been</b> <b>losing</b> my way, I've <b>been</b> <b>losing</b> my brain cells at a million a day, I'm so disillusioned, I'm on suicide street..." [...] Harley cleans out his soul and wherever he's going, he's {{going to take a}} lot with him." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, the NPA {{calculated}} that on average British pig farmers <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> £21 per pig they produce.

5|$|Enceladus <b>is</b> <b>losing</b> mass {{at a rate}} of 200kg/second. If {{mass loss}} at this rate {{continued}} for 4.5 Gyr, the satellite would have lost approximately 30% of its initial mass. A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal. It suggests that tectonics in the south polar region is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated subduction caused by the process of mass loss.|$|E
5|$|Jenna {{has become}} more famous after gaining weight, and sorts through large amounts of fan mail. Jack congratulates her on her weight, and Jenna enjoys her new {{friendship}} with him. While talking to Liz, Jenna begins to worry about losing weight, and fears her popularity will decline. Upset that Jenna <b>is</b> <b>losing</b> weight, Jack sends Kenneth to follow her around and make sure she keeps her weight on. Liz tells Kenneth to insult Jenna if he wants her to eat more, and writes down {{a list of things}} to say to Jenna to hurt her. Jenna takes the insults as compliments, and tries to seduce Kenneth.|$|E
5|$|Crazy and Roz {{are then}} seen at a pier. Rozzie {{tells him that}} Vinnie is {{ditching}} town, her and the rumble, which makes Crazy {{the leader of the}} Stompers. Disgusted with Vinnie's cowardice, Roz allows Crazy to make love to her in an abandoned warehouse. Solly interrupts, and fights Crazy to get him to talk. As he <b>is</b> <b>losing,</b> Crazy lies, saying Vinnie killed the gang members. Vinnie packs up his things and leaves, but bumps into the Stompers and in time for the rumble. As the two gangs wait for Boogaloo to show up, Solly drives up, ready to arrest Vinnie. On the rooftop of a nearby building, Crazy begins shooting randomly towards the street, causing both gangs to begin shooting at each other. Vinnie tries to run and is shot at by Solly. Crazy jumps off the rooftop, landing on Solly, killing himself and Solly. As Roz calls up a radio station to make a memorial request in honor of Vinnie, he stands up and walks away, leaving Brooklyn.|$|E

50|$|The George VI Ice Shelf, {{which may}} be on the brink of instability, has {{probably}} existed for approximately 8,000 years, after melting 1,500 years earlier. Warm ocean currents may have been the cause of the melting. Not only the ice sheets <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> mass, but they <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> mass at an accelerating rate.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{government}} grant announcement, Kevin Rudd, Australia's Prime Minister at the time, stated that production would support 600 new {{jobs at the}} Elizabeth facility; however, this failed {{to take into account}} Holden's previous announcement, whereby 600 jobs would be shed when production of the Family II engine ceased in late 2009. In mid-2013, Holden sought a further A$265million, in addition to the A$275million that was already committed by {{the government}}s of Canberra, South Australia and Victoria, to remain viable as a car manufacturer in Australia. A source close to Holden informed the Australian news publication that the car company <b>is</b> <b>losing</b> money on every vehicle that it produces and consequently initiated negotiations to reduce employee wages by up to A$200 per week to cut costs, following the announcement of 400 job cuts and an assembly line reduction of 65 (400 to 335) cars per day.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} with an eye patch, a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by Blister, an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit that lives {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life <b>is</b> <b>losing</b> its leaves, where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E
5|$|Notably, KOF 94 innovated {{the genre}} by {{replacing}} a traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting {{games with a}} format consisting of 3-on-3 team based matches dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each consisting of three members. Before each match, the players choose {{the order in which}} each of their team member enters the battle. When the match begins, the members chosen to go first on their respective teams will fight. When one character is defeated, the following member of the same team will take his or her place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character <b>is</b> <b>losing</b> a match against the opponent, then the player can call one of the remaining teammates standing on the sidelines to jump in and perform a support attack. The match ends when all three members of either team lose.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{complaints}} that the MSPB has gone far beyond protecting civil servants from unjustified disciplinary action. Rather, critics allege, the MSPB now makes {{it nearly impossible}} to fire poor performers or problematic employees, even when they have committed egregious violations {{that would result in}} immediate termination in the private sector. According to the CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, [...] "There is no question that taxpayers <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> hundreds of millions of dollars, in a conservative estimate. They <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> more than that because they <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> the ability to get the very best out of government." ...|$|R

5|$|Space Station Silicon Valley is a {{platform}} game that is viewed from a third-person perspective. Players traverse several different environments to advance through the game. During the game, players control Evo—a robot who {{is reduced to}} a crawling microchip during a ship crash, and <b>is</b> <b>losing</b> energy at a steady rate without protection. In order to survive, players attack animals, which disables them and allows players to assume control of their bodies. Each animal possesses different characteristics, including survival rate and special attacks, and uses different abilities; for example, large animals such as bears are able to destroy ice blocks, which other animals are incapable of doing so. Some animals are also unable to survive in certain unfamiliar environments, forcing players to enter the body of another. The animals are used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in each level, collecting Evo's power cells to maintain energy.|$|E
