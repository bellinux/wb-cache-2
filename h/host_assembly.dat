40|$|AbstractStructural {{transition}} can {{be induced}} in charged micelles {{by increasing the}} ionic strength of the medium. We have monitored the organization and dynamics of the functionally important tryptophan residues of gramicidin in spherical and rod-shaped sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles utilizing a combination of wavelength-selective fluorescence and related fluorescence approaches. Our results show that tryptophans in gramicidin, present in the single-stranded β 6. 3 conformation, experience slow solvent relaxation giving rise to red edge excitation shift in spherical and rod-shaped micelles. In addition, changes in fluorescence polarization with increasing excitation or emission wavelength reinforce that the gramicidin tryptophans are localized in motionally restricted regions of these micelles. Fluorescence quenching experiments using acrylamide as a quencher of tryptophan fluorescence {{show that there is}} reduced water penetration in rod-shaped micelles. Taken together, we show that gramicidin conformation and dynamics is sensitive to the salt-induced structural transition in charged micelles. In addition, these results demonstrate that deformation of the <b>host</b> <b>assembly</b> could modulate protein conformation and dynamics...|$|E
40|$|As {{intracellular}} parasites, viruses {{rely heavily}} {{on the use of}} numerous cellular machineries for completion of their replication cycle. The recent discovery of the heterogeneous distribution of the various lipids within cell membranes has led to the proposal that sphingolipids and cholesterol tend to segregate in microdomains called membrane rafts. The involvement of membrane rafts in biosynthetic traffic, signal transduction, and endocytosis has suggested that viruses may also take advantage of rafts for completion of some steps of their replication cycle, such as entry into their cell <b>host,</b> <b>assembly,</b> and budding. In this review, we have attempted to delineate all the reliable data sustaining this hypothesis and to build some models of how rafts are used as platforms for assembly of some viruses. Indeed, if in many cases a formal proof of raft involvement in a virus replication cycle is still lacking, one can reasonably suggest that, owing to their ability to specifically attract some proteins, lipid microdomains provide a particular milieu suitable for increasing the efficiency of many protein-protein interactions which are crucial for virus infection and growth...|$|E

Classboxes {{are a new}} module {{system for}} {{object-oriented}} languages defining a packaging and scoping mechanism for controlling the visibility of isolated extensions to portions of class-based systems. Unlike object-oriented specialization, the class extension mechanisms supported by classboxes preserve the identity of extended classes and, therefore, all clients of extended classes can benefit from the applied extensions. In this paper, we present a language design and a corresponding implementation strategy for classboxes in C#. A particular challenge in incorporating classboxes into C # is to preserve the identity of extended classes as the.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{unconventional}} approach to antiviral drug discovery, {{which is used}} to identify potent small molecules against rabies virus. First, we conceptualized viral capsid assembly as occurring via a host-catalyzed biochemical pathway, in contrast to the classical view of capsid formation by self-assembly. This suggested opportunities for antiviral intervention by targeting previously unappreciated catalytic host proteins, which were pursued. Second, we hypothesized these host proteins to be components of heterogeneous, labile, and dynamic multi-subunit assembly machines, not easily isolated by specific target protein-focused methods. This suggested the need to identify active compounds before knowing the precise protein target. A cell-free translation-based small molecule screen was established to recreate the hypothesized interactions involving newly synthesized capsid proteins as <b>host</b> <b>assembly</b> machine substrates. Hits from the screen were validated by efficacy against infectious rabies virus in mammalian cell culture. Used as affinity ligands, advanced analogs were shown to bind a set of proteins that effectively reconstituted drug sensitivity in the cell-free screen and included a small but discrete subfraction of cellular ATP-binding cassette family E 1 (ABCE 1), a host protein previously found essential for HIV capsid formation. Taken together, these studies advance an alternate view of capsid formation (as a host-catalyzed biochemical pathway), a different paradigm for drug discovery (whole pathway screening without knowledge of the target), and suggest the existence of labile assembly machines that can be rendered accessible as next-generation drug targets by the means described...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this dissertation explores the field of organic catalysis with metal-dinitrosyl complexes and synthetic supramolecular nanovessels. Part I (Chapters 1 - 3) presents the development of both stoichiometric and catalytic vinylic C-H functionalization reactions of unactivated alkenes mediated by cobalt and ruthenium dinitrosyl complexes. Part II (Chapters 4 - 7) describes the design and synthesis of terephthalamide-based supramolecular M 4 L 6 nanovessels and their application in organic catalysis. Part I - Metal-Dinitrosyl Mediated Vinylic C-H FunctionalizationChapter 1 contains a brief literature review of C-H activation and functionalization reactions mediated by transition-metal complexes. Of the examples presented, the cobalt dinitrosyl mediated intermolecular vinylic C-H functionalization reaction offers an approach for the activation of simple alkenyl C-H bonds that {{takes advantage of the}} ligand-based reactivity of such cobalt complexes. The difficulties of isolating the reactive cobalt dinitrosyl species and achieving catalytic turnover for functionalization, as well as extension toward other metals, are also presented to provide a context in which Chapters 2 and 3 can be viewed. Chapter 2 describes the development of a one-pot cobalt-dinitrosyl mediated inter- and intramolecular vinylic C-H functionalization reaction of unactivated and alkyl-substituted alkenes. Enantioselective intramolecular cobalt-dinitrosyl mediated 5 -exo-trig and 6 -endo-trig cyclization reactions are also described. Although catalytic turnovers can be achieved with such complexes for vinylic C-H functionalization, generality of the methodology and broader substrate scope remain elusive. Chapter 3 presents the application of a ruthenium-dinitrosyl complex in the context of vinylic C-H functionalization reaction of simple alkenes. The recently discovered ruthenium-dinitrosyl complex proves to be stable for isolation and characterization, an improvement over the cobalt system, but also proves to be less reactive as a catalyst for vinylic C-H functionalization. The challenges associated with the development of metal-dinitrosyl catalyzed C-H functionalization and its outlook are also discussed. 	Part II - Synthesis of Terephthalamide-based Ga 4 L 6 Supramolecular Nanovessels and their Application in Enantioselective and Stereospecific Organic CatalysisChapter 4 introduces the field of supramolecular chemistry with a main focus on the synthesis and chemistry of enantiopure host complexes. Examples of asymmetric organic reactions catalyzed by chiral host assemblies are also presented to provide a platform from which Chapters 5 - 7 can be viewed. Chapter 5 describes the design, synthesis and characterization of enantiopure supramolecular Ga 4 L 6 nanovessels that are based on terephthalamide (TAM) -derived ligands. The synthesis of achiral TAM-based ligands and their corresponding racemic host-guest complexes are also presented. Chapter 6 summarizes the development of an enantioselective ring-opening reaction of meso-episulfonium catalyzed by the enantiopure <b>host</b> <b>assembly</b> presented in Chapter 5. Additionally, the application of this new cluster as a chiral host catalyst for the Aza-Cope rearrangement and the Prins-like cyclization reactions are also discussed. Chapter 7 describes the development of a stereospecific reaction catalyzed by both racemic and enantiopure supramolecular Ga 4 L 6 host assemblies. The host assemblies are capable of catalyzing the substitution reaction at a secondary benzylic carbon center to give products with overall stereochemical retention, while reaction of the same substrates in bulk solution gives products with inversion. Such ability of a biomimetic synthetic <b>host</b> <b>assembly</b> to reverse the stereochemical outcome of a nucleophilic substitution reaction is unprecedented in the field of supramolecular catalysis...|$|E

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis examines the noncovalent interactions, dynamics and structure of a self-assembled supramolecular host-guest system. The highly-charged, water soluble supramolecular assembly is able to selectively bind cationic molecules to the host interior and exterior and mediate the physical properties and chemical reactivity of bound guests. Herein, physical organic chemistry {{in the context of}} this supramolecular system is used to elucidate some of the fundamental host-guest interactions that underlie guest binding and reactivity. 	 Chapter 1. First, an overview of different noncovalent interactions and their importance to biological systems is presented. Selected examples of synthetic supramolecular host-guest systems are then reviewed, focusing on examples that illustrate how chemists have used noncovalent interactions to construct complex host architectures and affect guest chemical reactivity. Finally, the [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - supramolecular assembly, which is the topic of Chapters 2 - 5, is introduced and previous work examining the host-guest chemistry of this system is briefly reviewed. 	 Chapter 2. Ortho-substituted benzylphosphonium guest molecules are used to quantitatively probe the steric effects of confinement within the [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - host. Encapsulated guest bond rotational barriers and tumbling rates are measured in different solvents and at elevated external pressures. These studies reveal that despite the flexibility of the <b>host</b> <b>assembly,</b> guest molecules experience significant steric confinement on the host interior and their bond rotational barriers are increased by up to 6 kcal/mol. Significant solvent and pressure effects on the bond rotational rates are also observed; these suggest that the host cavity is smaller or less flexible in organic than in aqueous solution, and that internal solvent pressure is responsible for the observed changes in ligand framework flexibility. The apparently smaller cavity volumes in organic solvents are further supported by NOE distance measurements, which show shorter average host-guest distances in organic, as compared to aqueous, solutions. 	 Chapter 3. Building on the solvent effects observed in Chapter 2, some additional, qualitative solvent effects are first presented; these show that guest binding and exchange is also sensitive to bulk solvent and that N,N-dimethylformamide can act as weakly bound guest. The second part of this chapter presents a quantitative study of the solvent effects on the thermodynamics and kinetics of guest binding and exchange in the [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - host. No correlation between the guest binding or exchange parameters across different solvents are observed, illustrating the complexity of host and guest solvation in these highly-charged supramolecular systems. 	 Chapter 4. A brief literature review of isotope effects on guest binding and exchange in supramolecular host-guest systems is first presented. The measurement of kinetic and equilibrium isotope effects on guest binding and exchange in the [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - assembly are then described. Protiated guests are found to be more strongly bound to both the host interior and exterior, with significantly larger equilibrium isotope effects observed for C-H/D bonds that can participate in cation-&# 960; interactions. DFT-level computations reveal that the equilibrium isotope effects arise from changes in low frequency C-H/D vibrational motions upon guest association. Kinetic isotope effects during the guest ejection process are also observed. A general model to explain both equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects, based only on changes in C-H/D vibrational force constants and zero-point energies is presented. The observation of significant isotope effects on both guest binding and exchange demonstrates the remarkable sensitivity of the [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - <b>host</b> <b>assembly</b> to even the most subtle changes in guest architecture. 	 Chapter 5. Guest molecules encapsulated in [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - experience dramatic changes in their 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts due to the unique magnetic environment of the host interior. Gauge-independent atomic orbital NMR chemical shift calculations are carried out and compared with experiment to provide information about host-guest conformation and structure...|$|E
40|$|Though many enzymes {{can promote}} {{chemical}} reactions by tuning substrate properties purely through the electrostatic environment of a docking cavity, this strategy has proven challenging to mimic in synthetic host-guest systems. Here we report a highly-charged, water soluble, metal-ligand assembly with a hydrophobic interior cavity that thermodynamically stabilizes protonated substrates and consequently catalyzes the normally acidic hydrolysis of orthoformates in basic solution, with rate accelerations {{of up to}} 890 -fold. The catalysis reaction obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics, exhibits competitive inhibition, and the substrate scope displays size selectivity consistent with the constrained binding environment of the molecular host. Synthetic chemists have long endeavored to design host molecules capable of selectively binding slow-reacting substrates and catalyzing their chemical reactions. While synthetic catalysts are often site-specific and require certain properties of the substrate to insure catalysis, enzymes are often able to modify basic properties of the bound substrate such as pK{sub a} {{in order to enhance}} reactivity. Two common motifs used by nature to activate otherwise unreactive compounds are the precise arrangement of hydrogen-bonding networks and electrostatic interactions between the substrate and adjacent residues of the protein. Precise arrangement of hydrogen bonding networks near the active sites of proteins can lead to well-tuned pK{sub a}-matching, and can result in pK{sub a} shifts of up to eight units, as shown in bacteriorhodopsin. Similarly, purely electrostatic interactions can greatly favor charged states and have been responsible for pK{sub a} shifts of up to five units for acetoacetate decarboxylase. Attempts have been made to isolate the contributions of electrostatic versus covalent interactions to such pK{sub a} shifts; however this remains a difficult challenge experimentally. This challenge emphasizes the importance of synthesizing host molecules that, like enzyme cavities, can enhance binding of small molecular guests and, in a few cases, catalyze chemical reactions. Supramolecular assemblies with available functional groups have been used to generate solution-state pK{sub a} shifts of up to two pK{sub a} units and to catalyze chemical reactions. Synthetic hosts often rely on hydrogen-bonding or ion-dipole interactions for guest inclusion, and numerous studies have investigated the effects of charge on guest binding affinities in supramolecular host-guest systems. We report here a synthetic supramolecular <b>host</b> <b>assembly</b> that relies exclusively on electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions for thermodynamic stabilization of protonated substrates. As nature has exploited pK{sub a} shifts to activate otherwise unreactive substrates toward catalysis, this stabilization is exploited to promote acid-catalyzed hydrolyses in strongly basic solution...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1. A {{literature}} review of supramolecular reaction {{control and the}} efforts made towards developing supramolecular catalysts is presented. Representative examples of the fundamental ways in which supramolecular encapsulation can promote reactivity are given, with emphasis placed on catalytic reactions involving self-assembled hosts. The [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - supramolecular assembly developed by the Raymond group is introduced, and previous work {{on its ability to}} enhance the reactivity of its encapsulated guests is reviewed. Chapter 2. The tetrahedral [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - assembly encapsulates propargyl enammonium cations capable of undergoing the aza Cope rearrangement. For propargyl enammonium substrates that are encapsulated in the [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - assembly, rate accelerations of up to 184 are observed when compared to the background reaction. After rearrangement, the product iminium ion is released into solution and hydrolyzed allowing for catalytic turnover. The activation parameters for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reaction were determined, revealing that a lowered entropy of activation is responsible for the observed rate enhancements. The catalyzed reaction exhibits saturation kinetics; the rate data obey the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics, and competitive inhibition using a non-reactive guest has been demonstrated. Chapter 3. The tetrahedral [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - assembly catalyzes the Nazarov Cyclization of 1, 3 -pentadienols with extremely high levels of efficiency. The catalyzed reaction proceeds at a rate over a million times faster than that of the background reaction, an increase comparable to those observed in some enzymatic systems. This catalysis operates under aqueous conditions at mild temperature and pH ranges, and the reaction is halted by the addition of an appropriate inhibitor. The product of this reaction, pentamethylcyclopentadiene, is a competitive guest in the <b>host</b> <b>assembly,</b> and the catalysis suffers from product inhibition. This was alleviated by the addition of maleimide, which readily undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with the product to form a more weakly-encapsulated adduct. Chapter 4. The kinetically-controlled, regioselective deprotonation of cyclopentenyl cations mediated by encapsulation within the [Ga 4 L 6] 12 - assembly is presented. The regiochemistry of the deprotonation step determines which one of two possible products is formed. Although this deprotonation step occurs at both possible positions outside the host interior, encapsulation renders the process > 95 % regioselective. Moreover, subtle differences in the stereochemistry of the encapsulated cyclopentenyl cation switch the product selectivity of this process. This reactivity shares several features with the regioselective, enzyme-controlled deprotonation of the geranyl cation involved in the biosynthesis of myrcene and &# 946;-ocimene. Chapter 5. Mechanistic studies of the processes described in the two preceding chapters are presented. A combined experimental and computational approach is used to elucidate the reaction mechanism of both the catalyzed and the uncatalyzed Nazarov cyclization of pentadienols. Kinetic analysis, 18 O exchange experiments, and computational studies implicate a mechanism in which encapsulation, protonation and water loss from substrate are reversible, followed by irreversible electrocyclization. While electrocyclization is rate-determining in the uncatalyzed reaction, the barrier for water loss and for electrocyclization are nearly equal in the assembly-catalyzed reaction. Analysis of the proposed energetics of the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reaction revealed that transition state stabilization contributes significantly to the catalytic rate acceleration...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dynamic {{exchange}} of guest molecules, encapsulated in <b>host</b> <b>assemblies,</b> {{is a phenomenon}} in supramolecular chemistry that has important implications in several applications. While the mechanism of exchange in micellar assemblies has been previously investigated, the effect of host and guest environment upon the guest-exchange dynamics has received little attention, if any. In this paper, we study the guest-exchange mechanism in pH-sensitive nanogels along with pH-insensitive nanogels as a control. By systematically comparing the behavior of these nanogels, we show that size, concentration, and hydrophobicity can all {{play a critical role}} in guest-exchange dynamics. More importantly, these studies reveal that the dominant mechanism of guest exchange can intimately depend on environmental factors. Nanocontainers that can bind and hold hydrophobic molecules have attracted significant interest due to implications in area...|$|R
