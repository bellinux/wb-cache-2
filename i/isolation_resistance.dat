The thesis constructs a picture of <b>isolation</b> and <b>resistance</b> through these individual narratives that illustrate how a state policy to control the communication of individual RAF prisoners was translated into techniques of immobilization -solitary confinement- and surveillance -searches, censorship and monitoring-.

The narratives also give insight into individual and collective <b>resistance</b> to <b>isolation,</b> namely the rationales of individual survival and striving for community in the pursuit of collective detention of RAF prisoners.

50|$|Knowledge sharing can {{sometimes}} constitute {{a major challenge}} {{in the field of}} knowledge management. The difficulty of knowledge sharing resides in the transference of knowledge from one entity to another. Some employees tend to resist sharing their knowledge because of the notion that knowledge is property; ownership, therefore, becomes very important. In order to counteract this, individuals must be reassured that they will receive some type of incentive for what they create. However, Dalkir (2005) demonstrated that individuals are most commonly rewarded for what they know, not what they share. Negative consequences, such as <b>isolation</b> and <b>resistance</b> to ideas, occur when knowledge sharing is impeded. To promote knowledge sharing and remove knowledge sharing obstacles, the organizational culture of an entity should encourage discovery and innovation.|$|R

One cause of these fires is a “blind spot ” in the ground fault ground fault fuse [...] As {{a result of this}} discovery, the Solar America Board for Codes and Standards {{identified}} a number of alternatives to ground fault fuses, but these technologies have limited historical use in the United States. This paper investigates the efficacy of two of these devices, <b>isolation</b> <b>resistance</b> monitoring (Riso) and current sense monitoring (CSM), in small (~ 3 kW) and large (> 500 kW) arrays using both simulation and field data.

From these results, {{it was found that the}} majority of leakage current is not from the modules, but from low inverter isolation-to-ground. Therefore appropriate thresholds to maximize detection area while minimizing nuisance tripping should be made based on the specific inverter isolation and switching noise rather than the configuration of the PV system.

40|$|The work {{concerns}} the constructive characteristics optimization of brushless D. C. (direct current) motors used in electromechanical spacecraft drives. The spacecraft electromechanical drives and units use rather widely the brushless D. C. motors {{in which a}} motor commutator is replaced with more reliable semiconductor commutator controlled by the rotor position sensors. However, these motors are of low power. Electrohydraulic actuators (EHA) use simple permanent-magnet motors (PMM) of rather high power and commutator motors with graphite brush variable contacts. High reliability of brush motors, and, therefore a reliability of EHA in general, substantially depends {{on the quality of}} motor commutator operation. There are different reasons for a possible impact on the normal motor commutator operation. One of them is brush wear. Sparking brushes and burning commutator bars are possible in case brushes are poorly grinded to fit, brushes cannot freely move true in the brush holder box, and in case an incorrect force to clamp brushes to the commutator is chosen. It is established that drive wear resistance and operability depends on the gas environment composition being under sealed motor housing. In dry nitrogen environment brush wear suddenly raises because of the changing tribological performances of the commutator thus leading to essentially falling <b>isolation</b> <b>resistance</b> and no motor start. It is recommended to fill a space under sealed motor housing with air. Positive experience of operating spacecraft device containers with mobile electromechanical couples allowed us to find that in this case a dew point of filled air must be minus 20 ˚C.

Findings. The paper presents the developed mathematical model, describing dependence of the input impedance of the coded and audio-frequency track circuits on the train coordinate at various values of ballast isolation resistances and for all frequencies used in track circuits. The relative error determination of train coordinate by input impedance caused by variation of the ballast <b>isolation</b> <b>resistance</b> for the coded track circuits was investigated. The values of relative error determination of train coordinate can achieve up to 40 - 50 % and these facts do not allow using this method directly for coded track circuits.

The aim {{of this study is to}} systematically review the effects of nutrition and/or exercise on cancer-related fatigue and/or quality of life. Methods: A literature search was conducted in six electronic databases. The Delphi quality assessment list was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the literature. The study characteristics and results were summarized in accordance with the review’s Population, Intervention, Control, Outcome (PICO) criteria. Results: A total of 20 articles (one diet only, two combined diet and exercise, and seventeen exercise only studies) were included in the review. Soy supplementation improved quality of life, but resulted in several adverse effects. Prescribing healthy eating guidelines with combined resistance training and aerobic exercise improved cancer-related fatigue, yet its effect on quality of life was inconclusive. Combined resistance training with aerobic exercise showed improvements in cancer-related fatigue {{and quality of life}}. In <b>isolation,</b> <b>resistance</b> training appears to be more effective in improving cancer-related fatigue and quality of life than aerobic exercise. Studies that utilised an exercise professional to supervise the exercise sessions were more likely to report improvements in both cancer-related fatigue and quality of life than those prescribing unsupervised or partially supervised sessions. Neither exercise frequency nor duration appeared to influence cancer-related fatigue or quality of life, with further research required to explore the potential dose-response effect of exercise intensity. Conclusion: Supervised moderate-hard resistance training with or without moderate-vigorous aerobic exercise appears to improve cancer-related fatigue and quality of life.
