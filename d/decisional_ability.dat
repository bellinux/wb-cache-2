40|$|Advances in {{understanding}} neurobiology and intellectual disabilities {{have led to}} clinical trials testing new medications. This study assessed parents' perceptions of the ability of their son or daughter with fragile X syndrome (FXS), an inherited form of intellectual disability, {{to participate in the}} consent process for clinical trials. Four hundred twenty-two families participated in a survey that included six items assessing various aspects of the ability to provide consent. A rank ordering of decisional tasks was found. The easiest task was to understand that the medication was different from his or her medical treatment; the most difficult was the ability to understand and weigh the potential benefits and risks of study participation. Factor analysis suggested that despite the range in difficulty, the six items were best summarized by a single <b>decisional</b> <b>ability</b> score. Parents of 29 % of males reported that their son was not at all capable of participating, but the remainder exhibited a range of decisional skills. Factors associated with this variability include age and parents' willingness to enroll their child in clinical trials. We conclude that many individuals with FXS appear to be able to participate at some level in the consent or assent process, but will likely need individualized support to maximize effective participation.

40|$|In the Province of Quebec, an {{adolescent}} aged 14 {{years or older}} may, subject to a few exceptions, consent alone to medical treatment required {{for his or her}} condition. However, neuroscience research on the adolescent’s brain indicates that: 1) the acquisition of “brain maturity” is a continuing process, which can last until the mid-twenties and 2) certain decisional capacities such as assessment of short and long-term risks and benefits differ from those of adults, particularly in emotionally charged situations. I argue that, {{from the perspective of a}} child’s best interest, the neurophysiological capacity of the adolescent should be taken into consideration in the health care context. Thus, I question the adequacy of the presumption of ability to make autonomous judgments from the age of 14, and point out the paradox of allowing judicial review of such judgments in cases of refusal of treatment. I also question the relevance of age considerations in the context of the doctor-patient relationship, where assessment of <b>decisional</b> <b>ability</b> is of the essence in obtaining an informed consent. Finally, I question the exclusion of parents from the decision-making process in light of both their continuing responsibility to protect their child’s best interests and the benefits that parental guidance may provide to the adolescent. Consequently, I argue that a reconsideration of the case for giving decisional authority to the adolescent aged 14 or older is desirable and that a uniform standard, with a few possible exceptions, applicable throughout childhood would better reflect recent neuroscience findings...|$|E
40|$|Objective. In {{absence of}} a gold {{standard}} of methods to assess competence, three judgements of competency of geriatric patients are evaluated: the judgements of a physician, the judgement of a family member, and the judgement of an instrument. Methods. Competence of 80 geriatric patients was judged both by a physician and a family member. Decision making capacity was assessed with a vignette. A vignette describes a treatment choice, after which the following abilities are evaluated: evidencing a choice, understanding, reasoning and appreciating a situation. Cognitive functioning was measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results. Most of the geriatric patients were judged competent by all three methods. Disagreement between the three judgements was found for 25 patients. Agreement about incompetence was only reached for one patient. Physicians appeared to be most lenient in their incompetency judgement: only three patients were judged incompetent. These patients scored significantly lower than competent patients on cognitive functioning, the <b>decisional</b> <b>ability</b> of understanding, and the total vignette score. Family members appeared to be most stringent in their judgement: they considered 22 patients incompetent. Incompetent patients scored significantly lower than competent patients on cognitive functioning, reasoning and the total vignette score. Conclusions. The disagreement between the judgements suggests a difference in factors given emphasis by the three methods. The finding that both the judgement of physicians and family members {{are associated with the}} assessment of the vignette, suggests that the vignette method has more than a legal theoretical base and is associated with daily life experience and knowledge as well. Physicians can be helped to assess competence by the vignette method to evaluate decisional abilities and by family members who can provide more information about patients' values.

40|$|International audienceSafety {{critical}} {{systems with}} <b>decisional</b> <b>abilities,</b> such as autonomous robots, {{are about to}} enter our everyday life. Nevertheless, confidence in their behavior is still limited, particularly regarding safety. Considering the variety of hazards that can affect these systems, many techniques might be used to increase their safety. Among them, active safety monitors are a means to maintain the system safety in spite of faults or adverse situations. The specification of the safety rules implemented in such devices is of crucial importance, but has been hardly explored so far. In this paper, we propose a complete framework for the generation of these safety rules based on the concept of safety margin. The approach starts from a hazard analysis, and uses formal verification techniques to automatically synthesize the safety rules. It has been successfully applied to an industrial use case, a mobile manipulator robot for co-working...|$|R
40|$|Three {{instruments}} assessing abilities {{related to}} legal standards for competence to consent to treatment {{were administered to}} 6 groups: patients recently hospitalized for schizophrenia, major depression, and ischemic heart disease, as well as three groups of non-ill persons in the community who were matched with the hospitalized patients on age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Significant impairments in <b>decisional</b> <b>abilities</b> were found for {{only a minority of}} persons in all groups. Both the schizophrenia and depression groups manifested poorer understanding of treatment disclosures, poorer reasoning in decision making regarding treatment, and a greater likelihood of failing to appreciate their illness or the potential benefits of treatment. Deficits were more pronounced, however, among patients with schizophrenia. Implications are discussed for policy designed to protect the rights and welfare of patients with mental illness who are at risk of incompetent refusal or consent when making treatment decisions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Decision {{aids are}} often used to assist {{individuals}} confronted with a diagnosis of a serious illness {{to make decisions about}} treatment options. However, they are rarely utilised to help those with chronic or age related conditions to make decisions about care services. Decision aids should also be useful for carers of people with decreased decisional capacity. These carers' choices must balance health outcomes for themselves and for salient others with relational and value-based concerns, while relying on information from health professionals. This paper reports on a study that both developed and pilot tested a decision aid aimed at assisting carers to make evaluative judgements of community services, particularly respite care. Methods A mixed method sequential study, involving qualitative development and a pilot randomised controlled trial, was conducted in Tasmania, Australia. We undertook 13 semi-structured interviews and three focus groups to inform the development of the decision aid. For the randomised control trial we randomly assigned 31 carers of people with dementia to either receive the service decision aid at the start or end of the study. The primary outcome was measured by comparing the difference in carer burden between the two groups three months after the intervention group received the decision aid. Pilot data was collected from carers using interviewer-administered questionnaires at the commencement of the project, two weeks and 12 weeks later. Results The qualitative data strongly suggest that the intervention provides carers with needed decision support. Most carers felt that the decision aid was useful. The trial data demonstrated that, using the mean change between baseline and three month follow-up, the intervention group had less increase in burden, a decrease in decisional conflict and increased knowledge compared to control group participants. Conclusions While these results must be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size, all intervention results trend in a direction that is beneficial for carers and their <b>decisional</b> <b>ability.</b> Mixed method data suggest the decision aid provides decisional support that carers do not otherwise receive. Decision aids may prove useful in a community health services context. Trial registration number ISRCTN: ISRCTN 32163031 </p...|$|E
40|$|Self-efficacy beliefs have a {{particularly}} {{important role in}} the analysis of the processes that are involved in choice. Low efficacy beliefs in one's own choice experiences are associated to poor professional exploration, high levels of school-career indecision and avoidance behaviors in relation to professional tasks. On this ground an instrument How much confidence do I have in myself? has been devised with the aim of collecting information on the efficacy beliefs held by 14 - to 19 -year-olds on their own <b>decisional</b> <b>abilities</b> and on their likelihood to persevere with the realization of particularly difficult or long lasting training activities. The psychometric requisites of the instrument have been verified especially through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses as concerns construct validity and, as concerns reliability, through the classic investigation methods as well as the Rasch models analysis.

40|$|Abstract — Human-robot {{interaction}} requires explicit reasoning on {{the human}} environment and on the robot capacities to achieve its tasks in a collaborative way with a human partner. This paper focuses on organization of the robot <b>decisional</b> <b>abilities</b> and more particularly on the management of human interaction {{as an integral part}} of the robot control architecture. Such an architecture should be the framework that will allow the robot to accomplish its tasks but also produce behaviors that support its engagement vis-a-vis its human partner and interpret similar behaviors from him. Together and in coherence with this framework, we intend to develop and experiment various task planners and interaction schemes. that will allow the robot to select and perform its tasks while taking into account explicitly the constraints imposed by the presence of humans, their needs and preferences. We have considered a scheme where the robot plans for itself and for the human in order not only (1) to assess the feasibility of the task (at a certain level) before performing it, but also (2) to share the load between the robot and the human and (3) to explain/illustrate a possible course of action.

40|$|Many {{challenging}} {{ethical questions}} {{come with the}} scientific efforts {{to understand the nature}} and treatment of schizo-phrenia. The empirical study of ethical aspects of schizo-phrenia research has sought to clarify and resolve many of these questions. In this article we provide an overview of the existing data-based literature on schizophrenia re-search ethics and outline directions for future inquiry. We examine 5 broad categories of inquiry into the ethics of schizophrenia research: (1) Scientific designs (eg, pla-cebo-controlled studies and medication-free intervals, pro-dromal and high-risk research, and genetics research); (2) informed consent and decision-making capacity, including assessment of <b>decisional</b> <b>abilities,</b> as well as intervention studies; (3) understanding and perceptions of risk and ben-efit (including the therapeutic misconception); (4) influen-ces on research participation (including voluntarism, altruism, and other motivations); and (5) key participant safeguards, such as protocol review and participant advo-cates. We discuss how empirical work in each of these areas answers certain questions and raises new ones. Finally, we highlight important gaps in our understanding of ethically relevant aspects of schizophrenia research and offer a specific research agenda for empirical ethics.

40|$|The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) {{field for}} assistive {{applications}} focuses {{on how to}} provide long-term/lifelong social interaction for vulnerable populations (e. g., children with autism, post-stroke patients, and individuals suffering of cognitive impairments) [1]. Due to the sensitive nature of their interactions with humans, socially assistive robots need a thorough and targeted training, similar to that received by nurses/trainers/therapists, before they are released in the wild. They also need to continuously and incrementally learn and adapt their behavior to the user’s profile (i. e., personality, preferences, and disability) and to the environmental changes in order to deliver a personalized, engaging, and motivating social interaction and useful feedback to their “users”. Different perceptual modalities and cognitive and behavioral capabilities need to be explored so that a robot can develop through continuous interaction with, learning of, and adaptation in the social environment. The robot’s <b>decisional</b> <b>abilities</b> require taking into account context, user’s profile and disability level while performing its tasks [1]. It has to take initiative to establish and conduct a fruitful therapeutical session with humans, and change its interaction styles depending on context and scenarios [2], [3]. The point raised by Rohlfing and Wrede regarding {{the necessity of a}} long-term memory to facilitate knowledge assimilation and consolidation is one that I also share. I would go even further and argue that sharing learned concepts between robots and make some of that knowledge innate to the next generation is extremly valuable. Moreover, socially assistive robotics is about helping vulnerable users in specific tasks where the robot’s behavior evolve with time t...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} essential properties of virtual enterprises {{and the consequent}} modeling requirements. Apart from that, we define agent’s autonomy. As agents in AI (Artificial Intelligence), virtual enterprises are treated as autonomous entities. Requirements are derived from two types of virtual enterprises, a repetitive and a one-of-a-kind production or service enterprise. A virtual enterprise model should represent properties which include the dynamics of decision-making, the negotiations among participants for the definition of autonomy, authority, beliefs and responsibilities, the mapping of organizational entities to <b>decisional</b> roles, the <b>ability</b> to identify and analyze a variety of conflict types {{and the existence of}} conflict resolution paths. These properties have to be analyzed by matching enterprise-engineering tools. An ontological theory is also needed to systematize the concepts that must be supported by the protocol languages for parallel distributed planning, scheduling and control algorithms in the virtual enterprise.

40|$|To {{explore the}} concept of {{autonomy}} {{as a basis for}} social participation, with particular reference to rehabilitation. Method: A study of relevant literature from the field of rehabilitation, building on theory developed in other fields (ethics, social sciences), and deriving important concepts and strategies for rehabilitation practice. Results: The focus of rehabilitation for people with a chronic disabling condition is shifting from a biomedical to a client-centred perspective. Conceptions of autonomy vary among individuals and cultures, but a crucial distinction can be made between <b>decisional</b> autonomy (the <b>ability</b> to make decisions without external restraint) and executional autonomy (the ability to act as one wishes). The liberal-individualist account of autonomy over-emphasizes physical independence and does not sufficiently recognize the inter-dependency of all people, including those with disabilities. An ethic of care, complementary to the principle of respect for autonomy, should guide the development of rehabilitation strategies to enhance individual autonomy and participation in daily living. For rehabilitation, this entails an attentive attitude, maximizing opportunities for informed choices, taking full account of each person's preferences, needs and social contexts. Conclusions: Autonomy is central to client-centred rehabilitation since it is a pre-requisite for effective participation. It is suggested that autonomy, conceived as a basis for participation, is the ultimate aim of rehabilitation. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
