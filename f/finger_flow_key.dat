40|$|Purpose. To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between optic nerve head (ONH) and <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> in subjects with and without a primary vascular dysregulation (PVD). Methods. ONH blood <b>flow</b> and <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> was measured in 15 subjects with PVD and in 24 subjects without PVD. PVD was defined as being present if it was detected in patient history as well as by nailfold capillaromicroscopy.

Objectives: to determine the effects of the magnitude and frequency of hand-transmitted vibration on <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> in an exposed and a non-exposed hand during and after exposure to vibration. Methods: twelve persons attended seven sessions consisting of five successive periods: (1) no force and no vibration, (2) force and no vibration, (3) force and vibration, (4) force and no vibration, and (5) no force and no vibration. During the second, third and fourth periods, the palm of the right hand applied a 2 -N downward force on a 25 -mm diameter convex platform. During the third period, the platform was vibrated at either 16, 31. 5, 63, 125, 250, or 315 Hz with the vibration magnitude increasing linearly from 0 to 15 ms? 2 rms (frequency-weighted) over 30 min (0 – 11 ms? 2 rms at 315 Hz). <b>Finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> was measured in the middle and little fingers of the right (exposed) hand and the middle finger of the left (unexposed) hand. Results: the application of 2 -N force by the palm did not affect <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> on either the exposed hand or the unexposed hand. Blood flow in all three fingers (both exposed and not exposed to vibration) reduced similarly with increasing vibration magnitude, with the greatest reduction to about 40 % of <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> before vibration exposure. During vibration at the same frequency-weighted acceleration according to current standards, <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> was dependent on the vibration frequency, with vibration at 125, 250 and 315 Hz causing the greatest reductions in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow.</b> With vibration at 250 Hz and 315 Hz, frequency-weighted accelerations less than 1. 0 ms? 2 rms reduced <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow,</b> whereas greater magnitudes were required at the lower frequencies.

Methods: Each of 10 subjects attended 11 sessions in which they experienced five successive experimental 5 -minute periods: (i) no force and no vibration; (ii) force and no vibration; (iii) force and vibration; (iv) force and no vibration; (v) no force and no vibration. During periods (ii) to (iv), the intermediate phalanx of the right middle finger applied one of two forces (2 N or 5 N) on a platform that vibrated during period (iii) at one of two frequencies: 31. 5 Hz (at 4 or 16 ms– 2 r. m. s.) or 125 Hz (at 16 or 64 ms– 2 r. m. s.). <b>Finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> was measured in the exposed right middle finger, the unexposed right little finger, and the unexposed left middle fingers throughout the 25 minutes of each session. Results: The application of force alone caused a reduction in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> in the exposed finger, but not other fingers. There were additional reductions in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> caused by vibration, with greater reductions at the higher vibration magnitudes at both frequencies but {{no difference between the}} two frequencies when using unweighted acceleration.

40|$|The {{basis of}} this study was the {{hypothesis}} that the physical and chemical properties of hypersaline tank waste could lead to wetting from instability and <b>fingered</b> <b>flow</b> following a tank leak. Thus, the goal of this project was to develop an understanding of the impacts of the properties of hypersaline fluids on transport through the unsaturated zone beneath Hanford's Tank Farms. There were three specific objectives (i) to develop an improved conceptualization of hypersaline fluid transport in laboratory (ii) to identify the degree to which field conditions mimic the flow processes observed in the laboratory and (iii) to provide a validation data set to establish {{the degree to which the}} conceptual models, embodied in a numerical simulator, could explain the observed field behavior. As hypothesized, high ionic strength solutions entering homogeneous pre-wetted porous media formed unstable wetting fronts a typical of low ionic strength infiltration. In the field, this mechanism could force flow in vertical flow paths, 5 - 15 cm in width, bypassing much of the media and leading to waste penetration to greater depths than would be predicted by current conceptual models. Preferential flow may lead to highly accelerated transport through large homogeneous units, and must be included in any conservative analysis of tank waste losses through coarse-textured units. However, numerical description of <b>fingered</b> <b>flow</b> using current techniques has been unreliable, thereby precluding tank-scale 3 -D simulation of these processes. A new approach based on nonzero, hysteretic contact angles and fluid-dependent liquid entry has been developed for the continuum scale modeling of <b>fingered</b> <b>flow.</b> This approach has been coupled with and adaptive-grid finite-difference solver to permit the prediction of finger formation and persistence form sub centimeter scales to the filed scale using both scalar and vector processors. Although laboratory experiments demonstrated that elevated surface tension of imbibing solutions can enhance vertical <b>fingered</b> <b>flow,</b> this phenomenon was not observed in the field. Field tests of showed that the <b>fingered</b> <b>flow</b> behavior was overwhelmed by the variability in texture resulting from differences in the depositional environment. Field plumes were characterized by lateral spreading with an average width to depth aspect ratio of 4. For both vertical <b>fingers</b> and lateral <b>flow,</b> the high ionic strength contributed to the vapor phase dilution of the waste, which increased waste volume and pushed the wetting from well beyond what would have occurred if the volume of material had remained unchanged from that initially released into the system. It was also observed that following significant vapor-phase dilution of the waste simulants that streams of colloids were ejected from the sediment surfaces. It was shown that due to the high-sodium content of the tank wastes the colloids were deflocculated below a critical salt concentration in Hanford sediment s. The released colloids, which at the site would be expected to carry the bulk of the sorbed heavy metals and radioisotopes, were mobile though coarse Hanford sediments, but clogged finer layers. The developments resulting from this study are already being applied at Hanford in the nonisothermal prediction of the hypersaline, high pH waste migration in tank farms and in the development of inverse methods for history matching under DOE's Groundwater/Vadose Zone Integration Project at Hanford...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePreferential flow in {{unsaturated}} soil may due to local heterogeneities like worm burrows {{but also to}} front instability leading to unstable <b>finger</b> <b>flow</b> (<b>fingered</b> pattern) in sandy textured soils. This last spontaneous preferential flow cannot be described by the standard Richards equation. Cueto-Felgueroso and Juanes proposed recently a phase field model {{in order to take}} into account a macroscopic surface tension effect at the front [1]. Their model simulates successfully the interface instability of an advancing front. We aim at simulating and understanding front instability passing a textural soil discontinuity for which the <b>finger</b> <b>flow</b> is particularly visible. We consider sand layers with different characteristics such as granulometry. Moreover, the wettability is taken into account by adding a hydrophobic term in the free energy of the phase field model. The hydrophobicity part is not only relevant for repellent soil but also to model the ultra-thin films [2]. Therefore, in our framework, this may have an influence at the front because the water saturation is nearly zero. Such a wettability influence on infiltration in porous media has recently been measured in [3]. The governing equation is analogous to the lubrication equation for which we pointed out the specific numerical difficulties [4]. A numerical code to perform time integration and bifurcation analysis was developed in [4] allowing to determine the onset of instability and its resulting dynamics in the parameter space [5]. We compute the parameter range for which the front stops when reaching the layers interface. As in [4], there is two main mechanisms that allow water to cross over the discontinuity. A first mechanism, called «depinning», leads to an intermittent flow and the second one, to a front instability and then to a <b>finger</b> <b>flow.</b> There is a parameter domain where both instabilities are present leading to a complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Finally, it is noteworthy that the wettability property has a crucial impact on the fingering emergence...|$|R

Increased skin temperature and decreased sweating are used to identify the adequacy of sympathetic {{block in the}} upper limb after stellate ganglion block (SGB). Baroreflexes elicited by postural change induce a reduction in peripheral blood flow by causing sympathetic vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that sympathetic block in the upper limb reduces the decrease in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> caused by baroreflexes stimulated by postural change from the supine to long sitting position. This study evaluated if sympathetic block of the upper limb affects the change in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> resulting from postural change. If change in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> would be kept against postural changes, it has a potential to be a new indicator of sympathetic blockade in the upper limb. Methods: Subjects were adult patients who had a check-up at the Department of Pain Management in our university hospital over 2 years and 9 months from May 2012. We executed a total of 91 SGBs in nine patients (N= 9), which included those requiring treatment for pain associated with herpes zoster in seven of the patients, tinnitus in one patient and upper limb pain in one patient.

Results: We executed a total of 91 SGBs in nine patients. Two SGBs were excluded from the analysis due to the absence of Horner’s sign. We divided 89 procedures into two groups according to elevation in skin temperature of the thumb: by over 1 °C (sympathetic block group, n= 62) and by < 1 °C (nonsympathetic block group, n= 27). <b>Finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> decreased significantly just after a change in posture from the supine to long sitting position after SGB in both groups. In the sympathetic block group, the ratio of <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> in the long sitting position/supine position with a change in posture significantly increased after SGB compared with before SGB (before SGB: range 0. 09 – 0. 94, median 0. 53; after SGB: range 0. 33 – 1. 2, median 0. 89, p< 0. 0001).

Retention of <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> against postural changes may be an indicator of sympathetic block in the upper limb after SGB or brachial plexus block.

40|$|Objectives <b>Finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> {{is reduced}} by hand-transmitted {{vibration}} {{but there has been}} little study of the peripheral vascular response to repetitive mechanical shocks. This study investigated how reductions in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> depend on shock repetition rate and the peak and rms magnitude of acceleration. Methods Subjects attended seven sessions: six with repetitive mechanical shocks and a control session with no shocks. Each session comprised five successive 5 -min periods: (1) no force and no vibration, (2) force and no vibration, (3) force and vibration, (4) force and no vibration and (5) no force and no vibration. During the second– fourth periods, the palm of the right hand applied 2 -N force to a vibrator. During the third period, a 125 -Hz mechanical shock was applied with one of four repetition rates (1. 3, 5. 3, 21 or 83. 3 /s) and one of three acceleration magnitudes (2. 5, 5 or 10 ms- 2 rms, unweighted). <b>Finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> was measured every 30 s in the middle and little fingers of the right (exposed) hand and the left (unexposed) hand. Results Different repetition rates (1. 3 – 83. 3 s- 1) and different peak magnitudes (10 – 88 ms- 2 peak) but the same rms acceleration (10 ms- 2 rms) caused similar decreases in blood <b>flow</b> in <b>fingers</b> on exposed and unexposed hands. Shocks with a 83. 3 s- 1 repetition rate, peak magnitude of 10 ms- 2 and rms acceleration of 10 ms- 2 provoked greater reduction in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> than shocks with the same peak magnitude but lower repetition rate (21 or 5. 3 s- 1) and lower rms acceleration (5 or 2. 5 ms- 2). Conclusions For shocks similar to those based on 125 -Hz oscillations with repetition rates between 1. 3 and 83. 3 s- 1, acute reductions in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> can be predicted from the rms acceleration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} flow instabilities on {{capillary}} trapping mechanisms {{is a major}} source of uncertainty in CO 2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers. Standard macroscopic models of multiphase flow in porous media are unable to explain and quantitatively predict the onset and structure of viscous-unstable flows, such as the displacement of brine by the injected CO 2. We present the first step of a research effort aimed at the experimental characterization and mathematical (continuum) modeling of such flows. Existing continuum models of multiphase flow are unable to explain why preferential <b>flow</b> (<b>fingering)</b> occurs during infiltration into homogeneous, dry soil. We present a macroscopic model that reproduces the experimentally observed features of <b>fingered</b> <b>flows.</b> The proposed model is derived using a phase-field methodology and does not introduce new independent parameters. From a linear stability analysis, we predict that finger velocity and finger width both increase with infiltration rate, and the predictions are in quantitative agreement with experiments...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{observed}} Cl- transport {{during a}} large-scale in situ unsaturated infiltration experiment {{in terms of}} the observation scale of the transport process and the physical stratification of the Tertiary sedimentary flow domain. By comparing piston flow and local velocity profiles, we show that velocity variations cannot be explained by water content changes alone. We also demonstrate that by comparing a layered convection - dispersion (CD) model with the observations, the dispersivity profile cannot be explained with the model, which produced unrealistic local dispersivity values. These discrepancies were partially explained by nonrepresentative sampling using porous cup solution samplers (PCS). We hypothesize that <b>fingering</b> <b>flow</b> or convergence phenomena below sand - clay interfaces leads to nonrepresentative artificially high dispersivity values. Velocity and dispersivity values immediately above the clay layers, however, seem more reliable to convergence and more lateral mixing induced by a larger water Following the criteria derived from the Chuoke equation, we show that the subsoil can be subjected to <b>fingering</b> <b>flow.</b> We found that this process likely persisted for some 17 yr. Therefore, we conclude that the fine-textured clayey layers regulated the flow rate through time, approaching a quasi-steady-state flow condition. Overall, solute transport processes in the unsaturated layered subsoil appeared to be very strongly influenced by stratification of the flow domain. An highly variable flow field was induced by the clay layers in a sandy deposit, while the local PCS sampling devices were likely too small to properly assess the mixing regime at this large scale...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} showed that acute vascular responses to hand-transmitted vibration depend on the magnitude, the frequency, and the duration of the vibration but the mechanisms involved in the immediate vasoconstriction on exposure to vibration are not clear. This research was designed to advance understanding of the relation between the characteristics of vibration and changes in vascular circulation on exposed hands, and to develop a model of the mechanoreceptor channel involved in mediating vascular changes during vibration. Study 1 was designed to determine an appropriate temperature for investigating changes in finger circulation induced by hand-transmitted vibration. Subjects were exposed to vibration with two room temperatures (20 °C and 28 °C). The reduction in absolute <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> was greater with the higher room temperature, but the percentage reduction in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> relative to FBF during pre-exposure to vibration was similar. The room temperature was then setting up at 25 °C to maintain suitable absolute <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> value and obtain clear reduction pattern for digits circulation during vibration exposure. Three experiments were designed to investigate the role of the Pacinian channel in mediating vasoconstriction in the fingers during exposure to 125 -Hz vibration. In study 2, the association between vibration-induced reductions in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> and vibrotactile perception thresholds was investigated. Thresholds for the perception of 125 -Hz vibration were measured on the thenar eminence of the right hand and then changes in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> were measured when exposed to vibration (125 -Hz at 0. 5 and 1. 5 ms- 2 r. m. s.). When the vibration magnitude was greater than individual vibration thresholds, vasoconstriction was correlated with thresholds at both vibration magnitudes. In study 3, the relation between thresholds and vasoconstriction was investigated with 125 -Hz vibration and two contactors: 3 -mm and 6 -mm diameter probes. Subjects provided thresholds for perceiving vibration with both contact areas. With the magnitude of vibration 15 dB above each individual’s threshold with the 3 -mm probe, the reduction in FBF with the 6 -mm probe was greater than with the 3 -mm probe. There were similar reductions in finger circulation when vibration was presented by the two sizes of contactor at the same sensation level. In study 4, the relationship between 125 -Hz perception thresholds and vascular changes was investigated by applying vibration to different body locations. Vibration (125 -Hz 15 dB above the individual threshold at the right thenar eminence) was applied to three body locations: right index finger, right thenar eminence, and left thenar eminence. Differences in reductions in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> caused by vibration at each location were correlated with differences in thresholds: subjects with a greater difference in threshold between fingertip and thenar eminence showed a greater difference in the vascular changes when vibration was applied to the fingertip and the thenar eminence. Study 5 investigated the role of the Pacinian channel in mediating vascular responses to vibration at different frequencies of vibration. Subjects were exposed to 10 magnitudes of vibration (from - 10 dB to 40 dB sensation level) at 8, 16, 31. 5, 63, 125, and 250 Hz. <b>Finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> was reduced by 63 -, 125 -, and 250 -Hz vibration when the vibration magnitude reached a sensation level of 10 dB. With 8 -, 16 - and 31. 5 -Hzvibration, 25 dB sensation level was required to cause vasoconstriction. It is concluded that acute reductions in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> during vibration are mediated by the Pacinian channel through the sympathetic nervous reflex. The differences in the reductions in <b>finger</b> blood <b>flow</b> induced by vibration when exposed to different contact areas, body locations, and frequencies reflect the variation of the sensitivity of the Pacinian channel due to its characteristics (i. e., spatial summation, receptor density, frequency-dependent sensitivity) ...|$|R
