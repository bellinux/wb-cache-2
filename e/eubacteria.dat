Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally <b>Eubacteria)</b> and Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals) These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as ribosomes.|$|E

25|$|Three {{classes of}} RNR have similar {{mechanisms}} for {{the reduction of}} NDPs, but differ in the domain that generates the free radical, the specific metal in the metalloprotein structure, and the electron donors. All classes use free-radical chemistry. Class I reductases use an iron center with ferrous to ferric conversion to generate a tyrosyl free radical. Reduction of NDP substrates occurs under aerobic conditions. Class I reductases are divided into IA and IB {{due to differences in}} regulation. Class IA reductases are distributed in eukaryotes, <b>eubacteria,</b> bacteriophages, and viruses. Class IB reductases are found in <b>eubacteria.</b> Class IB reductases can also use a radical generated with the stabilization of a binuclear manganese center. Class II reductases generate a free radical by mechanisms involving 5’-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin (coenzyme B12) and have a simpler structure than class I and class III reductases. Reduction of NDPs or ribonucleotide 5’-triphosphates (NTPs) occurs under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Class II reductases are distributed in archaebacteria, <b>eubacteria,</b> and bacteriophages. Class III reductases use a glycine radical generated {{with the help of an}} S-adenosyl methionine and an iron sulphur center. Reduction of NTPs is limited to anaerobic conditions. Class III reductases are distributed in archaebacteria, <b>eubacteria,</b> and bacteriophages. Organisms are not limited to having one class of enzymes.

25|$|James Lake {{presented}} a 2 primary kingdom arrangement (Parkaryotae + eukaryotes and eocytes + Karyotae) and suggested a 5 primary kingdom scheme (Eukaryota, Eocyta, Methanobacteria, Halobacteria, and <b>Eubacteria)</b> based on ribosomal structure and a 4 primary kingdom scheme (Eukaryota, Eocyta, Methanobacteria, and Photocyta), bacteria being classified according to 3 major biochemical innovations: photosynthesis (Photocyta), methanogenesis (Methanobacteria), and sulfur respiration (Eocyta). He has also discovered evidence that Gram-negative bacteria arose from a symbiosis between 2 Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|With {{improved}} methodologies {{it became}} clear that the methanogenic bacteria were profoundly different and were (erroneously) believed to be relics of ancient bacteria thus Carl Woese, regarded as the forerunner of the molecular phylogeny revolution, identified three primary lines of descent: the Archaebacteria, the <b>Eubacteria,</b> and the Urkaryotes, the latter now represented by the nucleocytoplasmic component of the Eukaryotes. These lineages were formalised into the rank Domain (regio in Latin) which divided Life into 3 domains: the Eukaryota, the Archaea and the Bacteria. This scheme is still followed today.|$|E

Genes of this operon encode the enzymes responsible for bile acid 7 α-dehydroxylation. The baiG gene encodes a bile acid transporter in <b>Eubacterium</b> sp. strain V. P. I. 12708.

500|$|Archaea {{were first}} {{classified}} as a separate group of prokaryotes in 1977 by Carl Woese and George E. Fox in phylogenetic trees based on the sequences of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. These two groups were originally named the Archaebacteria and <b>Eubacteria</b> and treated as kingdoms or subkingdoms, which Woese and Fox termed Urkingdoms. Woese argued that this group of prokaryotes is a fundamentally different sort of life. To emphasize this difference, Woese later proposed a new natural system of organisms with three separate Domains: the Eukarya, the Bacteria and the Archaea, {{in what is now}} known as [...] "The Woesian Revolution".|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "bacteria" [...] was {{traditionally}} {{applied to}} all microscopic, single-cell prokaryotes. However, molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate domains, originally called <b>Eubacteria</b> and Archaebacteria, but now called Bacteria and Archaea that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor. The archaea and eukaryotes are {{more closely related to}} each other than either is to the bacteria. These two domains, along with Eukarya, are the basis of the three-domain system, which is currently the most widely used classification system in microbiology. However, due to the relatively recent introduction of molecular systematics and a rapid {{increase in the number of}} genome sequences that are available, bacterial classification remains a changing and expanding field. For example, a few biologists argue that the Archaea and Eukaryotes evolved from gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
500|$|Although not {{recognized}} until the 1970s, nickel {{is known to}} play an important role in the biology of some plants, <b>eubacteria,</b> archaebacteria, and fungi. Nickel enzymes such as urease are considered virulence factors in some organisms. Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbamate. The -hydrogenases can catalyze the oxidation of [...] to form protons and electrons, and can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the reduction of protons to form hydrogen gas. A nickel-tetrapyrrole coenzyme, cofactor F430, is present in methyl coenzyme M reductase, which can catalyze the formation of methane, or the reverse reaction, in methanogenic archaea. One of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an Fe-Ni-S cluster. Other nickel-bearing enzymes include a rare bacterial class of superoxide dismutase and glyoxalase I enzymes in bacteria and several parasitic eukaryotic trypanosomal parasites (in higher organisms, including yeast and mammals, this enzyme contains divalent Zn2+).|$|E

2500|$|The three-domain {{system is}} an {{addition}} to the Linnaean system biological classification introduced by Carl Woese et al. in 1977 that divides cellular life forms into archaea, bacteria, and eukaryote domains. In particular, it emphasizes the separation of prokaryotes into two groups, originally called <b>Eubacteria</b> (now Bacteria) and Archaebacteria (now Archaea). Woese argued that, {{on the basis of}} differences in 16S rRNA genes, these two groups and the eukaryotes each arose separately from an ancestor with poorly developed genetic machinery, often called a progenote. To reflect these primary lines of descent, he treated each as a domain, divided into several different kingdoms. The term [...] "domain" [...] was adopted in 1990.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{reversal}} of the pattern on land, in the oceans, almost all photosynthesis is performed by algae, with a small fraction contributed by vascular plants and other groups.

[...] <b>Eubacteria</b> are important photosynthetizers in both oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems, and while some archaea are phototrophic, none are known to utilise oxygen-evolving photosynthesis.

Both isolates hydrolyzed esculin to esculetin, indicating beta-glycosidase activity. In addition to plasmenylethanolamine, five other lipids which contain an alkenyl ether residue supported growth of <b>Eubacterium</b> strain 403 in a lecithin-cholesterol base medium.

40|$|Clostridium sp. strain TO- 931 can rapidly {{convert the}} {{primary bile acid}} cholic acid to a {{potentially}} toxic compound, deoxycholic acid. Mixed oligonucleotide probes were used to isolate a gene fragment encoding a putative bile acid transporter from Clostridium sp. strain TO- 931. This DNA fragment had 60 % nucleotide sequence identity to a known bile acid transporter gene from <b>Eubacterium</b> sp. strain VPI 12708, another bile acid- 7 α-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium. The DNA (9. 15 kb) surrounding the transporter gene was cloned from Clostridium sp. strain TO- 931 and sequenced. Within this larger DNA fragment was a 7. 9 -kb region, containing six successive open reading frames (ORFs), that was encoded by a single 8. 1 -kb transcript, as determined by Northern blot analysis. The gene arrangement and DNA sequence of the Clostridium sp. strain TO- 931 operon {{are similar to those}} of a <b>Eubacterium</b> sp. strain VPI 12708 bile acid-inducible operon containing nine ORFs. Several genes in the <b>Eubacterium</b> sp. strain VPI 12708 operon have been shown to encode products required for bile acid 7 α-dehydroxylation. In Clostridium sp. strain TO- 931, genes potentially encoding bile acid-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase, 3 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, bile acid 7 α-dehydratase, bile acid-CoA hydrolase, and a bile acid transporter were similar in size and exhibited amino acid homology to similar gene products from <b>Eubacterium</b> sp. strain VPI 12708 (encoded by baiB, baiA, baiE, baiF, and baiG, respectively). However, no genes similar to <b>Eubacterium</b> sp. strain VPI 12708 biaH or baiI were found in the Clostridium sp. strain TO- 931 bai operon, and the two putative <b>Eubacterium</b> sp. strain VPI 12708 genes, baiC and baiD, were arranged in one continuous ORF in Clostridium sp. strain TO- 931. Intergene regions showed no significant DNA sequence similarity, but primer extension analysis identified a region 115 bp upstream from the first ORF that exhibited 58 % identity to a bai operator/promoter region identified in <b>Eubacterium</b> sp. strain VPI 12708.
