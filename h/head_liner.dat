One important aspect other that properties, performance, emission, combustion {{of alternative}} fuels is wear characteristics. Some important components of an engine are piston, piston rings, cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>liner</b> etc. where major wear takes place. In this present work, a four stroke single cylinder diesel engine {{is run by}} alternative fuel. The alternative fuel is used here Neem-Diesel blend. The same engine is run by this blend continuously and discontinuously {{with a view to}} investigates wear effect on the engine components due to continuous running. At the beginning of each experiment engine piston, cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>liner,</b> Gasket, Injector etc. have been changed and fitted newly. Wear characteristics, both quantitative and qualitative, have been studied by Ferrographic analysis (DR-V Dual Ferrograph) of collected lubricating oil samples from the oil sump. Images of the wear particles have also been taken using CCD camera. The comparative wear characteristics indicate critical damage of components occurred in case of continuous running of the engine and thus continuous mode of operation of the engine using Neem-Diesel blend should be taken care of...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of TBCs in engines reduces the heat {{transfer to the}} engine cooling jacket through the combustion chamber surfaces (which include the cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>liner,</b> and piston crown) and piston rings. This paper deals with the study and comparison of various coatings applied on IC engine pistons and their effects on efficiencies and fuel consumption. It is well known fact that about 30 % of the energy supplied is lost through the coolant and the 30 % is wasted through friction and other losses, thus leaving only 30 % of energy utilization for useful purposes. There have been numerous research papers in recent years describing the theoretical benefits obtained {{from the use of}} ceramic components in reciprocating engines, but that describes practical results is very limited. This paper gives the comparison of various practical experiments on coatings in IC engines and their effects. This paper serves as a guide, i. e., collection of all coating effects from the literature for any future development in the IC engine coating industry...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} an integrated methodology for the accurate {{characterization of the}} thermal behavior of internal combustion engines, with particular reference to a high performance direct injected SI engine for sport car applications. The engine is operated at full load and maximum power revving speed, which {{is known to be}} critical {{from the point of view}} of thermal stresses on the engine components. In particular, two different sets of 3 D-CFD calculations are adopted: on one side, full-cycle in-cylinder analyses are carried out to estimate the point wise thermal heat flux due to combustion on the engine components facing the combustion chamber. On the other side, full-engine multi-region CHT calculations covering the engine coolant jacket and the surrounding metal components are used to compute the point wise temperature distribution within the engine <b>head,</b> <b>liner</b> and block. An iterative procedure is then implemented in order to exchange relevant thermal data between the two modeling frameworks: at first, local gas temperatures and heat transfer coefficients from the in-cylinder simulations are applied as thermal loads to the CHT calculations; then, the resulting surface temperature maps are re-applied to the combustion chamber walls for the subsequent in-cylinder CFD analysis. The procedure is iteratively repeated until convergence is met in terms of thermal characterization of the engine. The procedure takes into account the non-uniform spatial distribution of both thermal loads from the combustion process and resulting temperature distribution on the combustion chamber walls, which are known to be particularly evident when considering direct injected stratified charged engines. The resulting thermal fields are compared to those deriving from a traditional approach for both the in-cylinder and CHT calculations, i. e. the application of uniform heat fluxes on the CHT side and the use of uniform wall temperatures on the in-cylinder side. The resulting differences are highlighted and critically discussed, with particular emphasis on those which could have a relevant impact on both the fatigue strength evaluation of the engine and the arising of local undesired phenomena such as surface ignition and knocking...|$|E
40|$|Heladhanavi 100 MW Diesel Power Plant in Puttalam, Sri Lanka {{comprises}} of six 18 V 46 Wartsila turbocharged {{air cooled}} engines. Fuel {{consumption of the}} engines varies with the ambient conditions. It has been seen in hotter days fuel consumption is higher comparatively to cooler days. This study was conducted as per the requirement {{to find out the}} reasons behind this variation of the fuel consumption and to quantify the effects on the efficiency with respect to the charge air properties in relation to temperature and humidity. In this study the effect of charge air temperature was analyzed performing two sets of experiments. A combustion analysis experiment (experiment 1) was performed to monitor what happens inside the combustion chamber during day and night times. This is to investigate the cause of efficiency variation and why and how it happens. Simultaneously a fuel consumption test was performed using the direct method with the fuel flow meter and energy dispatch readings taking in to the consideration. A humidity analysis inside the charge air receiver was carried out simultaneously to investigate the humidity effect on the combustion. A flue gas analysis test (experiment 2) was performed to determine the efficiency variation in day and night times through the indirect method. Along with this analysis the direct method was followed up to calculate fuel consumption to compare the results from the both tests. A humidity analysis inside the charge air receiver was carried out simultaneously to investigate the humidity effect on the combustion. For all the tests and analysis DG 02 at approximately Rhs: 55, 000 was selected to conduct the measurements as 48, 000 rhs major overhaul was completed recently. All the components in the fuel system such as pumping elements and injectors are in good condition. The cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>liner</b> and piston overhaul was also have been carried out. The experiments were planned so the lots other factors are not affecting the combustion efficiency during the process to isolate the ambient conditions. The experiments were also carried out during day and night times on the same day to minimize other factors such as fuel quality affecting the equations. Always the LHV of the incoming fuel was obtained for calculations to avoid further mistakes. The results are elaborated along with findings from the past studies in the Literature review. It was confirmed the fuel consumption is positively affected by the charge air temperature while the efficiency is negatively affected. From the literature review it was found out the humidity in charge air affects positively on the fuel consumption while efficiency is negatively affected. The charge air temperature affects the ignition delay period so that the peak pressure and then the combustion efficiency. The efficiency improvement is further confirmed by the flue gas analysis experiment as the loss in the flue gas reduces in night time comparatively to the day time. At Heladhanavi temperature and humidity in charged air behaves in completely opposite manner in day and night times. During day time temperature is high while humidity is low. For the night time case its vise versa. Finally it can be concluded that under the prevailing ambient conditions at the Heladhanavi Power Plant, Puttalam, Sri Lanka, the effect of charge air temperature is more prominent than the effect of humidity in the combustion process for the Wartsila 18 V 46 diesel engines, as a result the efficiency improves during the night time comparatively to the day time. Therefore, proper cleaning and maintaining of the charge air coolers are the most important factor to maintain the charge air temperature and relative humidity inside charge air receiver at a lowest value. Therefore to attain the best electrical efficiency and the fuel consumption for a certain fuel batch. Presentation was conducted online. </p...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that with high {{interfacial}} temperatures in hip bearings, it is possible to precipitate proteins, greatly reduce the compressive creep properties of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), and change the phase content of monolithic tetragonal zirconia. These induced features may alter the wear rate of UHMWPE. It was the objective of this study to examine the interfacial temperatures of oxidized zirconium (OxZr) heads as compared with metallic and ceramic heads coupled with polyethylene in a hip simulator. The interface temperatures were measured by placing thermocouples within 0. 5 mm of the interface surface of both femoral <b>heads</b> and acetabular <b>liners,</b> and then articulating the surfaces using a 12 -station AMTI anatomic hip simulator. The alumina femoral heads had the lowest average interfacial temperature, followed in increasing order by OxZr, CoCr, and zirconia.

40|$|Background: Aseptic {{loosening}} and osteolysis commonly {{limit the}} survivorship of total hip prostheses. Retention of a well-fixed acetabular component, rather than full acetabular revision, has multiple advantages, but questions have lingered regarding the clinical success and prosthetic survivorship following this procedure. We examined {{the impact of}} acetabular component position, polyethylene type, liner insertion technique, femoral head size, and simultaneous revi-sion of the entire femoral component (as opposed to <b>head</b> and <b>liner</b> exchange) or bone-grafting on mid-term to long-term prosthetic survival following such limited revisions. Methods: One hundred hips in 100 patients with osteolysis, polyethylene wear, or femoral component loosening underwent revision total hip arthroplasty with retention of the acetabular component. Acetabular component inclination and anteversion weremeasured on prerevision radiographs and were categorized according to predetermined positional safe zones (inclination of 35 to 55 and anteversion of 5 to 25). Operative reports were reviewed for femoral <b>head</b> size, polyethylene <b>liner</b> type (conventional or highly cross-linked), liner insertion technique (use of the existing lockingmechanism or cementation), whether the patient had revision of the entire femoral component, and use of bone graft.
