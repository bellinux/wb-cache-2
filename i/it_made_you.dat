You weren't as surrounded by your peers as everybody else your age was... In my case it meant tremendous amount of reading at an early age... I read, listened to radio...

500|$|In 1972, Jerry Claiborne {{took over}} as {{head coach of the}} Terrapins, which had only nine wins in the past five years. In his first season, Maryland {{improved}} to 5–5–1, and the following year, they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades. The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11–0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as [...] "vanilla", and said his strategy was [...] "run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense." [...] He went on to say, [...] "But, there's no question he made me a tougher player [...] [...] [...] We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker. It was like he had a sign on our back, 'Hit us, we're stupid'. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> a tougher player." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{day after}} Madonna's halftime show {{performance}} on the Super Bowl XLVI, the singer confirmed to Ryan Seacrest that [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] would be released as the second single from the album. A lyric video for the song was released on February 27, 2012, while it was available for digital download from March 2, 2012 at the iTunes Store. The cover art for the single was released on February 29, 2012. Shot by fashion photographers Mert and Marcus, who had also created the covers for MDNA, the [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] artwork showed Madonna wearing lingerie by English retailer Agent Provocateur. She had chosen the brand's [...] "Raphaella" [...] padded bra, made from French corded lace and pleated tulle. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly praised the artwork saying that the singer [...] "still wears underwear in public better than most women half her age". Billboard writer Gregory DelliCarpini, Jr. felt that Madonna portrayed having fun in [...] "racy undies" [...] on the cover, in spite of being a mother. [...] "Is this the 21st century version of her infamous cone bra? Nah, but <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> look ," [...] he concluded.|$|E

500|$|Michael Deacon of The Daily Telegraph reacted {{positively}} {{towards the}} series, stating [...] "episode one was enjoyably sinister. It was also, once or twice, quite amusing, in (of course) a blokey way." [...] Deacon liked {{the beginning of}} the pilot where the main characters record a video message, stating [...] "this is what Mad Dogs did well – like any competent suspense thriller, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> ask questions throughout. The episode bubbled with foreboding, right up to the cliffhanger." [...] Deacon also noted at the cliffhanger that [...] "the most disturbing sight wasn't the shower of blood but the gunman's rubber mask, which was of a grinning Tony Blair." [...] John Crace of The Guardian was more mixed, starting [...] "after unsuccessfully fobbing us off with endless series of Ross Kemp looking macho, Sky is now throwing serious money at getting viewers to watch something other than sport." [...] Crace was critical of the set up of the episode, stating [...] "I'm all for allowing a drama time to breathe but we didn't really need a whole hour just to establish that Alvo was a bit dodgy and that the four others had complications in their lives. Rather than building menace, the snail-like pace dissipated it," [...] However, he reacted positively towards the end, as [...] "things did eventually look up," [...] adding [...] "there's hope for Mad Dogs yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} written from the {{perspective}} of Vikings rowing west from Scandinavia in search of new lands. The lyrics, such as [...] "Fight the horde, sing and cry, 'Valhalla, I am coming!'" [...] make explicit reference to Viking conquests and the Old Norse religion. In a 1970 radio interview, Plant jokingly recalled, [...] "We went to Iceland, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> think of Vikings and big ships ... and John Bonham's stomach ... and bang, there it was – Immigrant Song!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Alamo {{went on to}} say, [...] "Mr. Diaz was 175. This {{creates a}} unique situation. I was there at this fight and believe that you were {{intoxicated}} and... that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> numb to the pain. Did it help you win? I think it did." [...] Despite Diaz being surrounded by other athletes and video cameras for several hours before the fight, Alamo gave no explanation for why he believed Diaz had used marijuana in the hours preceding the event. Diaz himself dismissed the assertion that marijuana was a Performance-enhancing drug, or that he was smoking it prior to the fight.|$|E

2500|$|At Abbey Road Studios on 20 May 1970, a {{month after}} the Beatles' break-up, Harrison ran through [...] "Hear Me Lord" [...] alone on {{electric}} guitar for producer Phil Spector. Leng suggests that, following Lennon and McCartney's routine dismissal of many of his compositions, Harrison [...] "presented his new songs with reticence, almost with a Pavlovian expectation of their being rejected". In his interview for the 2011 [...] documentary, Spector explains his positive reaction to Harrison's spiritually themed songs: [...] "He just lived by his deeds. He was spiritual and you knew it, and there was no salesmanship involved. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> spiritual being around him." [...] Harrison biographer Gary Tillery notes an additional need for faith on the singer's part in mid 1970 as [...] "pillars of Harrison's old life were passing away", with the demise of his former band and the fatal illness of his mother, Louise.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene and}} song [...] "Life Support" [...] were {{also based on}} Friends in Deed, {{as well as on}} Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the [...] "forget regret" [...] refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV {{positive}} friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this [...] "credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?" [...] Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, [...] "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" [...] Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, [...] "Then why choose fear?" [...] Gordon says, [...] "I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life." ...|$|E

Not {{that she was}} a phoney in what she said or {{believed}} – she was absolutely not a con artist – but she knew that some people looked on her as a crackpot, so she kind of fed into that notion and let you go either way with it...She believed enough to make it spooky, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> doubt your own sense of reality sometimes." [...] Barbara Lesko wrote, [...] "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance." [...] William Golding wrote of the Egyptologists he met in his travels through Egypt in the 1980s who were [...] "as well disposed to the Mystery as any child could have wished." [...] When [...] "the question arose of a dear lady who believed herself to have been a priestess of a particular temple, they did not dismiss her as a crackpot but agreed that she had something." ...|$|E
