As of 15 November 2016, Indonesia is issuing these licenses, i.e. only timber that is <b>FLEGT</b> <b>licensed</b> can enter the EU. [...] Among other VPA partner countries, Ghana is also in an advanced stage of implementing its timber legality assurance system ahead of <b>FLEGT</b> <b>licensing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{aim is to}} use {{trade as}} an incentive, as FLEGT-licensed timber {{automatically}} meets {{the requirements of the}} EU Timber Regulation, which requires EU operators to use due diligence to prevent illegal wood entering the market. <b>FLEGT</b> <b>licensed</b> timber will not be subject to those checks so will have a green light to enter the EU.|$|R

40|$|The chapter {{reflects}} {{on the state of}} free and open source software (‘FOSS’) and other alternative <b>licensing</b> <b>schemes</b> in the Netherlands: though still the exception in copyright licensing, a series of initiatives are paving the way for mainstream recognition and usage. Some examples, explained in the first section dealing, inter alia, with the types of <b>licensing</b> <b>schemes</b> available in the Netherlands and the EU, are the efforts made by the local Creative Commons (‘CC’) team in porting and translating licenses or the recognition by the courts of Creative Commons licensing. Sections two and three of the chapter provide a more detailed legal description of these alternative <b>licensing</b> <b>schemes</b> from the perspective of Dutch contract law and Dutch copyright law, respectively. Those aspects that have still not been construed by either common practice or Dutch courts are dealt with from a legislative and doctrinal point of view. To conclude, the last section of our chapter addresses the potential implications, and challenges, of alternative <b>licensing</b> <b>schemes</b> in the areas of patent law and competition law. Some insight is also given into the opportunities offered to the public sector by the increasingly widespread use of alternative licensing...|$|R

40|$|The Inquiry has {{recommended}} that a <b>licensing</b> <b>scheme</b> {{be set up}} to regulate labour hire operators. The report also called on the Victorian Government to advocate for a national <b>licensing</b> <b>scheme</b> for labour hire operators, through the Council of Australian Governments. The Victorian Government has accepted in principle the recommendations regarding licensing and advocacy to the Commonwealth. The Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources will now consult further to develop the structure of such a <b>licensing</b> <b>scheme</b> and what industries should be regulated. There are a range of other important findings and recommendations in the comprehensive and wide ranging report, which was presented by the Chairman of the Inquiry, RMIT Professor, Anthony Forsyth. These will be closely examined by the government {{with a view to}} developing a response to those matters over coming months...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{alternative}} <b>licensing</b> <b>schemes</b> of a patentor, that is, at {{the same}} time, a producer within an industry. The <b>licensing</b> <b>scheme</b> can assume {{the form of a}} royalty per unit of output, a fixed fee, or a fixed fee with maximum authorized production. We show that, when the innovation is non-drastic, in a duopolistic Cournot competition, the third method dominates the others. As the patentor has strong incentives to limit the output of the opponent, this practice must be carefully monitored by the antitrust authority. ...|$|R
