However, a major shortcoming of DNA vaccines is their poor immunogenicity when administered intramuscularly. Transcutaneous immunization (TCI) via microneedles is a promising alternative delivery route to enhance the vaccination efficacy. A novel dissolving microneedle array (DMA) -based TCI system loaded with cationic liposomes encapsulated with hepatitis B DNA vaccine and adjuvant CpG ODN was developed and characterized. The pGFP expression in mouse skin using DMA was imaged over time. In vivo <b>immunity</b> <b>tests</b> in mice were performed to observe the capability of DMA to induce immune response after delivery of DNA. The results showed that pGFP could be delivered into skin by DMA and expressed in skin. Further, the amount of expressed GFP was likely to peak at day 4. The <b>immunity</b> <b>tests</b> showed that the DMA-based DNA vaccination could induce effective immune response. CpG ODN significantly improved the immune response. The cationic liposomes could further improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccine.

40|$|Smart Grid {{components}} {{often are}} subject to considerable conducted current disturbances in the frequency range 2 – 150 kHz and, as a consequence, {{it is necessary to}} provide reliable <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> methods. The relevant basic standard IEC 61000 - 4 - 19 that is currently under discussion focusses on frequency domain test methods. It is remarked in this contribution that in the context of frequency domain testing the chosen frequency spacing is related to the resonance response of the system under test which, in turn, is characterized in terms of resonance frequencies and quality factors. These notions apply well to physical system but it is pointed out by the example of an actual smart meter <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> that smart grid components may exhibit susceptibilities that do not necessarily follow a resonance pattern and, additionally, can be narrowband.

40|$|In this paper, a {{bulk current}} {{injection}} (BCI) <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> is designed that conforms to the effects induced in the equipment under test (EUT) by a radiated electromagnetic disturbance (EMD). This is done by adopting a statistical description of the EMD and by comparing currents induced by BCI and distributed field-coupling (i. e., radiation) in the input pins of the EUT. Closed-form results are obtained that enforce equivalence of the aforementioned test procedures in terms of specific statistical estimates (e. g., expected value and dispersion) {{as well as for}} worst-case radiation-induced effects. A distributed-parameter circuit model of the system under test is adopted, composed by the EUT, auxiliary equipment (AE), and a wiring harness. In the analysis, the EMD is described via plane waves with random parameters and a uniform multiconductor transmission line model is used for the wiring harness. The EUT and AE are represented via lumped impedance matrices. Injection-probe feeding-conditions assuring equivalence are derived analytically, and involve a frequency piecewise-linear profile of the RF voltage source.

40|$|Transverse {{electromagnetic}} (TEM) waveguides {{are predominantly}} used for emission and <b>immunity</b> <b>tests.</b> General requirements for TEM waveguides are {{given by the}} IEC 61000 - 4 - 20. Annex C of the IEC 61000 - 4 - 20 specifies <b>immunity</b> <b>tests</b> based on high-altitude electromagnetic pulses with a double exponential waveform. This waveform's shape is sufficiently defined by the rise time and the pulsewidth. The quality of its transmission within a waveguide can, thus, be expressed by the allowed variation of these parameters. However, other arbitrary signals cannot be reduced to just these characteristic parameters. In this paper, a method is described that offers the possibility to characterize the transmission quality of a TEM cell for arbitrary transient waveforms. It {{is based on the}} Pearson correlation coefficient of a so-called reference signal and the signals being measured within the test volume of a TEM cell. Both signals are measured simultaneously with identical field probes in order to be independent from the reproducibility of the signal generator. The signals are windowed and limited to include only the defining reflections and distortions. By means of this signal-dedicated validation procedure, the transmission quality of a TEM waveguide can be validated for an arbitrary transient waveform...|$|E

40|$|Cameras are {{nowadays}} {{important part}} of mobile devices like smart phones, mobile phones and tablets. Nokia is concentrating on camera development, and good cameras are one way how Nokia is differentiating from its competitors. During camera development there are many kinds of tests {{that need to be}} done to verify the performance of a camera module. Testing can be time-consuming for Nokia and camera suppliers. Automated tests are a good way to reduce the time needed for testing and the workload of test operators. Automating usually also improves test repeatability which makes it safer to count on camera suppliers’ measurements. With repeatable test systems, more testing can be moved to camera suppliers and hence problems are found in earlier phases of camera development. Purpose of this thesis was to develop an automated conducted <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> for camera modules. The conducted <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> is a part of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests, and it tests how well the camera module can tolerate fluctuations on power supply lines. Power supply fluctuations can cause row noise to an image, which lowers the image quality. Noise on power supply lines can come from inside or outside of the camera module. On a smart phone camera, there are possible noise sources inside the small camera module like an autofocus (AF) and an optical image stabilizer (OIS). Therefore it is important to pay attention to camera module immunity against power supply fluctuations. The automated test replaced an old manually done conducted <b>immunity</b> <b>test.</b> Biggest problems with the manual test were that it took too much time to do the test, it was not repeatable enough, and it did not find all problem frequencies. The automated test eliminated these problems. Test results shows what are the problem frequencies and how much the image has row noise at those frequencies. This gives understanding of camera module immunity and also gives guidance what sensitive frequencies should be avoided if there is possibility to affect to noise signal frequencies. The automated test has already been taken into use at Nokia and camera suppliers...|$|R
