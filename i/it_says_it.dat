25|$|Al Jazeera {{is owned}} by the {{government}} of Qatar. Al Jazeera officials have stated that they are editorially independent from the government of Qatar. However, this assertion is disputed, and many have accused Al Jazeera of being a propaganda outlet for the Qatari government. The network is sometimes perceived to have mainly Islamist perspectives, promoting the Muslim Brotherhood, and having a pro-Sunni and an anti-Shia bias in its reporting of regional issues. However, Al Jazeera insists it covers all sides of a debate; <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> presents Israel's view, Iran's view and even aired videos released by Osama bin Laden. In June 2017, the Saudi, Emirati, Bahraini, and Egyptian governments demanded the closure of the news station as one of thirteen demands made to Qatar during the 2017 Qatar Crises.|$|E

Dilys Powell in The Sunday Times complained [...] "...17th century hanging, burning, raping, screaming, and Vincent Price as England's prize torture-overseer. Peculiarly nauseating." [...] The Guardian felt the film was filled with [...] "gratuitous sadism." [...] Margaret Hinxman of The Sunday Telegraph dismissed it as a [...] "sadistic extravaganza." [...] Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. John Russell Taylor in the London Times Saturday Review said the film [...] "...is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else... There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject... Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period." [...] Films and Filming noted, [...] "Witchfinder General has no explicit 'message', but it does {{say something about the}} springs of despair and <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> forcefully. It is a very frightening film... Matthew Hopkins is the best of Price's recent performances. Witchfinder General is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one..." [...] Monthly Film Bulletin observed, [...] "Not since Peeping Tom has a film aroused such an outcry about nastiness and gratuitous violence as this one... the tone of the film is oddly muted, with torture and death in plenty, but viewed matter-of-factly and without stress... Throughout the whole film there is a vivid sense of a time out of joint, which comes as much from the stray groups of soldiers who skirmish against unseen attackers in the woods or hang wearily about by the wayside waiting for battle to commence, as from the bloody crimes committed in the name of religion by Matthew Hopkins." ...|$|E

Their biggest success came with the dreamy [...] "I'm Not in Love", which gave the band their second UK No.1 in June 1975. The song also provided them with their first US chart success when the song reached No.2.
