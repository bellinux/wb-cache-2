5000|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{and texture}} has an undeniable influence on protein adsorption on all materials, {{but with the}} ubiquity of metal machining processes, {{it is useful to}} address how these impact protein behavior. The initial adsorption is important, as well as maintained adhesion and integrity. Research has shown that surface roughness can encourage the adhesion of scaffold proteins and osteoblasts, and results in an increase in surface mineralization. Surfaces with more topographical features and roughness will have more exposed surface area for proteins to interact with. [...] In terms of biomedical engineering applications, micromachining techniques are often used to increase protein adhesion to implants in the hopes of shortening recovery time. The technique of laserpatterning introduces grooves and surface roughness that will influence adhesion, migration and alignment. <b>Grit-blasting,</b> a method analogous to sand blasting, and chemical etching have proven to be successful surface roughening techniques that promote the long-term stability of titanium implants. The increase in stability {{is a direct result of}} the observed increase in extracellular matrix and collagen attachment, which results in increased osteoblast attachment and mineralization when compared to non-roughened surfaces. Adsorption is not always desirable, however. Machinery can be negatively affected by adsorption, particularly with Protein adsorption in the food industry.|$|E
5000|$|As {{one of the}} {{requirements}} for stress corrosion cracking {{is the presence of}} stress in the components, one method of control is to eliminate that stress, or at least reduce it below the threshold stress for SCC. This is not usually feasible for working stresses (the stress that the component is intended to support), but it may be possible where the stress causing cracking is a residual stress introduced during welding or forming.Residual stresses can be relieved by stress-relief annealing, and this is widely used for carbon steels. These have the advantage of a relatively high threshold stress for most environments, consequently it is relatively easy to reduce the residual stresses to a low enough level. In contrast austenitic stainless steels have a very low threshold stress for chloride SCC. This, combined with the high annealing temperatures that are necessary to avoid other problems, such as sensitization and sigma phase embrittlement, means that stress relief is rarely successful as a method of controlling SCC for this system.For large structures, for which full stress-relief annealing is difficult or impossible, partial stress relief around welds and other critical areas may be of value. However, this must be done in a controlled way to avoid creating new regions of high residual stress, and expert advice is advisable if this approach is adopted.Stresses can also be relieved mechanically. For example, hydrostatic testing beyond yield will tend to ‘even-out’ the stresses and thereby reduce the peak residual stress. Similarly laser peening, shot-peening, or <b>grit-blasting</b> tend to introduce a surface compressive stress, and are beneficial for the control of SCC. The uniformity with which these processes are applied is important. If, for example, only the weld region is shot-peened, damaging tensile stresses may be created at the border of the peened area. The compressive residual stresses imparted by laser peening are precisely controlled both in location and intensity, and can be applied to mitigate sharp transitions into tensile regions. Laser peening imparts deep compressive residual stresses on the order of 10 to 20 times deeper than conventional shot peening making it significantly more beneficial at preventing SCC. [...] Laser peening is widely used in the aerospace and power generation industries in gas fired turbine engines.|$|E

Background: The 2 Step process consists of (1) an initial <b>grit-blasting</b> process to produce a micro-rough surface, followed by (2) a combined thermo-chemical treatment that produces a potentially bioactive surface, that is, that can form an apatitic layer when exposed to biomimetic conditions in vitro.

The results demonstrated that there was a general tendency for the apparent static shear strength to be increased with the rise of surface roughness. The polished and glass bead-blasted rods illustrated a slip-stick-slip failure whereas the shot-blasted and <b>grit-blasted</b> rods displayed gross interface failure.

40|$|Objectives: The study {{compared}} the bond strengths of three resins, Bis-GMA and two novel experimental methacrylated polyester dendrimer resins to <b>grit-blasted</b> titanium substrate with three silanes. Methods: Two commercial dental silanes (ESPE Sil™ and Monobond-S™) and an experimental 0. 5 vol% 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane {{were applied to}} <b>grit-blasted</b> Ti substrates. Light-polymerizable resins of Bis-GMA and methacrylated dendrimer were applied to the <b>grit-blasted</b> Ti substrate with polyethylene molds. The substrates with resin stubs (n= 10) were thermocycled (6000 cycles, 5 - 55 °C) or kept in water (37 °C, 24 h). The shear bond strength of the resin was measured at a crosshead speed of 1. 0 mm min- 1. The surface examination, before and after silanization, was made with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The silane reactions on the Ti surface were monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. Results: Statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed that the highest shear bond for thermocycled samples was obtained for Bis-GMA with Monobond-S™ (19. 4 MPa, standard deviation (SD) 7. 1 MPa), and after water storage with a laboratory-made silane (26. 4 MPa, SD 8. 1 MPa). The dendrimer and Bis-GMA resins conferred equal bonding properties to <b>grit-blasted</b> titanium after thermocycling. The silane, resin type, and storage conditions significantly affected the shear bond strength (p< 0. 001 for all factors). SEM images suggested a mainly cohesive type of bonding failure.

The purpose of the study detailed in this report was to examine the feasibility of extending the application of the silane pre-treatment to metallic repairs involving the use of room temperature or paste adhesive systems employed in a range of airbase repairs. Wedge style durability tests were conducted for a range of metallic adherends and room temperature curing adhesives. The durability performance of the <b>grit-blast</b> and epoxy silane metallic adherend pre-treatment was compared with standard pre-treatments recommended in a range of SRMs. Generally, the data indicated that the <b>grit-blast</b> and silane pre-treatment offered either improved or similar performance to the SRM alternative pre...|$|R

Different sets of AA 2024 -T 3 specimens have been coated with pure Al 1050 feedstock powder, using a conventional cold spray coating technique. The sets were <b>grit-blasted</b> (GB) before coating. The study focuses on substrate surface topography evolution before coating and coating-substrate interface morphology after coating. To study coating adhesion by LASAT® technique for each set, specimens with and without preceding GB treatment were tested in load-controlled conditions. Then, several techniques were used to evaluate the effects of substrate surface treatment on the final coating mechanical properties. Irregularities induced by the GB treatment modify significantly the interface morphology. Results showed that particle anchoring was improved dramatically by the presence of craters. The substrate surface was characterized by numerous anchors. Numerical simulation results exhibited the increasing deformation of particle onto the <b>grit-blasted</b> surface. In addition, results showed a strong relationship between the coating-substrate bond strength on the deposited material and surface preparation...|$|R
