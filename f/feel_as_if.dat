5|$|The Doctor and Clara find a {{location}} in the mansion which is noticeably colder {{than the rest of}} the house, and they <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are being watched. Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race back to where the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes in front of them and Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris {{during the holiday}} season {{following}} their adventures with Nights. Though they both enjoy the Christmas season, they <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> something is missing. Realising that the Christmas Star that usually sits {{at the top of the}} Twin Seeds Christmas tree is absent, the pair travel to Nightopia to find it. There, they reunite with Nights and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been decorated due to their dreams of the holiday season. The remainder of the story revolves around their attempts of defeating a revived Gillwing and retrieving the Christmas Star from his lair.|$|E
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E

5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and {{the ruins of the}} Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E
25|$|Overall a {{majority}} of military brats report having developed a kind of extra-adaptability and assimilate into new situations quickly and well, as they have done with each {{move to a new}} military base, town or country. Yet paradoxically, long-term feelings of being an outsider in relation to civilian (non-military) culture are common to {{a majority}} of military brats. For example, one major study shows that 32% of military brats <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are only spectators on U.S. life, and another 48% do not <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are central to any group.|$|E
25|$|In Poetics, Aristotle {{refers to}} {{action as a}} mode, or manner of {{representing}} something. Action is the demonstration of events as they are happening in a story, and may help readers <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were participating in the plot.|$|E

25|$|Occupational {{stress is}} stress related to one's job. Occupational stress often stems from {{unexpected}} responsibilities and pressures {{that do not}} align with a person's knowledge, skills, or expectations, inhibiting one's ability to cope. Occupational stress can increase when workers do not feel supported by supervisors or colleagues, or <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they have little control over work processes.|$|E
25|$|Teachers {{and other}} {{educators}} can <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are pawns {{in a larger}} game of chess where school and district leaders are making decisions that cause problems for educators trying to do their jobs. Barriers that can inhibit the development of PLCs include subject areas, because some educational subjects tend to naturally take precedence over others. The physical layout of the school can be another obstacle.|$|E

It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they {{are sitting in the}} cab of their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.|$|E

25|$|A model {{proposed}} by Naqvi et al. (see above) {{is that the}} insula stores {{a representation of the}} pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. A number of functional imaging studies have shown the insula to be activated during the administration of drugs of abuse. Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the insula is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. In the cue-exposure studies, insula activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the insula {{may play a role in}} memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they arise from within the body. This may make addicts <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> their bodies need to use a drug, and may result in persons with lesions in the insula reporting that their bodies have forgotten the urge to use, according to this study.|$|E
25|$|To {{begin with}} {{cognitive}} responses in infidelity, individuals {{whom have been}} cheated on experience jealousy cognitively for many reasons. They may feel that their partner has lost interest in them and feel that they cannot compare to the persons with whom they are being cheated on with (Johnson, 2017). Therefore, they anticipate {{the loss of their}} partner's emotional interest in them and become jealous for more clear reasons. They could believe that they are losing someone who they care deeply about, or they may <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> their partner is mad at them and doing it out of spite, etc. The anticipation of jealous feelings towards an individual’s significant other causes a cognitive response, even without the burden of proof.|$|E
25|$|The altarpiece {{measures}} 375 x 260cm {{when the}} shutters are closed. The upper panels contain lunettes showing prophets and Sibyls {{looking down on}} the annunciation; the lower tier shows the donors on the far left and right panels flanked by saints. The exterior panels are executed with relative sparseness in comparison to the often fantastical colour and abundance of the interior scenes. Their settings are earthly, pared down and relatively simple. Yet there is the same striking use of illusionism which also characterises the inner panels; {{this is especially true of}} the faux stone grisaille statues of the saints. Lighting is used to great effect to create the impression of depth; van Eyck handles the fall of light and casting of shadow to make the viewer <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the pictorial space is influenced or lit by light entering from the chapel in which he stands.|$|E
5000|$|Taylor's first novel, At Mrs. Lippincote's, was {{published}} in 1945. It was followed by eleven more. Her short stories were published in magazines and collected in four volumes. She also wrote a children's book. The English critic Philip Hensher called The Soul of Kindness a novel [...] "so expert that it seems effortless. As it progresses, it seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the cast are so fully rounded that all the novelist {{had to do was}} place them, successively, in one setting after another and observe how they reacted to each other.... The plot... never <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were organised in advance; it <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it arises from her characters' mutual responses." ...|$|R

25|$|Theorists of {{new media}} examine how {{emerging}} kinds of media, such as websites, blogs, wiki pages, and digital video, both delimit the ways people can use them, and provide new avenues {{for the production}} of social relations and meanings. Picking up from McLuhan, media theorists Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin , in their 1999 book Remediation: Understanding New Media, sought to describe how media forms interact with one another through remediation and the way that this media practice invokes the interrelated processes of immediacy and hypermediacy. The validation of the concept of ‘remediation’; “the representation of one medium in another” (p.45), is a principal aim of the book, in order to illustrate how remediation has been an integral practice to both new and old media forms that continually inform one another. Immediacy attempts to make viewers <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> ‘really’ there, through hypermediated practices, which splice together (hybridizing as McLuhan would say) different kinds of media, such as the combination of “live-action footage with computer compositing and two- and three-dimensional computer graphics” (p.6) in order to create the appearance of a seamless moving image. These interrealated processes highlight, what Bolter and Grusin term, the “double logic of remediation” (p.5) that pursues the proliferation of media whilst trying to erase all traces of human and/or technological mediation.|$|E

[...] "Part of {{the idea is to}} create an element of visible language," [...] Idol explained during an interview with the New York Times, [...] "so that you <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you're being talked to through images. I think you have to start looking to get to the future of what rock-and-roll concerts should be like. We're working; we're pushing the technology to the edge." ...|$|E
500|$|After Aaliyah's death, the German {{newspaper}} Die Zeit published {{excerpts from}} an interview done shortly before her death, {{in which she}} described a recurring dream: [...] "It is dark in my favorite dream.

500|$|Amy Taubin of Film Comment {{described}} The Hurt Locker as [...] "a structuralist war movie" [...] and [...] "a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety {{experience from}} beginning to end." [...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes you <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you, like the characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hollywood Reporter John DeFore {{called the}} film [...] "genuinely moving" [...] and [...] "effortlessly {{balanced}} ... Brett Pawlak's handheld camerawork and Cretton's unsentimental direction have a frankness that acknowledges the dramatic extremes in these lives without needing to parade {{it before the}} audience." [...] Manohla Dargis from The New York Times also praised Cretton's direction, saying he [...] "brings you into this coed group home {{and the lives of}} its inhabitants casually, with images and scenes that, no matter how transparently considered, <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had been caught on the fly." ...|$|E
