25|$|Dairy cattle housing systems {{vary greatly}} {{throughout}} the world depending on the climate, dairy size, and feeding strategies. Housing must provide access to feed, water and protection from relevant environmental conditions. One obvious issue for humanely housing cattle is temperature extremes. Heat stress can decrease fertility and milk production in cattle. Providing shade is a very common method for reducing heat stress. Barns may also incorporate fans or tunnel ventilation into {{the architecture of the}} barn structure. Overly cold conditions, while rarely deadly for cattle, cause increases in maintenance energy requirements and thus increased <b>feed</b> <b>intake</b> and decreased milk production. During the winter months, where temperatures are low enough, dairy cattle are often kept inside barns which are warmed by their collective body heat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{costs of}} beak {{trimming}} relate primarily to welfare concerns. [...] These include acute stress, and acute, possibly chronic, pain following trimming. A bird’s ability to consume feed is impaired following beak trimming {{because of the}} new beak shape and pain. [...] Most studies report reduced body weights and <b>feed</b> <b>intake</b> following beak trimming, however, by sexual maturity or peak egg production, growth rates are usually normal. [...] Weight losses were reduced in chicks that were beak trimmed by infrared compared with chicks trimmed by a hot-blade.|$|E
2500|$|The beak is a complex, {{functional}} organ with {{an extensive}} nervous supply including nociceptors that sense pain and noxious stimuli. [...] These {{would almost certainly}} be stimulated during beak trimming, indicating strongly that acute pain would be experienced. Behavioural evidence of pain after beak trimming in layer hen chicks {{has been based on}} the observed reduction in pecking behavior, reduced activity and social behavior, and increased sleep duration. [...] In Japanese quail, beak-trimming by cauterization caused lower body weights and <b>feed</b> <b>intake</b> in the period just after beak trimming. [...] Beak trimmed Muscovy ducks spent less time engaging in beak-related behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2 weeks post-trim. [...] It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak. [...] Pecking force has been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{aromatic}} ingredients, phytogenics add flavor to feed, thereby increasing feed palatability.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to know the {{roughage}} concentrate ratio and the fiber ratio of the <b>feeds</b> <b>intaked</b> by steers voluntarily in the free access to soilage and concentrate respectively. As roughage, soilage of Italian ryegrass {{was used in the}} experimental period covering 12 days, and rice straw was used in the control period covering 12 days. The concentrate used was a commercial mixture of grains for fattening cattle. Seven steers of the Holstein breed were employed in this study, averaging 13 months old in age and 435 kg in body weight. They were allowed to eat freely roughage and concentrate ad libitum respectively The fiber ratio of the <b>feed</b> <b>intaked</b> was 7. 1 in experimental period (Italian ryegrass period) and 7. 6 in the control period. The fiber ratio in the experimental period was lower than that in the control period. This difference seems to be due to physical condition of the rougrhage. The fiber ratios in the <b>feeds</b> <b>intaked</b> by the steers voluntarily were around 7. 5. It was proved again that the fiber ratio in the range of 7 to 8 will meet steer's physiological requirement...|$|R

50|$|Phosphorus is {{particularly}} important both {{for the growth of}} tagasaste and for the growth of the animals grazing on it. Higher levels of phosphorus are required for the maximum growth of the animals than for maximum plant growth. Fertiliser will also reduce the level of phenolic compounds (similar to tannins) that increase when the plants are moisture stressed. These phenolic compounds make the tagasaste less palatable and reduce the animals' <b>feed</b> <b>intake.</b> The phenolics suppress the utilisation of protein in the rumen, and as a result <b>feed</b> <b>intake.</b> Despite the crude protein always being above 14%, supplementing with a high-protein feed like lupin seed stimulates animal <b>feed</b> <b>intake</b> when phenolics are high in tagasaste. Tagasaste typically has the same nutritional value as the best type of Alfalfa when planted on good soil balanced in nutrients. Daily weight gains of 1 to 1.5kg per steer per day are achieved during the growing season, with 6-10 rotations per year, typically one every 6=8 weeks.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the activities of}} four groups of four sows, allocated {{to one of two}} space allocations, in a novel farrowing system design, over parturition and during lactation. The two pen configurations provided 13. 4 m² (L) and 8. 6 m² (S) per sow, respectively. A lactation diet providing 14 MJ/kg DE and 18 % CP was supplied ad libitum via a sow operated feeder, adapted to facilitate the calculation of individual <b>feed</b> <b>intakes.</b> The influence of environmental, physical, management and production factors upon the way in which sows allocated their time to different activities, suckling behaviour, <b>feed</b> <b>intakes</b> and <b>feeding</b> and drinking strategies was investigated. Sows in the small pen area were generally less active than those housed in the large pen configuration. During the first week of lactation, significantly more time was spent lying down (P< 0. 05) and fewer transitions were made between postures (P< 0. 001) in the reduced space allocation. Sows in the S pen configuration suckled their piglets significantly more frequently than sows in the L pen area (P< 0. 001). However, similar daily piglet weight gains were achieved in both the L and S pen configurations. Daily <b>feed</b> <b>intakes</b> of 7. 69 kg (s. e. 0. 31) and 7. 72 kg (s. e. 0. 35) were achieved during lactation, by sows in the L and S pen configurations, respectively. This was accomplished by sows taking a series of small feeds throughout the day. Sows in the S pen area made fewer visits to the feeder and spent less time per day feeding, compared with sows in the L pen area. However, more feed was consumed per visit by the S sows, resulting in similar daily <b>feed</b> <b>intakes</b> in both treatment groups. A marked increase in activity during the 24 hours prior to parturition was followed by a sharp reduction during day 1 of lactation in both treatment groups. Thereafter, activity levels increased gradually during week 1 of lactation. Most piglet deaths occurred in early lactation, 65. 0 % and 67. 9 % of which were during days 1 to 3 following birth in the L and S pen areas, respectively. Mortality of live-born piglets was unacceptably high at 19. 6 % in the L and 24. 6 % in the S pen areas. The relative advantages and disadvantages to sows and piglets within the novel farrowing system are considered in the general discussion...|$|R

Twenty-four yearling Tibetan sheep (25. 29 ± 3. 95 kg LW) and twenty two-year-old yaks (100. 62 ± 4. 55 kg LW) with familiar body conditions {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups, fed oats hay (OH), oats silage (OS), total mixed ration (TMR) and traditionally grazed on the local cool-season pasture (TG), respectively, over a 135 -day experiment.

For milk production the six Holstein herds produced an average of 70. 925 lbs of energy corrected milk, while the four Jersey herds produced an average of 73. 688 lbs of energy corrected milk. For <b>feed</b> <b>intakes</b> the six Holstein herds consumed an average of 52. 417 lbs per milking cow, while the four Jersey herds consumed an average of 45. 094 lbs of feed per milking cow for the year 2012. For feed efficiency, the Holstein dairies had 1. 353 lbs of milk produced per pound of dry matter (DM) consumed. For the Jersey breed, the dairies reported an average feed efficiency of 1. 635. Feed costs for the dairies were also observed. Feed costs per day per milking cow on the six Holstein dairies resulted in $ 7. 66 compared to $ 7. 45 for the four Jersey dairies. Another feed cost that was determined was the cost per hundred weight of milk. The Holstein dairies had a $ 10. 85 average on feed cost per hundred weight, while the Jersey dairies had a $ 10. 12 average on feed cost per hundred weight. As well as the information from the dairies, I constructed spread sheets to compare different prices of milk income for different cooperatives. Premiums were observed and milk quality bonuses were plugged into spread sheets for different cooperatives in California to see which ones were more beneficial to ship milk to. Information from this study was very hard to draw conclusions with, because of different factors that go into how cooperatives pay dairymen. With this information, I will determine if there is a sound advantage between milking a Jersey herd or a Holstein herd on a commercial size dairy in California...|$|R

The growth rates of the lambs fed the treated diets were higher than those fed the untreated diets in all cases, but the differences were not statistically significant. <b>Feed</b> <b>intakes</b> were highest with the diets containing linseed meal (P< 0. 0 5). The wool growth rates of lambs fed the treated diets were higher than those fed the untreated diets, but the difference was significant only {{in the case of the}} wheat diet (PC 0. 05). Increasing the level of the protein meals in the diets to 20; (about 15. 8 % CP) resulted in increased rates of weight gain with the untreated diets but decreased weight gains and <b>feed</b> <b>intakes</b> in the case of the treated diets.

Investigation into methods of applying formalin to hammermilled wheat showed that neither the dilution of the applied formalin nor the air temperature at the time of application had any marked effect on the amount of formaldehyde bound. The use of unsealed containers for storage of the wheat immediately after treatment caused a reduction in the amount of formaldehyde bound. Pelleting of treated wheat stored for two weeks in sealed plastic bags did not result in losses of bound formaldehyde, but considerable losses occurred when the pelleted material was subsequently stored in hessian bags for a further ten weeks.
