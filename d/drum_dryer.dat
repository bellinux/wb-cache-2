50|$|Drying drum, {{also named}} <b>drum</b> <b>dryer,</b> is a machine for drying process, which people call drum drying.

The drums were lifted {{to the top}} of the building by a skip hoist where they were emptied into a surge hopper that feeds the magnetic separator and jaw crusher. From the jaw crusher, the one-half inch material passes through a rotary <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> to a system of conveyors, which conveys the material to a surge hopper that feeds the ring roll mill. The particle size output from the mill was controlled to about 100 mesh by an air classifier mounted directly on the mill. The undersized material was blown to a cyclone separator that was mounted directly above the first Gallagher sampler. The three Gallagher samplers in series each took a 10% cut of the stream fed to it, producing a sample approximately 0.1% of the original lot size.

40|$|SummarySince {{early twentieth}} century, <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> {{was used to}} dry clothes, and soon became a glowing industry. A <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> is a {{household}} appliance {{that is used to}} remove moisture from a load of clothing and other textiles, generally At the beginning a simple electrical <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> was used, then different development has been made for meeting different needs and changing industrial environment, such as spin dryer, condenser dryer, heat pump dryer etc. The working mechanism of a <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> is that clothes is dried by heated air in a rotating drum: the heated air absorbs water evaporated from the wet clothes, so that the clothes is dried. The rotating drum is due to maintaining air space both between the load and between the loads and the drum surface. The way of how the air is heated and how the water is condensed is of interest. A heat pump dryer has the potential for energy saving and is good for environment. ASKO has developed to types of heat pump using different refrigerant: R 134 a and R 744. This project will focus on the application of a CO 2 (R 744) heat pump. A prototype has already been built, an assumption was made from former project that more cooling after compression for the refrigerant will be beneficial for increasing the energy efficiency of the whole system. So new external gas coolers will be installed and some optimization and analysis will be made for this project. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract−The {{effects of}} flow rates {{of hot air}} and cooling water on drying {{percentage}} and energy efficiency of cotton lint in a cylindrical type <b>drum</b> tumbler <b>dryer</b> (0. 54 m-ID× 0. 34 m-high) have been determined. Drying of the lint is mainly affected by flow rate of hot air, which {{is a function of}} the diameter ratio (D M /D F) of motor and fan pulley and motor capacity. During the drying process in the tumbler dryer, temperatures and humidity before and after were measured to determine the drying characteristics. The volumetric flow rate of hot air increases with increasing the diameter ratio of the motor and fan pulley, whereas the volumetric flow rate of hot air decreases with an increase in the mass flow rate of the cooling water through the condenser. The energy consumed by the motor relied more on the diameter ratio of the motor and fan pulley as opposed to the mass flow rate of cooling water. Despite the increase in the drying per-centage with increasing the diameter ratio of the motor and fan pulley and the mass flow rate of the cooling water, the energy efficiency decreased...|$|R
40|$|In {{composite}} agricultural {{materials such}} as grass, tee, medicinal plants; leaves and stems have a different drying time. By this behavior, after leaving the dryer, the stems may have greater moisture content than desired, while the leaves one minor, which can cause either the appearance of fungi or {{the collapse of the}} over-dried material. Taking into account that a lot of grass is dehydrated in forced air <b>dryers,</b> especially rotary <b>drum</b> <b>dryers,</b> this research was developed in order to establish conditions enabling to make a separation of the components during the drying process in order to provide a homogeneous product at the end. For this, a rotary dryer consisting of three concentric cylinders and a circular sieve aligned with the more internal cylinder was proposed; so that, once material enters into the dryer {{in the area of the}} inner cylinder, stems pass through sieve to the middle and then continue towards the external cylinder, while the leaves continue by the inner cylinder. For this project, a mixture of Ryegrass and White Clover was used. The characteristics of the components of a mixture were: Drying Rate in thin layer and in rotation, Bulk density, Projected Area, Terminal velocity, weight/Area Ratio, Flux through Rotary sieve. Three drying temperatures; 40 °C, 60 ° C and 80 ° C, and three rotation speeds; 10 rpm, 20 rpm and 40 rpm were evaluated. It was found that the differences in drying time are the less at 80 °C when the dryer rotates at 40 rpm. Above this speed, the material adheres to the walls of the dryer or sieve and does not flow. According to the measurements of terminal velocity of stems and leaves of the components of the mixture, the speed of the air should be less than 1. 5 m s- 1 in the inner drum for the leaves and less than 4. 5 m s- 1 in middle and outer drums for stems, in such way that only the rotational movement of the dryer moves the material and achieves a greater residence time. In other hand, the best rotary sieve separation efficiencies were achieved when the material is dry, but the results are good in all the moisture contents. The best rotary speed of sieve is within the critical rotational speed, i. e. 20 rpm. However, the rotational speed of the dryer, including the sieve in line with the inner cylinder should be 10 rpm or less in order to achieve the greatest residence times of the material inside the dryer and the best agitation through the use of lifting flights. With a finite element analysis of a dryer prototype, using an air flow allowing speeds of air already stated, I was found that the best performance occurs when, through a cover, air enters the dryer front of the Middle cylinder and when the inner cylinder is formed in its entirety through a sieve. This way, air flows in almost equal amounts by both the middle and external cylinders, while part of the air in the Middle cylinder passes through the sieve towards the inner cylinder. With this, leaves do not adhere to the sieve and flow along drier, thanks to the rotating movement of the drums and the showering caused by the lifting flights. In these conditions, the differences in drying time are reduced to 60 minutes, but the residence time is higher for the stems than for leaves, therefore the components of the mixture of grass run out of the dryer with the same desired moisture content.

40|$|Cogeneration in the Australian sugar {{industry}} {{has the potential}} to provide significant environmental and economic benefits. Central to increasing cogenerated energy output is the use of bagasse drying to improve boiler efficiency. In a previous numerical study, pre-drying of bagasse from 50 % moisture to 30 % moisture using waste flue gas was shown to deliver up to 16 % reduction in bagasse usage and up to 24 % increase in specific steam production. Across the world both flighted rotary dryers and flash dryers have been used to dry bagasse fibre for enhanced boiler operation. In this paper, the design and preliminary costing of a flighted rotary dryer processing 50 t/h of Burdekin bagasse fibre from 50 % moisture to 38 % moisture using waste flue gas is described. Operational scenarios, such as the effect of varying flue gas temperature on dryer design, are evaluated. Key design data such as the drying rate and bagasse angle of repose were determined by experiments using a Spencer oven and pilot scale rotary dryer, respectively. The development and use of a multi-scale compartment model for sizing the dryer is described. In this model, the impact of flight and <b>drum</b> geometry on <b>dryer</b> loading and dryer design were directly accounted for. The results of this investigation showed that both energy and material costs of a dryer are highly dependent on the loading state and material properties such as angle of repose and bulk density. A new design methodology which used simulated trails with variable dryer loading states showed a distinct minimum in costs occurring {{at the point where the}} particular dryer was operating closest to its design loading. The optimum flighted rotary bagasse dryer design was found by minimising total cost (electrical energy and raw material requirements), and was shown to occur at design loading.
