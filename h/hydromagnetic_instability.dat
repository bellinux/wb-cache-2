40|$|The {{stability}} of ion shell distribution {{is an interesting}} and important issue {{in view of the}} fact that it is stable under perturbations propagating parallel to the ambient magnetic field, despite large amount of free energy it contains. It was found, however, that if the shell distribution of ions has a sufficient amount of drift speed with respect to the solar wind hydromagnetic waves, it can become unstable. The obliquely propagating <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> associated with the ion shell distribution was recently discovered. This letter presents the unified stability analysis of the ion shell distribution, under what condition the drift-induced in{{stability of}} the type first discussed by Gary and Sinha (1989), and the oblique <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> discussed by Wu and Yoon (1990) are excited, and how the two types of instabilities are related...|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the fragmentation of the expanding shock wave from a supernova to form stellar clusters is considered. A model of supernova shell expansion is constructed in which the ratio of magnetic field intensity to gas density remains constant during the one-dimensional compression of the interstellar medium by the shock, and the gas and field adjust to a quasi-equilibrium within the shell following shock passage. It is shown that the quasi-equilibrium, which may be considered as an isothermal atmosphere, is unstable to a <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> representing a form of the Parker instability, which results in a clumping of gas at intervals {{on the order of}} parsecs. The length and time scales of the instability are consistent with the clustering of newly formed stars observed in Canis Major R 1, where there is evidence for supernova-induced star formation...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model based on <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> (including Alfven firehose and magnetoacoustic mirror instabilities), {{in the region}} where the electrons are in the transition from collisional to collisionless and ions are in the collisionless region, is proposed as a possible wave emission mechanism for Pc- 1 pulsations. The model is compared with recent observations with good agreement between the theory and observations, especially for an emission source located at a distance L less than 5. Furthermore, a suggestion is made that the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> could be relevant to the night and early morning hours emissions while the ion cyclotron instabilities could {{be responsible for the}} daytime emission of Pc- 1 pulsations...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} entry modes were {{investigated}} {{to determine whether}} most of the accreting plasma enters the magnetosphere {{as a result of}} <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> or via other means. It is shown that diffusion is never important under the conditions of interest, nor is the loss-cone entry through the polar cusps when the plasma is collisionless. Although the loss-cone entry rate can be significantly increased if the plasma in the cusps cools and becomes collisional, this cannot stabilize the magnetosphere. The descent of the cusps cannot be the dominant entry process if the star has a persistent luminosity greater than about 10 to the 36 th erg/s and a substantial fraction of the magnetosphere is illuminated. This, however, can be a significant entry process for much lower luminosities or strongly anisotropic illumination. The possibility that plasma entry via reconnection can stabilize the magnetosphere is also unlikely...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{physical}} interpretation of Elie Cartan three-dimensional space torsion as couple asymmetric stress, {{has the effect of}} damping, previously Riemannian unstable Couette planar shear flow, leading to stability of the flow in the Lagrangean sense. Actually, since the flow speed is inversely proportional to torsion, it has the effect of causing a damping in the planar flow atenuating the instability effect. In this sense we may say that Cartan torsion induces shear viscous asymmetric stresses in the fluid, which are able to damp the instability of the flow. The stability of the flow is computed from the sectional curvature in non-Riemannian three-dimensional manifold. Marginal stability is asssumed by making the sectional non-Riemannian curvature zero, which allows us to determine the speeds of flows able to induce this stability. The ideas discussed here show that torsion plays the geometrical role of magnetic field in <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> of Couette flows recently investigated by Bonnano and Urpin (PRE, (2007,in press) can be extended and applied to plastic flows with microstructure defects. Recently Riemannian asymmetric stresses in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) have been considered by Billig (2004). Comment: Departamento de Fisica Teorica-UER...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that in a {{hydrodynamic}} Taylor-Couette system uniform rotation or a rotation law with positive shear ('super-rotation') are linearly stable. It is also known that a conducting fluid under {{the presence of a}} sufficiently strong axial electric-current becomes unstable against nonaxisymmetric disturbances. It is thus suggestive that a cylindric pinch formed by a homogeneous axial electric-current is stabilized by rotation laws with dΩ/dR ≥ 0. However, for magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm≠ 1 and for slow rotation also rigid rotation and super-rotation support the instability by lowering their critical Hartmann numbers. For super-rotation in narrow gaps and for modest rotation rates this double-diffusive instability even exists for toroidal magnetic fields with rather arbitrary radial profiles, the current-free profile B_ϕ∝ 1 /R included. For rigid rotation and for super-rotation the sign of the azimuthal drift of the nonaxisymmetric <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> pattern strongly depends on the magnetic Prandtl number. The pattern counterrotates with the flow for Pm≪ 1 and it corotates for Pm≫ 1 while for rotation laws with negative shear the instability pattern migrates {{in the direction of the}} basic rotation for all Pm. An axial electric-current of minimal 3. 6 kAmp flowing inside or outside the inner cylinder suffices to realize the double-diffusive instability for super-rotation in experiments using liquid sodium as the conducting fluid between the rotating cylinders. The limit is 11 kAmp if a gallium alloy is used. Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Po...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of electromagnetic instabilities in nonuniform plasmas are analyzed, {{taking into account}} the anisotropy in temperature and temperature gradients. It is shown that resonance-type drift instabilities can be produced in nonuniform plasmas by resonant interactions between ions or electrons and plasma drift waves when the temperature anisotropy and temperature gradients vary widely. In contrast, production of off-resonance type instabilities is found to be possible only when the temperature gradients are much greater than the magnetic field gradients. It is pointed out that these findings are applicable to solar wind plasmas with <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> and shock transition regions. Attention is given to the occurrence of resonance ion instabilities and off-resonance drift cyclotron instabilities in the solar wind...|$|R

We measure {{the growth rate of}} the instability as a function of field strength and rotation rate Ω, and investigate the effects of a stabilising thermal stratification as well as magnetic and thermal diffusion on the stability.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a simple model {{consisting}} of a dilute fully ionized plasma {{in the presence of}} the gravitational and a constant magnetic field to analyze the propagation of <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instabilities.</b> In particular we show that the so called Jeans instability is in principle affected by the presence of the magnetic field. A brief discussion is made attempting to assess this influence in the stage of the evolution of the Universe where structures were formed. The most logical conclusion is that if magnetic fields existed in those times their magnitudes were too small to modify Jeans' mass. Our results places limits of the possible values of seed magnetic fields consistent with the formation structures in the Universe. These values are within the range of the results obtained by other authors. Comment: 5 pages, no figures. Updated reference...|$|R
40|$|The linear {{stability}} of MHD Taylor-Couette flow of infinite vertical extension is considered for liquid sodium with its small magnetic Prandtl number Pm of order of 10 ^- 5 and an uniform axial magnetic field. The {{sign of the}} constant a in the basic rotation law Ω=a+b/R^ 2 strongly influences the presented results. It is negative for resting outer cylinder. The main {{point here is that}} the subcritical excitation which occurs for large Pm disappears for small Pm. This is the reason that the existence of the magnetorotational instability remained unknown over decades. For rotating outer cylinder the limiting case a= 0 plays an exceptional role. The <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> exists with certain Reynolds numbers at certain Hartmann numbers of the magnetic field. These Reynolds numbers exactly scale with Pm^- 1 / 2 resulting in moderate values of order 10 ^ 4 for Pm= 10 ^- 5. However, already for the smallest positive value of a the Reynolds numbers start to scale as 1 /Pm leading to much higher values of order 10 ^ 6 for Pm= 10 ^- 5. Also nonaxisymmetric modes have been considered. With vacuum boundary conditions their excitation is always more difficult than the excitation of axisymmetric modes; we never observed a crossover of the lines of marginal stability. For conducting walls, however, such crossovers exist for both resting and rotating outer cylinders, and this might be essential for future dynamo experiments.

40|$|This work {{presents}} an extensive {{study of the}} previously discovered formation of bipolar flux concentrations in a two-layer model. We interpret the formation process in terms of negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI), which is a possible mechanism to explain the origin of sunspots. In our simulations, we use a Cartesian domain of isothermal stratified gas that {{is divided into two}} layers. In the lower layer, turbulence is forced with transverse nonhelical random waves, whereas in the upper layer no flow is induced. A weak uniform magnetic field is imposed in the entire domain at all times. In this study we vary the stratification by changing the gravitational acceleration, magnetic Reynolds number, strength of the imposed magnetic field, and size of the domain to investigate their influence on the formation process. Bipolar magnetic structure formation takes place over a large range of parameters. The magnetic structures become more intense for higher stratification until the density contrast becomes around $ 100 $ across the turbulent layer. For the Reynolds numbers considered, magnetic flux concentrations are generated at magnetic Prandtl number between 0. 1 and 1. The magnetic field in bipolar regions increases with higher imposed field strength until the field becomes comparable to the equipartition field strength of the turbulence. A larger horizontal extent enables the flux concentrations to become stronger and more coherent. The size of the bipolar structures turns out to be independent of the domain size. In the case of bipolar region formation, we find an exponential growth of the large-scale magnetic field, which is indicative of a <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instability.</b> Additionally, the flux concentrations are correlated with strong large-scale downward and converging flows. These findings imply that NEMPI is responsible for magnetic flux concentrations. Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures, Astronomy and Astrophysics, publishe...|$|E
40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} the saturation of the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> of a magnetized spherical Couette flow. Previous simulations [Hollerbach, 2009] demonstrated region where the axisymmetric flow, calculated from a 2 -D simulation, was linearly unstable to nonaxisymmetric perturbations. Full, nonlinear, 3 d simulations [Hollerbach 2009, Travnikov 2011] {{showed that the}} saturated state would consist only of harmonics of one azimuthal wave number, though there were bifurcations and transitions as nondimensional parameters (Re, Ha) were varied. Here, the energy transfer between different aziumthal modes is formulated as a network. This demonstrates a mechanism or the saturation of one mode and for the suppression of other unstable modes. A given mode grows by extracting energy from the axisymmetric flow, and then saturates as the energy transfer to its second harmonic equals this inflow. At the same time, this mode suppresses other unstable modes by facilitating an energy transfer to linearly stable modes. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|Are giant flares in magnetars viable {{sources of}} {{gravitational}} radiation? Few theoretical {{studies have been}} concerned with this problem, with the small number using either highly idealized models or assuming a magnetic field orders of magnitude beyond what is supported by observations. We perform nonlinear general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of large-scale <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> in magnetar models. We utilise these models to find gravitational wave emissions {{over a wide range}} of energies, from 10 ^ 40 to 10 ^ 47 erg. This allows us to derive a systematic relationship between the surface field strength and the gravitational wave strain, which we find to be highly nonlinear. In particular, for typical magnetar fields of a few times 10 ^ 15 G, we conclude that a direct observation of f-modes excited by global magnetic field reconfigurations is unlikely with present or near-future gravitational wave observatories, though we also discuss the possibility that modes in a low-frequency band up to 100 Hz could be sufficiently excited to be relevant for observation.

40|$|At {{this first}} {{opportunity}} for open scientific dis-cussions {{on this subject}} we look forward with eagerness to exchanging experiences with others and hearing of the courses taken towards the common goal in the various laboratories of the world. Early Development At this laboratory, the peculiarly intriguing {{nature of the problem}} and the admirable consequences of its solution have long been recognized. Lively discussions of such matters as plasma drift in a torus and its effect on achieving a laboratory thermonuclear reac-tion occurred between Fermi, Kerst, Landshoff, Teller, R. R. Wilson and the writer in 1946, and an unsuccessful search for neutrons from colliding Munroe jets of metal deuterides was made at about the same time, based on an earlier paper by Ulam and the writer. When the subject was reopened in 1951, the toroidal pinch (as proposed, with a superimposed Bz field, by the writer in 1948) was selected as the confinement geometry for initial study and it passed through the usual vicissitudes and modifications— instability, linear dynamic pinches (Columbus), rf pinches, so called Bz and wall stabilized pinches; while parallel speculations and experimental forays were made into cusped geometries (Picket Fence), spinning plasmas, shocks in axial and convergent geometries and magnetic mirrors. Our ideas and plans have undergone profound changes during the last seven years and are in process of undergoing another. As little as half a year ago, the chief obstacle to the achievement of a thermonuclear reaction via the stabilized pinch appeared to be contamination of the plasma by foreign atoms sputtered or evaporated off the walls. Doubtless this particular obstacle is still there, but in the meantime a crevasse has opened at our feet, in the form of our new experimental observa-tions of high energy losses from the pinched plasma. If these turn out to be due to the newly predicted surface <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> then we know how to overcome these and the outlook may be better than ever.
