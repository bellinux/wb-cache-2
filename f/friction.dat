40|$|Costly state {{verification}} models {{predict that}} the sensitivity of borrowing costs to financial leverage is positively related {{to the level of}} state verification costs (financial <b>frictions).</b> This paper constructs a measure of financial <b>frictions</b> that is consistent with this prediction of theory. Using bond deals from 47 countries, financial <b>frictions</b> are captured as the sensitivity of bond spreads to the issuing firms' financial leverage. This dynamic measure of financial <b>frictions</b> provides new insights into three characteristics of financial <b>frictions.</b> 1) In contrast to the inferences from widely-used measures, financial <b>frictions</b> display a large degree of variability, and have decreased over time. 2) The effect of financial <b>frictions</b> on private credit supply has decreased both in significance and magnitude over time. 3) Bankruptcy reforms, in general have not been effective in improving creditor/borrower rights. financial <b>frictions,</b> leverage sensitivity, financial accelerator, bond deals. ...|$|R

Uncertainty about the degree of financial <b>frictions</b> is modelled as Markov switching between regimes without and with strong financial <b>frictions.</b> Optimal monetary policy is determined for different scenarios of permanent and temporary regime shifts in financial <b>frictions,</b> as well as for variations in financial <b>frictions</b> over the business cycle. Optimal monetary policy is found to be state-dependent. In each state, optimal monetary policy depends on the transition probabilities between the different regimes.

5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static <b>friction,</b> generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static <b>friction</b> force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static <b>friction</b> increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|Reducing <b>friction</b> {{is vital}} for {{minimizing}} wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of <b>friction</b> mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce <b>friction</b> at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, <b>friction</b> is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low <b>friction</b> coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E

40|$|Defined {{simply as}} {{anything}} that interferes with trade, financial market <b>frictions</b> can exist even in efficient markets. Understanding financial market <b>frictions</b> is important, this article argues, because they generate real costs to investors, because they generate business opportunities, {{and because they}} change over time. Financial market <b>frictions</b> depend in part on market structure. Market structure tends to evolve over time, as trading volume increases, from low fixed costs and high marginal costs to high fixed costs and low marginal costs. To help identify the best means of reducing market <b>frictions</b> costs, the authors classify and discuss five primary categories of frictions: transactions costs, taxes and regulations, asset indivisibility, nontraded assets, and agency and information problems. Looking for evidence of how <b>frictions</b> influence market participants behavior, the authors not only review the economic literature but also conduct an empirical exercise to illustrate and quantify <b>frictions</b> impact on investors risk-return trade-off. Their results show that market <b>frictions</b> impose utility costs on investors by making preferable investment portfolios unattainable. Their findings and other academic studies also suggest that investors who ignore market <b>frictions</b> compound the harm done by the <b>frictions</b> themselves...|$|R
40|$|This survey gives {{insight into}} the ongoing {{research}} in financial <b>frictions</b> modeling. The recent financial turmoil has fueled interest in operationalizing financial <b>frictions</b> concepts and introducing them into tools for policy makers. The rapid growth {{of the literature on}} these issues is the motivation for our review of the presented approaches. The empirical facts that motivate the inclusion of financial <b>frictions</b> are surveyed. This survey provides a description of the basic approaches for introducing financial <b>frictions</b> into dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. The significance and empirical identification of the financial accelerator effect is then discussed. The role of financial <b>frictions</b> models in CNB monetary and macroprudential policy is also described. It is concluded that given the heterogeneity of the approaches to financial <b>frictions</b> it is beneficial for the conduct of monetary policy to focus on the development of satellite approaches. The role of financial <b>frictions</b> in DSGE models for macroprudential policy is also discussed, as these models can be used to generate stress-testing scenarios. It can be concluded that DSGE models with financial <b>frictions</b> could complement current stress-testing practice, but are not able to replace stress tests.

5|$|The surface <b>friction</b> tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} {{attached}} to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the <b>friction</b> between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface <b>friction</b> testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface <b>friction</b> data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface <b>friction</b> testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface <b>friction</b> tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare {{production}} inefficiencies in bilateral meetings generated by {{two types of}} trading frictions: double-coincidence <b>frictions</b> and information <b>frictions.</b> For both types of <b>frictions,</b> money enlarges the sets of incentive-feasible allocations relative to barter. In environments with double-coincidence <b>frictions,</b> the first-best allocation is incentive-feasible if the real stock of money is sufficiently high. In contrast, in environements with information <b>frictions,</b> the first-best allocation is never incentivefeasible regardless of the real stock of money.

5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin <b>friction,</b> which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin <b>friction</b> also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin <b>friction</b> is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin <b>friction</b> from induced turbulence.|$|E

Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and empirically tests a model {{designed to}} distinguish the role of real and â€¦nancing <b>frictions</b> on â€¦rmsâ€™investment, debt â€¦nancing and equity â€¦nancing policies. Real <b>frictions</b> include â€¦xed costs of investment and adjustment costs. Financing <b>frictions</b> include taxes, collateral constraints, â€¡otation costs of equity and dividend constraints. Because of â€¦nancing <b>frictions,</b> all corporate policies are interrelated and depend on average Q. Due to â€¦xed costs of investment and binding â€¦nancing constraints, the sensitivity of corporate policies to Q is non-linear. The empirical tests demonstrate that both the endogeneity and non-linearities created by real and â€¦nancing <b>frictions</b> are economically signiâ€¦cant.
