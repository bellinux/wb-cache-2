40|$|AbstractStereoscopic {{corrugation}} detection in {{the presence}} of horizontal- and vertical- additive disparity noise was examined using a signal detection paradigm. Random-dot stereograms either represented a 3 -D square-wave surface with various amounts of Gaussian-distributed additive disparity noise or had the same disparity values randomly redistributed. Stereoscopic detection of 2 arcmin peak amplitude corrugations was found to tolerate significantly greater amplitudes of vertical-disparity noise than horizontal-disparity noise—irrespective of whether the corrugations were horizontally or vertically oriented. However, this directional difference in tolerance to disparity noise was found to reverse when the corrugation and noise amplitudes were increased (so as to produce <b>equivalent</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios).</b> These results suggest that horizontal- and vertical-disparity noise pose different problems for dot-matching and post-matching surface reconstruction as corrugation and noise amplitudes increase...|$|R

30|$|While it {{has been}} proved that in buffer-aided {{relaying}} systems, the MLS schemes can provide both the diversity and coding gains over the T-BRS and MMLS schemes when the all relay channels obey the i.i.d fading, the corresponding diversity and delay performance of the MLS schemes have not been reported when the relay channels experience the practical i.ni.d fading. Thus, in this paper, the MLS schemes are investigated over the i.ni.d Nakgami-m channels. By employing Markov chain model, the statistical descriptions of the MLS schemes are achieved firstly. Then, with the derived statistical descriptions, the average packet delays are investigated over the i.ni.d Nakgami-m fading channels. The obtained {{results show that the}} non-identically distributed relay links impose a severe loss in the diversity and coding gains for the MLS schemes. Moreover, when the disparity of the powers of relay links is very large, the MLS schemes no longer provide any diversity gain over the T-BRS and MMLS ones even if the buffers’ size is enough large. However, when the disparity of the powers of relay links is little relatively, the enough diversity and coding gains can be still provided by the MLS schemes. For the average packet delays, it is achieved that under the i.ni.d fading channels, the average packet delays at all relays are different. The results indicate that at some relays, the average packet delays can be very large, and at other relays, they are small. This phenomenon yields that at some relays, the data packets would be trapped {{for a long time and}} the relay systems with MLS schemes are unstable. However, it is enough lucky that when the powers of S-R links are less than the ones of R-D links, the average packet delays are reduced evidently. Inspired this observation, a W-MLS diversity-delay trade-off scheme is proposed to reduce the delay and to enhance the stability of MLS schemes but still obtain the enough diversity and coding gains over T-BRS and MMLS schemes. In the proposed W-MLS schemes, before selecting a best link, the systems multiply the link gains by a weight vector, such that the <b>equivalent</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> of S-R links are same, so does the ones of R-D links, such that the data packet delays at all relays are same. By adjusting the weight vector, it is guaranteed that the equivalent SNRs of R-D links are greater than the ones of S-R links, such that the delays can be decreased evidently. Moreover, by designing feasible weight vector, the W-MLS can still provide the enough diversity and coding gains.|$|R

A linear analysis of the limits to the quantiser gain and feedback parameter is presented.

The moti-vation {{is to provide}} a cheap radio network with simple receivers and sophisticated transmitters. The energy detector receiver performs relatively poorly, but waveform-level precoding can be used to compensate for the performance loss. Waveform-level precoding is a transmitter-side processing taking advantage of known channel information. Given channel impulse response (CIR), transmitted waveform can be optimized in some crite-rion. In this paper the optimization goal is to maximize an <b>equivalent</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SNR) at the receiver, assuming no inter-symbol-interference (ISI).

The sensitivity index, d′, was measured for discriminations between a number of fixed pairs of correlation values. Cumulative d′ functions were derived for each frequency and condition. The d′ for discriminating any two values of correlation may be recovered from the cumulative d′ function by the difference between cumulative d′’s for these values. Two conditions were employed: the noisebands were either presented in isolation (narrow-band condition) or {{in the context of}} broad, contiguous flanking bands of correlated noise (fringed condition). The cumulative d′ functions showed greater sensitivity {{to differences}} in correlation close to 1 than close to 0 at low frequencies, but this difference was less pronounced in the fringed condition. Also, a more linear relationship was observed when cumulative d′ was plotted {{as a function of the}} <b>equivalent</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SNR) in dB for each correlation value, rather than directly against correlation. The equivalent SNR was the SNR at which the interaural correlation in an NoSπ stimulus would equal the interaural correlation of the noise used in the experiment. The maximum cumulative d′ declined above 750 Hz. This decline was steeper for the fringed than for the narrow-band condition. For the narrow-band condition, the total cumulative d′ was variable across listeners. All cumulative d′ functions were closely fitted using a simple two-parameter function. The complete data sets, averaged across listeners, from the fringed and narrow-band conditions were fitted using functions to describe the changes in these parameters over frequency, in order to produce an interpolated family of curves that describe sensitivity at frequencies between those tested.
