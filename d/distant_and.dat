5|$|Evidence for {{the early}} {{appearance}} of galaxies was found in 2006, when {{it was discovered that}} the galaxy IOK-1 has an unusually high redshift of 6.96, corresponding to just 750 million years after the Big Bang and making it the most <b>distant</b> <b>and</b> primordial galaxy yet seen.|$|E
5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly <b>distant</b> <b>and</b> faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E

40|$|One in {{four people}} suffers from chronic {{musculoskeletal}} pain (CMP). Acupuncture points stimulation is increasingly used for pain relief for CMP. Commonly, {{a combination of}} local <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> points is used. However, {{the difference between the}} effects of local <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> point stimulation is unknown. This systematic review aimed to determine if there was a difference in effects between stimulating local <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> points, <b>and</b> the combination of both when compared with either alone. English and Chinese electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials, where local or distant points were stimulated in adults with CMP. Pain intensity was the primary outcome measure. Nineteen were included in the qualitative analysis and 15 in the meta-analysis. Local <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> point stimulation was more effective than their respective controls in pain reduction immediately after treatment. Three studies directly compared the stimulation of local <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> points <b>and</b> found {{no significant difference between the}} two. No studies compared combined local <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> point stimulation with either alone. Subgroup analyses showed that, local tender point stimulation was more effective than local acupuncture points. Local <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> point stimulation induces similar degree of acupuncture analgesia. The benefit of combining local <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> point stimulation is unknown. However, subgroup analyses suggested that local tender points could be important in the treatment of CMP for short-term pain relief...|$|R

The Prologue begins with a quote from Cervantes' Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda (Persiles and Sigismunda), which is subsequently mentioned, with a focus on the character of Rutilio. The mention of Rutilio is noteworthy, as the episode has been of interest to critics due to its magical subject matter, concerning lycanthropy.

5|$|Herschel also {{observed}} three faint galaxies, {{two of which}} are interacting with each other.

Named as a single object by Herschel, NGC 2402 is actually a pair of near-adjacent galaxies that appear to be interacting with each other.

Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies.

5|$|Beta, Gamma, and Iota Serpentis form a {{distinctive}} triangular shape marking {{the head of}} the snake, with Kappa Serpentis being roughly midway between Gamma and Iota. The brightest of the four with an apparent magnitude of roughly 3.67, Beta Serpentis is a white main-sequence star roughly 160 parsecs distant. It is likely that a nearby 10th-magnitude star is physically associated with Beta, although it is not certain. The Mira variable R Serpentis, situated between Beta and Gamma, is {{visible to the naked eye}} at its maximum of 5th-magnitude, but, typical of Mira variables, it can fade to below magnitude 14. Gamma Serpentis itself is an F-type subgiant located only 11 parsecs <b>distant</b> <b>and</b> thus is quite bright, being of magnitude 3.84 ± 0.05. The star is known to show solar-like oscillations.|$|E

5|$|During the Han dynasty under Han Wudi (141–87 BCE), the Chinese {{government}} {{united and}} became powerful enough that China began to successfully indulge in imperialistic endeavors with its neighboring nations in East Asia. Han China's imperialism was a peaceful tributary system, which focused mainly on diplomatic and trade relations. The {{growth of the}} Han Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange with {{virtually all of the}} known world as reached from Asia, and Chinese silks spread through Asia and Inner Asia and even to Rome. The early T'ang dynasty saw China as even more responsive to foreign influence and the T'ang dynasty becoming a great empire. Overseas trade with India and the Middle East grew rapidly, and China's East and Southern Coasts, once <b>distant</b> <b>and</b> unimportant regions, gradually became chief areas of foreign trade. During the Song Dynasty China's navy became more powerful thanks to technological improvements in shipbuilding and navigation, and China's maritime commerce also increased exponentially.|$|E

5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was <b>distant</b> <b>and</b> there was little co-ordination or co-operation.

5|$|Located near Alpha is Delta Antliae, {{a binary}} star, 430 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth. The primary is a blue-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type B9.5V and magnitude 5.6, and the secondary is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9Ve and magnitude 9.6. Zeta Antliae {{is a wide}} optical double star. The brighter star—Zeta1 Antliae—is 410 ± 40 light-years <b>distant</b> <b>and</b> has a magnitude of 5.74, {{though it is a}} true binary star system composed of two white main sequence stars of magnitudes 6.20 and 7.01 that are separated by 8.042 arcseconds. The fainter star—Zeta2 Antliae—is 380 ± 20 light-years <b>distant</b> <b>and</b> of magnitude 5.9. Eta Antliae is another double composed of a yellow white star of spectral type F1V and magnitude 5.31, with a companion of magnitude 11.3. Theta Antliae is likewise double, most likely composed of an A-type main sequence star and a yellow giant. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system that varies in apparent magnitude from 6.27 to 6.83 over a period of 15.6 hours. The system is classed as a W Ursae Majoris variable—the primary is hotter than the secondary and the drop in magnitude is caused by the latter passing in front of the former. Calculating the properties of the component stars from the orbital period indicates that the primary star has a mass 1.94 times and a diameter 2.026 times that of the Sun, and the secondary has a mass 0.76 times and a diameter 1.322 times that of the Sun. The two stars have similar luminosity and spectral type as they have a common envelope and share stellar material. The system is thought to be around 5–6 billion years old. The two stars will eventually merge to form a single fast-spinning star.|$|E
