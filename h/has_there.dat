5|$|In tennis, {{the term}} Big Four {{refers to the}} quartet of men's singles players {{comprising}} Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray. These players are considered dominant in terms of ranking and tournament victories, including Grand Slam tournaments and ATP Masters 1000 events, {{as well as the}} ATP World Tour Finals and Olympic Games, having dominated the sport amongst them from 2004 onwards. Never before in the history of tennis <b>has</b> <b>there</b> been a group of players as dominant as these four.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{secondary}} market {{is unlikely to}} have followed {{the growth of the}} primary market since 2007 seeing as game companies have become better at monetizing on their games with microtransactions and many popular games such as World of Warcraft are sporting increased measures against player to player real money trading. Also hampering the turnover growth are the extreme price drops that has followed the increased competition from businesses in mainland China targeting the global secondary market. Furthermore, the global decline in consumption that followed the financial crisis of 2007–2008 would have affected {{the secondary}} market negatively as well. Post 2007 secondary market growth is likely localized to emerging markets such as Russia, eastern Europe, South America, and South East Asia - all of which are relatively inaccessible to international merchants due to payment systems, advertisement channels and language barrier. For example, South Korea is estimated to have the biggest share of the global real money trading market and it <b>has</b> <b>there</b> become an officially acknowledged and taxable part of the economy. In western countries the secondary market remains a black market with little to no social acceptance or official acknowledgement.|$|E
