5000|$|In {{light of}} the {{calculation}} above, {{it is tempting to}} think of Bohm diffusion as classical diffusion with an anomalous collision rate that maximizes the transport, but the physical picture is different. Anomalous diffusion is the result of turbulence. Regions of higher or lower electric potential result in eddies because the plasma moves around them with the E-cross-B drift velocity equal to E/B. These eddies play a similar role to the gyro-orbits in classical diffusion, except that the physics of the turbulence can be such that the <b>decorrelation</b> <b>time</b> is approximately equal to the turn-over time, resulting in Bohm scaling. Another {{way of looking at it}} is that the turbulent electric field is approximately equal to the potential perturbation divided by the scale length , and the potential perturbation can be expected to be a sizeable fraction of the kBT/e. The turbulent diffusion constant [...] is then independent of the scale length and is approximately equal to the Bohm value.|$|E

We {{examined the effects of}} simple shear flow on swimming trajectories and orientations of two species of dinoflagellates Glenodinium foliaceum and Alexandrium catenella. In the absence of either shear or a cue that can cause directional motion, swimming orientations of both species were insignificantly different from random. Although cells of G. foliaceum maintained their random swimming orientations upon exposure to shear, swimming orientations of both single cells and chains of A. catenella were affected by shear. Magnitude of the effect increased with shear rate. Changes in <b>decorrelation</b> <b>times,</b> as a result of exposure to shear, were observed for both species, providing another indication that shear affects swimming behavior. <b>Decorrelation</b> <b>times</b> for the swimming directions of both species were of the same order as the characteristic time scale of turbulence that would produce shear rates comparable to those examined in this study. Theoretical models that assess the effects of turbulence on vertical migration of dinofla-gellates and predator–prey interactions commonly assume that swimming motion of dinoflagellates in the presence of shear flow can be described by simple superposition of the flow on the swimming motion in the absence of flow.
