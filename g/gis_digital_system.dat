40|$|Interpolation or {{approximation}} of scattered data is very often task in engineering problems. The Radial Basis Functions (RBF) interpolation is convenient for scattered (un-ordered) data sets in k-dimensional space, in general. This approach is convenient {{especially for a}} higher dimension k > 2 as the conversion to an ordered data set, e. g. using tessellation, is computationally very expensive. The RBF interpolation is not separable and {{it is based on}} distance of two points. It leads to a solution of a Linear System of Equations (LSE) Ax=b. There are two main groups of interpolating functions: ‘global” and “local”. Application of “local” functions, called Compactly Supporting RBF (CSFBF), can significantly decrease computational cost as they lead to a system of linear equations with a sparse matrix. In this paper the RBF interpolation theory is briefly introduced at the “application level” including some basic principles and computational issues and an incremental RBF computation is presented and approximation RBF as well. The RBF interpolation or approximation can be used also for image reconstruction, inpainting removal, for solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDE), in <b>GIS</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>digital</b> elevation model DEM etc...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: With {{the recent}} rapid {{development}} of the Internet and portable multimedia terminals, the concept of GIS has been introduced to many aspects of our daily life. Although the <b>digital</b> map and <b>GIS</b> service systems abruptly increased on the Internet, the vast amount of geographical information data and the limited speed of the service cause problems when the GIS data for the actual users are transmitted through the Internet and saved in the portable terminals in a short time. In this study, the most efficient technique to transmit the large-volume <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map images is identified to address such problems. First, the file-based digital map v 2. 0 and shape files, the XML-based 3 DF-GML, GML, CityGML and KML, and the database-based geodatabase files are used to form layers in the 3 D GIS engine, and the data are transmitted to the simulator. Second, there is the streaming technique for the digital map screen images. In this method, the administrator and users connect to the server, and the 3 D GIS engine and diverse <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map information on the administrator screen are transmitted to the users in the forms of screen captures or streaming service. In this study, {{the characteristics of the}} two methods are examined, and the more efficient way to deliver the <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map information is determined.

40|$|The current U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{licensing}} process for <b>digital</b> <b>systems</b> rests on deterministic engineering criteria. In its 1995 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) policy statement, the Commission encouraged {{the use of}} PRA technology in all regulatory matters to the extent supported by the state-of-the-art in PRA methods and data. Although many activities have been completed {{in the area of}} risk-informed regulation, the risk-informed analysis process for <b>digital</b> <b>systems</b> has not yet been satisfactorily developed. Since digital instrumentation and control (I&C) systems are expected to play an increasingly important role in nuclear power plant (NPP) safety, the NRC established a <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> research plan that defines a coherent set of research programs to support its regulatory needs. One of the research programs included in the NRC's <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> research plan addresses risk assessment methods and data for <b>digital</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Digital</b> I&C <b>systems</b> have some unique characteristics, such as using software, and may have different failure causes and/or modes than analog I&C systems; hence, their incorporation into NPP PRAs entails special challenges. The objective of the NRC's <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> risk research is to identify and develop methods, analytical tools, and regulatory guidance for (1) including models of <b>digital</b> <b>systems</b> into NPP PRAs, and (2) using information on the risks of <b>digital</b> <b>systems</b> to support the NRC's risk-informed licensing and oversight activities. For several years, Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has worked on NRC projects to investigate methods and tools for the probabilistic modeling of <b>digital</b> <b>systems,</b> as documented mainly in NUREG/CR- 6962 and NUREG/CR- 6997. However, the scope of this research principally focused on hardware failures, with limited reviews of software failure experience and software reliability methods. NRC also sponsored research at the Ohio State University investigating the modeling of <b>digital</b> <b>systems</b> using dynamic PRA methods. These efforts, documented in NUREG/CR- 6901, NUREG/CR- 6942, and NUREG/CR- 6985, included a functional representation of the system's software but did not explicitly address failure modes caused by software defects or by inadequate design requirements. An important identified research need is to establish a commonly accepted basis for incorporating the behavior of software into <b>digital</b> I&C <b>system</b> reliability models for use in PRAs.

In this paper we are particularly interested in asynchronous <b>digital</b> <b>systems</b> because they present several advantages over the synchronous ones, such as better performance, energy saving, and freedom from clock skews. For the modeling of such circuits some formalisms have been proposed on the literature, like Finite State Machines, and Petri nets.
