5|$|All {{the crew}} {{on board the}} ship {{at the time of}} the {{incident}} (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the bodies were found. In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer's wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by a lack of organization and poorly maintained fire-fighting equipment at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to take them onto the island. The terminal's own fire engine would not start. Firefighters <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> into the terminal's main depot to access materials and equipment (much of which did not work).|$|E
5|$|Banza {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who he looked to for support. Mandaba {{went along with the}} plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him into the trunk of a Mercedes and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake.|$|E
5|$|In Your Honor is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on June 14, 2005 by RCA Records. It is a double album, with one disc containing heavy rock songs and a second disc with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl decided to do a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> new ground with their music. The album was recorded at a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics deal with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement {{on the campaign trail}} with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. It is the first album to feature keyboardist Rami Jaffee, although he would not join the band as full-time member until 2017.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Two {{companies}} of the 1st Hampshires landed {{very close to}} the strong point at Le Hamel, and had to fight inland through enemy garrisons to get off the beach. Attempts to flank Le Hamel were made difficult by the surrounding machine gun placements, mines, and barbed wire. Elements of the 1st Hampshires captured the German strongpoint WN-36 at {{the eastern edge of the}} village of Asnelles. When they turned west to move along the beach towards their primary objective at Le Hamel, they came under heavy fire and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> off the attack. Major Warren, in charge after the commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Nelson Smith was wounded, decided that the troops would have to circle around and attack the emplacement from the rear, a process that took several hours. The troops began to have some success around 15:00 with the arrival of an AVRE tank of 82nd Assault Squadron. The tank fired two petards into the sanatorium, where most of the defenders were located. The German soldiers fled into fortified houses in Le Hamel and Asnelles, and were taken out in house-to-house combat. Few surrendered. The 75mm gun was finally silenced at 16:00, when the AVRE tank fired a large petard charge into the rear entrance of the casemate. C/A Company, 1st Hampshires and the AVRE tank proceeded west along the beach and took out strongpoint WN-38 at La Fontaine St Côme, taking 20 prisoners. Still further west, D Company captured strong point WN-39 at the Arromanches radar station, capturing 30 more defenders.|$|E
5|$|With about 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman {{soldiers}} of the 16th and 19th Divisions, von Oppen succeeded in retreating towards Beisan via Mount Ebal during 21 September but {{was forced to leave}} behind all guns or baggage. They suffered some casualties when fired on by artillery, before bivouacking that night at Tammun with the 16th and 19th Divisions at Tubas, unaware that Desert Mounted Corps had already occupied Beisan. They were moving northwards from Tubas towards Beisan when von Oppen learned it had already been captured. He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders would order a strong rearguard action. However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army ordered him to cross the Jordan instead; he successfully got all the Germans and some of the Ottoman soldiers across before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked and captured the remainder, to finalise the capture of Afulah and Beisan. Liman von Sanders was very critical of Jevad's intervention which considerably weakened the Samakh position, but von Oppen would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through a whole cavalry division to get there.|$|E

5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E
