5|$|The bobcat is {{believed}} to have evolved from the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx,</b> which crossed into North America by way of the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern Canada lynx. Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur.|$|E
5|$|Wolf and coyote {{packs and}} the solitary cougar {{are the most}} likely predators, {{although}} brown and black bears also prey on elk. Coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves, though they can sometimes take a winter-weakened adult. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park, bears are the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, dhole, brown bear, Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and snow leopard. <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx</b> and wild boar sometimes prey on Asian elk calves. Historically, tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian wapiti, and continue {{to do so in the}} Amur region.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria's {{biodiversity}} is conserved {{in three}} national parks, 11 nature parks and 16 biosphere reserves. Nearly 35 per cent of its land area consists of forests, {{where some of}} the oldest trees in the world, such as Baikushev's pine and the Granit oak, grow. Most of the plant and animal life is central European, although representatives of Arctic and alpine species are present at high altitudes. Its flora encompass more than 3,800 species of which 170 are endemic and 150 are considered endangered. A checklist of larger fungi of Bulgaria reported that more than 1,500 species occur in the country. Animal species include owls, rock partridges, wallcreepers and brown bears. The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx</b> and the eastern imperial eagle have small, but growing populations.|$|E
50|$|This {{part of the}} zoo houses animals {{which usually}} live in the {{temperate}} zone of the world. Animals housed in this area include Przewalski's wild horses, American beavers, American bison, raccoons, sika, bobcats, woodchuck, European otters, Asiatic black bears, red pandas, brown bears, grey wolves, pumas, and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both foxes and Eurasian badgers {{compete with}} raccoon dogs for food, {{and have been}} known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynxes</b> rarely attack them, due to their low numbers. Birds of prey known to take raccoon dogs include golden eagles, white-tailed eagles, {{goshawks}} and eagle owls.|$|R

5|$|Large wolf populations {{limit the}} numbers of small to {{medium-sized}} felines. Wolves encounter cougars along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges. Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations. In winter, however, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys, interactions between the two species become more likely. Wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal kills. They have been reported killing mothers and their kittens. Wolves hunt steppe cats, and may scavenge from snow leopard kills. Wolves may also reduce <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx</b> populations. Wolves may kill lynxes by running them down, or killing them before they can escape into trees. Similar reports of encounters between wolves and bobcats have been documented.|$|E
5|$|The last {{confirmed}} {{death of}} an Anatolian leopard, {{closely related to the}} Persian (Caucasian) leopard and native to the western regions of Anatolia, took place in the Bağözü village of the Beypazarı district in Ankara Province on 17 January 1974. The Persian (Caucasian) leopard is still found in very small numbers in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Turkey. The Caspian tiger is an extinct tiger subspecies (closely related to the Siberian tiger) which lived in the easternmost regions of Turkey until {{the latter half of the}} 20th century, with the last confirmed death in Uludere, February 1970. The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx</b> and the European wildcat are other felid species which are currently found in the forests of Turkey.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and European pine marten. The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx</b> sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E
40|$|Infections with feline hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) {{have been}} {{documented}} in domestic cats and free-ranging feline species with high prevalences in Iberian <b>lynxes</b> (<b>Lynx</b> pardinus), <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynxes</b> (Lynx lynx), European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris), African lions (Panthera leo) in Tanzania and domestic cats in South Africa. The prevalence of hemoplasmas {{has not yet been}} investigated in free-ranging felids in southern Africa. In this study we screened 73 blood samples from 61 cheetahs in central Namibia for the presence of hemoplasmas using quantitative real-time PCR. One of the cheetahs tested PCR-positive. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequencing of the 16 S rRNA and RNAse P genes revealed that the isolate belongs to the Mycoplasma haemofelis/haemocanis group. This is the first molecular evidence of a hemoplasma infection in a free-ranging cheetah...|$|R
25|$|Asian {{black bears}} may be {{occasionally}} attacked by tigers and brown bears, although leopards, and packs of wolves and dholes {{can also be}} threats. <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynxes</b> are a potential predator of cubs. Black bears usually dominate Amur leopards in physical confrontations in heavily vegetated areas, while leopards are uppermost in open areas, though the outcome of such encounters is largely dependent {{on the size of}} the individual animals. Leopards have been known to prey on cubs younger than two years old.|$|R

25|$|Mammals in {{the park}} include the endemic Tatra chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica), a unique goat—antelope that is an IUCN {{critically}} endangered species. Other mammals include the Eurasian brown bear, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx,</b> marten, wolf, fox, and the Alpine marmot.|$|E
25|$|Some {{important}} carnivores {{include the}} <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx,</b> European wild cats, foxes (especially the red fox), and European jackal. There are hedgehogs, martens, and snakes such as vipers and grass snakes. According to recent estimates, Slovenia has c.40–60 wolves and about 450 brown bears.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} animals are wolf, fox, the European hare (Lepus europaeus), squirrel, and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra).

50|$|Chamois {{can reach}} {{an age of}} 22 years in captivity, {{although}} the maximum recorded in the wild is from 15 to 17 years of age. Common causes of mortality can include avalanches, epidemics and predation. At present, humans are the main predator of Chamois. In the past, the principal predators were <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynxes,</b> Persian leopards and gray wolves; with some predation possibly by brown bears and golden eagles. Chamois usually use speed and stealthy evasion to escape predators and can run at 50 km/h and can jump 2 m vertically into the air or over a distance of 6 m.|$|R

5|$|In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynxes.</b> The lynxes chase red foxes {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws {{give them an}} {{advantage}} over foxes, especially when {{the depth of the}} snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do. North American felid predators of red foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.|$|R
25|$|A {{study on}} {{livestock}} predation taken in Tibet {{showed that the}} wolf was the most prominent predator, accounting for 60% of the total livestock losses, followed by the snow leopard (38%) and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx</b> (2%).

25|$|Bulgaria's {{vertebrate}} fauna {{is among}} the most diverse in Europe. The zoogeograhical regions are three: the Eurosiberian region, encompassing the Danubian Plain and the mountainous regions of the country; the Irano-Turanian region encompassing Southern Dobrudzha; and the Mediterranean region that includes the Upper Thracian Plain, the lower Struma valley and the Black Sea coast. Bulgaria is inhabited by around 100 mammal species, including brown bears, grey wolves, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynxes,</b> golden jackals, red deer and roe deer among other. The avian fauna is represented by 426 species of birds, which is the second highest number in Europe. Important conservation species are the eastern imperial eagle, the cinereous vulture, the great white pelican, the Dalmatian pelican, etc. The reptiles and the amphibians found in Bulgaria are 38 and 20 species respectively. The ichtyofauna of the country has not been fully researched. As of 2000 there are 207 fish species. There are an estimated 27,000 species of insects and other invertebrates.|$|R
40|$|Trichinella spp. larvae {{have not}} been {{detected}} in Swiss pigs, horses, or wild boar for many decades, whereas the parasite was repeatedly isolated from red foxes and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynxes.</b> Whenever the isolated larvae could be subjected to genotyping, T. britovi was found as infective agent. The present study was initiated to re-assess the epidemiological situation of Trichinella infection in Swiss carnivorous wildlife, namely in red foxes and lynxes. Tissue samples from 1, 298 foxes were collected between 2006 and 2007, and those of 55 lynxes between 1999 and 2007. All samples were tested by a standard artificial digestion method and a multiplex-PCR to determine the species and/or genotypes of recovered larvae. Trichinella larvae were found in 21 foxes (1. 6 %) and 15 lynxes (27. 3 %), and T. britovi was identified as infecting species in all cases. The geographic distribution of positive foxes showed two main clusters: one in Central Switzerland {{and one in the}} West of the country, where also many lynxes were found to be positive. While the prevalence for Trichinella infection in foxes was not statistically correlated with sex or age class, the prevalence in lynx was significantly higher in males compared to females, and in adults compared to juveniles...|$|R
25|$|With their height {{averaging}} 1.5 m (5ft), {{their large}} size deters most predators. As a result, red-crowned cranes often react indifferently {{to the presence}} of other birds such as small raptors; with harriers, falcons, owls, and small buzzards being allowed to hunt small prey near a crane nest without any of these parties harassing each other. However, birds more likely to be egg or nest predators, such as corvids, some buzzards, and various eagles, are treated aggressively and are threatened until they leave the crane's territory. Mammalian carnivores, including gray wolves, red foxes, badgers, raccoon dogs, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynxes,</b> and domestic dogs, are attacked immediately, with the parent cranes attempting to jab them in the flanks until the predators leave the vicinity, sometimes killing smaller enemies such as foxes. Occasionally, losses at the nest occur to some of the above predators. Introduced American mink on Hokkaido {{are one of the most}} successful predators of eggs and nestlings. Also, immature and unwary adult cranes may be killed by the largest raptors, such as sea eagles, or mammalian carnivores, though this is rare, especially with adults. White-naped cranes often nest near red-crowned cranes, but competition between these species for food in a common nesting area is lessened due to the greater portion of vegetation in the white-naped crane's diet. In cases where interactions turn aggressive between white-naped and red-crowned cranes, red-crowned cranes are dominant, as expected due to their considerably larger size.|$|R
25|$|Extensive plains are {{primarily}} {{located in the}} regions of Thessaly, Central Macedonia and Thrace. They constitute key economic regions as {{they are among the}} few arable places in the country. Rare marine species such as the pinniped seals and the loggerhead sea turtle live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece, while its dense forests are home to the endangered brown bear, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx,</b> the roe deer and the wild goat.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal life}} {{in these areas}} is also {{relatively}} rich. The zone is particularly important to the brown bear, which likes to hibernate the winter away in dens along the mountainside. In spring, the brown bears descent to the plains, and only return to the mountain when the berries do. These terrains are also favored stomping grounds of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx.</b> Both species, brown bear and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>lynx,</b> are protected in Sweden. Besides the red fox, the other predators, which are the wolverine, the gray wolf and the Arctic fox, are much rarer {{and do not have}} a fixed location in the park. The park shelters an important population of moose that pass the summer on the mountain, but prefer to spend the winter in areas less snowy. There are no more wild reindeerin the park, which is part of those few Swedish mountains not included in the area of pasture of domestic reindeer. Muskox, which left the area almost 4000 years ago, were reintroduced in Norway and sometimes wander near the park. Among the smaller animals, one can cite the red squirrel, the European pine marten, and the mountain hare. Like other Swedish mountains, the Norway lemming is present in Fulufjället, but in a patchy fashion, extremely numerous some years and almost absent others. This phenomenon is still not entirely understood.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{habit of}} living in areas with rocks and tall trees for refuge, dense {{thickets}} and abandoned burrows, wildcats have few natural predators. In Central Europe, many kittens are killed by pine martens, and {{there is at least}} one account of an adult wildcat being killed and eaten. In the steppe regions of Europe and Asia, village dogs constitute serious enemies of wildcats, along with the much larger <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Lynx,</b> one of the rare habitual predators of healthy adults. In Tajikistan, wolves are their most serious enemies, having been observed to destroy cat burrows. Birds of prey, including eagle-owls and saker falcons, have been known to kill wildcat kittens.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is located}} on the slope of the Saguramo Range, east of the Aragvi River, and belongs to the {{drainage}} basin of the Kura. The highest point of the park is 1385 m.

The protected mammals in the park include red deer, <b>lynx,</b> <b>Eurasian</b> brown bear, red fox, and jackal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interaction}} of complex climatic, hydrological, geological and topographical conditions make Bulgaria {{one of the}} most biologically diverse countries of Europe. Phytogeographically, Bulgaria straddles the Illyrian and Euxinian provinces of the Circumboreal region within the Boreal kingdom. The country falls within six terrestrial ecoregions of the Palearctic ecozone: Balkan mixed forests, Rodope montane mixed forests, Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests, Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests, East European forest steppe and Pontic-Caspian steppe. Around 35% of Bulgaria's land area consists of forests, which include some of the oldest trees in the world, such as Baikushev's pine and the Granit oak.
