25|$|Rochester {{opposed the}} {{election}} of William and Mary as king and queen, raising his voice {{for the establishment of}} a regency on behalf of the exiled James. But he soon reconciled himself to the new order, perhaps because he could not retain his pension unless he took the oaths of allegiance. After this he was quickly in the royal favour and again a member of the Privy Council. He advised the queen in ecclesiastical matters, and returned to his former position as the leader of the High Church party. Rochester tried to mediate in the quarrel between Princess Anne and the King and Queen, but with little success. Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, thanked him for his expressions of goodwill, but added sarcastically that she would have valued them much more <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that they had been sincere.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{continued}} her stellar play in her sophomore year; her coaches {{noticed that she}} was demanding the ball more often, something she occasionally did as a freshman, but usually only <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> she was playing well. By {{the end of her}} sophomore year, she was named the American Athletic Conference Player of the Year in the league's first season after the split of the original Big East Conference, an honor she would go on to win the following two seasons. Additionally, she was named AP Player of the Year, only the third time in history a sophomore had claimed the honor. The other two sophomore recipients were UConn's Maya Moore and Oklahoma's Courtney Paris. Stewart started and played in all 40 games of 2013–2014 season. She led the team at 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game, was second on the team with 8.1 rebounds per contest, and fourth on the squad at 49.7 percent shooting and her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn annals. Her 324 boards marked the 12th-highest single-season total in school history, and her 110 rejections was the third-highest mark.|$|E
500|$|One award Sheindlin had {{difficulty}} winning was a Daytime Emmy Award. By 2011, her program had been nominated 14 consecutive years without winning. In mid-2012, an article from the New York Post reported that Judge Judy was snubbed by the award show by not even being nominated that year despite being the highest-rated court show. In {{an interview with}} Entertainment Tonight (ET) on May 3, 2013, Sheindlin said, [...] "I have my walls full of Daytime Emmy Award nominations." [...] When ET's interviewer asked Sheindlin <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> she would ever win the award, she replied: ...|$|E

500|$|After leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly {{mentioned}} the incident {{to one another}} until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister {{and when she got}} to the afternoon of the Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the Petit Trianon was haunted. Jourdain told her that she thought it was. Three months later in Oxford, [...] they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.|$|E
500|$|When asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> Sarah {{had come}} to terms with the fact she is a lesbian, Batley said: [...] "I don't know because from the beginning, Sarah was always boy crazy, so for her, I don't think it's about being one way or the other — I think she's just very clingy. Batley also gave her views on how Sarah should have to developed, opining it would have been good for her to spend more time on her own, be herself and learn who she really is. She felt that Sarah had to often clung on to people and believing that {{ultimately}} it would make her happy. Sarah tries this notion with Zoe, describing this Batley added: [...] "I think that's what happened with Zoe as well because they were such good friends. With Lydia, she brought something to her and she got on with her and was sparky, which is something that Sarah liked. I don't know if she'd suddenly turned, though. Maybe she was more bisexual than anything." ...|$|E
500|$|After 326 performances, Leigh {{finished}} her run, {{and she was}} soon assigned to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in {{the film version of}} the play. Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with Brando, but she had an initial difficulty in working with director Elia Kazan, who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche. Kazan had favoured Jessica Tandy and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche. He later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress, believing that [...] "she had a small talent." [...] As work progressed, however, he became [...] "full of admiration" [...] for [...] "the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it would help her performance." [...] Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me." [...] Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with Jennifer Jones in William Wyler's Carrie (1952).|$|E

500|$|Initially {{upon her}} arrival at Seattle Grace, plastic surgeon Mark Sloan {{was seen to}} develop {{feelings}} for Hahn, only to be repeatedly rebuffed. The character explained that she kept her personal and professional lives separate, but as Smith has explained: [...] "She came to the wrong hospital <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> she wasn’t {{going to have a}} personal life!" [...] Smith has admitted to eavesdropping on a writers’ meeting in an attempt {{to find out what was}} in store for her character romantically, as it was being closely guarded, even from her. She discussed with TV Guide editor Michael Ausiello early in her tenure as Hahn how she and Sandra Oh had pushed for a lesbian relationship between Hahn and Cristina, having previously played lovers in the play Stop Kiss. She agreed with Ausiello's assessment that Hahn would make an [...] "awesome lesbian" [...] and that: [...] "I've certainly let [...] know I'm open to it. [...] They were like, [...] "OK, duly noted!" [...] I think they wanted me to shut up already." [...] Equally, however, Smith has revealed that when she and Shonda Rhimes first discussed the possibility of Hahn being gay; [...] ""we felt it was too obvious that a strong, powerful woman would be a lesbian".|$|E
500|$|Nagle {{credited}} {{herself with}} [...] "dragging the Jockey Club {{into the twentieth}} century". She said: [...] "This {{was a matter of}} principle. I am a feminist. I believe in equal rights for women. Things should be decided by ability, not sex". [...] At odds with Nagle's view, in her court case Lord Justice Salmon commented that [...] "No doubt there are occupations, such as boxing, which may be reasonably regarded inherently unsuitable for women", and Lord Denning had gone on to say that [...] "It is not as if the training of horses could be regarded as an unsuitable occupation for a woman, like that of a jockey or speedway-rider"; it was another eight years before Jockey Club rules permitted women jockeys in 1972. When asked by a journalist in the late 1970s <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> women could ever match men on the racecourse, Nagle replied: [...] "My dear man, it used to be said women couldn't stand up to three-day-eventing. Now they're beating the men regularly– and the same will happen in racing. Give them time." [...] Her endeavours led to her being described as [...] "the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing" [...] in Stud & Stable Magazine and [...] "Racing's Emily Pankhurst".|$|E
500|$|At Yekaterinburg, Tatiana {{occasionally}} {{joined her}} younger sisters in chatting {{with some of}} the guards over tea, asking them questions about their families and talking about her hopes for a new life in England when they were released. On one occasion one of the guards forgot himself and told the grand duchesses an off-color joke. The shocked Tatiana ran from the room, [...] "pale as death," [...] and her younger sister Maria scolded the guards for their bad language. She [...] "would be pleasant to the guards <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> they were behaving in an acceptable and decorous manner," [...] recalled another of the guards in his memoirs. Later, when a new commander was placed in charge of the Ipatiev House, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the rules of their confinement became more strict. Tatiana, still the family leader, was often sent by her parents to question the guards about rules or what would happen next to the family. She also {{spent a great deal of}} time sitting with her mother and ill brother, reading to her mother or playing games to occupy the time. At the Ipatiev House, Tatiana and her sisters were required to do their own laundry and make bread. Her nursing skills were called upon at the end of June 1918 when she gave an injection of morphine to Dr. Eugene Botkin to ease his kidney pain.|$|E

500|$|After {{pictures}} of Spears and Trawick carrying replica guns on set surfaced online, the Hackney London Borough Council criticized her for [...] "promoting gun violence", since {{the area had}} been badly affected by the 2011 England riots. The Council told London Tonight {{that they had not}} agreed to the use of replica guns at Stoke Newington Town Hall, and that they would be raising the matter with the production company. Councillor Ian Rathbone added that Spears should apologize and make a sizeable donation to a Hackney charity [...] "for the rudeness and damage she's done to this community." [...] When asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the council was overreacting, Hackney MP Diane Abbott insisted: [...] "It is only a music video but it's images like this, with popstars glamorising gangs, which means that some young people... get drawn in. Britney should really know better." [...] Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly explained that the United Kingdom [...] "is not a place that readily embraces guns. Rather, it's a place where guns are rare, gun licensing is tightly controlled, and the entire establishment has been in a panic about gun use on its streets for the last three years." [...] On September 26, 2011, Spears' representatives released a statement to MTV News saying, [...] "The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened." [...] The production company apologized to the Council before the release of the video. Marrs Piliero stated about the controversy, ...|$|E
500|$|One of Lois's key {{relationships}} is with Clark, who is {{her husband in}} the comics. For Smallville, the characters' relationship is in constant development. Darren Swimmer describes the relationship between Lois and Clark in season five as [...] "a bit of a melting of the ice". The two characters continue to [...] "butt heads", but the audience can see where there is a growing attraction and that either would be there for the other in a time of need. According to Erica Durance, in season five it is not yet clear if either character realizes the attraction, but the joking between the two characters represents a foreshadowing of a greater relationship. Durance believes that because of Lois's self-imposed walls, even <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> about Clark in a romantic notion for just an instant she would immediately make it out to be a joke because she is not ready for that type of closeness, yet. The actress sees season five as being too soon for the characters to be [...] "in-love" [...] because they are still getting to know each other. Writer Brian Peterson describes Lois's relationship with Oliver Queen in season six as a precursor to her future relationship with Clark. As Peterson sees it, it is the dynamic between her and Oliver, with her willingness to accept Oliver's secret identity as Green Arrow as mirroring the relationship she will have with Clark. As far as season six is concerned, the relationship between Lois and Clark is still undefined for the audience. As Durance describes it, neither character is willing to put an official label on their relationship. The pair has learned to deal with each other's [...] "quirks", but there are still moments that both feel uncomfortable with. Instead at this point, Durance believes that Clark and Lois are satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother-sister friendship" [...] label, than trying to discover how they both truly feel about each other.|$|E

60|$|She {{that day}} nearly formed the {{intention}} of begging his pardon on the very next occasion of their meeting.

The witch replied with his grandmother's accent, [...] "Hut tut, what has happened now?" [...] On another occasion, an Englishman stopped to visit and offered to investigate. On remarking on his family overseas, the witch suddenly began to mimic his English parents. Again at early morning, the witch woke him to voices of his parents worried as they had heard his voice as well. The Englishman quickly left that morning and later wrote to the Bell family the entity had visited his family in England and apologized for his skepticism.|$|E
2500|$|Following the war, General Canby was {{retained}} {{by the army}} as one of only ten brigadier generals and served as military commander of various districts throughout the South. In an 1873 newspaper article, Mrs. Lew Wallace (née Susan Arnold Elston) would recall that Louisa practiced charity, tending to give things away to the needy wherever she went in the South, endearing herself to the local populace, but at some cost to her household. [...] "I can hardly keep anything, {{there is so much}} suffering about us," [...] Louisa wrote Wallace from New Orleans. She sometimes pleaded the case of someone in need to her husband <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> he might help.
