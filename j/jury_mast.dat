60|$|The {{first mate}} ascended {{to the fore}} top, and at once hailed the deck that ice was visible ahead. The captain joined him, and for some minutes the two {{officers}} carefully examined the horizon. No sooner did the captain regain the deck than he ordered the try sail to be hoisted on the <b>jury</b> <b>mast,</b> and a haul to be given upon the braces of the fore sail, while the ship's course was laid a little north of east.|$|E
60|$|Two {{days later}} the wind went {{completely}} down, and the crew at once set to work to repair damages. Reuben, with two men under him, filled up the breaches in the bulwarks. A respectable <b>jury</b> <b>mast</b> was rigged by the stump of the main mast; and the spar, which had done such good service among the bergs, {{was replaced by a}} longer and heavier one. All hands worked vigorously, and the sailors were assisted in the heavier work by parties of convicts.|$|E

He was up there late last season well over on the western side. A north-easterly gale fell on them, and took most of the foremast out of her. I understand they tried to lash on a boom or something as a <b>jury</b> <b>mast,</b> but it hadn't height enough to set much forward canvas, and that being the case she wouldn't bear more than a three-reefed mainsail. Anyway, they couldn't do anything with her on the wind, and as it kept heading them from the east she sidled away down south through the Kuriles into the Yellow Sea. They got ice-bound somewhere, which explains why Dunton only fetched Vancouver a week ago." ...|$|E
25|$|The crew {{set up a}} <b>jury</b> main <b>mast</b> {{and began}} heading back east towards Portsmouth, {{spending}} {{the rest of the}} day trying to set up a <b>jury</b> mizzen <b>mast.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{contention}} among knot researchers {{whether this}} supposed rigging knot can work as described. Due {{to a lack}} of hard historical evidence there is also uncertainty whether it was ever commonly used for rigging <b>jury</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 21 October 1813, Pomone was in the Bay of Biscay {{repairing}} damage following a gale in which she had lost her fore-yard. By chance she fell in with a ship under <b>jury</b> <b>masts</b> that proved to be a French frigate.|$|R
60|$|Additional stays {{were fixed}} to the <b>jury</b> <b>mast,</b> {{as it might be}} necessary, at any moment, to attempt to bring her up into the wind; and the word was passed that both watches must remain on deck. Fortunately the night was a light one, for the moon was up, and the sky almost cloudless. The mate stood with two of the best hands at the wheel; while the second mate took his place in the fore top, with a lantern, to signal the {{position}} of ice ahead. Fortunately there were but few small floating blocks about, and the Paramatta threaded her way through the larger bergs, without once approaching near enough to render danger imminent. It was a long and anxious night but, when morning broke, it was seen that the sea was now open ahead, and by the afternoon they had left the last berg behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see you are {{too good}} a sailor by far to be cheered by any {{questionable}} hopes," [...] laughed Theriere; [...] "but you must take the will into consideration--I only wished {{to give you a}} ray of hope that might lighten your burden of apprehension. However, honestly, I do think that we may {{find a way to make}} a safe landing if the sea continues to go down as it has in the past two hours. We are not more than a league from shore, and with the <b>jury</b> <b>mast</b> and sail that the men are setting under Mr. Ward now we can work in comparative safety with a light breeze, which we should have during the afternoon. There are few coasts, however rugged they may appear at a distance, that do not offer some foothold for the wrecked mariner, and I doubt not but that we shall find this no exception to the rule." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ships {{typically}} {{carried a}} number of spare parts (e.g., items such as topmasts), but the lower masts were too large to carry spares, at up to 1 meter (3 ft 3 in) in diameter. So a <b>jury</b> <b>mast</b> could be various things. Ships usually carried a variety of spare sails so rigging the <b>jury</b> <b>mast,</b> once erected, was mostly a matter of selecting appropriate size. Contemporary drawings and paintings show {{a wide variety of}} jury rigs, attesting to the creativity of sailors faced with the need to save their ships. Example jury-rig configurations are: ...|$|E
50|$|With <b>jury</b> <b>masts</b> and a {{temporary}} rudder {{she was making}} fair progress when the wind backed and made the coast of Jutland a lee shore. She was unable to work off and was wrecked before the coast of Thorsminde, 3 miles from Ringkøbing, Danmark on 24 December 1811, {{with the loss of}} all but seven of the 738 on board.|$|R
50|$|Carteret {{was about}} to attack when another vessel, which also {{appeared}} to be a frigate, and a brig flying French colours, emerged from the haze, followed by three more indistinct vessels. To avoid hazarding Pomone, Carteret got well to windward of them. However, when the wind cleared in the afternoon it was discovered that they were all merchantmen except for the frigate under <b>jury</b> <b>masts</b> and the second frigate.|$|R
50|$|Years ago, Peleg, now the {{co-owner}} of the Pequod, sailed as mate under Ahab. During that voyage, a typhoon near Japan swung her three masts overboard. Every moment the crew thought the ship would sink, the sea breaking over the ship. Yet instead of thinking of death, Captain Ahab and Peleg thought of how to save all hands, and how to rig <b>jury</b> <b>masts</b> {{in order to get}} into the nearest port.|$|R
50|$|The <b>jury</b> <b>mast</b> knot {{is often}} {{mentioned}} as a method to provide the anchor points for securing makeshift stays and shrouds to the new mast. However, {{there is a lack}} of hard evidence regarding the knot's actual historical use.|$|E
50|$|The frigate herself turned northward, {{hoping to}} {{encounter}} HMS Milford, a British frigate {{which had been}} capturing New England shipping. Before long, she boarded a ship which proved to be French and was set free. Then, as she continued the search, Randolph sprung her foremast. While the crew labored to rig a spar as a <b>jury</b> <b>mast,</b> the ship's mainmast broke and toppled into the sea.|$|E
50|$|Berceau {{had been}} dismasted, so Boston towed {{her as a}} prize to Boston. During the voyage prize-master Lieutenant Robert Haswell rigged a <b>jury</b> <b>mast</b> and then sailed her on in an {{impressive}} feat of seamanship. The battle having been fought two weeks after a formal peace agreement, Berceau was repaired at American expense for $32,839.54. On 22 June 1801, she was restituted to France and recommissioned under Lieutenant Michelon. He then sailed her from Boston to Port-Louis, arriving around 19 October 1801.|$|E
50|$|Carteret {{moved to}} attack the second frigate but she {{turned out to be}} a large Portuguese East Indiaman, which the French had taken and the British retaken. Carteret then sailed for four days in a fruitless search for the frigate under <b>jury</b> <b>masts</b> before he was able to find out that Andromache had {{captured}} her on 23 October. She was the Trave, and the Royal Navy took her into service as the troop transport HMS Trave.|$|R
50|$|HMS St George was wrecked near Ringkøbing on {{the west}} coast of Jutland on 24 December 1811. She {{narrowly}} escaped wrecking on a shoal (Rødsand) south of Zeeland on 15 December, while returning from the Baltic Sea. Under <b>jury</b> <b>masts</b> and a temporary rudder she had got a considerable distance out of the Sleeve when a gale came up. This, combined with a heavy sea, resulted in St George being wrecked at Nazen, about three miles from Ringkøbing, together with Defence.|$|R
2500|$|The Wetmore was [...] {{long with}} {{a beam of}} [...] and a [...] draft and gross tonnage of 3,000. Her power was a single [...] steam engine, but she also had four <b>jury</b> <b>masts</b> with sails for {{emergency}} use. As typical for freight whalebacks, {{there was a small}} turret at the bow which had anchor hoisting machinery and other equipment. Three turrets at the stern raised the stern cabin and pilothouse off the hull. Her single stack exited through one of the turrets. A typical crew complement was 22.|$|R
50|$|The <b>jury</b> <b>mast</b> knot (or {{masthead}} knot) {{is traditionally}} used for jury rigging a temporary mast on a sailboat or ship {{after the original}} one has been lost. The knot is placed {{at the top of}} a new mast with the mast projecting through the center of the knot. The loops of the knot are then used as anchor points for makeshift stays and shrouds. Usually small blocks of wood are affixed to, or a groove cut in, the new mast to prevent the knot from sliding downwards.|$|E
50|$|One {{method for}} tying the bottle sling {{is similar to}} the loop-and-weave method used to tie the <b>jury</b> <b>mast</b> knot and the trumpet knot. The knot is begun by making a bight in a piece of rope and folding the bight back on itself to make two {{separated}} loops that are mirror images of each other. Lay one loop {{on top of the other}} so that they overlap slightly and create a cat's eye shaped hole above a triangular shaped hole between the two loops. Make a bird's beak with your index and thumb and weave them down through the loop, up through the cat's eye and down through the bottom loop, bunching the coils of rope against your fingers. Pinch the section of rope that was the bottom of the triangle and flip the coils over the pinched section. The flip may take a little practice, but the pinched section should become a short bight hanging off a circular shaped knot.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 August 1812, U.S. frigate Constitution chased a large vessel. Captain Isaac Hull, USN, {{reported}} that [...] "As we bore up she hoisted an English Ensign at the Mizen Gaff, {{another in the}} Mizen Shrouds, and a Jack at the Fore, and MizentopGallant mast heads." [...] After the ships had engaged each other, Hull looked {{to see if the}} enemy ship, which proved to be HM frigate Guerriere, had surrendered by striking its colors: [...] "not knowing whither the Enemy had struck, or not, we stood off for about half an hour, to repair our Braces, and such other rigging, as had been shot away, and wore around to return to the Enemy, it being now dark we could not see whether she had any colours, flying or not, but could discover that she had raised a small flag Staff or <b>Jury</b> <b>mast</b> forward. I ordered a Boat hoisted out, and sent Lieutenant Reed on board as a flag truce to see whether she had surrendered or not." [...] Captain James Richard Dacres, RN, of Guerriere reported the surrender in these words: [...] "When calling my few remaining officers together, they were all of opinion that any further resistance would be a needless waste of lives, I orderd, though reluctantly, the Colours to be struck." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nimrod was {{reported}} to have been off Payta Head on 13 December 1815 with 500 barrels. On 23 April 1816 Nimrod was off the coast of Peru with 1500 barrels of oil. In December 1816 the stroke of a whale drowned Day, the Mate, and a boat crew. Nimrod then put into Rio de Janeiro in distress. On 3 February 1817 Nimrod was off Cape Clear under <b>jury</b> <b>masts,</b> main top mast, and bowsprit. Under the command of Captain Thomas she returned to Britain on 26 March 1817.|$|R
5000|$|The Wetmore {{was built}} in 1891 as hull #112 of the American Steel Barge Company works. The Wetmore was 264 ft long with a beam of 38 ft and a 16.4 ft draft and gross tonnage of 3,000.

5|$|After {{carrying}} out temporary repairs in Abu Qir Bay, Bellerophon hoisted <b>jury</b> <b>masts</b> and, towing the captured Spartiate with HMS Majestic, sailed to Gibraltar for a refit. When this was completed {{she returned to}} Britain, arriving at Spithead on 2 April 1800, where she paid off and entered the dockyard for a more substantial refit in September. These works amounted to £32,608 and lasted until August 1801. She recommissioned on 25 June 1801 {{under the command of}} Captain Lord Garlies and sailed in August to rejoin the Channel Fleet, which was blockading Brest. Lord Garlies was superseded by Captain John Loring on 25 November, and Bellerophon continued on the blockade until receiving new orders in early March 1802.|$|R
500|$|For {{the next}} seven days, Bellerophons crew were {{occupied}} in repairing damage, rigging <b>jury</b> <b>masts,</b> and trying to ride out the storm that struck the area immediately after the battle.

25|$|Hotham then {{sailed to}} Leghorn, leaving Littlejohn behind with {{instructions}} for Berwick to follow when repairs were complete. Littlejohn raised the <b>jury</b> <b>masts,</b> but {{was forced to}} dismount a number of guns to improve stability. Delayed by contrary winds, Berwick, with an improvised sail rig, was only able to follow Hotham on 7 March, steering north out of San Fiorenzo Bay. Four days earlier, upon learning of Hotham's absence, Martin had sailed once more with the French fleet. His force comprised fifteen ships of the line, including one of 120-guns, two of 80-guns and the remainder of 74-guns, supported by seven frigates and five smaller warships. On board his flagship was a Représentant en mission from the National Convention, Étienne-François Letourneur, sent to provide political oversight for the operation.|$|R
5|$|As Southampton stopped firing, the {{remaining}} masts of the Haitian ship fell overboard. Casualties on Heureuse Réunion were immense: of the 600–700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from {{a crew of}} 212. Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary <b>jury</b> <b>masts</b> were fitted to Heureuse Réunion for the journey to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners for trial at Port Royal. Heureuse Réunion was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name Améthyste, returning to Haitian service. Yeo's action in attacking the Haitian ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.|$|R
5|$|At 19:00, {{delayed by}} {{the effect of}} the Rock of Gibraltar on the wind, the British {{squadron}} rounded Gibraltar and found the French and Spanish ships still assembling at Cabrita Point. The light wind prevented any rapid movement, and Saumarez began to slowly tack towards the combined squadron in line of battle formation.
