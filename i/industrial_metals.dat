5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{is a type}} of {{metallurgical}} furnace used for smelting to produce <b>industrial</b> <b>metals</b> and its alloys, generally iron, but also others such as lead or copper.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of lead—at 327.5°C (621.5°F)—is very low {{compared}} to most metals. Its boiling point of 1749°C (3180°F) is the lowest among the carbon group elements. The electrical resistivity of lead at 20°C is 192 nanoohm-meters, almost {{an order of magnitude}} higher than those of other <b>industrial</b> <b>metals</b> (copper at 15.43nΩ·m; gold 20.51nΩ·m; and aluminium at 24.15nΩ·m). Lead is a superconductor at temperatures lower than 7.19K; this is the highest critical temperature of all type-I superconductors and the third highest of the elemental superconductors.|$|E
5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) {{are by far the}} most common <b>industrial</b> <b>metals</b> because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>metal</b> {{developed}} in the late 1980s, as <b>industrial</b> and <b>metal</b> began to fuse into a common genre. In {{the early years of}} the 21st century, groups from the black metal scene began to incorporate elements of <b>industrial</b> music. <b>Industrial</b> <b>metal</b> did well in the early 1990s, particularly in North America, with the success of groups such as Nine Inch Nails. The <b>industrial</b> <b>metal</b> movement began to fade in the latter half of the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Around this time, veteran <b>industrial</b> <b>metal</b> artists (Ministry, Godflesh, and White Zombie) {{began to}} {{repudiate}} the industrial label. Sales remained high throughout 2000–2005; at least 10 million records were sold {{during that time}} frame. Many groups began to take influence from hip hop and electronic music, in addition to <b>industrial</b> <b>metal.</b> As a result, acts like Powerman 5000 are often described as <b>industrial</b> <b>metal</b> as well as nu metal.|$|R
5|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>metal</b> is {{the fusion}} of heavy <b>metal</b> music and <b>industrial</b> music, {{typically}} employing repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals. Founding <b>industrial</b> <b>metal</b> acts include Ministry, Godflesh, KMFDM, and Rammstein.|$|R

25|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>metals</b> {{are sold}} by the metric ton through the London Metal Exchange and New York Mercantile Exchange. The London Metal Exchange trades include copper, {{aluminium}}, lead, tin, aluminium alloy, nickel, cobalt and molybdenum. In 2007, steel began trading on the London Metal Exchange.|$|E
25|$|Bilateral {{trade between}} both {{countries}} {{is concentrated in}} key value chain sectors. These sectors include highly diversified segments such as machinery, electronics, aerospace, automobile, commercial shipping, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilisers, apparels, precious stones, <b>industrial</b> <b>metals,</b> petroleum products, coal, high-end tea and coffee products. Bilateral trade in 2002 stood at $1.5 billion and increased by over 7 times to $11 billion in 2012 and with both governments setting a bilateral trade target of $30 billion by 2025. Bilaterial bodies that conduct economic {{relations between the two}} countries include IRIGC, the Indo-Russian Forum on Trade and Investment, the India-Russia Business Council, the India-Russia Trade, Investment and Technology Promotion Council, the India-Russia CEOs' Council and the India-Russia Chamber of Commerce.|$|E
50|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>metal</b> is {{a musical}} genre that draws from {{industrial}} dance music, thrash metal and hardcore punk, using repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals.

50|$|Streetcleaner is {{the debut}} studio album by British <b>industrial</b> <b>metal</b> band Godflesh. It was {{released}} on November 13, 1989, on Earache Records. Being influential in the development in the <b>industrial</b> <b>metal</b> genre, the album was widely praised by critics.|$|R
50|$|Nomindsland is {{the debut}} album by the <b>industrial</b> <b>metal</b> band Red Harvest, {{released}} through Black Mark Production in 1992.

500|$|Iridium {{prices have}} fluctuated over a {{considerable}} range. [...] With {{a relatively small}} volume in the world market (compared to other <b>industrial</b> <b>metals</b> like aluminium or copper), the iridium price reacts strongly to instabilities in production, demand, speculation, hoarding, and politics in the producing countries.|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{had high}} {{expectations}} and obvious scientific talents, the first {{fifteen years of}} Eliot's career were less than auspicious. [...] He was appointed Tutor in Mathematics at Harvard {{in the fall of}} 1854, and studied chemistry with Josiah P. Cooke. In 1858, he was promoted to Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Chemistry. [...] He taught competently, wrote some technical pieces on chemical impurities in <b>industrial</b> <b>metals,</b> and busied himself with schemes for the reform of Harvard's Lawrence Scientific School.|$|E
2500|$|Mining {{exists in}} many countries. London {{is known as}} the capital of global [...] "mining houses" [...] such as Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton, and Anglo American PLC. The US mining {{industry}} is also large, but it is dominated by the coal and other nonmetal minerals (e.g., rock and sand), and various regulations have worked to reduce the significance of mining in the United States. In 2007 the total market capitalization of mining companies was reported at US$962 billion, which compares to a total global market cap of publicly traded companies of about US$50 trillion in 2007. In 2002, Chile and Peru were reportedly the major mining countries of South America. The mineral industry of Africa includes the mining of various minerals; it produces relatively little of the <b>industrial</b> <b>metals</b> copper, lead, and zinc, but according to one estimate has as a percent of world reserves 40% of gold, 60% of cobalt, and 90% of the world's platinum group metals. Mining in India is a significant part of that country's economy. In the developed world, mining in Australia, with BHP Billiton founded and headquartered in the country, and mining in Canada are particularly significant. For rare earth minerals mining, China reportedly controlled 95% of production in 2013.|$|E
