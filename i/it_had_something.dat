5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to do with naval guns.|$|E

500|$|The Air Ministry did {{not want}} to allow the enemy to learn of their {{airborne}} radar. German night fighters would not be equipped with such devices on a large scale until much later. A legend was created to explain his successes instead. As the first night fighter ace, they were allowed to publish his picture. The captions read that his eyesight was so exceptional it allowed him to see in the dark with the same visually ability as a domestic cat. It was also said that his diet of carrots provided him with vitamin A which allowed him to maintain excellent night-vision. The ensuing public adulation was detested by Cunningham, but he accepted the [...] "Cats-Eyes" [...] tag as a necessary deception. The propaganda story served its purpose for the populace when it was released to the public in January 1941. The success of night defences also told the Germans the RAF was either improving its techniques, or <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> new.|$|E
500|$|With {{the end of}} the war the Special Relationship between Britain and the United States [...] "became {{very much}} less special". The British {{government}} had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which it considered a joint discovery. On 8 August 1945 [...] the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, sent a message to President Harry Truman in which he referred to themselves as [...] "heads of the Governments which have control of this great force". Roosevelt had died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on subsequent administrations. In fact, the American copy was temporarily physically lost. When Wilson raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945.

500|$|The Times {{described}} the ceremony as [...] "a masterpiece", with The Daily Telegraph {{saying it was}} [...] "brilliant, breathtaking, bonkers and utterly British". The BBC's chief sports writer Tom Fordyce called it [...] "eccentric" [...] and [...] "tongue-in-cheek", saying [...] "no-one expected ... {{it would be quite}} so gloriously daft, so cynicism-squashingly charming and, well, so much pinch-yourself fun." [...] Two weeks after the ceremony Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian wrote that [...] "Boyle's spectacular, so beautifully executed and ingeniously conceived it lingers in the mind even as the closing draws near, stood apart from its predecessors thanks not only to its humour and eccentricity, but also because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to say." [...] Writing in The Observer, Jackie Kay commented that [...] "it seemed that Boyle had invented a new kind of opening ceremony, a concept ceremony, one that embraces big ideas as passionately as it does technical flamboyancy". The Stage said that [...] "Danny Boyle's spectacular and moving Olympics Opening Ceremony was undoubtedly the theatrical highlight of 2012".|$|E

500|$|Geisel gave varying {{accounts}} {{of how he}} created The Cat in the Hat, but in the version he told most often he was so frustrated with the word list from which he could choose words to write his story {{that he decided to}} scan the list and create a story based on the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were cat and hat. The book met with immediate critical acclaim and financial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001 Publishers Weekly listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling children's books of all time. The book's success {{led to the creation of}} Beginner Books, a publishing house centered on producing similar books for young children learning to read. In 1983, Geisel said, [...] "It is the book I'm proudest of because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to do with the death of the Dick and Jane primers." [...] The book was adapted into a 1971 animated television special and [...] a 2003 live-action film.|$|E
500|$|Creator Matthew Weiner {{conceived}} {{the script for}} [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] in 2000, while he {{was working as a}} writer for the sitcom Becker. The first draft of the episode was written as a spec script and was titled [...] "The Division". Two years later, Weiner sent the script to David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, although Weiner's agents insisted that he not proceed with his plans. Chase later recruited him upon first glance. [...] "It was what you’re always hoping to see," [...] he recalled. [...] "It was lively and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> new to say. Here was someone who had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism." [...] Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years to focus on The Sopranos. Neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the project until the commencement of The Sopranos final season. During that time, AMC began looking into the television market for new programming. [...] "The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series," [...] according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll, [...] "and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth MacDonald asserts, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is {{the book}} that made Dr. Seuss famous. Without The Cat, Seuss would have {{remained}} a minor light {{in the history of}} children's literature." [...] Donald Pease concurs, writing, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is the classic in the archive of Dr. Seuss stories for which it serves as a cornerstone and a linchpin. Before writing it Geisel was better known for the 'Quick, Henry, the Flit!' ad campaign than for his nine children's books." [...] The publication and popularity of the book thrust Geisel {{into the center of the}} United States literacy debate, what Pease called [...] "the most important academic controversy" [...] of the Cold War era. Academic Louis Menand contends that [...] "The Cat in the Hat transformed the nature of primary education and the nature of children's books. It not only stood for the idea that reading ought to be taught by phonics; it also stood for the idea that language skills—and many other subjects—ought to be taught through illustrated storybooks, rather than primers and textbooks." [...] In 1983, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, [...] "It {{is the book}} I'm proudest of because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to do with the death of the Dick and Jane primers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Undeterred by Apple's rejection, {{the group}} decided to plug another song {{which had been}} written as a {{possible}} B-side to [...] "Waterfall", a Godley/Creme composition entitled [...] "Donna". The song was a Frank Zappa-influenced 1950s doo-wop parody, a sharp mix of commercial pop and irony with a chorus sung in falsetto. Stewart said: [...] "We knew <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something.</b> We only knew of one person who was mad enough to release it, and that was Jonathan King."

Dalton Trumbo's troubles were that The Hollywood Reporter had publicly named him and a dozen or so other industry professionals as communist sympathizers, and that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) had seized upon this list as the starting point for their investigation into communist influence in Hollywood. [...] Paulette Goddard was a rising star at Paramount and the studio was heavily invested in her, but she was also at risk of being swept into the HUAC's investigation by virtue of her marriage to actor Burgess Meredith, whose communist affiliations were a matter of record.|$|E
2500|$|Chase Kolpath visits Alex at his uncle's house. Before disappearing, Gabriel Benedict {{had hired}} Ms. Kolpath to {{investigate}} the last flight of the Tenandrome, Hugh Scott's Planetary Survey ship, and then meet Gabe at a world near the Veiled Lady star cluster and pilot them to an unspecified destination. Alex's uncle disappeared before reaching his destination, and owed Ms. Kolpath a considerable sum. Alex agrees to pay what his uncle owed her and asks her to assist him in his investigations. From the planned logistics of the trip, Ms. Kolpath estimates {{that they were to}} travel from 800 to 1,500 light years distance. Chase doesn’t know Gabe’s objective, only that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to do with the [...] Tenandrome.

[...] Weiner and his representatives at Industry Entertainment and ICM tried to sell the pilot script to HBO and Showtime, both of which passed. [...] Lacking a suitable network buyer, they tabled sales efforts until years later when a talent manager on Weiner's team, Ira Liss, pitched the series to AMC's Vice President of Development, Christina Wayne.

I had the control panel in front of me, it's old hat now but we were the first to do it. There were pieces of rubber with silver paper on the back with a silver coil that moved up and down inside a magnet that produced a signal, so it was touch sensitive. I had 5 snares across the top and then ten tom-toms and then a whole octave of bass drums underneath my feet and then four lots of 16 sequencers, two on each side. There was a gap — to play a space — a tambourine, ebony stick, snare and three tom-toms. This was pre-chip days, back then you did it all with transistors. So <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> like 500 transistors. The electronic drums inside looked something like spaghetti. When it worked it was superb, but it was before its day, because it was so sensitive..." ...|$|E
