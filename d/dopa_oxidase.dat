40|$|Peroxidatic {{oxidation}} of tyrosine {{was directly}} demonstrated in tumor cells of Harding Passey mouse melanoma using dihydroxyfumarate (DHF) as cofactor: {{there was no}} evidence of oxidation of tyrosine by aerobic <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> (“tyrosinase”) in these cells. Peroxidative oxidation of tyrosine was correlated with a positive benzidine reaction and peroxidase-dependent oxidation of dopa to melanin. Melanoma cells with peroxidase activity were designated as type A cells. Many of the type A cells also demonstrated oxidation of dopa to melanin which was mediated by aerobic <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> (“tyrosinase”). In cells with both enzymes, peroxidase activity was present in melanosomes, whereas aerobic <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity was present in both melanosomes and in the Golgi-associated cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum (GERL). Without inhibitors, cells containing both enzymes showed reaction product in melanosomes and in the GERL after incubation in tyrosine, DHF, and hydrogen peroxide. After preincubation with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), new melanin was still formed in melanosomes, but was eliminated in the GERL; when catalase was present in the incubation medium, reaction product was completely eliminated in all areas. These results indicate that melanin in the GERL induced after incubation with tyrosine, DHF, and hydrogen peroxide was due to the action of <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> on dopa synthesized by peroxidase. Some larger, more heavily melanized tumor cells (type B cells) were present which had aerobic <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity, but no demonstrable peroxidase activity.

Dopaminergic substances or actions increase dopamine-related {{activity in the}} brain. Dopaminergic brain structures facilitate dopamine-related activity. For example, certain proteins such as the dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine receptors can be classified as dopaminergic, and neurons that synthesize or contain dopamine and synapses with dopamine receptors in them may also be labeled as dopaminergic.

Also, any endogenous or exogenous chemical substance that acts to affect dopamine receptors or dopamine release through indirect actions (for example, on neurons that synapse onto neurons that release dopamine or express dopamine receptors) can also be said to have dopaminergic effects, two prominent examples being opioids, which enhance dopamine release indirectly in the reward pathways, and some substituted amphetamines, which enhance dopamine release directly by binding to and inhibiting VMAT2.|$|R

The Me 8 cell line, classified as undifferentiated on the basis of cell shape, absence of pigment, insignificant <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity and presence of inhibitors of dopa-melanin formation, showed the lowest GST activity among the cell lines investigated. GLL 19 cells exhibited normal differentiation as indicated by the presence of dendrites, typical eumelanosomes, melanin granules and <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity. These cells showed the highest GSH content and the highest GST activity. The JUSO cell line showed incomplete differentiation, and its <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> and GST activities were intermediate between the Me 8 and GLL 19 cell lines. The sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to melphalan increased with their degree of differentiation; it was lowest for Me 8, intermediate for JUSO and highest for GLL 19. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) enhanced melphalan toxicity against Me 8 cells. Depletion of intracellular GSH with buthionine sulphoximine (BSO) resulted in a three-fold increase in melphalan sensitivity in all three cell lines. Our results indicate that melphalan toxicity is related to cell differentiation and GSH status of melanoma cells. Based on the observed relationship between <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase,</b> GSH/GST levels and drug toxicity, it is proposed that competition for the GSH pool between quinonoid melanin intermediates and melphalan could diminish drug conjugation and increase cytotoxicity...|$|E

Cytological and cytochemical analyses show that parenchymal pigmented cells of the spleen, like those of the liver, are positive to peroxidase and lipase reactions and have phagocytic properties. The observation of premelanosomes in various stages of differentiation, together with the demonstration of <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity in the melanosome proteins, indicate that spleen pigmented macrophages have endogenous melanogenic ability as do liver pigmented macrophages. Attempts to demonstrate tyrosine-hydroxylase activity in melanosome protein extracts from frog spleen and liver, using the same protocol as for mammalian tyrosinases, gave negative results. As regards the <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity revealed, some of its properties differ from the typical behaviour observed for tyrosinases from different sources. Peroxidase activity is shown in spleen and liver melanosome proteins with p-phenylenediamine-pyrocatechol (PPD-PC), and not with typical peroxidase substrates. Suitable inhibition tests revealed that <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> and peroxidase activities might be supported by two different proteins. Liver melanosome extracts display a very strong laccase (dimethoxyphenoloxidase) activity but spleen extracts do not.

In lower vertebrates melano-macrophage centres, clusters of pigment-containing cells forming the extracutaneous pigment system, are widespread in the stroma of the haemopoietic tissue, mainly in kidney and spleen. In fishes, melano-macrophage centres play an important role in the immune response against antigenic stimulants and pathogens. Hence, they are employed as biomarker of fish health status.

40|$|Mammalian {{tyrosinase}} {{as currently}} defined has two catalytic functions: 1) the oxidation of tyrosine to L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and 2) the oxidation of dopa to dopa quinone (1 - 9). Although an imposing {{body of evidence}} has been advanced {{in support of this}} interpretation, Okun and associates have recently chal-lenged the prevailing concept of the action of tyrosinase (10, 11). They have pro-posed that within mammalian melanocytes, the oxidation of tyrosine to dopa is mediated by peroxidase whereas the oxidation of dopa to dopa quinone is regulated by <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase.</b> In their view it is the coupling of peroxidase and <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> which accounts for "tyrosinase " activity in mammals; i. e., a tyrosinase with cata-lytic action directed toward both tyrosine and dopa does not exist.

The inhibitor is most effective when administered to synchronized cells in four pulses on successive days at 1. 8 X 10 - 5 M during the S phase of the cell cycle. Colcemid at a sublethal concentration, and growth on medium solidified with agar also evoked pigment production in this line, but a large number of other inhibitors of biosynthetic processes did not, under the conditions tested. The melanotic lines are active producers of tyrosinase (<b>DOPA</b> <b>oxidase),</b> whereas the amelanotic line produces an inhibitor of tyrosinase activity. Both enzyme and inhibitor are labile at 4 ° C and- 20 ° C, and decay of the inhibitor in homogenates of amelanotic cells reveals a low level of residual <b>DOPA</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity.

In the present study, the synthesis of 5 -S-CD was examined in human epidermal melanocytes isolated from dark skin type VI (MT) and from white skin type III (GT). The MT melanocytes showed the higher melanin content and <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity. In addition, they produced eumelanin as shown by their ultrastructure, and the solubility and UV/visible absorption of the isolated pigment. Both MT and GT cells showed high levels of 5 -S-CD (5. 5 - 6. 9 nmol/mg protein). 5 -S-CD was also detected in culture supernatants from MT cells; the secretion rate was estimated to be 2. 5 nmol/mg protein per 24 h. The role of cysteine and glutathione in 5 -S-CD formation was investigated by exposing the melanocytes to the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). A strong reduction in glutathione levels (4 - 8 % of the untreated controls) associated with an increase in cysteine levels (152 - 154 %) was observed. In addition, BSO induced a moderate increase in the cellular levels of 5 -S-CD (114 - 129 %) and a decrease in <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity (75 - 83 %). Our results indicate that the direct addition of cysteine to dopaquinone is the main source of 5 -S-CD in human epidermal melanocytes.

40|$|Animal peroxidases are iron-containing {{proteins}} that catalyze the oxidation {{of a variety}} of substances by hydrogen peroxide. Histochemically, the myeloperoxidase of granulocytes is the most easily detected (1). Tyrosinase (<b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase)</b> is a copper-containing enzyme complex capable of converting both tyrosine to dopa (slowly) and dopa to dopa quinone (rapidly) in the melanin synthetic pathway (2). Histochemically, dopa-oxidase activity is easily demonstrated. Okun and his collaborators, using various histochemical tests, have shown that peroxidases are present in mast cells, granulocytes, neurons, some melanomas, and possibly some mammalian melanocytes (3 - 7). These peroxidases are capable of converting both tyrosine and dopa to melanin. These workers have concluded that peroxidase, rather than tyrosinase, is pnmarily responsible for converting tyrosine to dopa in melanocytes and that tyrosinase actually possesses only dopaoxidase activity. Since these peroxidase studies were limited to mammalian systems, it was imperative that we make similar investigation of the melanocyte system of the fowl so that results involving enzyme activity in this species could be correctly interpreted. Histochemical tests were conducted using the melanocytes and granulocytes of three pigment mutations of the fowl. The results indicate that a copper-containing tyrosinase does exist in the fowl which is capable of oxidizing both tyrosine and dopa. MATERIALS AND METHODS There were two main groups of experiments.

40|$|The {{catechol}} 5 -S-cysteinyldopa (5 -S-CD) {{is produced}} in large amounts in metastatic malignant melanoma. To further understand the mechanism of formation of 5 -S-CD, we investigated the effects of thiol modulating agents and melanin precursors on human melanoma cells. Under standard culture conditions (0. 1 mM cystine), the cell levels of 5 -S-CD were highly correlated with the degree of melanization and the <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity of the four cell lines investigated (Me 8, JUSO, GLL 19, Swift). Inhibition of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis with buthionine sulphoximine did not affect 5 -S-CD levels in the low melanotic GL 19 cells. In contrast, the highly pigmented Swift cells showed a strong increase in the cell levels of cystine (CysH) and 5 -S-CD. When the cystine concentration of the growth medium was increased to 0. 2 mM, a similar situation of 5 -S-CD synthesis caused {{by an increase in}} intracellular CysH levels was observed in the Swift cells. The GLL 19 cells showed enhanced 5 -S-CD formation in the presence of 0. 1 mM L-dopa. This effect was associated with a fourfold increase in <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity. Our data clearly indicate that 5 -S-CD is formed in human melanoma cells by a tyrosinase-dependent mechanism involving the addition of CysH to dopaquinone. Based on the enhancing effect of buthionine sulphoximine on 5 -S-CD formation, it is proposed that GSH is not directly implicated in 5 -S-CD formation, but regulates CysH levels via the enzyme gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase...|$|E

Thus various bleach-ing cosmetics and medicines are being developed to control melanogenesis. Oxyresveratrol, (Fig. 1) one of the ingredients of Mori cortex, 2) has recently been reported to exert a potent in-hibitory effect on <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity of tyrosinase which catalyzes rate-limiting steps of melanin biosynthesis. Its in-hibitory effects were stronger than kojic acid which is cur-rently widely used in cosmetics. 3) At present, the production of bleaching cosmetics based on oxyresveratrol is dependent on Mori cortex extract, because the quantity of the ingredient is limited and an effective method of synthesis has yet to be established. 4, 5) Therefore, an attempt to search for alternative materials like stilbene derivatives, which have high bioactiv-ity and can be easily obtained, is warranted. This study was designed to examine the melanogenesis inhibiting activity of oxyresveratrol derivatives with a transformed connection chain between the two benzene rings and lower polarity for the development of optimal functional cosmetics. A new compound I, (4 -methoxy-benzylidene) -(3 -methoxy-phenyl) -amine, was prepared by a single step synthetic process.

A placental total lipid fraction (PTLF), the total lipid prepared from an hydroalcoholic extract of fresh term human placenta, was previously {{shown to have}} a pigmentinducing activity in an animal model. The PTLF contains sphingolipids which stimulate DNA synthesis and melanin formation with marked morphological changes in B 16 F 10 melanoma cells. In order to identify the mechanism underlying the increased melanin synthesis, B 16 F 10 cells were treated with PTLF to assess the catalytic activities of tyrosinase (i. e. tyrosine hydroxylase and <b>DOPA</b> <b>oxidase),</b> the key regulatory enzyme of melanin synthesis. Tyrosine hydroxylase (estimated by the release of 3 H 2 O) as well as <b>DOPA</b> <b>oxidase</b> (measured spectrophotometrically and also in non-denaturing gels), was stimulated significantly by PTLF. Western blot analysis demonstrated {{an increase in the}} expression of tyrosinase, tyrosinase related proteins 1 and 2 (TRP 1 and TRP 2) at the protein level and RT-PCR analysis revealed stimulated transcription of tyrosinase, TRP 1 and TRP 2 mRNAs in PTLF-treated B 16 F 10 cells. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide, inhibitors of transcription and translation, respectively, inhibited PTLF-induction of tyrosinase activity with a corresponding decrease in melanogenesis. In all cases, the response to PTLF was similar to that induced by a-melanocyte stimulating hormone, a well-known stimulator of melanogenesis. Thus, these results provide the basis of action of PTLF stimulated melanogenesis in B 16 F 10 cells showing that this placental extract is a strong inducer of pigmentation at the transcriptional and translational levels...|$|E

To date, as far as we know, there are no reports in the literature about the genetic system of tyrosinase as regards these melanin-synthesizing cells; we carried out the present study to analyze how the tyrosinase gene may function. We showed that the Kupffer cells of Rana esculenta L. do indeed have a transcriptionally active tyrosinase gene. Evidence of this was obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis carried out on both the liver tissue and the Kupffer cells in culture. Moreover, analysis of the cells in culture enabled us to observe that, by increasing the culture time from 0 to 72 hr, an appreciable increase occurred in the amplification products of the tyrosinase gene, {{as well as in the}} level of <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity and in the quantity of melanin in the cells. The results of the present study demonstrate that frog Kupffer cells possess an active tyrosinase gene and that the increase of the tyrosinase mRNA accumulation closely correlates with phenotypic differentiation, in terms of increased <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity and melanosome content.

The pigment cells in the hair follicles {{and the eyes}} of pallid mice have less mature melanosomes than those of black mice. In the hair follicles the pallid melanosomes were transferred into keratinocytes and became aggregated. In the eyes they were already aggregated within the pigment cells and were digested in acid phosphatase-positive lysosomes. The activity of acid phosphatase, a marker of lysosomal enzymes, was significantly higher in pallid hair follicles and eyes than in black hair follicles and eyes. Dopa reactions at light and electron microscopical levels indicated that the pigment cells in each tissue produced a large amount of <b>Dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> when compared with those in each black ocunterpart. However, the rate of hydroxylation of L-tyrosine– 3, 5 – 3 H was significantly lower in the pallid eyes than in black eyes, while this rate was significantly higher in pallid hair follicles than in black hair follicles. Immediate digestion of melanosomes within the pigment cells, i. e. autophagocytosis, seemed to explain the low activity in the pallid eyes. The diluted coat and eye colors of pallid mice are, therefore, not related to low <b>Dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity but to immaturity of melanosomes and high activities of lysosomal enzymes; these enzymes seem to digest many of these immature melanosomes and contribute to the diluted coat and eye colors of pallid mice...|$|E
40|$|Tyrosine is an {{integral}} component in scierotization and melanization, two developmentally controlled processes which are necessary for synthesis and pigmentation of the insect cuticle. Studies were undertaken to investigate {{the means by which}} tyrosine arises and, also, the nature of the reaction whereby tyrosine is hydroxylated to yield dopa, the subsequent step in both of the above mentioned processes in Drosophila melanogaster. It was found that phenylalanine is rapidly converted to tyrosine in vivo and the enzyme(s) responsible for the catalysis is readily extractable. The in vitro conversion is dependent upon the presence of tetrahydropteridine (DMPH 4), which is a cofactor in mammalian phenylalanine hydroxylase systems. Other common biological reductants are ineffective in this respect. The concentration of hydroxylase in the animal is developmentally regulated, the level building up during early third instar and peaking at puparium formation. Detectable quantities of enzyme are not found in pupae. The activity of the crude enzyme responds to the concentration of enzyme, substrate and DMPH 4 in a linear fashion (up to the point of saturation). Tyrosine may give rise to dopa via two distinct enzymatic means: tyrosinase or tyrosine hydroxylase. Drosophila are known to possess a very active tyrosinase system; however, this molecule also contains a <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> function which rapidly dehydrogenates dopa to yield dopaquinone, an irreversible step in melanization. In the absence of suitable regulation, this system does not allow for accumulation of dopa which is also necessary for sclerotization. Crude extracts are capable of supporting the conversion of tyrosine to dopa in a DMPH 4 stimulated reaction. A high concentration of pteridine also serves to arrest <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity in vitro. DMPH 4 is an essential cofactor for mammalian tyrosine hydroxylase activity. The rates of accrual and utilization of dopa (by <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase)</b> in crude extracts indicate that {{there are at least two}} synthetic pathways by which dopa arises. The ratio of the abilities to hydroxylate tyrosine and oxidize dopa varies as a function of the age of the animal, the highest ratio observed in early third instar larvae and the lowest at puparium formation. The activity responsible for catalyzing the hydroxylation of tyrosine behaves in a manner similar to tyrosinase under a number of conditions. Pure tyrosinase, which is derived by sucrose gradient centrifugation, catalyzes a DMPH 4 stimulated hydroxylation reaction. Multiple forms of tyrosinase are derived in sucrose gradients and heterogeneity with respect to substrate utilization is observed in these species, a situation which may have significance in a consideration of tyrosinase's involvement in supplying dopa for sclerotization. This possibility is discussed. Since DMPH 4 plays such a crucial role in these reactions (stimulation of hydroxylation and inhibition of <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity), the nature of these involvements was investigated. There are some indications that the pteridine is not functioning to stimulate the hydroxylation reaction by serving as a non-specific reductant (reductants, such as, ascorbate and DPNH are known to stimulate the hydroxylase activity of pure tyrosinase), but may be serving in a more direct fashion with the enzymatic mechanism. The nature of this interaction is discussed. Banded tyrosinase, using dopa as a substrate, catalyzes the synthesis of an unidentified compound. This reaction is stimulated by DMPH 4. The nature of this material and its significance to aromatic amino acid metabolism are discussed...|$|E

Two approaches were used to compare pigmented versus unpigmented cells: RPE cells were repigmented by phagocytosis of synthetic melanin; UVB irradiation was used to induce an increase in pigment in both RPE and CMs. Three drugs known to induce toxicity in the eye, tamoxifen, chloroquine and thioridazine, were used to assess the sensitivity of cells to xenobiotic drugs. RPE cells were more resistant than CMs to the cytotoxic effects of all three drugs by a factor of 5 -fold for tamoxifen, 7 -fold for thioridazine and 30 -fold for chloroquine. When RPE cells were repigmented using synthetic melanin, their sensitivity to tamoxifen was unchanged, they showed a slightly improved response to thioridazine (after 3 days of incubation with this drug), but they showed greatly increased toxicity to chloroquine (after 1 and 3 days of exposure to the drug), suggesting accumulation of this latter drug on the synthetic melanin. UVB irradiation was used to achieve an increase in the pigment content of both RPE and CMs. CMs were much more sensitive to UVB than RPE cells. CMs appeared to synthesise pigment via <b>DOPA</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity; RPE cells showed an increase in fluorescent material independent of any detectable <b>DOPA</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity. Irrespective of the nature of the pigment that UVB induced in melanocytes and RPE cells, their subsequent response to thioridazine and chloroquine was unchanged by the presence of this pigment.

Bloch's hypothesis prevailed until several decades ago when Lerner et al. (6) published their initial studies, which used manometric data obtained from crude extracts of mouse melanoma to provide evidence for the existence of a mammalian tyrosinase. These authors expressed the opinion that failure of Hogeboom and Adams (7) and Greenstein and Algire (8) to demonstrate activity toward tyrosine in their "dopa oxidase " melanoma fractions was because of their unawareness of the role of dopa as a required cofactor...|$|E
40|$|Techniques {{of single}} cell {{analysis}} {{were developed to}} study differentiated gene expression in fibroblast x melanocyte fusion products. Chicken embryo fibroblasts containing normal genes for pigment production were radioactively labeled with (2 ̆ 73) H-thymidine and fused with mitomycin C-treated pigmented B- 16 mouse melanoma cells. The resulting heterokaryons, incapable of division, contained one radioactively labeled nucleus, a second unlabeled nucleus and pigment granules. These cells were identified using the light microscope and assayed for pigment gene expression using the transmission electron microscope. ^ In a separate set of experiments the chicken embryo fibroblasts were radioactively labeled with (2 ̆ 73) H-leucine and enucleated {{by a combination of}} cytochalasin B treatment and centrifugation. Cytoplasts (the enucleated cytoplasms) were then fused with the mitomycin C-treated pigmented B- 16 mouse melanoma cells. The resulting nondividing cybrids, cytoplasmic hybrids incapable of division, contained cellular radioactive label, one mouse nucleus and pigment granules. These cells were also identified using the light microscope and assayed for pigment gene expression using the transmission electron microscope. ^ Pigment gene expression was assayed using a cytochemical test for dihydroxyphenylalanine (<b>dopa)</b> <b>oxidase,</b> the enzyme responsible for the conversion of tyrosine to dopa and dopa to melanin. Cells were scored according to the extent of golgi-related electron dense end product with a score of 0 representing no reaction product; 1 representing scant, vesicular reaction product; and 2 representing vesicular and cisternal reaction product. ^ The fibroblast x melanoma heterokaryons showed significantly less dopa reaction product than mitomycin C-treated whole melanoma cells, while the nondividing cybrids showed no significant change in enzyme activity compared with their control populations. Extinction of pigment production in heterokaryons agrees with the results found in hybrids using biochemical analyses and suggests that extinction is not due to chromosome loss in hybrids but is the result of gene control interactions between the two parent cells, in this case from different species. The presence of the intact nuclear membranes of the fibroblast and melanoma nuclei did not restrict the interactions resulting in altered gene expression. The maintenance of <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity in the nondividing cybrids shows that the fibroblast cytoplasm alone is incapable of suppressing pigment gene expression. Thus, the presence of the fibroblast nucleus is necessary to extinguish the expression of luxury functions in the differentiated nucleus. ...|$|E
40|$|Tyrosinase {{is one of}} the key enzymes in {{mammalian}} melanin synthesis. The pigment {{is produced}} in two different cell types: the pigmented epithelial cell of the retina, and the melanocyte, a cell of neural-crest origin. We recently showed that a fusion gene between regulatory sequences of tyrosinase gene (tyr) and the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ), when introduced into transgenic mice, resulted in embryonic expression in presumptive pigment cells but also in cells populations along the entire neural tube. This expression in the developing brain was striking, and we therefore asked whether this would still be detectable after birth. Transgenic mice carrying the tyr-lacZ fusion gene showed beta-galactosidase expression in adult brain. On Western blots, we detected tyrosinase-specific bands of 65 - 68 kDa in brain and eye. Using an affinity-purified antibody, we showed that detection of tyrosinase is specific and competed off by the presence of the cognate tyrosinase-derived peptide. However, neither tyrosine hydroxylase nor <b>Dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity were detected in protein extracts of brain. We therefore suggest that tyrosinase is present in brain but either not functional or catalyzing different reactions compared to pigment cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of pigment granules from melanocytes to keratinocytes was studied {{using a new}} living skin equivalent (SE) model in vitro. The model was constructed by plating human neonatal melanocytes onto dermal equivalent (DE) before it was overgrown with keratinocytes. The dermal component of the SE arises in vitro through the action of fibroblasts, which compact matrix proteins into a tissue. It becomes keratinized as keratinocytes migrate out of 2 -mm punch biopsies of human neonatal skin embedded in the DE; keratinocytes from teh biopsies covered the lattice in 14 days. A basal lamina develops at the dermal-epidermal junction in vitro. Exposure of some SEs to UVB irradiation for 14 days stimulated and enhanced pigment transfer. Pigment transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes was documented in light and electron microscopic studies. Melanosomes, identified by their pigment {{as well as by}} <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> staining, were dispersed throughout the keratinocty cytoplasm. We conclude that the SE model is valuable for studying the relationship between melanocytes and keratinocytes in vitro; since the SE has been shown to serve as a skin replacement, pigmenting it may be expected to increase its usefulness...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} the <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> (DO) activity of human hairbulb tyrosinase has been developed {{and the results of}} this method have been compared with the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity of hairbulb tyrosinase for brown-, black-, blond-, and red-haired subjects. The method takes advantage of the rapid trapping of dopaquinone by cysteine with the subsequent formation of cysteinyldopas which can be measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. 5 -S-Cysteinyldopa (5 SCD) and 2 -S-cysteinyldopa (2 SCD) were detected in the reaction products. Formation of 5 SCD correlated with the TH activity over the full range of hair colors and enzyme activity, while 2 SCD appeared to be formed nonenzymatically. The absolute amount of 2 SCD was constant for each individual but did not correlate with hair color or TH activity. The formation of 5 SCD was linear for 60 min while most of the 2 SCD was formed within seconds and did not change with time. White hairbulbs which demonstrated no TH activity formed 2 SCD, but not 5 SCD. We conclude that tyrosinase activity can be quantitated in human hairbulbs by this method, and that TH and DO are coordinate functions of tyrosinase over a broad range of hair color and enzyme activity...|$|E
40|$|Ultrastructural and autoradiographic {{analysis}} revealed the developmental genetic {{differences between the}} <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> positive pk and I mutations of the fowl. The differences were revealed {{by the results of}} five measurements involving homozygous mutant melanocytes, heterozygous melanocytes, and standard melanocytes at each of the loci. The measurements were: ultrastructural comparisons of melanosomes in pigmented epithelial (PE) and neural crest derived (NC) melanocytes, the number of 3 H-dopa and 3 H-leucine grains/µ 2 of melanosome, the 3 H-dopa/ 3 H-leucine ratio, and the percentage of cytoplasmic 3 H-leucine grains that were melanosomal. The pk mutation altered both PE and NC melanosomes. +/pk melanocytes were characterized by suppressed 3 H-dopa/µ 2 and 3 H-dopa/ 3 H-leucine values. +/pk cells, however, had the same percentage of melanosomal 3 H-leucine grains as the "pk" standard. The I mutation altered only NC melanosomes. +/I melanocytes were characterized by 3 H-dopa/µ 2 and 3 H-dopa/ 3 H-leucine values similar to the "I" standard. +/I cells had a lower percentage of melanosomal 3 H-leucine grains than the "I" standard, however. These data suggest that pk is a structural mutation affecting melanin binding to the premelanosome, while I seems to be a control gene mutation partially suppressing the production of premelanosomal components in NC melanocytes...|$|E

The clin-ical manifestations of THD are variable, ranging from early-onset lethal disease to mild Parkinson disease-like symptoms appearing in adolescence. Until 2014, approx-imately 70 THD patients {{with a total of}} 40 different disease-related missense mutations, five nonsense muta-tions, and three mutations in the promoter region of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene have been reported.

40|$|Cinnamoyl, p-coumaroyl, feruloyl, caŠeoyl aloesin, {{and related}} {{compounds}} were isolated from Aloe species. The antiin‰ammatory and antioxidative activities of these compounds were examined {{based on the}} structure-activity relationship. It was suggested that the bioactivities may link to acyl ester groups in aloesin, together with those of aloe-sin-related compounds. However, investigations using the contact hypersensitivity response indicated a preventive eŠect of aloesin on the UVB-induced immune suppression. Furthermore, aloesin inhibited tyrosine hydroxylase and di-hydroxyphenylalanine (<b>DOPA)</b> <b>oxidase</b> activities of tyrosinase from normal human melanocyte cell lysates. These results show that aloesin prevents not only UVB-induced immune suppression, but also could be a positive pigment-altering agent for cosmetic application. In preclinical study, aloe extract was investigated using phagocytosis and nitrob-lue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) reduction in adult bronchial asthma, and high molecular-weight materials, such as poly-saccharide and glycoprotein fractions, were identiˆed as active ingredients. The neutral polysaccharides, aloemannan and acemannan showed antitumor, antiin‰ammatory and immunosuppressive activities, and glycoprotein fractions with bradykinindegrading and cell proliferation-stimulating activities were identiˆed from the nondialysate fraction of the gel part of Aloe species.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of constitutively expressed tyrosinase (<b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase)</b> activity on glycosylation in lightly pigmented {{human melanoma cells}} (MM 96 E) was determined using tunicamycin (TM), which prevents transfer of oligosaccharide chains to nascent protein (core glycosylation), the glucosidase inhibitors castanospermine (CS) and deoxynojirimycin (dNM), and the mannosidase inhibitors deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) and swainsonine (SW). TM caused irreversible inhibition of tyrosinase activity and carbohydrate synthesis as judged by incorporation of 3 H-fucose. Tyrosinase in CS- and dNM-treated cells showed 50 % loss of activity within 5 h but recovered rapidly when the drugs were removed; dMN and SW had little effect. Expression of the tyrosinase 2 B 7 epitope and of an 80 -kDa melanosomal antigen (B 8 G 3) was inhibited by TM but not by CS, dNM, dMM, or SW. CS and dNM appeared to decrease the half-life of active tyrosinase. Overall, {{these results indicate that}} 1) in addition to the requirement for core glycosylation the removal of glucose residues plays a critical role in the formation of active human tyrosinase; 2) glucosidase inhibitors appear to cause an accumulation of inactive tyrosinase and increase the degradation rate of active enzyme; and 3) later stages in oligosaccharide processing are not required for maintaining tyrosinase activity...|$|E
30|$|Melanocyte {{functions}} and cell cycle are modulated {{by the rich}} dermal vascular and neural net works. A study of dendritic melanocytes at the margin of vitiligo, show a high enzyme activity which extends along the dendrites (Iyengar 1992 b). These cells show biphasic melanogenic/adrenergic differentiation as is also observed in the amelanotic melanoma cell line HT- 18 (Whimster 1965). The enzymes include tyrosine hydroxylase/dopa oxidase, dopamine oxidase along with the catecholamines, dopamine and noradrenaline activity. It was observed that the substrates of catecholamine metabolism modulate tyrosine metabolism, melanogenesis is enhanced by DOPA and tyrosine[*]+[*]DOPA, adrenalin and dopamine while cupric ions enhance catecholamine production as an autocrine feedback (Iyengar and Misra 1987). Melanocytes show membrane bound acetyl choline esterase (AChE) activity (Iyengar 1989). Acetylcholine (ACh) modulates pigmentation by inhibiting <b>dopa</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity in vitiligo during depigmentation, due to a decrease in melanocyte AChE, while during repigmentation esterase activity increases blocking thls inhibitory effect (Iyengar 1989). Skin biopsies from pigmentary lesions including melanocytic nevi and neurofibromas were also studied to assess neural dependence of epidermal melanocytes. Thus melanocyte functions are modulated by Ach, DA and NA in close association with dermal innervation as well as autocrine feedback by neurotransmitter substances produced by the melanocytes themselves, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes expressed in human skin melanocytes (Buchli et al. 2001; Plonka et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundNevus depigmentosus is a congenital, non-progressive, hypopigmented macule or patch that {{is stable}} in its {{relative}} size and distribution throughout life. The lesions are often single {{but may be}} multiple, circumscribed and either isolated, dermatomal or in whorls. The lesions are uniformly hypomelanoic but not amelanotic. The aetiopathogenesis of nevus depigmentosus is not yet fully understood. A defect in the transfer of melanosomes from melanocytes to keratinocytes has been reported. ObjectiveThis work aimed at evaluation of the clinical and ultrastructural characteristics of nevus depigmentosus in a trial to understand its pathogenesis. Patients and methodsThis study included 15 patients having nevus depigmentosus. Ultrastructural study was performed for 5 patients. 2 punch biopsies were taken from each patient, one {{from the center of}} the lesion and another from the nearby apparently normal skin as a control. ResultsThe lesions were mostly present before 3 years of age, mostly on the trunk. Six patients (40 %) had the isolated type and 9 (60 %) had the segmental type. Under Wood's lamp, the lesions exhibited an off-white accentuation without fluorescence. Ultrastructural study showed apparent reduction in melanosomal content of lesional melanocytes and keratinocytes. Immature and aggregated melanosomes were more present in lesional keratinocytes. Electron microscopic <b>DOPA</b> <b>oxidase</b> reaction was decreased in lesional skin compared to control indicating a reduced tyrosinase activity. ConclusionThe results of this study support the hypothesis that nevus depigmentosus is caused by functional defect of melanocytes and morphologic abnormalities of melanosomes...|$|E
