5|$|Most of {{the films}} noir of the classic period were {{similarly}} low- and modestly budgeted features without major stars—B movies either literally or in spirit. In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the Production Code ensured that no film character could literally <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>murder</b> or be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqué for the time.|$|E

500|$|Several {{critics have}} {{acknowledged}} Clair's influence on female African American lawyers Olivia Pope and Annalise Keating {{from the television}} dramas Scandal and How to <b>Get</b> <b>Away</b> <b>with</b> <b>Murder,</b> respectively. Clair's influence on fictional female lawyers in television, particularly Alicia Florrick's dual role as mother and lawyer in the legal drama The Good Wife, has been dubbed [...] "the Clair Huxtable effect" [...] by the media. Much like Clair, Alicia is often forced to defend her decision to work while raising her family. Pastes Shannon M.

Crediting Clair with pioneering [...] "the feminist, TV lawyer", the character's impact extends to include Diane Lockhart from The Good Wife and Abby Whelan from Scandal. Rainbow Johnson from the sitcom Black-ish is often compared to Clair.

Commenting at the time to NOW, Oberman said, [...] "I think Chrissie deserves to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>murder.</b> She was heavily provoked.
