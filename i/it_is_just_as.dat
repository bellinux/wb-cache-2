Both drugs are well studied for this condition, unlike other therapies, and are recommended for initial treatment. 25mg/day (low-dose therapy) is just as good as 75mg/day (high-dose therapy).|$|E

25|$|Acid jazz {{developed}} in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, influenced by jazz-funk and electronic dance music. Acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including Sampling (music) or a live DJ cutting and scratching), but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation {{as part of their}} performance. Jazz-funk musicians such as Roy Ayers and Donald Byrd are often credited as the forerunners of acid jazz.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} little known in cultivation. Tony Cavanagh and Margaret Pieroni rate its foliage as {{attractive}} and its flowers as showy, and state that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> attractive {{as many other}} large shrubs in its series. The species prefer heavy soils with good drainiage, and tolerates full sun or light shade. It has good tolerance for both drought and frost. Germination of seed {{appears to have a}} success rate of only about 50%; germination is rapid, often taking less than four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Reliability {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering applies to {{all aspects of the}} system. It is closely associated with maintainability, availability (dependability or RAMS preferred by some), and logistics engineering. Reliability {{engineering is}} always a critical component of safety engineering, as in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and hazard fault tree analysis, and of security engineering.|$|E

25|$|Just as {{uncertain}} is {{the nature}} of the sacrifices made there. Judging from the remains of the actual, relatively small fire altar inside the huge altar edifice, it can at least be concluded that its shape resembled a horseshoe. It was apparently an altar with two projecting side wings and one or several steps in front. Possibly the thighs of sacrificial animals were burned here. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> possible that the altar served only for libations— the offering of sacrifices in the form of incense, wine and fruits. It is likely that only priests, members of the royal household and illustrious foreign guests were allowed access to the fire altar.|$|E
25|$|Frank R. Freemon (1976) {{thinks that}} the above reasons given by modern biographers of Muhammad in {{rejection}} of epilepsy come from the widespread misconceptions about {{the various types of}} epilepsy. In his differential diagnosis, Freemon rejects schizophrenic hallucinations, drug-induced mental changes such as might occur after eating plants containing hallucinogenic materials, transient ischemic attacks, hypoglycemia, labyrinthitis, Ménière's disease, or other inner ear maladies. At the end, Freemon argues that if one were forced to make a diagnosis psychomotor seizures of temporal lobe epilepsy would be the most tenable one, although our lack of scientific as well as historical knowledge makes unequivocal decision impossible. Freemon cites evidences supporting and opposing this diagnosis. In the end, Freemon points out that a medical diagnosis should not ignore Muhammad’s moral message because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> likely, perhaps more likely, for God communicate with a person in an abnormal state of mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} first tested by a joint Norwegian-Swedish rifle commission. Their first tests were {{favorable}} but highlighted {{the desirability of}} a repeating weapon, that is, a weapon with a magazine. Several magazine-fed prototype rifles were built—Ole Herman Johannes Krag, the designer of the Krag–Petersson and the Krag–Jørgensen repeating rifles, designed two different magazines for the Jarmann rifle: one virtually identical to the magazine used on the Krag–Petersson, one which was the forerunner for the magazine he used on the Krag–Jørgensen. Jacob Smith Jarmann himself also made several prototypes, mainly with tubular magazines under the barrel or detachable magazines mounted sideways over the bolt. The latter was considered unusable in the field, {{and in the end}} a tubular magazine was selected for the weapon. The magazine is similar to the Kropatschek tubular magazine and may have been inspired by it, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> possible that the magazine is inspired by the Krag–Petersson magazine.|$|E

500|$|Released as {{an album}} under Virgin Records, the soundtrack peaked at No. 99 on the Billboard 200. More than 200,000 {{copies of the}} lengthy soundtrack were sold in France alone. Rodney Batdorf of AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, stating it was [...] "diverse and accomplished, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> {{effective}} outside of the film as it is within it."

500|$|Its {{importance}} {{is not limited}} to the historical information it provides, however. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> important a source for the early development of English. The Peterborough Chronicle changes from the standard Old English literary language to early Middle English after 1131, providing some of the earliest Middle English text known. Howe notes, in [...] "Rome: Capitol of Anglo-Saxon England", that many of the entries indicate that Rome was considered a spiritual home for the Anglo-Saxons, Rome and Roman history being of paramount importance in many of the entries; he cites the one for AD 1, for instance, which lists the reign of Octavian Augustus before it mentions the birth of Christ.|$|E
500|$|Sigtrygg {{may have}} succeeded his {{paternal}} half-brother Glúniairn as king of Dublin in 989, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> likely his rival Ivar of Waterford {{came to power}} in the city then. The Irish annals record little information about Sigtrygg, his family or Dublin during these first five years of his reign. [...] Benjamin Hudson claims this was because of the arrival of the future King of Norway, Olaf Tryggvason, who took up residence in Dublin for a few years after marrying Sigtrygg's sister Gytha. [...] Tryggvason had met Gytha while raiding along the coasts of the Irish Sea. [...] The presence of a powerful Viking leader in Dublin was a deterrent to Irish raids, and Trygvason may have weakened Sigtrygg's foes by plundering them.|$|E

500|$|Goldfinger {{received}} more positive reviews than Fleming's previous novel, Dr. No, which had faced widespread {{criticism in the}} British media. Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to be leaving realism further and further behind and developing only {{in the direction of}} an atomic, sophisticated Sapper." [...] Even when leaving reality behind, however, Richardson considers that Fleming, [...] "even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek, ... remains maniacally readable". Richardson picked up on two areas relating to the characters of the book, saying that Goldfinger [...] "is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming's museum of super fiends", whilst, referring to the novel's central character, observed that [...] "the real trouble with Bond, from a literary point of view, is that he {{is becoming more and more}} synthetic and zombie-ish. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> well." [...] Writing in The Manchester Guardian, Roy Perrott observed that [...] "Goldfinger...will not let [...] close admirers down". Perrott thought that overall [...] "Fleming is again at his best when most sportingly Buchan-ish as in the motoring pursuit across Europe"; he summarised the book by saying that it was [...] "hard to put down; but some of us wish we had the good taste just to try." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Psychology of Joss Whedon, two {{academic}} psychologists identify {{the source of}} Buffy's strength as her mother, paired with Giles' mentorship. Joyce did not know all along that Buffy was a Slayer and had difficulty accepting what her daughter was called to do. She was nonetheless always attentive and available when Buffy's confidence was shaken, and both Joyce's and Giles' devotion to her [...] "gave her the self-assurance to wield her power to its full potential". Joyce served as a parent figure to all of Buffy's friends, whose home lives were often unstable or unloving, thus making her death more poignant to all of them. Willow mentions her parents several times throughout the series, but her father is never seen. Her mother is portrayed only once in [...] "Gingerbread", at first as an academic so preoccupied with her career that she is unable to communicate with Willow, and then—with Joyce—under the spell of a demon and {{in the throes of}} moral panic, attempting to burn her own daughter at the stake for being involved in witchcraft. Xander's parents are described by him and those who have been to his house as alcoholic and verbally abusive. Even Anya, severely wanting in social graces, has lost someone she admires and trusts. Giles also grieves for the loss of a friend and—in one episode when the adults fall under a spell making them retreat into an adolescent state—a lover. Lorna Jowett in Sex and the Slayer writes that Joyce represents stability and normality. For the Scoobies, her death destroys the illusion that normal life is trouble-free; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> challenging as encountering supernatural forces.|$|E

2500|$|Seventh-day Adventists {{believe the}} name [...] "Michael" [...] is {{significant}} in showing who <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> [...] "Immanuel" [...] (which means [...] "God with us") is about who Jesus is.

2500|$|According to Constantin Gutberlet {{writing in}} [...] Catholic Encyclopedia (1911), materialism, defined as [...] "a {{philosophical}} system which regards matter {{as the only}} reality in the world [...] denies the existence of God and the soul", Materialism, in this view, therefore becomes incompatible with most world religions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. In such a context one can conflate materialism with atheism. However Friedrich Lange wrote in 1892 [...] "Diderot has not always in the Encyclopaedia expressed his own individual opinion, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> true that at its commencement {{he had not yet}} got as far as Atheism and Materialism".|$|E
