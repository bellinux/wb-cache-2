This study describes a methodology that was developed to understand when factors such as distraction and inattention may have been contributors to crashes and also describes some of the consequences of distraction and inattention in terms of subsequent driver actions. The study uses data relating to distraction and inattention from the SafetyNet Accident Causation Database.

30|$|Evidence {{regarding}} {{the nature and}} circumstances of PTW accidents comes from several sources. In the Motorcycle Accident In-Depth Study, or MAIDS [29], <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> covering 921 motorcycle accidents in five European countries suggested that some 60 % of motorcycle accidents involve collisions with passenger cars—exactly the types of collisions that the Powered Two-Wheeler On-coming Information System aims to prevent. According to the MAIDS data, {{over a third of}} these accidents (35 %) pointed to two main accident configurations: accidents at an intersection, where the colliding vehicles were following perpendicular paths, and left-turn accidents (right-turn in the UK and Ireland), where two vehicles were approaching the intersection from opposite directions and one vehicle cut across the path of the oncoming motorcycle. Similarly, Reed & Morris [30] found that of 283 fatal PTW accidents, 46 % occurred at an intersection whereas 54 % occurred away from an intersection. These figures conform to findings from the EU CARE database used in our calculations, which show that 41 % of fatal accidents and 46 % of injury accidents involving mopeds with vehicles occur at intersections, compared with 41 % and 54 % respectively for motorcycles with vehicles also at intersections.|$|E
40|$|At present, work in {{road traffic}} safety is {{expanding}} from injury prevention to include also accident prevention. For accident preventive measures to be effective, knowledge is needed about common causal {{factors that contribute}} to the occurrence of accidents. This paper aims towards identification of such common factors for a specific subset of all road accidents, namely intersection accidents. The data used for the study consists of in-depth investigation material from sixteen intersection accidents that have been investigated by a multi-disciplinary accident investigation team. Data analysis was performed using DREAM, a MTO based accident investigation method. The results indicate that cognitive bias, hidden information, inadequate design of traffic environment, and competing task are common contributing factors of intersection accidents. Also, the distribution of factors for different collision path scenarios was studied, and several patterns in the distribution were discovered. These patterns were then compared to the results of another study with a similar aim, but based on database statistics rather that in-depth data. The conclusion of the comparison is that the DREAM method, in combination with <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data,</b> provides a deeper and more detailed insight into how and why different factors contribute to accidents, and these insights are well suited for accident preventive work...|$|E

This is proving to be a major obstacle in the European Union (EU) since data are needed to both assess the performance of road and vehicle safety policies and to support the development of further actions by stakeholders. An analysis conducted by the European Transport Safety Council identified that there was no single reporting system in place that could meet all of the data needs and that there were gaps with regard to <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data.</b> This study describes the process of developing a data collection and analysis system designed to partly fill these gaps.

The typical level of detail recorded was a minimum of 150 variables for each accident. The study describes some analyses of the data in terms of accident contributory factors, ‘events’ during the accident sequence and occupant details.

In 2013, more than 2. 000 cyclists were killed in road traffic accidents in 27 EU countries, constituting almost 8 % of all road accident fatalities for that year. Although a considerable decrease by 32 % in the total number of bicycle fatalities in noted within the decade 2004 – 2013, it is still smaller than the respective reduction of the overall road fatalities by 45 %.

This study describes a methodology that was developed to understand when factors such as distraction and inattention may have been contributors to crashes and also describes some of the consequences of distraction and inattention in terms of subsequent driver actions. The study uses data relating to distraction and inattention from the SafetyNet Accident Causation Database. This database was formulated as part of the SafetyNet project to address the lack of representative <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> causation <b>data</b> within the European Union. Data were collected in 6 European countries using ‘on-scene’ and ‘nearly on-scene’ crash investigation methodologies. 32 % of crashes recorded in the database, involved at least one driver, rider or pedestrian, who was determined to be ‘Inattentive’ or ‘Distracted’. 212 of the drivers were assigned ‘Distraction’ and 140 drivers were given the code ‘Inattention’. It was found that both distraction and inattention often lead to missed observations within the driving task and consequently ‘Timing’ or ‘Direction’ become critical events in the aetiology of crashes. In addition, the crash types and outcomes may differ according to the type and nature of the distraction and inattention as determined by the in-depth investigations.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Transportation Research F [© Elsevier] and is also available at: [URL] some time now, it has been recognised that a major shift is occurring in the population age distributions of most motorised countries resulting in a growing number of older persons with an increasing need for mobility. It is expected that the mobility of older persons will become even more reliant on the motor vehicle as European countries in particular undergo transitions towards decentralisation and suburbanisation and because of the well-established longevity factor. This study compares injury outcomes in passenger car crashes for belted occupants of different ages. The study considers drivers and front seat passengers. National accident data in the UK show that whilst older car occupants {{are less likely to be}} involved in a car accident than younger occupants, in the event of a crash, older occupants are more likely to be killed or to sustain serious injury. This, in conjunction with the increasing numbers of older licence holder and car users implies that the protection of the inherently frail elderly should become a priority for the future. Analysis of the UK <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> revealed that the older car occupants were significantly more prone to serious chest injury than their younger counterparts and that these injuries were predominantly due to forces exerted by the restraint system, particularly in frontal impacts. Since by the year 2030 one in four persons will be aged over 65 in most Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the results suggest a need for intervention through vehicle design including in-vehicle crashworthiness systems that take into account the reduced tolerance to impact that occurs with ageing...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{pedestrian}} fatalities were reported in China since the 1990 s, however the exposure of pedestrians in public traffic has never been measured quantitatively using <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data.</b> This study aimed to investigate the association between the impact speed and risk of pedestrian casualties in passenger vehicle collisions based on real-world accident cases in China. The cases were selected from a database of in-depth investigation of vehicle accidents in Changsha-IVAC. The sampling criteria were defined as (1) the accident was a frontal impact that occurred between 2003 and 2009; (2) the pedestrian age was above 14; (3) the injury according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was 1 +; (4) the accident involved passenger cars, SUVs, or MPVs; and (5) the vehicle impact speed can be determined. The selected IVAC data set, which included 104 pedestrian accident cases, was weighted based on the national traffic accident data. The logistical regression models of the risks for pedestrian fatalities and AIS 3 + injuries were developed in terms of vehicle impact speed using the unweighted and weighted data sets. A multiple logistic regression model on the risk of pedestrian AIS 3 + injury was developed considering the age and impact speed as two variables. It {{was found that the}} risk of pedestrian fatality is 26 % at 50 km/h, 50 % at 58 km/h, and 82 % at 70 km/h. At an impact speed of 80 km/h, the pedestrian rarely survives. The weighted risk curves indicated that the risks of pedestrian fatality and injury in China were higher than that in other high-income countries, whereas the risks of pedestrian casualty was lower than in these countries 30 years ago. The findings could have a contribution to better understanding of the exposures of pedestrians in urban traffic in China, and provide background knowledge for the development of strategies for pedestrian protection.

Besides the identified Accident Scenarios (basic crash descriptions), this paper describes in short the method of deriving the Use Cases for car-to-cyclist crashes. Method Crashes involving one passenger car and one cyclist were investigated in several European crash databases looking for all injury severity levels (slight, severe and fatal). These data sources included European statistics from CARE, data on national level from Germany, Sweden and Hungary as well as detailed accident information from these three countries using GIDAS, the Volvo Cars Cyclist Accident database and Hungarian <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data,</b> respectively. The most frequent accident scenarios were studied and Use Cases were derived considering the key aspects of these crash situations (e. g., view orientation of the cyclist and the car driver’s manoeuvre intention) and thus, form an appropriate basis for the development of Test Scenarios. Results Latest information on car-to-cyclist crashes in Europe was compiled including details on the related crash configurations, driving directions, outcome in terms of injury severity, accident location, other environmental aspects and driver responsibilities. The majority of car-to-cyclist crashes occurred during daylight and in clear weather conditions. Car-to-cyclist crashes in which the vehicle was traveling straight and the cyclist is moving in line with the traffic were found to result in the greatest number of fatalities. Considering also slightly and seriously injured cyclists led to a different order of crash patterns according to the three considered European countries. Finally the paper introduced the Use Cases derived from the crash data analysis. A total of 29 Use Cases were derived considering the group of seriously or fatally injured cyclists and 35 Use Cases were derived considering the group of slightly, seriously or fatally injured cyclists.

40|$|The aim {{with this}} paper is to {{describe}} the procedure {{for the development of a}} common methodology for research accident investigation and identifying and training new research teams across Europe. In-depth accident investigation has a great potential to provide researchers, car manufacturers and road administrations with valuable information on how and why accidents and injuries occur. The data can be used to determine the issues where efforts must be focused when research studies are conducted, crash protection countermeasures are designed and policy decisions are taken. Existing European databases are mainly focused on regional or specific stakeholder interests due to the lack of an international network, and there are significant differences in the information collected and how the database variables are coded. This lack of harmonisation precludes any detailed global analysis on the whole EU accident situation. The EU co-funded the DaCoTA project - inspired by previous projects like SafetyNet and TRACE – intended to establish a Pan-European In-depth Accident Investigation Network and to create a European database that could include in-depth accident investigation cases from all the European countries. Built on earlier pilot investigations conducted by previous projects, and following consultation with the range of stakeholders, an in-depth accident investigation system has been developed to standardise and harmonise the data to be collected during the investigations. Based on the new methodology, accident investigation teams from across Europe have been trained to systematically produce high quality research data. A comprehensive, secure, web-based database has been created to centralise the information collected and to analyse the results from the cases. To ensure the harmonisation of the data collected, a pilot study and subsequent data quality reviews were performed. The DaCoTA project has developed a harmonised in-depth accident investigation methodology, openly available in an online manual. From 19 European countries, 22 organisations were trained in the DaCoTA accident investigation methodology. The web based database includes over 1, 500 variables related to the road, vehicle, road-user, accident reconstruction and injury analysis. Over 450 of these variables are considered as essential “core variables”. In total, 99 on-scene and retrospective cases have been collected by 18 accident investigation teams using the standard methodology and these have been uploaded to the database for further analysis. Good relationships have been established between the network teams and their local authorities, including the police and hospitals. In some countries, efforts to obtain the necessary permissions to gain access to the accident scenes and to acquire sensitive medical or forensic data is continued. The DaCoTA project has developed the Pan-European in-depth accident investigation methodology, including a network of investigating teams, providing a viable means for the systematic collection of harmonised <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> for use by researchers, road and vehicle safety related industries and policy makers...|$|E

40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} for the Department of Transport. This report identifies passenger car occupant safety issues that can be considered priorities for injury mitigation through secondary safety interventions. The results are relevant to a newer car fleet {{designed to meet the}} current regulatory and consumer test requirements. Some suggestions were made for secondary safety interventions but the general conclusion for all areas was that more understanding of the injury mechanisms, further enhanced biomechanical data, and improved dummy bio-fidelity were required before the most effective countermeasures (including both changes in regulation and vehicle design) could be determined and their respective benefits quantified. The main conclusion from this study is that whilst various priority areas have been identified and some secondary safety interventions suggested, the benefit that these would have in mitigating injury is unclear since some injury mechanisms are still largely undefined. It would be inadvisable to simply implement design solutions/develop new regulation without due consideration to the shortfall in current biomechanical knowledge and the limitations of the current test procedures/tools in predicting injury outcome under real world crash conditions. In addition to the main study, a pilot driver survey was carried out to gain knowledge of public opinion and perception of car safety as an influencing factor in vehicle purchase. This survey demonstrated a potential methodology but the results are limited due to the small sample size. This report is intended as a summary of the extensive work that has been undertaken for the project. There are a number of substantial appendices which document the in-depth research undertaken on which this summary report is based. The project was conducted in a number of stages. Issues have been identified through analysis of national and <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> sets, through workshops held with experts in the field of vehicle safety (Project Consultative Group), and through a review of the literature. Throughout the project consultations have been held with the Department for Transport. National accident data highlighted the continued importance of car occupant injury mitigation within the accident constellation. Further priority areas for passenger car occupants were then defined primarily according to the frequency of the injury, the cost to society of the injury, and through the existing knowledge base across members of the Project Consultative Group (PCG). A total of 18 priority areas have emerged relating to injury mitigation in frontal, side, rear, rollover and multiple impact configurations. Additionally, 6 areas were identified concerned with associated issues such as vulnerable road users. For each of these an indication of the extent of current research activity is given and recommendations made for further actions that could be undertaken to advance the current knowledge. Consensus was sought among the PCG members for 5 leading priority areas and the potential for injury mitigation through secondary safety intervention by means of vehicle design or regulatory compliance was explored by means of a workshop. These 5 areas were femur fractures in frontal impact, foot/ankle injuries in frontal impacts, chest injuries in struck side impacts, whiplash in frontal impacts and rear occupant protection in frontal impacts...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{this article}} the factors {{affecting}} fatality and injury risk of road users involved in fatal accidents are analyzed {{by means of}} <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> investigation <b>data,</b> with emphasis on parameters not extensively explored in previous research. Methods: A fatal accident investigation (FAI) database is used, which includes intermediate-level in-depth data for a harmonized representative sample of 1300 fatal accidents in 7 European countries. The FAI database offers improved potential for analysis, because it includes information {{on a number of}} variables that are seldom available, complete, or accurately recorded in road accident databases. However, the fact that only fatal accidents are examined requires for methodological adjustments, namely, the correction for two types of effects on a road user's baseline risk: ""accident size"" effects, and ""relative vulnerability"" effects. Fatality and injury risk can be then modeled through multilevel logistic regression models, which account for the hierarchical dependences of the road accident process. Results: The results show that the baseline fatality risk of road users involved in fatal accidents decreases with accident size and increases with the vulnerability of the road user. On the contrary, accident size increases nonfatal injury risk of road users involved in fatal accidents. Other significant effects on fatality and injury risk in fatal accidents include road user age, vehicle type, speed limit, the chain of accident events, vehicle maneuver, and safety equipment. In particular, the presence and use of safety equipment such as seat belt, antilock braking system (ABS), and electronic stability program (ESP) are protection factors for car occupants, especially for those seated at the front seats. Conclusions: Although ABS and ESP systems are typically associated with positive effects on accident occurrence, the results of this research revealed significant related effects on accident severity as well. Moreover, accident consequences are more severe when the most harmful event of the accident occurs later within the accident chain. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, the {{systematic}} efforts for gathering and harmonising road accident data at the European level {{have led to a}} significant upgrade and enhancement of the CARE database. Moreover, important data collection and harmonization efforts have provided very useful results as regards exposure data and safety performance indicators; however, the availability, completeness and level of harmonization of this data varies significantly. At the same time, additional data and related information sources have been established at EU level, including in-depth data, behaviour / attitudes data, programmes and measures data, social cost data etc., mainly in the framework of European research projects. However, these data sources are still not of sufficient comparable quality, are still not sufficiently linked, and the aggregate data are not always accessible. Finally, an important amount of national data remains unexploited at the European level. Consequently, there is a clear need for the consolidation of the various data (at least at an aggregate level) into an integrated system, a data warehouse. This will allow not only for better integration of the various data assembly processes, but also for the provision of a complete set of data services, with full documentation of the data and their sources, in order to support road safety knowledge and the related decision making. This data warehouse will be developed as a complete working tool for road safety stakeholders, for which not only a full description of the structure, format and content will be designed and specified, but also the related content will be provided, consisting in fact of a new system with road safety related data/information in aggregate form. The objective of the DaCoTA WP 3 is the development of the DaCoTA System, being a road safety data warehouse {{to be used as a}} comprehensive and integrated system with aggregate data and information consolidating, organising and making available all existing data and information, necessary for the support of the decision making. Aggregate road safety data concern road accident data, risk exposure data and road safety performance indicators, but also causation indicators (as those resulting from indepth data) and health indicators (as those resulting from epidemiological data). These indicators will be combined with additional information on other important aspects of road safety, as those related to behavioural, social and political aspects. In particular, an integrated approach for supporting road safety decision making needs to include quantitative information on road users' attitudes and behaviour, on road safety measures implemented, rules and programmes (including enforcement), and on their social costs and benefits. The expected outcome of DaCoTA WP 3 is the establishment of a solid but easily accessible, integrated road safety system that will allow for road safety policy and decision making to use a complete set of aggregate road safety related data (road accident data, risk exposure data, safety performance indicators, in-depth data, health indicators/data) and information (programmes, measures, legislation, social cost, behaviours/attitudes, regulations). During the second and last phase of the DaCoTA WP 3, the initially designed Data Warehouse structure, format and content were continuously assessed by the members of the CARE/RSPI Experts Group and the DaCoTA partnership during the entire project lifecycle and by policy-makers and other road safety stakeholders during the DaCoTA project Conference in Athens in November 2012. The Data Warehouse structure and content were finalised according to the feedback and additionally, a final set of national and international data and information was defined and gathered through appropriate templates, along with the related explanatory meta-data and the related links. Regarding the output interfaces three new, updated editions of the Annual Statistical Report for 2010, 2011 and 2012 were developed, as well as seventeen (17) Basic Fact Sheets on selected road safety topics. These statistical outputs are enhanced with additional non-CARE data that were gathered and were further included in the data warehouse, either in the form of interactive data (exposure data) or in the form of static data (<b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data,</b> health indicators), the necessary data/information for countries benchmarking and statistical analyses were defined in collaboration with the DaCoTA WP 4 (Decision Support) and data/information were provided through the Master Tables to other DaCoTA WPs to conduct analyses (WP 1, WP 4).

40|$|The CARE {{database}} {{brings together}} the disaggregate details of road accidents and casualties across Europe. It {{is based on}} the national accident databases maintained by all EU member states, taking account of the differences between national systems for recording accidents. It is thus a vital resource in monitoring the level of road safety across Europe, and for formulating approaches for reducing the harm caused throughout Europe by road accidents. Access to the CARE database is permitted only to a restricted range of users, so it has been important to develop a comprehensive range of publications based on these data that are accessible to the general public. This process was begun in the SafetyNet project that was carried out between 2004 and 2008 as part of the European Commission’s Sixth Framework Programme. The concepts of the Basic Fact Sheet (BFS) and Annual Statistical Report (ASR) were developed, and by 2008 one ASR and twelve BFSs was being prepared annually by researchers at five institutes and published via the SafetyNet website. The ‘Main figures’ Fact Sheet provided an overview of the accident data. The other Fact Sheets presented a range of statistics derived from analyses of the CARE database relating to a specific group of accidents or casualties, such as pedestrian casualties or accidents occurring on motorways. All Fact Sheets gave details of trends over ten years, with more detailed analyses of data from the most recent year. The Annual Statistical Report consists {{of a large number of}} Tables and Figures with data retrieved from the CARE database, without further analysis or comment. Only data relating to fatal accidents or casualties were analysed because of inconsistencies between national reporting of non-fatal accidents and casualties. One of the tasks of DaCoTA Work Package 3 has been to continue to develop this area of work. These twelve Fact Sheets have been updated and new content has been added. Six new Fact Sheets have been developed, and the set of eighteen Fact Sheets that were prepared in 201 2 is listed in Table 1. The partners involved in this work are listed in Table 2. One part of the development has consisted of adding details of accident causation to Fact Sheets where appropriate, based on <b>in-depth</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> collected during the SafetyNet project; this has been done for ten Fact Sheets as shown in Table 1. Another development in 2011 was the addition of a section ‘Road Accident Health Indicators’ to the Main Figures BFS based on analyses of data from the EU Injury Database. In 2012, health indicator sections based on analyses of the EU Injury Database were added to the nine BFS shown in Table 1. In addition a new BFS was developed dealing specifically with accident causation, based again on the SafetyNet in-depth data. Experience with the preparation of the 2010 Fact Sheets had demonstrated that authors needed more comprehensive guidance about style and content, so in the summer of 2011 one of the partners (TRL) developed the document ‘Design Principals for the Basic Fact Sheets and Annual Statistical Reports’. This guidance was followed by Partners as they worked on the 201 1 and 2012 editions. A central aim of road safety analysis is to measure and compare the risk of having an accident, so measures of exposure to risk are indispensable for providing the context for the accident and casualty data. Risk indicators are generally calculated as the ratios between accident or casualty counts and an appropriate exposure measure. Various indices exist that quantify more or less satisfactorily the exposure to risk of those travelling by road in a country, so they are related more or less directly to the number and type of road accident casualties in that country. These indices are typically divided into three groups: those relating to the people using the roads and their behaviour, those relating to the vehicles being used, and those relating to the road infrastructure. The range and detail of indices that are collected varies between countries. One of the tasks of DaCoTA Work Package 3 is to bring together the available files of exposure data to broaden the range of analyses of CARE data that can be conveniently be made. Where possible, these exposure data have been used to enhance the Fact Sheets. (Author/publisher...|$|E
