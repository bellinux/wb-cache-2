40|$|This study {{explored}} the information needs of adult <b>daughters</b> whose mothers had early {{breast cancer and}} illustrated the information Flows between the <b>daughters</b> and two information providers: patients and health care professionals (HCPs). Participants were 97 <b>daughters,</b> who completed a 30 -item self-administered questionnaire, a tool designed to identify the information needs of <b>daughters</b> and their communication channels. <b>Daughters</b> also completed the Miller Behavioral Style Scale, a scale {{used to determine the}} information-seeking behavior of individuals under threat. Descriptive statistics revealed that the information flows between women with breast cancer and <b>daughters</b> participating in this study were good. Most of the <b>daughters</b> received information from their mothers and asked their mothers questions. Few <b>daughters</b> thought their mothers avoided giving them information. The vast majority of the <b>daughters,</b> however, sought information from sources other than their mothers, indicating that the mothers alone did not satisfy their information needs. More than half of the <b>daughters</b> participating in this study accompanied their mothers to their medical consultations and received information from HCPs. Logistic regression indicated that the communication flows between patients, HCPs, and adult <b>daughters</b> of women with breast cancer depended on a number of factors, in particular, on the amount of communication desired by women with breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Data were {{analyzed}} on 2 to 6 yr old cows to evaluate sire and family effects. Cows were {{produced in the}} McGregor Genomics Project from 13 embryo transfer (ET) full sib families (n = 188, F 2 Nellore-Angus (NA)) and 4 half sib natural service (NS) families (n = 114, out of 1 / 2 Brahman 1 / 2 British dams) from the same 4 F 1 NA sires. The ET and NS cows {{were analyzed}} separately and together as paternal half sibs (PHS). <b>Daughters</b> of bull 437 J had the highest calving rate and weaning rate; <b>daughters</b> of 551 G were the lowest in ET, and <b>daughters</b> of 297 J were the lowest in NS. Calves out of <b>daughters</b> of 551 G were the heaviest at birth; those from of <b>daughters</b> of 437 J were the lightest in NS and PHS. Calves out of <b>daughters</b> of 297 J were the heaviest at weaning in ET and PHS, and those from <b>daughters</b> of 432 H were the lightest. Calves from <b>daughters</b> of 297 J and 437 J gained the most weight and those from <b>daughters</b> of 432 H gained the least. <b>Daughters</b> of 297 J and 551 G had longer and larger diameter teats and lower udder support scores (more pendulous) than <b>daughters</b> of 432 H and 437 J. <b>Daughters</b> of 437 J had the highest body condition score (BCS); <b>daughters</b> of 551 G were the lowest in ET and NS. Calves from <b>daughters</b> of 297 J had the highest BCS at weaning. Those out of <b>daughters</b> of 551 G had the lightest WWT, those out of <b>daughters</b> of 437 J were the heaviest in NS and PHS, and those out of <b>daughters</b> of 432 H were the heaviest in ET. <b>Daughters</b> of 437 J and 551 G scored the highest for disposition (least docile) in ET and PHS, and <b>daughters</b> of 432 H were lowest. The regression of WWT on weaning age was 0. 82 plus/minus 0. 07 in ET, 0. 71 plus/minus 0. 08 in NS, and 0. 78 plus/minus 0. 05 kg/d in PHS. There appears to be sufficient variation within and between these full sib and half sib families for use in QTL analysis for major genes affecting cow productivity in NA crosses...|$|R

5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{in order}} to {{maintain}} peace, established marriage ties with several rulers; his <b>daughter</b> was married to the Abbasid caliph at-Ta'i, while another was married to the Samanids and the Ziyarid ruler Bisutun.

Adud al-Dawla also had a younger son named Baha' al-Dawla. Abu'l-Husain Ahmad was supported by his mother and his uncle Fuladh ibn Manadhar as the heir of the Buyid Empire. However, Abu Kalijar Marzuban, because of his more prominent descent, was appointed as heir of the Buyid Empire by Adud al-Dawla.|$|E
