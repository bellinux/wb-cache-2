40|$|Business process {{re-engineering}} (BPR) {{is described}} as a management <b>fashion.</b> Management <b>fashions</b> <b>are</b> introduced on the market for management knowledge by fashion-setters, who are often consultants. Characteristic for management <b>fashions</b> <b>are</b> multi-interpretability and promises of performance improvements. The demand for and supply of management <b>fashions</b> <b>is</b> constituted in iterative cycles. By drawing on primary and secondary data, we show how Dutch consultants handle the management fashion BPR. They tend to be highly pragmatic in using this fashionable label. In close interaction with clients, elements of the original BPR concept are dropped and notions of other concepts are included in what are called “BPR-projects”. The label “BPR” is used for commercial reasons, yet it is easily decoupled from the original concepts and coupled to notions of other concepts. The consequences of these findings for the current literature on management <b>fashions</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R

Parasols, chunky Mary Jane heels, and Bo Peep collars are also very popular.|$|E

25|$|Buckwheat groats are {{commonly}} used in western Asia and eastern Europe. The porridge was common, and is often considered the definitive peasant dish. It is made from roasted groats that are cooked with broth to a texture similar to rice or bulgur. The dish was brought to America by Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish immigrants who called it kasha, and they mixed it with pasta or {{used it as a}} filling for cabbage rolls, knishes, and blintzes, hence buckwheat prepared in this <b>fashion</b> <b>is</b> most commonly called kasha in America. Groats were the most widely used form of buckwheat worldwide during the 20th century, eaten primarily in Estonia, Russia, Ukraine, and Poland, called grechka in Ukrainian or Russian. The groats can also be sprouted and then eaten raw or cooked.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{propelling}} {{factors of}} the explosion of hip hop onto the music scene in Japan is the fashion aspect. At hip hop nightclubs, often owned and run by Africans, one would find clubbers wearing hip hop clothing typical of American youth such as oversized shirts, Tommy Hilfiger jeans and baseball caps. This macho look is even found on the women. In Tokyo you {{are most likely to}} find the latest fashions amongst the youth including burapan, the black wannabe fashion. Shibuya is a center of youth culture in Tokyo, where hip hop's growing presence can be most experienced. Here many stores offer hip hop clothing including the Bathing Ape line. Bape has been worn by Pharrell Williams and other popular hip hop artists of America. The hip hop clothing available in many of these stores can be very expensive. Hip hop <b>fashion</b> <b>is</b> now also popular in the suburbs - although some people are only following fashion trends and are not necessarily into hip hop music. Hip hop's presence can definitely be seen on the youth of Japan as they use their clothing to express themselves.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fashion</b> <b>was</b> arguably {{a social}} {{phenomenon}} {{that emerged in}} Europe during early modern times, and this paper seeks {{to determine whether it}} was unknown in the refined civilizations of the East. The conclusion <b>is</b> that <b>fashion</b> <b>was</b> not a European invention. The analysis of the evolution of Indian, Chinese, and Japanese clothing systems underlines how these societies underwent phases in which, thanks to propitious economic conditions, the accentuated propensity towards consumption stimulated behaviour that challenged the traditional hierarchies of appearance, usually regulated by canons of a prescriptive nature. <b>Fashion</b> <b>was</b> not, therefore, a European invention, but it only fully developed as a social institution in Europe, while in India, China, and Japan it only evolved partially, without being able to obtain full social recognition...|$|R
