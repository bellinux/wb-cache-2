50|$|Dialyzers come in many {{different}} sizes. A larger <b>dialyzer</b> with a larger membrane area (A) will usually remove more solutes than a smaller <b>dialyzer,</b> especially at high blood flow rates.

40|$|The {{effect of}} PMMA-based protein-leaking <b>dialyzers</b> on total plasma {{homocysteine}} levels. BackgroundHyperhomocysteinemia is a well-recognized independent {{risk factor for}} cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Since homocysteine (Hcy) largely binds to serum proteins (80 to 90 %), {{in this study we}} investigated the possibility that polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) -based protein-leaking <b>dialyzers</b> could reduce total plasma Hcy (tHcy) levels in ESRD patients. MethodsTwo matched groups of patients (N = 13) showing mild to intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia on standard hemodialysis (HD) with conventional non-protein-leaking <b>dialyzers</b> were included. In the control group membranes were maintained the same, while the study group was switched to protein-leaking <b>dialyzers</b> (BK-F series; Toray, Japan) and studied for 6 months. tHcy was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. Proteins and Hcy were also measured in the spent dialysate. ResultsThe pre-HD levels of tHcy in the control group remained close to baseline values (26. 6 ± 5. 0 μmol/L), while in the study group at 1, 3, and 6 months they decreased from a baseline value (in μmol/L) of 25. 3 ± 5. 9 to 21. 5 ± 4. 5, 16. 9 ± 4. 0, and 17. 2 ± 4. 2, respectively (P < 0. 01 for values at 3 and 6 months vs. baseline). The intra-HD drop of tHcy (ΔHDHcy) slightly but progressively decreased during the 3 steps on protein-leaking <b>dialyzers</b> and a positive correlation was found between ΔHDHcy and pre-HD levels of tHcy. In spent dialysate samples from protein-leaking dialyzer–treated patients, the amount of protein-bound Hcy (bHcy) was approximately 10 times higher than in non-protein-leaking <b>dialyzers,</b> but the ΔHDHcy observed in non-protein-leaking <b>dialyzers</b> and protein-leaking <b>dialyzers</b> was comparable. Serum proteins and albumin were only slightly affected by protein-leaking <b>dialyzers.</b> ConclusionThis study demonstrates that protein-leaking <b>dialyzers</b> used with a pure diffusive technique significantly lower pre-HD tHcy (approximately 33 % of starting levels after 3 months of treatment) in ESRD patients. A possible underlying mechanism for this effect could be the removal of large molecular weight solutes responsible for a defective metabolism of the Hcy, as the removal of bHcy with protein-leaking <b>dialyzers</b> seems not sufficient, per se, to explain this steady reduction of tHcy levels in pre-HD...|$|R

In a follow-up study, <b>dialyzers</b> were evaluated for up to 25 uses. After 12 to 15 uses dialysate protein was 7. 9 ± 0. 8 mg/dl (N = 13), after 16 to 20 uses; 12. 0 ± 1. 2 mg/dl (N = 13) and after 23 to 25 uses; 19. 9 ± 2. 1 mg/dl (N = 5). Mean dialysate volume was 83. 9 ± 1. 1 liters (N = 63) yielding total protein losses of up to 20. 7 grams per treatment. Dialysate albumin losses, which were unmeasurable during the first use of the <b>dialyzers,</b> revealed a similar increase with reuse resulting in a mean value of 14. 4 ± 3. 2 mg/dl after 23 to 25 reuses (N = 5). Dialysate beta- 2 microglobulin (β 2 m) levels were 1. 05 ± 0. 13 mg/l for <b>dialyzers</b> bleached 10 times (N = 31, P < 0. 02 vs. < 10 reuses). A random sampling of <b>dialyzers</b> processed without bleach for 8, 14, 15, 24 and 25 reuses revealed minimal protein losses, ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 7 mg/dl with no relation to reuse number and no measureable albumin. After determination of the bleach associated protein losses, bleach {{was removed from the}} reprocessing procedure. Mean monthly serum albumin levels from all 44 patients dialyzed with the bleach reuse procedure increased from 3. 55 ± 0. 01 g/dl (range 3. 51 to 3. 59) for the 6 months prior to discontinuing bleach to 3. 79 ± 0. 02 g/dl (range 3. 77 to 3. 89) for the first 6 full months after bleach was removed (P < 0. 001, bleach vs. no-bleach).

50|$|There are {{two ways}} of reusing dialyzers, manual and automated. Manual reuse {{involves}} the cleaning of a <b>dialyzer</b> by hand. The <b>dialyzer</b> is semi-disassembled then flushed repeatedly before being rinsed with water. It is then stored with a liquid disinfectant(PAA) for 18+ hours until its next use. Although many clinics outside the USA use this method, some clinics are switching toward a more automated/streamlined process as the dialysis practice advances. The newer method of automated reuse is achieved {{by means of a}} medical device which began in the early 1980s. These devices are beneficial to dialysis clinics that practice reuse - especially for large dialysis clinical entities - because they allow for several back to back cycles per day. The <b>dialyzer</b> is first pre-cleaned by a technician, then automatically cleaned by machine through a step-cycles process until it is eventually filled with liquid disinfectant for storage. Although automated reuse is more effective than manual reuse, newer technology has sparked even more advancement in the process of reuse. When reused over 15 times with current methodology, the <b>dialyzer</b> can lose B2m, middle molecule clearance and fiber pore structure integrity, which has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of the patient's dialysis session. Currently, as of 2010, newer, more advanced reprocessing technology has proven the ability to completely eliminate the manual pre-cleaning process altogether and has also proven the potential to regenerate(fully restore) all functions of a <b>dialyzer</b> to levels that are approximately equivalent to single-use for more than 40 cycles. As medical reimbursement rates begin to fall even more, many dialysis clinics are continuing to operate effectively with reuse programs especially since the process is easier and more streamlined than before.|$|E

BackgroundHyperhomocysteinemia {{is an independent}} risk factor for cardiovascular disease in chronic hemodialysis (CHD) patients. Treatment with folic acid normalizes total homocysteine (tHcy) in {{only a minority of}} the patients. The present investigation has been conducted to study the influence of various <b>dialyzers</b> with different flux characteristics on the {{reduction of}} tHcy in the long term. MethodsTotal Hcy, folate, vitamin B 6, vitamin B 12, and albumin levels were assessed prospectively in 10 patients undergoing HD with high-flux polysulfon (PS; F 60) and 20 patients with super-flux <b>dialyzers</b> (N = 10 PS, F 500 S; N = 10 CTA, Tricea 150 G). Blood samples were collected before hemodialysis both {{at the beginning of the}} study and after 12 weeks. ResultsAt baseline, all the groups showed similar tHcy levels. During high-flux dialysis, tHcy remained stable. In contrast, during dialysis with both super-flux modalities, tHcy decreased significantly (F 500 S week 1, 29. 6 ± 9. 9 μmol/L, and week 12, 21. 5 ± 8. 5 μmol/L, P = 0. 007; Tricea 150 G week 1, 24. 4 ± 8. 7 μmol/L, and week 12, 15. 3 ± 3. 7 μmol/L, P = 0. 008). The difference between high-flux and super-flux <b>dialyzers</b> was highly significant (mean: high-flux increase 15. 6 %, super-flux decrease 33. 3 %, P = 0. 001). Multivariate analysis showed a significant effect of super-flux dialysis on tHcy (P = 0. 001), independently of the previously mentioned variables. ConclusionsOur findings clearly show that both types of super-flux <b>dialyzers</b> reduced tHcy significantly.

The compartmental {{distribution of}} the human anaphylatoxins C 3 a and C 5 a has been defined during simulated hemodialysis performed with various types of hemodialyzers. New cuprophan hollow fiber <b>dialyzers</b> were found to activate human complement very readily in vitro, while re-used cuprophan <b>dialyzers</b> displayed only modest complement activating potential. The C 3 a and C 5 a antigens, formed {{as a result of}} complement activation in these <b>dialyzers,</b> accumulated predominantly in the blood path and were not adsorbed extensively on the membrane surface or transported into the dialysate compartment. Cellulose acetate membranes also produced complement activation in vitro, but to a lesser degree than new cuprophan hollow fibers. However, these membranes exhibited a significant capacity to bind the anaphylatoxins to their surface. Polyacrylonitrile membranes appeared to be unique in that they not only failed to activate complement significantly, but they rapidly adsorbed large quantities of C 3 a and C 5 a. These findings demonstrate that hemodialysis membranes may differ with regard to their complement activating potential as well as their ability to remove circulating anaphylatoxins from the blood path. Clinical measurements of anaphylatoxin production during hemodialysis reflect these dynamic events...|$|R
5000|$|In hemodialysis, the patient's {{blood is}} pumped through the blood {{compartment}} of a <b>dialyzer,</b> exposing it to a partially permeable membrane.

This usually is done by applying a negative pressure to the dialysate compartment of the <b>dialyzer.</b> This pressure gradient causes water and dissolved solutes to move from blood to dialysate, and allows the removal of several litres of excess fluid during a typical 4-hour treatment.In the United States, hemodialysis treatments are typically given in a dialysis center three times per week (due in the United States to Medicare reimbursement rules); however, as of 2005 over 2,500 people in the United States are dialyzing at home more frequently for various treatment lengths.

Another cell aliquot was left within the <b>dialyzers</b> without circulation. Samples were taken at different time intervals and cells counted. Cells were labeled with tritiated glycerol overnight, and DAG was measured by thin-layer chromatography. Our data showed that cells tended to adhere with more efficiency to CU than to the synthetic <b>dialyzers.</b> Circulation in the in vitro dialysis circuit resulted in the rapid (5 min) formation of [3 H]DAG (CU 1. 95 -; PS 1. 34 -; PAN 1. 24 -fold increase over untreated cells).

With the dimensions typical for analytical <b>dialyzers,</b> there were only small differences between the laminar-flow and plug-flow models. The mixing-cup model predicted higher fluxes through the membrane {{than the other two}} models, particularly when the channel heights were increased. The theoretical results were compared with experimental results for dialysis of zinc(II) ions and the flow dependence agreed reasonably well with theory provided that the hydrostatic pressures were equal on both sides, and that stresses which could result in membrane bulging were kept low.

40|$|It is uncertain, {{given the}} lack of recent data and the {{inconclusive}} nature of previous data, whether ethambutol is cleared by hemodialysis using contemporary <b>dialyzers.</b> We measured serum ethambutol concentrations before, during, and 1 h after hemodialysis in a 75 -year-old Caucasian man receiving ethambutol for disseminated Bacille Calmette-Guérin infection. There was a mean 41 % decrease in serum ethambutol concentration during dialysis, confirming the hemodialyzability of ethambutol and the utility of drug monitoring in ensuring safety...|$|R
40|$|Backgound and Objectives: The {{observation}} of hazards during processing of hemodialyzers showed {{the need to}} study these events. The aim {{of the study was}} to identify occupational accidents and hazards recognized by nursing professionals in the reprocessing of hemodialyzers. Methods: It was performed an exploratory-descriptive study in a haemodialysis unit of a university hospital using recall. Six nurses and fifteen nursing technicians answered the questions about risks in re-processing <b>dialyzers.</b> Results: 44 occupational hazards were reported: 30 (70...|$|R
