5|$|Boydell's Shakespeare project {{contained}} three parts: an <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of Shakespeare's plays; a folio {{of prints}} from the gallery (originally {{intended to be}} a folio of prints from the edition of Shakespeare's plays); and a public gallery where the original paintings for the prints would hang.|$|E
5|$|Boydell's {{crowning}} achievement was his Shakespeare project, {{which was to}} occupy {{much of the last}} two decades of his life. The project contained three parts: an <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of Shakespeare's plays, a public gallery of paintings depicting scenes from the plays, and a folio of prints based on the paintings.|$|E
5|$|In the 1790s, Boydell began a large Shakespeare {{venture that}} {{included}} {{the establishment of a}} Shakespeare Gallery, the publication of an <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of Shakespeare's plays, and the release of a folio of prints depicting scenes from Shakespeare's works. Some of the most illustrious painters of the day contributed, such as Benjamin West and Henry Fuseli.|$|E

5|$|Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness is {{the only}} {{complete}} work of children's literature by the 18th-century English feminist author Mary Wollstonecraft. Original Stories begins with a frame story that sketches out the education of two young girls by their maternal teacher Mrs. Mason, followed {{by a series of}} didactic tales. The book was first published by Joseph Johnson in 1788; a second, <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition,</b> with engravings by William Blake, was released in 1791 and remained in print for around a quarter of a century.|$|E
5|$|The press {{reported}} weekly on {{the building}} of Boydell's gallery, designed by George Dance the Younger, on a site in Pall Mall. Boydell commissioned works from famous painters of the day, such as Joshua Reynolds, and the folio of engravings proved the enterprise's most lasting legacy. However, the long delay in publishing the prints and the <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> prompted criticism. Because they were hurried, and many illustrations {{had to be done}} by lesser artists, the final products of Boydell's venture were judged to be disappointing. The project caused the Boydell firm to become insolvent, and they were forced to sell the gallery at a lottery.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} William Shakespeare enjoyed a renewed {{popularity}} in 18th-century Britain. Several new editions {{of his works}} were published, his plays were revived in the theatre and numerous works of art were created illustrating the plays and specific productions of them. Capitalising on this interest, Boydell decided to publish a grand <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of Shakespeare's plays that would showcase the talents of British painters and engravers. He chose the noted scholar and Shakespeare editor George Steevens to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.|$|E

5|$|Such {{publications}} {{were followed}} by multilingual collections, of which the most ambitious was Alessandro Torri’s L'elegia di Tommaso Gray sopra un cimitero di campagna tradotta dall'inglese in più lingue con varie cose finora inedite (Verona 1819). This included four translations into Latin, of which one was Christopher Anstey’s and another was Costa’s; eight into Italian, where versions in prose and terza rima accompanied those already mentioned by Torelli and Cesarotti; two in French, two in German and one each in Greek and Hebrew. Even more translations were eventually added in the new edition of 1843. By that time, too, John Martin’s <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of 1839 had appeared with translations into Latin, Greek, German, Italian and French, of which only the Torelli version had appeared in previous collections. What we learn from all this activity is that, as the centenary of its first publication approached, interest in Gray’s Elegy continued unabated in Europe and new translations of it continued to be made.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of {{the play}} text was {{produced}} as a large-format artist's book by the Old Stile Press, with images and an afterword by the British artist Clive Hicks-Jenkins, in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In October 1996, Christopher Tolkien {{commissioned}} illustrator Ted Nasmith {{to create}} full-page full-colour artwork {{for the first}} <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of The Silmarillion. It was published in 1998, and followed in 2004 by a second edition featuring corrections and additional artwork by Nasmith.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{appearing}} in a collection, the individual stories {{have also been}} published as separate books: often in large-format, <b>illustrated</b> <b>editions</b> for younger children.|$|R

25|$|The Old Man and the Sea {{became a}} Book of the Month Club selection, and made Hemingway a celebrity.

25|$|Unlike a typeface, {{irregularity}} in the characters' size, style, {{and colors}} increases aesthetic value, though the content may be illegible. Many {{of the themes}} and variations of today's contemporary Western calligraphy {{are found in the}} pages of The Saint John's Bible. A particularly modern example is Timothy Botts' <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of the Bible, with 360 calligraphic images as well as a calligraphy typeface.|$|E
25|$|In part {{written on}} Burnett's visits to Buile Hill Park, The Secret Garden was first serialised, {{starting}} in autumn 1910, in The American Magazine, a publication aimed at adults. The entire book {{was first published}} in summer 1911 by Frederick A. Stokes in New York, and published that year by William Heinemann in London. Its copyright expired in the United States in 1987, and in most {{other parts of the world}} in 1995, placing the book in the public domain. As a result, several abridged and unabridged editions were published during the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as the full-color <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> from David R. Godine, Publisher in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|She also <b>illustrated</b> <b>editions</b> of Johanna Spyri's Heidi (1921) and Mary Mapes Dodge's Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates (with Edna Cooke, 1918). She was {{acclaimed}} {{as one of}} [...] "the {{very best}} artists" [...] for children.|$|R
50|$|Jacques Amyot's French {{translation}} is perhaps better known than the original. The {{story has been}} presented in numerous <b>illustrated</b> <b>editions,</b> including a 1937 limited edition with woodcuts by Aristide Maillol, and a 1977 <b>edition</b> <b>illustrated</b> by Marc Chagall. Another translation that rivals the original is that of Annibale Caro, one of those writers dearest to lovers of the Tuscan elegances.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, historians Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon, both {{based in}} Louisiana, {{published}} an edited and annotated version of Northup's narrative. Updated and <b>illustrated</b> <b>editions</b> {{of this work}} have since been published, including an adaptation for younger readers.|$|R
25|$|Two {{important}} cast {{changes were}} made for the TV version. David Dixon replaced Geoffrey McGivern as Ford, and Sandra Dickinson replaced Susan Sheridan as Trillian. The {{changes were made}} because McGivern did not suit the role visually, and Sheridan was unavailable at the time. Another new cast member was Michael Cule, who appears as the Vogon Guard in Episode 2. Cule had first appeared {{in one of the}} Hitchhiker's stage adaptations, performing no fewer than twelve roles. He reprised the Vogon Guard part in the 1992 Making of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy TV documentary, voiced the Babel fish, appeared in the 1994 photo <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of the book (as Prosser), and returned a third time as a Vogon Guard for the BBC Radio 4 Quandary Phase.|$|E
25|$|In 1908 a {{paperback}} <b>illustrated</b> <b>edition</b> of 128 pages {{was published in}} the UK by George Newnes for 6d. In 1915 a new hardback edition of 25,000 copies and 260 pages was issued by Hodder and Stoughton for 7d. In 1956 a second American edition of 241 pages was published by Random house, now risen to $3.50. In 1957 {{a paperback}} edition of 222 pages was issued in the UK by Beacon books for 2s 6d. In 1973 a hardback edition of 260 pages was published by Cedric Chivers Ltd. on behalf of the library association for £2.20. Another USA edition was produced in 1976 by Amereon House. In 1990 Leo Cooper published a further UK edition, and others have been produced. There {{have been a number of}} editions translated into foreign languages.|$|E
25|$|In May 1950, the Gilberton {{publishing}} company produced a comic-book adaptation of The Man Who Laughs {{as part of}} their prestigious Classics Illustrated series. This adaptation featured artwork by Alex A. Blum, much of it closely resembling the 1928 film (including the anachronistic Ferris wheel). The character of Gwynplaine is drawn as a handsome young man, quite normal except for two prominent creases at the sides of his mouth. As this comic book was intended for juvenile readers, there may have been an intentional editorial decision to minimise the appearance of Gwynplaine's disfigurement. A revised Classics <b>Illustrated</b> <b>edition,</b> with a more faithful script by Al Sundel, and a painted cover and new interior art by Norman Nodel, was issued in the spring of 1962. Nodel's artwork showed a Gwynplaine far more disfigured than the character's appearance in either the 1928 film or the 1950 Classics edition.|$|E
