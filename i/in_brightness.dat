5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> in stars. These dips <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> {{can be interpreted}} as planets whose orbits move in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. Kepler-11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets.|$|E
5|$|The disks of most {{stars are}} much too small in angular size to be {{observed}} with current ground-based optical telescopes, and so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation. By precisely measuring the drop <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> of a star as it is occulted by the Moon (or the rise <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> when it reappears), the star's angular diameter can be computed.|$|E
5|$|Y Lyncis is {{a popular}} target among amateur astronomers, {{as it is a}} semiregular {{variable}} ranging <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> from magnitude 6.2 to 8.9. These shifts <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> are complex, with a shorter period of 110 days due to the star's pulsations, and a longer period of 1400 days possibly due to the star's rotation or regular cycles in its convection. A red supergiant, it has an estimated diameter around 580 times that of the Sun, is around 1.5 to 2 times as massive, and has a luminosity around 25,000 times that of the Sun. 1 Lyncis and UX Lyncis are red giants that are also semiregular variables with complex fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>brightness.</b>|$|E
40|$|Baseline {{observations}} {{of the night sky}} <b>brightness</b> <b>in</b> B and V are presented for McDonald Observatory. In agreement with earlier work by Elvey and Rudnick (1937) and Elvey (1943), significant night-to-night and same-night variations <b>in</b> sky <b>brightness</b> are found. Possible causes for these variations are discussed. The largest variation <b>in</b> sky <b>brightness</b> found during a single night is approximately a factor of two, a value which corresponds to a factor-of-four variation <b>in</b> airglow <b>brightness.</b> The data are used to comment on the accuracy of previously published surface photometry of M 81...|$|R

5|$|The final {{instrument}} was the HSP, {{designed and built}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. It was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of variable stars and other astronomical objects varying <b>in</b> <b>brightness.</b> It could take up to 100,000 measurements per second with a photometric accuracy of about 2% or better.|$|E
5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> as one star passes {{in front of the}} other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Its great {{distance}} and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets {{can be extremely}} unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at {{great distance}} only to diminish <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> later. Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and {{turned out to be}} unspectacular.|$|E
5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral type A {{fall into a}} region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating variable stars. In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes. As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.|$|E
5|$|One notable amateur {{observation}} was {{by students}} from schools in Hawaii, working with US and UK scientists, who during {{the press conference}} took live images using the Faulkes Automatic Telescope in Hawaii (the students operated the telescope over the Internet) and {{were one of the}} first groups to get images of the impact.

5|$|Sirius appears bright {{because of}} its {{intrinsic}} luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic studies first {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This would require the planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Also called Aludra, Eta Canis Majoris is a blue-white supergiant of {{spectral}} type B5Ia with a luminosity 176,000 {{times and}} diameter around 80 {{times that of}} the Sun. Classified as an Alpha Cygni type variable star, Aludra varies <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> from magnitude 2.38 to 2.48 over a period of 4.7 days. It is located 1120 light-years away. To the west of Adhara lies 3.0-magnitude Zeta Canis Majoris or Furud, around 362 light-years distant from Earth. It is a spectroscopic binary, whose components orbit each other every 1.85 years, the combined spectrum indicating a main star of spectral type B2.5V.|$|E
5|$|Although fainter {{than its}} {{northern}} counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis {{are the two}} brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris variable in the southern sky. Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System—a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars R and TY Coronae Australis light up parts of the nebula, which varies <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> accordingly.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of such dynamics, Pleione {{exhibits}} prominent long-term photometric and spectroscopic variations encompassing a period of about 35 years. In fact, during the last 100 years, Pleione has demonstrated notable phase changesas a Be phase until 1903, a B phase (1905–1936), a B-shell phase (1938–1954), and another Be phase (1955–1972). It then entered a Be-shell phase in 1972. Then, the star developed many shell absorption lines in its spectrum. At the same time, the star showed a decrease <b>in</b> <b>brightness,</b> beginning at the end of 1971. After reaching the minimum brightness in late 1973, the star gradually brightened. In 1989, Pleione entered a Be phase and stayed as a Be star until the summer of 2005.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change <b>in</b> <b>brightness</b> of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E
5|$|Close to Gamma Corvi {{and visible}} in the same {{binocular}} field is R Corvi, a long period (Mira) variable star.
