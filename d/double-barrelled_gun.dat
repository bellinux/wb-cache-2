2500|$|Within the churchyard, to the {{south-west}} of the tower, is a stone {{marker for}} {{the grave of}} Henry Trigg. Trigg was the Berden parish constable {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century, and ran a shoe shop adjacent to Berden Hall in the village. On the night of 25 March 1814 two men from Bishops Stortford, a William Pratt and a Thomas Turner, broke into Trigg's shop to thieve leather goods. They were confronted by Trigg and his father. Trigg offered defence by disabling Turner, but after a Pratt attempt to shoot Trigg’s father with a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun,</b> both father and son made to escape. Pratt, using the words [...] "Now, damn your heart, I will do for you", then shot Trigg in the chest, killing him. A year later Pratt and Turner were captured by the Bow Street Runners, sentenced to death, and sent to the gallows. The words [...] "In memory of Henry Trigg of this Parish Aged 36 years Who was murdered March 25th 1814 endeavouring to protect his property" [...] were recorded as written on the tombstone. Following the execution of Pratt and Turner, a postscript was reportedly added to Trigg’s stone: [...] "March 13th 1815 Wm Pratt, Thos Turner Both of Bishops Stortford, Herts. Were executed at Chelmsford for the above offence on their own confession".|$|E
60|$|It {{could not}} be the trump of doom, unless the trumping of doom went off like a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
60|$|A <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun</b> and pointers, {{and leave}} to shoot three Wellington College boys a week (not more) in case black game was scarce.|$|E
6000|$|The {{brothers}} Skyd {{and company}} proved themselves {{equal to the}} occasion, for they received him at the cavern mouth with the muzzles of four <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns,</b> and a stern order to halt! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly; and {{my brother}} shall remain with José. With his rifle and the two <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> and José's musket they could hold the ravine against {{anything}} but a rush of the whole tribe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we have {{certainly}} lost our <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns,</b> but our rifles and pistols are {{hidden in the}} straw of {{the bed in the}} room where we slept. We had just time to hide them before the brigands burst into the room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There iss noise enough--what-e-ver!" [...] remarked Skipper McPherson, who {{sat beside}} the keeper with a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun</b> charged with buckshot, {{which he had}} in readiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{are your}} arms, nephew?" [...] exclaimed Oldbuck--"where is your <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun,</b> {{that was never}} out of your hand {{when there was no}} {{occasion}} for such vanities?" ...|$|E
60|$|An {{ordinary}} breech-loading, <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun</b> {{was produced}} {{from behind the}} counter, and after some bargaining a trade was {{made on the basis}} of eight dollars for the weapon and sixty cartridges.|$|E
60|$|A large {{supply of}} the fireballs had {{been placed on the}} {{platforms}} and, as these were lighted and thrown down, the assailants were exposed to a deadly shower of arrows as they rushed forward. At this moment the rajah's servant brought up four <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the least fear of their attacking us, and with our rifles and <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> and pistols we could beat them off if they did. I can't see any better way {{of getting out of}} this scrape, and am quite willing to adopt this plan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have plenty}} of money, Dias, for I find two {{remittances}} from home awaiting me here. We have already bought two <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> and a stock of ammunition, principally buck-shot, for we shall not be doing much big game shooting. We can always buy food at the sea-side villages." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hardy {{had already}} an {{excellent}} <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun,</b> {{and he had}} now purchased a long and heavy rifle carrying a conical ball. In addition to the boys' carbines, he had bought them each a light <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun.</b> Besides these were two brace of Colt's revolving pistols. These were all new; but there were in addition two or three second-hand double-barrelled guns {{for the use of}} his servants, in case of necessity, and three light rifles of the sort used for rook-shooting. Altogether, it was quite an armoury. The carbines were in neat cases; and the boys carried these and a box of cartridges, while Mr. Hardy took his rifle; and so they started off to their shooting ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you shoot?" [...] asked Hans, laying {{his hand}} on his companion's <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun,</b> which lay on the ground between them, and which, with its {{delicate}} proportions and percussion-locks, formed a striking contrast to the battered, heavy, flint-lock weapon of the Dutchman.|$|E
6000|$|We found Hans, {{who had not}} {{accompanied}} us, being {{a little}} shy of appearing in public just then, engaged in cleaning the rifles, and this reminded me of something. Taking the <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun</b> of which I have spoken, I called Mavovo {{and handed it to}} him, saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{keep them}} from firing the pile as long as I can. The count has two <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns.</b> I don't want to use them, if I can help it; but they shall not get in here. Do you stop, and help next door. There can be no {{fighting}} here yet for, if they do burn the door, {{it will be a}} long time before they can get in." ...|$|R
6000|$|As they {{advanced}} {{into the}} passage {{there was a}} strange and sudden clamour, a roaring sound mingled with sharp shrieks and strange little piping squeaks. Maria ran back with a shriek of alarm, {{and there was a}} strange rush overhead. The torches were both extinguished, and Harry and his brother discharged their rifles almost at the same moment. Dias burst into a shout of laughter as they both dropped their weapons and swung their <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> forward. [...] "What on earth is it, Dias?" ...|$|R
60|$|Issuing forth armed {{only with}} our <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> and heavy hunting-knives, we hastened towards the native village. When within {{a hundred yards}} of {{the edge of the}} wood that skirted it we stopped to pull off our shoes, for it was {{necessary}} that we should have nothing about our persons to tell who we were should any one chance to see us as we ran. We also left our rifles beside the shoes at a spot where we could find them in an instant in passing, and then slowly approached the outskirts of the village.|$|R
60|$|Freeman and Trueman, {{who were}} at hand, were summoned to show their lord's <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun,</b> and his pistols with hair-triggers. This they did, with that stupid {{composure}} and dogged conceit which distinguish English servants in situations which must elicit from all other persons some ebullition of feeling.|$|E
6000|$|... "As soon as Macdonell {{saw this}} he rose up quietly, {{but with a}} {{look on his face}} sich as I never see in a man 'xcept when he means to stick at nothin'. He got hold of his <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun,</b> an' stuck a scalpin' knife an' an axe in his belt.|$|E
60|$|I {{dropped the}} handle. Ukridge dropped the jug. Mrs. Ukridge dropped her tea-cup. At the window, with a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun</b> in his hands, stood a short, square, {{red-headed}} man. The muzzle of his gun, which {{rested on the}} sill, was pointing {{in a straight line}} at the third button of my waistcoat.|$|E
60|$|He and José at once {{went up to}} the mules, {{and stood}} {{perfectly}} quiet at their head. Harry and Bertie moved closely up, laid their <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> beside them, and then sat down. By this time forty or fifty of the peccaries had issued from the trees; some were rooting among the herbage, others stood perfectly quiet, staring at the group on the rise above them. Seeing no movement among them nor any sign of hostility, they joined the others in their search for food, and in {{a quarter of an hour}} the whole herd had moved off along the edge of the forest.|$|R
60|$|Although he had {{not gone}} out that day to shoot, but to botanise, he carried a light <b>double-barrelled</b> shot <b>gun,</b> in case he might get {{a chance at a}} hare, which was always {{acceptable}} to the lady of Kinlossie.|$|R
50|$|Hazard, under Acting-Commander Robertson, {{operated}} in the Bay of Islands in New Zealand during the Flagstaff War in 1845. Hazard {{was in the}} Bay of Islands on 11 March 1845 when a force of about 600 Māori armed with muskets, <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> and tomahawks attacked Kororareka (as Russell was then known). Royal Marines and sailors from Hazard {{took part in the}} fighting ashore aiding a detachment of the 96th Regt. during the Battle of Kororāreka. The Hazard lost 6 men killed and 8 wounded. Lieutenant George Philpotts ordered the bombardment of Kororāreka. The next morning, all surviving inhabitants of Kororareka sailed for Auckland in the Hazard, the 21-gun United States corvette , the Government brigantine Victoria and the schooner Dolphin.|$|R
60|$|Going down on {{one knee}} and resting his left arm on the other, in what is known to volunteers as the Hythe position, the little youth calmly {{levelled}} his <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun.</b> It was charged only with small shot, and he knew that that was useless at long range, therefore he restrained himself and waited.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped short}} on looking round, and, observing {{that the two}} men were {{standing}} on the shore, seized a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun.</b> The stream had carried the canoe a considerable distance below the spot where the murder had been attempted, but they were still within range. Without a moment's hesitation Disco took deliberate aim at them and fired.|$|E
60|$|First, they ransacked the tents, {{where they}} {{discovered}} all the guns {{that had been}} taken from Bertram's party. These they tied up in a bundle, after each had secured one for his own use. Among them the artist found, to his intense delight, his own <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun,</b> the loss of which he had mourned most sincerely.|$|E
6000|$|I {{did my best}} to put {{a better}} spirit in him but without avail. He only wrung my hand warmly, said that it was a {{pleasure}} to have known such a [...] "real gentleman" [...] as myself, and expressed a hope that I might get out of this hell and live to a green old age amongst Christians. Then he wiped away a tear with the cuff of his coat, touched his hat in the orthodox fashion and departed. Their outfit, I should add, was very simple: some food in bags, a flask of spirits, two <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> that would shoot either shot or ball, a bull's-eye lantern, matches and their pistols.|$|R
5000|$|The {{uprising}} {{began when}} the flagpole was cut down {{for the fourth time}} at dawn on Tuesday 11 March 1845. A force of about 600 Māori armed with muskets, <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> and tomahawks attacked Kororareka. Heke's warriors attacked the guard post, killing all the defenders, and Heke cut down the flagstaff. At the same time, possibly as a diversion, Te Ruki Kawiti and his men attacked the town of Kororareka. The survivors from the 250 soldiers and settlers abandoned the town as [...] bombarded Heke's warriors with cannon. Heke's men then raided the town taking anything useful they could find. Heke's order that the southern part of Korororeka remain untouched resulted in the Anglican and Catholic churches being undamaged.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have none}} of us the least idea what will be required," [...] she said. [...] "It will be far better to pay {{somewhat}} higher prices for what we really do want out there than to cumber ourselves {{with all sorts of}} things that may be useless to us. We have already a considerable amount of baggage. There are our clothes, linen, and books, your father's two <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns,</b> which, by the way, I do not think he has ever used since we have been married. The only thing we had better get, as far as I see, will be four rifles, which no doubt we can buy cheap second-hand, and four revolvers.|$|R
60|$|Without speaking, Big Tim {{began to}} buckle on the cavalry sabre, {{not in the}} loosely-swinging cavalry fashion, but closely and firmly to his side, with his broad waistbelt, so {{that it might not}} impede his movements. He then {{selected}} from the arms a short <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun,</b> and, slinging a powder-horn and shot-pouch over his shoulders, prepared to depart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Old tree go flop! Glad he no flop on us, thanks be to Little Bonsa. Get on, you lazy nigger dog. Who pay {{you stand}} there and snivel? Get on or I blow out your stupid skull," [...] and he brought the muzzle of the full-cocked, <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun</b> into sharp contact with {{that part of the}} terrified porter's anatomy.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Rachel," [...] said Ishmael, {{whose face}} was white with fury, [...] "I think I {{will take you}} at your word, {{and you can go}} to look for him down below, if you like, for if I am not to get you here, he shan't. Now then, say your prayers, Mr. Darrien," [...] and {{stepping}} forward slowly he cocked the <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I {{understand}} that you wish me to give you one of my good guns with two mouths to it (i.e. <b>double-barrelled),</b> a <b>gun</b> worth at least twelve oxen, for nothing, O Saduko?" [...] I asked in a cold and scandalised voice.|$|R
2500|$|The {{uprising}} {{began when}} the flagpole was cut down {{for the fourth time}} at dawn on Tuesday 11 March 1845.

6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} {{occasion}} for that, Dias. We have quite made up our minds to wait here for a week before starting on our next expedition, so if you will come over in four days that will be quite soon enough. You can overhaul the blankets and bags, and see that those good enough to keep are put in good repair, and those worn out replaced. We shall want quite as many stores as those we took last time, for {{there are very few}} villages except on the sea-shore, and we shall find difficulty in replenishing our stock. We shall have to buy <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>guns</b> in place of those we lost, but that we shall do ourselves. We have plenty of ammunition and cartridges for the rifles and pistols, but we had only a few shot cartridges left when we lost the guns." ...|$|R
