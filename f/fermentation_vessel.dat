25|$|Vouvray {{produces}} {{more than a}} million cases of wine a year. The traditional style of winemaking in Vouvray is a minimalist approach, often using neutral <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessel</b> such as stainless steel and not submitting the wine to malolactic fermentation. While some winemakers are experimenting with oak, very few wines are made with new oak. Vouvrays are usually bottled early and expected to age in the wine bottle. Sparkling wines are made according to the traditional method and can either be pétillant (semi-sparkling) or mousseux (fully sparkling).|$|E
25|$|Primary {{fermentation}} {{usually takes}} 2856 days, {{after which the}} must is placed in a secondary <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessel</b> for 6–9 months of aging. Durations of primary and secondary fermentation producing satisfactory mead may vary considerably according to numerous factors, such as floral origin of the honey and its natural sugar and microorganism contents, must water percentage, pH, additives used, and strain of yeast, among others. Although supplementation of the must with nitrogen, salt or vitamins has been tested to improve mead qualities, {{there is no evidence}} that adding nutrients reduced fermentation time or improved quality. Cell immobilization methods, however, proved effective for enhancing mead quality.|$|E
25|$|Solazyme {{is one of}} {{a handful}} of {{companies}} which is supported by oil companies such as Chevron. Additionally, this company is also backed by Imperium Renewables, Blue Crest Capital Finance, and The Roda Group. Solazyme has developed a way to use up to 80% percent of dry algae as oil. This process requires the algae to grow in a dark <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessel</b> and be fed by carbon substrates within their growth media. The effect is the production of triglycerides that are almost identical to vegetable oil. Solazyme's production method is said to produce more oil than those algae cultivated photosynthetically or made to produce ethanol. Oil refineries can then take this algal oil and turn it into biodiesel, renewable diesel or jet fuels.|$|E

25|$|When yeast cells die, they sink to {{the bottom}} of the <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessel</b> where they combine with {{insoluble}} tartrates, grape seeds, skin and pulp fragments to form the lees. During fermentation, the first significant racking which removes the bulk of dead yeast cells is often referred to as the gross lees as opposed to the less coarse fine lees that come as the wine continues to settle and age. During the time that the wine spends in contact with the lees, a number of changes can impact the wine due to both the autolysis (or self-metabolize) of the dead yeast cells as well as the reductive conditions that can develop if the lees are not aerated or stirred (a process that the French call bâtonnage). The length of time that a wine spends on its lees (called sur lie) will depend on the winemaking style and type of wine.|$|E

2500|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is used in}} brewing beer, when it is {{sometimes}} called a top-fermenting or top-cropping yeast. It is so called because during the fermentation process its hydrophobic surface causes the flocs to adhere to CO2 and {{rise to the top}} of the <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessel.</b> Top-fermenting yeasts are fermented at higher temperatures than the lager yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus, and the resulting beers have a different flavor than the same beverage fermented with a lager yeast. [...] "Fruity esters" [...] may be formed if the yeast undergoes temperatures near , or if the fermentation temperature of the beverage fluctuates during the process. Lager yeast normally ferments at a temperature of approximately , where Saccharomyces cerevisiae becomes dormant.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{winemaking}} {{technology has}} introduced techniques to minimize {{some of the}} bitter tannins and ferment the wine fully dry. These include temperature control <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels</b> and aging in oak barrels. Like Nebbiolo, Freisa produces a relatively light colored wine but with more distinctive purple hues. The wines are often characterized with strawberry, raspberry and violet aromas.|$|R
30|$|The {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} an equilibration period of 6  days and a consecutive control period of 6  days {{followed by an}} experimental period of 24  h. During equilibration and control period nylon bags (11.5  ×  6.5  cm, pore size 150  µm) comprised 8  g of PFAA-free hay and 2  g concentrate. After 24  h of equilibrium period, one nylon bag in each vessel was replaced with a nylon bag containing PFAA-free hay and concentrate. Throughout the overall experimental period the retention time of each nylon bag was adjusted to 48  h, i.e. the nylon bags were exchanged alternately at 24  h intervals. At {{the beginning of the}} experimental period, three <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels</b> received two nylon bags with 8  g PFAA hay and 2  g concentrate (high dosage), whereas the remaining three <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels</b> received one nylon bag containing 8  g PFAA hay and 2  g concentrate and a second nylon bag filled with 8  g PFAA-free hay and 2  g concentrate (low dosage).|$|R

30|$|During the {{experimental}} period, 40  ml of fermentation liquid were retrieved from each vessel for determination of PFAA concentration at following points after exchanging feed: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24  h. In addition, the infused buffer volume was recorded at each point. Counteracting the continuous loss of fermentation liquid by sampling, the deviating volume was refilled from further six <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels</b> which were treated equally.|$|R
30|$|During control period, {{the average}} ammonia {{concentration}} was 11.79  mmol/l, but significantly decreased in the <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels</b> {{after receiving the}} PFAA hay (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 B), whereas the effect was less pronounced for the low PFAA dose (9.82  mmol/l) than for the high PFAA dose (6.85  mmol/l) (Table  2). The results indicated that ammonia was produced in a dose-related manner depending on the different protein levels of the hay.|$|R
50|$|Fermentation {{takes place}} in <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels</b> which come in various forms, from {{enormous}} cylindroconical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats. After the wort is cooled and aerated - usually with sterile air - yeast is added to it, and it begins to ferment. It is during this stage that sugars won from the malt are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, and the product can be called beer for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{a popular}} {{fermentation}} lock that mounts {{on top of}} the <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessel</b> is the three-piece fermentation lock. Other models contain three bulbous chambers allowing for a broader range of pressure equalization. These bulbous fermentation locks were generally made of hand blown glass and are nowadays often made of clear plastic.|$|E

In order to encourage efficient extraction of colour and flavour components it is important to maximize contact between the cap of skins and the liquid phase. This can be achieved by: ...|$|E
50|$|The use of {{perforated}} rubber balloons offers an easy and inexpensive alternative to conventional airlocks: as used primarily in homebrewing, the balloon is stretched over the orifice of the <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessel</b> and, if necessary, tightened with rubber bands. The balloon is then perforated with a needle. These punctures, while not completely airtight, sufficiently protect the vessel's contents from contamination {{and allow the}} gases produced by fermentation to evacuate from the vessel as the pressure rises and the balloon inflates.|$|E
30|$|Two {{electrodes}} {{used for}} the measurement of the redox potential showed an average result of − 269  mV during the control period (Additional file 1 : Figure S 2). The redox potentials in the <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels</b> decreased to − 309 and − 298  mV after receiving the low and high doses of PFAA hay, respectively (Table  2). It was assumed that this {{was associated with the}} increased production of propionate due to its higher demand for hydrogen.|$|R
500|$|In 1973, Watney Mann {{commissioned}} a new brewhouse. In 1979 a new £6million lager plant was started, initially brewing Holsten. By the early 1980s the brewery had beer production volumes of around 400,000 barrels per annum and employed around 600 people. At this time, the brewery {{was described as}} [...] "wonderfully traditional" [...] by Roger Protz and had open <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels,</b> mash tuns and copper brewing vessels. Production of Budweiser began in 1984. Having previously been used for storage, in 1986 the historic Long Can Hall was converted to function as the brewery's visitor's centre.|$|R
25|$|Pepe {{incorporates}} {{some elements}} of traditional winemaking, including crushing his organically grown grapes by foot similar to the traditional Port wine tradition of using a large stone vats called lagares to tread on wine grapes. He also shuns {{the use of any}} fining and filtration aids as well as the use of the sulfur dioxide for preserving and protecting the wine oxidation. However, instead of using oak barrels or stainless steel fermentation tanks, Pepe ferments and ages everything in glass (from using glass lined <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels,</b> to storing the wine in bottles). When the wines are ready to be released, they are decanted off their sediments and repackaged in a new wine bottle.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} designs for the {{fermentation}} lock, or airlock. These designs work when half filled with water. When {{the pressure of the}} gas inside the <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessel</b> exceeds the prevailing atmospheric pressure the gas will push its way through the water as individual bubbles into the outside air. A sanitizing solution or vodka is sometimes placed in the fermentation lock to prevent contamination of the beer in case the water is inadvertently drawn into the fermenter.|$|E
50|$|A {{coolship}} (Anglicized {{version of}} the Dutch/Flemish koelschip) {{is a type of}} <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessel</b> used in the production of beer. Traditionally, a coolship is a broad, open-top, flat vessel in which wort cools. The high surface to mass ratio allows for more efficient cooling. Contemporary usage includes any open fermentor used in the production of beer, even when using modern mechanical cooling techniques. Traditionally, coolships were constructed of wood, but later were lined with iron or copper for better thermal conductivity.|$|E

25|$|Like France, rosés {{are made}} {{throughout}} Italy with {{the style and}} grape varieties used changing depending on the region and local climate.

25|$|Sicilian or Greek type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe and ripe olives, {{they are}} almost {{identical}} to the Spanish type fermentation process, but the lye treatment process is skipped and the olives are placed directly in <b>fermentation</b> <b>vessels</b> full of brine (8–12% NaCl). The brine is changed {{on a regular basis}} to help remove the phenolic compounds. As the caustic treatment is avoided, lactic acid bacteria are only present in similar numbers to yeast and appear to be outcompeted by the abundant yeasts found on untreated olives. As very little acid is produced by the yeast fermentation, lactic, acetic, or citric acid is often added to the fermentation stage to stabilize the process.|$|R
