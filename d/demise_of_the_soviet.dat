40|$|Large archive {{databases}} of soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) widely exist in Lithuania and <b>the</b> other countries <b>of</b> Central and Eastern Europe. Despite <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union over 16 years ago, and Lithuania's integration as a full European Union state, difficulties of SOM data acceptance remain where these results are presented for publication in international journals, due to methodological differences between laboratory protocols. Therefore, the scientific pilot project ‘Carbon sequestration in Lithuanian soils’, supported by the Leverhulme Trust (U. K.), included an objective to correlate soil carbon methodologies, using Lithuanian Eutric Albeluvisols. A comparison of SOM content data acquired using five different analytical methods is reported. The research programme included a specific objective to correlate analytical methods for SOM analyses. A total of 92 Eutric Albeluvisol samples were collected from topsoil (0 – 0. 2 m: Ap, n= 36; Ah, n= 10) and subsoil (0. 2 – 0. 4 m: Bt, n= 46) horizons of 46 long-term experimental field plots at the Kaltinenai Research Station <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian Institute <b>of</b> Agriculture. Each sample was then subsampled and analysed for SOM using dry combustion (by automatic elemental analyser), Walkley–Black (USDA), Tyurin photometrical, Tyurin titrimetrical and loss-on-ignition (LoI) methods (the later performed, in parallel, in both Lithuania and U.

Correlation coefficients between <b>the</b> sets <b>of</b> results varied between r= 0. 81 – 0. 96 (from 0 – 0. 2 m, n= 46, P< 0. 001) and r= 0. 76 – 0. 98 (from 0. 2 – 0. 4 m, n= 46, P< 0. 001). Based on the strength and significance of these relationships, it is proposed that simple linear or more complex paired regression equations can be confidently employed to recalculate SOM data between various analytical methodologies.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{and tries to}} explain <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> anti-European and Eurosceptical sentiment in the United States since <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War. Contrary to anti-Europeanism, which has always permeated American culture and underpinned American exceptionalism, Euroscepticism is more confined to political and business elites and targets the process, main policies and identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Union. Although usually conservative, Anti-Europeans and Eurosceptics do not necessarily overlap: anti-Europeans are Eurosceptical but the reverse is not necessarily true. However, Anti-Europeanism and Euroscepticism have become entrenched beliefs among many conservatives. Europe's positive image since WWII and the wide support for European unification among American elites, {{have been replaced by}} competing views: for example, neo-conservatives believe Europe to be in economic, demographic and cultural decline that the EU only precipitates. Others see a unifying Europe as a rising power which will become more a rival than an ally for the US. Since the early 1990 s and increasingly until the war in Iraq, conservative commentators have attacked the style and content of European foreign policy, especially with regard to the Middle-East, Europe's weak defence budgets, its lack of resolve against terrorism, its welfare state and highly regulated economy, its left-leaning political culture, its growing anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism. The centralizing, elitist and regulatory aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU have also been denounced to justify Euroscepticism. The paper reviews and discusses possible explanations for such trends: a backlash against rising anti-Americanism in Europe? <b>The</b> projection <b>of</b> US domestic politics? <b>The</b> import <b>of</b> British Euroscepticism? <b>The</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> communism and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and <b>the</b> common threat they represented? America's new hegemonic ambitions? <b>The</b> rising influence <b>of</b> American conservatives? Clashes over globalization? A resurgent awareness of deep differences in political and economic cultures, which help cast Europe as the anti-model? The answer lies most likely in a combination of such factors. international relations...|$|R
2500|$|Under the Soviet regime, the {{copyright}} law {{was changed to}} conform more to Socialist ideology and economics. The duration of copyright was reduced, first to 25 years from the first publication of a work and then in 1928 to 15 years after the author's death, before it was increased again to 25 years [...] in 1973, when the USSR joined the Universal Copyright Convention. After the <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, the Russian Federation at first took over the last Soviet legislation from 1991, which hadn't even become effective anymore in the USSR. In 1993, a new, modernized copyright law of Russia entered in force, which was in-line with the leading international copyright treaties.

2500|$|During {{the soviet}} rule, state-sponsored hunting clubs were formed within the {{administrative}} boundaries or factories. Hunting clubs based in cities were allocated hunting grounds where club members {{were allowed to}} hunt {{according to the federal}} and local regulations. [...] Following <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union private individuals were allowed to lease hunting territories formerly used by government sponsored clubs. Many lease owners are wealthy Russians who are willing to spend large sums of money in order to maintain leased hunting grounds for their pleasure and sometimes to allow other hunters to use their territories for a fee. As a result, {{the quality and quantity of}} the game increased dramatically during the past 20 years in most parts of Russia. During the Soviet Union time, a single agency called [...] "Glavohota" [...] was granted an authority to conduct hunts for the foreign hunters. Nowadays many outfitters and booking agents organize hunting trips for the foreigners. The inevitable competition between such companies improved quality of hunts and brought down the prices which used to be extremely high.|$|E
2500|$|Although Soviet law, from 1925 {{on until}} the <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union (and also beyond in the {{successor}} states of the USSR), has always maintained that copyrights existed on a work regardless of its purpose or its value, the exercise of copyright in the Soviet Union was subject {{to the rules of}} censorship and the literary controls, the press legislation, the laws on printing, publishing, and selling, and Party directives. In general, only authors of [...] "socially useful" [...] works could exploit their copyrights; on [...] "useless works" [...] such as Church hymns no economic rights could be enforced; and authors of undesirable works faced administrative, or social, or even penal sanctions. What was [...] "socially useful" [...] was defined in a number of Party decrees (from 1925 to 1963, there were thirty-three such decrees). Publishers, film studios, and so on, were expected to refuse to publish works that were considered non-compliant to the currently valid definitions of the goals of artistic activity as defined by these decrees. In this way, the nominally exclusive rights of authors to publication were restricted by the need to go through the official channels and state-controlled publishing houses. As a way to bypass this governmental control for literary works samizdat developed: the non-commercial dissemination of a work in chain-letter fashion through carbon-copies produced by readers on their typewriters. Many samizdat works were considered to be [...] "anti-Soviet agitation" [...] by the authorities and the authors were prosecuted under article 58(10) (later articles 70 and 190(1)) of the RSFSR Criminal Code or corresponding provisions of the other republics' penal laws.|$|E
40|$|People {{are central}} to {{economic}} development. Workers are relatively vulnerable compared to <b>the</b> other factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy, including governments and employers. Because violations of workers’ rights and poor working conditions are prevalent, especially in developing countries, <b>the</b> diffusion <b>of</b> internationally recognized labor standards is now emerging as a critical process in the world. This is a process by which internationally recognized labor rights are transferred between countries by various means with <b>the</b> expectation <b>of</b> improving labor conditions world-wide. For this process to be successful, {{it is important that}} not only labor standards but also rules and mechanisms for their enforcement be diffused. The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP) is currently under negotiation. The TPP {{is expected to be the}} first “high-quality, twenty-first-century agreement” in the world. Norm entrepreneurs have chosen the TPP to be a channel for <b>the</b> diffusion <b>of</b> labor standards in the Asia-Pacific. How is the TPP likely to diffuse the norms, rules and mechanisms for <b>the</b> enforcement <b>of</b> labor standards and dispute resolution? Will it be by means of goodwill, cooperation and consensus or through material conditionality? Labor rights are human rights which must be upheld and promoted. The answer to the above empirical question is very important to <b>the</b> policy-makers <b>of</b> signatory countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TPP, given that labor standards are considered to be a sensitive issue in many Asian countries. Their concerns are grounded in history. <b>The</b> Government <b>of</b> Poland and <b>the</b> communist system in Eastern Europe were brought down as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> labor rights in the 1980 s¹. How to implement these rights without causing social and political disorder is a complex question for policy-makers in the TPP countries. The thesis reviews the literature on theoretical norm diffusion and labor standards as well as provides <b>the</b> empirical evidence <b>of</b> past diffusion of labor standards in order to identify which mechanisms of diffusion are likely to prevail in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> labor standards in the Asia-Pacific region. It answers who are <b>the</b> drivers <b>of</b> diffusion. It draws on <b>the</b> record <b>of</b> all signed FTAs in the region to provide an empirical foundation for its projection about <b>the</b> likely content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TPP in terms of rules and mechanisms for <b>the</b> enforcement <b>of</b> labor standards. ¹ After the rights to organize freely and to strike was recognized by <b>the</b> Government <b>of</b> Poland, <b>the</b> Solidarity Unions was formed and after many ups and downs of its evolution, finally it had led successfully <b>the</b> overthrow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communist Government <b>of</b> Poland and “played a central role in <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> communism across <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> bloc, changing forever <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> history in Europe”.

2500|$|Originally {{published}} in the dissident journal Novy Mir, The Time: Night entered the scene {{on the border between}} mainstream and dissident literature just after the <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Critics have acclaimed it as both Petrushevskaya's strongest work and the standard mold for her distinctive voice. [...] The Time: Night does typify Petrushevskaya's dark sense of humor and candid portrayal of gritty urban life in post-Soviet Moscow; [...] "unforgiving verbal authenticity" [...] is a defining quality of all Petrushevskaya's work. Petrushevskaya's narrative style being [...] "fueled by rumor, gossip, and polemic," [...] her work suffered harsh criticism during Perestroika, when cynicism began to lose its appeal among the literary elite. Similarly, the author's evenhanded portrayal of physiology in The Time: Night starkly contrasted traditional treatment of the issue in the early 1990s. Helen Goscilo frames Petrushevskaya's [...] "presumably unmotivated frankness" [...] concerning the body as a break from a [...] "feminine" [...] mode of expression particular to only a few modern Russian women writers. [...] Petrushevskaya's chef d'oeuvre has since earned a reputation as a pillar of New Women's Prose, a genre of [...] "bracing irreverence" [...] and [...] "complete lack of 'ladylike' squeamishness." [...] Notably, however, Petrushevskaya does not take a particularly militant feminist stance, given the groundbreaking implications of The Time: Night. When prompted by an editor (before the publication of the novella) as to whether she sided with men or women, Petrushevskaya responded with [...] "I'm {{on the side of the}} children.". Though her characters complain bitterly of Soviet and post-Soviet women's conditions, Petrushevskaya, nor New Women's Prose as a genre sprung from her work, minimizes [...] "women's collusion in their own victimization." [...] It might be concluded, then, that while Petrushevskaya introduced a blunt portrayal of contemporary Russian women's life in The Time: Night, her frankness is less a political tool than an empathetic gesture, though it took scholars years to identify that purpose.|$|E
