50|$|Diesel exhaust {{contains}} {{relatively high}} levels of particulate matter (soot), consisting largely of elemental carbon. Catalytic converters cannot clean up elemental carbon, though they do remove up to 90 percent of the soluble organic fraction, so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or diesel particulate filter (DPF). Historically, a DPF consists of a cordierite or silicon carbide substrate with a geometry that forces the exhaust flow through the substrate walls, leaving behind trapped soot particles. Contemporary DPFs can be manufactured {{from a variety of}} rare metals that provide superior performance (at a greater expense). As the amount of soot trapped on the DPF increases, so does the back pressure in the exhaust system. Periodic regenerations (high temperature excursions) are required to initiate combustion of the trapped soot and thereby reducing the exhaust back pressure. The amount of soot loaded on the DPF prior to regeneration may also be limited to prevent extreme exotherms from damaging the trap during regeneration. In the U.S., all on-road light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel and built after January 1, 2007, must meet diesel particulate emission limits, meaning that they effectively have to be equipped with a 2-way catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter. Note that this applies only to the diesel engine used in the vehicle. As long as the engine was manufactured before January 1, 2007, the vehicle is not required to have the DPF system. This led to an inventory runup by engine manufacturers in late 2006 so they could continue selling pre-DPF vehicles well into 2007. During the re-generation cycle, most systems require the engine to consume more fuel in a relatively short amount of time in order to generate the high temperatures necessary for the cycle to complete. This adversely affects the overall fuel economy of vehicles equipped with <b>DPF</b> <b>systems,</b> especially in vehicles that are driven mostly in city conditions where frequent acceleration requires a larger amount of fuel to be burned and therefore more soot to collect in the exhaust system.|$|E

40|$|Achieving {{substantial}} {{reductions in}} the exposure of underground miners to diesel particulate matter {{in a number of}} metal and nonmetal mines in the U.

But those studies and several other attempts to implement <b>DPF</b> <b>systems</b> in underground mines revealed a number of relatively unique technical and operational challenges that are limiting industry-wide implementation of this technology.

A single laundering process did not exhibit substantial effects on performance of the filter element. The effectiveness of DPFs and DFEs in removing aerosols by number was strongly influenced by engine operating mode. The concentrations of nucleation mode aerosols in the mine air were found to be substantially higher for both DPFs and DFEs when the engine was operated at high-load modes than at low-load modes.

Tests were conducted in the NIOSH Diesel Laboratory at the Lake Lynn Laboratory experimental mine, a facility developed to allow evaluation {{of these and other}} control technologies directly in an underground environment. The aforementioned technologies are evaluated by comparing the aerosol and gas measurements in the mine air 60 m downstream of the exhaust from a naturally aspirated, mechanically controlled engine fitted with the tested systems or muffler and operated at four steady-state engine speed and power modes. The tested DPF and HT DFE systems caused a 10 -fold reduction in total mass concentrations of aerosols. The size distribution and number concentration measurements showed that all tested <b>DPF</b> <b>systems</b> and HT DFE elements effectively removed accumulation mode aerosols (D 50 > 30 nm) for all test modes. An increase in peak number concentrations of nucleation mode (D 50 > 30 nm) diesel aerosols is evident for some of tested <b>DPF</b> <b>systems</b> when engine was operated at high-load modes. The effects of uncatalyzed DPFs on nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations are found to be minor.

But conventional I/M measurements (snap-acceleration opacity) and other similar ‘stop-and-test’ procedures are not sensitive enough to measure the difference between a properly functioning and a moderately malfunctioning <b>DPF</b> <b>system,</b> and can even be cross-sensitive to the by-products of some modern emission control systems, e. g.

40|$|Diesel exhaust {{is now one}} of {{the largest}} sources of {{nitrogen}} oxide (NOx) emissions, and also contributes significantly to emissions of fine particulate black carbon (soot). The California Air Resources Board (CARB) recently adopted a rule to requiring that all inuse trucks operating in California meet current (2007) exhaust PM emission standards by 2014. This will require retrofit or replacement of older in-use engines, with emission reductions occurring on an accelerated schedule compared to what would be achieved by fleet turnover alone. A side effect of using diesel particle filters (DPF) to control exhaust PM emissions is that the NO 2 /NOx ratio in exhaust emissions may increase to ~ 35 %, in comparison to lower values (~ 5 %) typical of engines without particle filters. We evaluate the effects of increased deployment of <b>DPF</b> <b>systems</b> as well as NOx controls on air quality in southern California using an Eulerian air quality model.

All PEMS-PM systems were found to reproduce within ± 30 % the gravimetric PM results determined with reference measurement systems under non-regenerative operating conditions, at emission levels lying at and above the Euro VI limit of 10 mg/kWh. The use of prolonged sampling times envisaged in In Service Conformity (ISC) testing (> 120 min) {{was found to be}} beneficial, as it reduced the limit of detection of the PEMS-PM instrumentation to 1 - 3 mg/kWh (120 min) from 3 to 9 mg/kWh (30 min). The real time aerosol instrumentation exhibited a much higher sensitivity, being capable of quantifying emission levels below the EURO VI particle number limit of 6 × 1011 #/kWh. Some modifications were required though in two particle sensors that were based on diffusion charging, in order to avoid a disproportional increase in their responses in the presence of homogeneously nucleated particles.

40|$|Within {{the last}} years modern diesel {{applications}} had to satisfy increasingly challenging European exhaust emission standards, especially the Euronorm 5 and 6. All the automotive firms focused her efforts to reduce soot emissions by developing new after treatment systems. Common concepts for diesel exhaust after treatment systems rely on Diesel Oxidation Catalysts (DOC), Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and NOx absorbers. The most effective of these systems is the DPF, actually providing filtration rates better than 90 %. The geometry of the DPF structure has an important influence on its performance. Simulation offers a valuable tool for the evaluation and optimisation of various DPF designs. The present paper demonstrates the usage of the COMSOL multi physics code for modelling <b>DPF</b> <b>systems.</b> The complete model {{is based on a}} single pair of DPF channels composed of inlet / outlet channel, porous wall and the ash layer. Alternating plugs sealing the inlet- and outlet channels force the soot loaded exhaust gas to flow through the porous walls, where the soot is deposited into porous structure and at a growing soot cake layer. It is advantageous to separate the modelling of a DPF into several stages. In a first stage the pressure drop over the complete DPF channel structure unit cell is analysed in a CFD-analysis, also incorporating nonlinear pressure loss contributions due to flow contraction and expansion at the channel in and outlets. The pressure difference across the porous walls and the soot cake follows from Darcy's Law. In a next stage the soot deposition with its effect on the permeability of the porous walls and initiation of soot cake growth is included into the analysis. Phenomenological approximations on a continuum level are applied to account for the different microscopic and molecular processes of soot deposition within and at the surface of the porous wall structures. There is a strong both way interaction between gas flow field and soot deposition. The model results are compared to experimental measures of the DPF filter segments. A further level of model analysis is necessary to account for non-ideal effects of the measuring system...|$|E

Abstract The efficiency and the selectivity of a model platinum based catalyst supported on a modified ceria-zirconia oxide was evaluated in the NOx storage-reduction (NSR) process at four catalytic scales: powder, (0. 5 "x 1. 5 ") flow-through monolith (FTM) system, small size (1 "x 2 ") and full size (5. 66 "x 10 ") catalysed Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). The washcoating of the active phase over FTM affects both the NOx storage properties and the NOx reduction step. The reduction step efficiency is especially decreased at low temperatures. It is associated with an incomplete regeneration of the storage sites and with a strong NOx desorption peak during the rich pulses of the NSR process for the FTM supported system. The NOx reduction selectivity is also strongly affected by the upscale, with an important N 2 O selectivity detected over FTM. The recorded NOx profiles during NSR cycles indicate a probable diffusion limitation. However, same trends were observed for both powder and FTM systems concerning {{the effect of the}} reductant mixture, for both NSR efficiency and N-compounds selectivity. After incorporation of the active phase in the porosity of the DPF, a sharp drop in NOx storage properties and subsequently in NSR efficiency are observed.

50|$|All {{on-board}} active systems use extra fuel, {{whether through}} burning {{to heat the}} DPF, or providing extra power to the <b>DPF's</b> electrical <b>system,</b> although {{the use of a}} fuel borne catalyst reduces the energy required very significantly. Typically a computer monitors one or more sensors that measure back pressure and/or temperature, and based on pre-programmed set points the computer makes decisions on when to activate the regeneration cycle. The additional fuel can be supplied by a metering pump. Running the cycle too often while keeping the back pressure in the exhaust system low will result in high fuel consumption. Not running the regeneration cycle soon enough increases the risk of engine damage and/or uncontrolled regeneration (thermal runaway) and possible DPF failure.|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{conducted}} a study {{to determine the effects}} of selected, state-of-the-art emission control technologies on the ambient concentrations of particulate matter and gases emitted by underground diesel-powered mining equipment. Tests were conducted in an isolated zone of an underground mine to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative fuel formulations, namely, water-fuel emulsions, blended biodiesel fuels, ultralow sulfur diesel fuel, and # 1 diesel; and selected exhaust after treatment devices, namely, diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs), diesel particulate filter (<b>DPF)</b> <b>systems,</b> and filtration systems designed around high-temperature disposable filter elements. The results showed that using a cold-weather and warm-weather water-fuel emulsion formulation reduced mass concentrations of elemental carbon (EC) by about 70 % and 85 %, respectively. The 20 % and 50 % soy biodiesel blends reduced EC by 49 % and 66 %, respectively. The reductions were slightly less pronounced for the 20 % and 50 % yellow grease biodiesel blends- 33 % and 56 %, respectively. EC concentrations were unaffected by using ultralow sulfur diesel in place of # 1 diesel. Use of the reformulated fuels did not substantially alter the concentrations of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. However, a measurable increase in the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) peak concentration was observed during the biodiesel tests. The ArvinMeritor (AM) fuel-burner DPF system with a palladium-catalyzed DOC reduced EC concentrations by 92 %. The diesel filter elements from Donaldson Co., Inc., and Filter Service & Testing Corp. reduced the EC concentration of the mine air by 92 % and 70 %, respectively. When the palladium-based DOC was used with the AM DPF, it raised the average and peak downstream NO 2 concentrations by a factor of three. Tests of the AM DPF system with a platinum-catalyzed DOC and CAP/ETG catalytic particulate oxidizer system had to be terminated because the elevated NO 2 concentrations threatened to overexpose the operator. The tests with only a selected DOC also resulted in increased NO 2 concentrations in mine air. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 by Aleksandar D. Bugarski, George H. Schnakenberg, Jr., Steven E. Mischler, James D.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP) consortium, Noranda Inc. has {{undertaken}} a field project to evaluate the overall performance of the latest diesel particulate filter technology (DPF) at its Brunswick Mine in Bathurst, New Brunswick. Performance of the filtration systems is evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to reduce tailpipe emissions and concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and noxious gases in mine air, efficiency of filter regeneration process, maintenance requirements, reliability, and acceptance. Four different particulate filter systems deployed on heavy production vehicles are subjected to an 18 -month field evaluation. Over the evaluation period the vehicles will have accumulated approximately 4000 operating hours in production. This paper presents the results of testing conducted mid way through the 18 -month field trials. The 400 - meter section of the mine drift at 525 - 5 sub level, hereinafter referred to as the "isolated zone" was isolated between intake and exhaust fan systems and sealed with bulkheads against leakage. The isolated zone was ventilated at the rate required per CSA Standards and issued by CANMET for the engines tested. Four vehicles, two load-haul-dumps (LHDs) and two trucks, retrofitted with particulate filter systems were tested along with a new identical model LHD and truck equipped with exhaust systems consisting of a catalytic converter (DOC) and muffler. The test vehicles were operated individually inside the isolated zone for approximately 4 hours over simulated production duty cycles. Measurements of ambient concentrations of particulate matter, tailpipe emissions, and engine parameters were performed for each of the tested vehicles. The DPM samples for carbon were collected at the most up- stream end of the isolated zone, at the vehicle next to the operator, and at the most downstream or exhaust end of the isolated zone. The DPM samples were analyzed for total (organic and elemental) carbon using NIOSH Analytical Method 5040. Ambient concentrations of particulate matter at the exhaust end of the zone were also measured using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), and real time PAH monitor (PAS 2000). Efficiency of the filters was also evaluated on a basis of tailpipe measurements performed using raw exhaust instruments the NanoMet and the UGAS. In addition, relevant engine parameters were obtained using Detroit Diesel Diagnostic Link (DDDL) and from exhaust backpressure and temperature measurements. Results from the tests proved conclusively that diesel particulate filters can significantly reduce the concentrations of air- borne DPM, but not without careful monitoring of both ambient and tailpipe emissions and not without careful attention with respect to maintaining the integrity of the <b>DPF</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mobile sources {{contribute}} significantly to air pollution problems. Relevant pollutants include numerous gaseous and particle-phase species that can affect human health, ecosystems, and climate. Accurate inventories of emissions from these sources are needed to help understand possible adverse impacts, and to develop effective air quality management strategies. Unfortunately large uncertainties persist {{in the understanding of}} mobile source emissions, and how these emissions are changing over time. There are more than two hundred million motor vehicles operating in the United States alone, and measurements of emissions from these sources are sparse. Pollutant emission factor distributions are becoming increasingly skewed, and this continually increases the needed vehicle sample size in studies that seek to quantify fleet-average vehicle emission rates. This dissertation aims to evaluate long-term trends in mobile source emissions in the United States, and to make detailed measurements of emissions from present-day fleets of on-road vehicles operating in California. Novel features of this work include studies of the in-use effectiveness of modern control technologies used to reduce diesel engine emissions, and application of advanced instrumentation to measure emissions from large numbers of on-road gasoline and diesel vehicles at high time resolution and {{with a high level of}} chemical and physical detail. Long-term trends in mobile source emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) in the United States were investigated through development of a fuel-based emission inventory. Annual emissions from on- and off-road gasoline and diesel engines were quantified for the years 1996 - 2006. Diesel engines were found to be the dominant mobile source of NOx and PM 2. 5, and on-road diesel vehicles were identified as the single largest anthropogenic source of NOx emissions in the United States as of 2005. The relative importance of diesel engines as a source of NOx grew over the ten-year time period considered here, while emissions from gasoline engines declined due to increased effectiveness and use of three-way catalytic converters. A comparison with national emission inventory estimates for 2005 found substantial differences in source contributions to overall mobile source emissions, with larger contributions from on-road diesel engines indicated in this study. The importance of diesel engines as a source of exhaust particulate matter emissions has led to the recent introduction of advanced emission control technologies in the United States, such as diesel particle filters (DPF), which have been required since 2007 for all new on-road heavy-duty (HD) diesel engines. In addition to national requirements for the use of such control devices on new engines, California has mandated accelerated clean-up of statewide emissions from older in-use diesel engines. This goal is to be achieved through filter retrofit and truck/engine replacement programs. This dissertation uses measurements of emissions from in-use HD diesel trucks at the Port of Oakland to evaluate the impacts of a DPF retrofit and truck replacement program. A plume capture method was developed to quantify black carbon (BC) and NOx emission factors for individual trucks and to characterize emission factor distributions. A comparison of emissions measured before and after the implementation of the truck retrofit/replacement rule shows a 54 ± 11 % reduction in the fleet-average BC emission factor, accompanied by a shift to a more highly skewed emission factor distribution. Although only particulate matter mass reductions were required in the first phase of the program, a 41 ± 5 % reduction in the fleet-average NOx emission factor was observed. These results provide an in-use/real-world assessment of the impact of DPF emission control systems, and a preview of emissions changes that may be expected from the extension of similar control programs to the entire HD truck fleet in California beginning in 2014. The plume capture method was further applied to measure emissions from a more diverse population of trucks observed at the Caldecott tunnel in summer 2010. Emissions from hundreds of individual trucks were measured, and emission factor distributions were characterized for nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde, BC, as well as optical properties of the emitted particles. Emission factor distributions for all species were skewed, with a small fraction of trucks contributing disproportionately to total emissions. For example, half of the total measured NO 2 and BC were produced by only 10 % of the total measurements. Total NOx and formaldehyde showed less skewed emission factor distributions compared to CO and BC. Emission factors for NO 2 were found to be anti-correlated with all other pollutants considered here. Also, the fleet-average NO 2 emission factor increased 34 ± 18 % relative to the corresponding value measured at the same location in 2006. These findings confirm that the use of catalyzed <b>DPF</b> <b>systems</b> is leading to increased primary NO 2 emissions. Absorption and scattering cross-section emission factors were used to calculate the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA, at 532 nm) for individual truck exhaust plumes, which averaged 0. 14 ± 0. 03. This value of aerosol SSA is very low compared to typical values (0. 90 - 0. 99) observed in ambient air studies. It is indicative of a strongly light-absorbing aerosol, due to the high BC emissions that are a characteristic feature of diesel exhaust PM emissions. Measurements at the Caldecott tunnel also included efforts to quantify light-duty (LD) gasoline vehicle emission factors, and further investigation of the relative contributions of on-road gasoline and diesel engines to air pollutant emissions. Measurements of CO, NOx, PM 2. 5, BC, and organic aerosol (OA) were made in a tunnel traffic bore where LD vehicles account for > 99 % of total traffic. Measured pollutant concentrations were apportioned between LD gasoline vehicles and diesel trucks, and fleet-average emission factors were quantified for LD gasoline vehicles using a carbon balance method. Diesel trucks contributed 18 ± 3, 22 ± 5, 44 ± 8 % of measured NOx, OA, and BC concentrations, respectively, despite accounting for < 1 % of total vehicles. Consequently, methods that do not explicitly account for diesel truck contributions tend to overestimate fleet-average LD gasoline vehicle emission factors for these species. Emission factors and overall fuel consumption for gasoline and diesel engines were used to describe the relative contributions of these sources to overall on-road vehicle emissions. Gasoline engines were found to be the dominant source of CO, an insignificant source of BC, and a relatively minor source of on-road OA emissions at urban, state, and national scales. Measurements at the Caldecott tunnel also featured use of a new high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer, which was used to characterize the chemical composition of PM emitted by gasoline and diesel vehicles. Measurements of PM in the exhaust of individual HD trucks show a predominance of cyclyoalkane-derived ion signals relative to saturated alkane ion signals in the truck exhaust OA spectra, indicating that lubricating oil, rather than diesel fuel, was the dominant source of OA emitted by diesel trucks. This conclusion is supported by the presence of lubricant-derived trace elements in truck exhaust, emitted relative to total OA at levels that correspond to their weight fractions in bulk oil. Furthermore, comparison of mass spectra for sampling periods with varying levels of diesel influence found a high degree of similarity in the chemical composition of OA emitted by gasoline and diesel engines, suggesting a common lubricating oil rather than fuel-derived source for OA emissions...|$|E

40|$|The {{particulate}} matter {{is probably one}} of the most critical issues of the diesel engine emissions. After years of research, people begin to understand it further, with respect to its impact on the environment and human health, its formation mechanism inside and outside the diesel engine, and most importantly, the methods to control its formation. This study has focused on the {{particulate matter}} emission control in diesel engines. It started with the application of two closely coupled Diesel Particle Filters (DPFs), consisting of an assistant DPF and a main standard honeycomb DPF, to replace the standard Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) + <b>DPF</b> <b>system,</b> commonly applied on diesel engines these days. This new after-treatment system showed a great potential to be adopted in the future, not only for the tighter emission regulations but also for the great cost reduction of the total after-treatment system by the reduction of the main DPF’s size and weight and more options of other cheaper materials. The back pressure problem revealed in the experiment was then studied through a one dimensional model simulation and its influence to the engine performance was discussed. Fuel injection parameters which are related with the engine performance and emissions were also investigated in the study. After careful calibrations, a single injection induced Partially Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) combustion was achieved, in which mode, NOx and smoke emissions were reduced by more than 80 % compared with using the normal multiple injections. Following that, the non-volatile particulate emissions under the pilot injection’s impacts were studied and the key parameters of the pilot control such as fuel quantity and injection timing were examined. The particulate number concentrations and size distributions were investigated under different engine operation conditions and the results illustrated how a pilot injection alongside a main injection could influence particulates and what these effects were closely related to. The research continued with the investigation of bio-fuels on the particle emission reduction, when 10 % alternative diesel fuel blends (Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) and Gas-to-Liquid (GTL)) were used. They indicated that without any modification to the engine, adding selected alternative fuels, even at a low percentage, could result in a noticeable reduction of the particle numbers, both in the total and the non-volatile parts; however, the number of nucleation mode particles could increase in certain cases. It was also revealed that the engine suffered very high numbers of the nucleation mode particulates during warming up. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
