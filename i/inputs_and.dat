5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E

5|$|Plasticity: The synapses between {{parallel}} {{fibers and}} Purkinje cells, and the synapses between mossy fibers and deep nuclear cells, are both susceptible to modification of their strength. In a single cerebellar module, input from {{as many as}} a billion parallel fibers converges onto a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells, and the influence of each parallel fiber on those nuclear cells is adjustable. This arrangement gives tremendous flexibility for fine-tuning the relationship between the cerebellar <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs.|$|E
5|$|The {{iterative}} algorithms were independently {{published in}} 1975–1976 by American physicist Eugene Salamin and Australian scientist Richard Brent. These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its <b>inputs,</b> <b>and</b> produces a result in each step that converges {{to the desired}} value. The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss, {{in what is now}} termed the arithmetic–geometric mean method (AGM method) or Gauss–Legendre algorithm. As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Dugan {{produced}} the Model E, the E standing for economy. This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller {{and less expensive}} than previous ones. It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted side-by-side in only 1U of rack space. The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace the Model E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs. Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible by computer connected with Category 5 cable.|$|E

We discuss sufficient and necessary conditions for a discrete-time system to be <b>input</b> <b>and</b> state observable. Next, we derive an unbiased minimum-variance filter to estimate the unknown <b>input</b> <b>and</b> the state, when the state space matrices are known. We show that the Kalman filter and other filters in the literature are special cases of the filter derived in this paper. Finally, we present an illustrative example. I...|$|R

5|$|Modularity: The {{cerebellar}} {{system is}} functionally divided into {{more or less}} independent modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands. All modules have a similar internal structure, but different <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs. A module (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons {{in one of the}} deep cerebellar nuclei. Different modules share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear to function independently—the output of one module does not appear to significantly influence the activity of other modules.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Over 1,200 {{writers and}} specialists {{contributed to the}} encyclopedia, one fifth of whom were foreign experts in Bangladesh or experts working abroad.

District and upazila cartography has been processed at the Geographic information system (GIS) and cartographic laboratory {{set up for the}} Banglapedia. A gazetteer group was created to focus on districts and upazilas. The fact that around 400 local intellectuals were charged with writing about their respective zillas and upazilas was described as a unique approach to information gathering. In addition, 250 people worked in research management for seven years. A total of 2,000 scholars and technicians were involved. There were 270 full-time personnel on the project in all, with 35 to 40 people employed at any given time.|$|E

5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E
5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E
5|$|With Harrison's entry, the Quarrymen now {{had four}} guitarists. Lennon and McCartney {{suggested}} to Griffiths that he instead buy a bass guitar, but Griffiths refused {{because of the}} expense. The two subsequently convinced Nigel Walley, still acting as the group's manager, to fire Griffiths. Walley regretted the incident, {{and as a result}} gradually severed his ties with the Quarrymen. Around this same time, Len Garry contracted tubercular meningitis, and spent seven months in the hospital, never playing with the group again. This left Colin Hanton as the last of the group of Lennon's Quarry Bank classmates that originally comprised the group. In March, McCartney bought an Elpico amplifier with two <b>inputs,</b> <b>and</b> he and Harrison added pickups to their guitars, giving the Quarrymen an electric sound for the first time.|$|E

30|$|An autoencoder, firstly {{introduced}} in Rumelhart et al. [72], is a feedforward network that {{can learn a}} compressed, distributed representation of data, usually {{with the goal of}} dimensionality reduction or manifold learning. An autoencoder usually has one hidden layer between <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output layer. Hidden layer usually has a more compact representation than <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output layers, i.e., hidden layer has fewer units than input or output layer. <b>Input</b> <b>and</b> output layer usually has the same setting, which allows an autoencoder to be trained unsupervised with same data fed in at the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> to be compared with what is at the output layer. The training process is the same as traditional neural network with backpropagation; the only difference lying in the error is computed by comparing the output to the data itself [2]. Mitchell et al. [73], showed a nice illustration of autoencoder. He built a three-layer structure (eight unit for <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output layer and three unit for the hidden layer in between), then he fed the one-hot vector representation into the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output layer, the hidden layer turned out to approximating the data with inputs’ binary representation [2].|$|R
50|$|SADI design {{patterns}} place a single unique constraint on the behaviour of the Service, {{in that the}} URI of the <b>input</b> individual, <b>and</b> the URI of the output individual must be identical. The consequence of this constraint is that the Service provider must connect the output to the input through a defined predicate; effectively, the output is 'about' the <b>input,</b> <b>and</b> the relationship between <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output is explicit. As such, SADI services become the source of new Linked Data relating the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output of a service, and chains of SADI services produce uninterrupted Linked Data graphs.|$|R
