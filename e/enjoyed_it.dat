5|$|Despite its toxicity, T.floccosus {{is one of}} the ten wild {{mushrooms}} most widely consumed by ethnic tribes in Meghalaya, northeast India, and is highly regarded by the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal. What is not known is whether the Indian populations of T.floccosus are nontoxic, or whether the local people have developed an immunity to it. It is also enjoyed in Mexico. American mycologist David Arora reported that some <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> while he felt it had a strong sour taste.|$|E
5|$|The novel's delayed {{publication}} was {{a result}} of Balzac's active social life. He spent many nights dining at the homes of friends, including novelist Eugène Sue and his mistress Olympe Pélissier, as well as the feminist writer George Sand and her lover Jules Sandeau. Balzac and Pélissier had a brief affair, and she became the first lover with whom he appeared in public. Eventually he removed himself from Paris by staying with friends in the suburbs, where he committed himself to finishing the work. In late spring he allowed Sand to read a nearly-finished manuscript; she <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> and predicted it would do well.|$|E

25|$|Zeno Clash {{received}} some press for its developers' reaction to copyright infringement. ACE Team member Carlos Bordeu left comments on many torrent sites saying that ACE Team {{did not intend}} to stop the unlicensed downloading of Zeno Clash, but rather implored downloaders to purchase the game if they <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it.</b> ACE Team later claimed that their unique approach, while probably not changing the minds of potential infringers, accidentally generated press which helped to market the product.|$|E

25|$|Crisp {{was in his}} eighties by {{the time}} he quit acting entirely, {{continuing}} to work long after financially necessary simply because he <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it.</b> He was married twice. He was divorced from his first wife in 1919. He later married film screenwriter Jane Murfin, whom he divorced in 1944. He died in 1974, a few months short of his 92nd birthday, due to complications from a series of strokes. In addition to being one of the premier character actors of his era, he left behind an extensive list of contributions to the film industry he worked to promote for more than fifty years. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.|$|E
25|$|The Anastasian War {{ended the}} longest period of peace the two powers ever <b>enjoyed.</b> <b>It</b> broke {{out when the}} Roman emperor Anastasius I refused to provide {{financial}} support to the Persian king, Kavadh I, who tried to gain the money by force. In 502 Kavadh quickly captured the unprepared city of Theodosiopolis, and then besieged the fortress-city of Amida through the autumn and winter (502–503). The siege of the city {{proved to be a}} far more difficult enterprise than Kavadh expected; the defenders repelled the Persian assaults for three months before being defeated. In 503 the Romans attempted an ultimately unsuccessful siege of the Persian-held Amida while Kavadh invaded Osroene, and laid siege to Edessa with the same results.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, DeStefano {{was a leading}} loan shark for the Outfit. DeStefano's loan shark victims {{included}} politicians, lawyers and small-time criminals; {{by the end of}} the decade, DeStefano was charging 20% to 25% a week in interest. DeStefano would accept very high-risk debtors, such as drug addicts or business men who had already defaulted on previous debts. The reason was simple: DeStefano <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> when debtors did not pay on time, since he could then bring them to the sound-proof torture chamber he had built in his basement. Other gangsters said the sadistic DeStefano would actually foam at the mouth while torturing his victims. From time to time, DeStefano would also kill debtors who owed him small sums just to scare other debtors into paying their bigger debts.|$|E

25|$|Méliès' {{great success}} in 1902 {{continued}} with his three other major productions of that year. In The Coronation of Edward VII, Méliès reenacts the crowning {{of the new}} British King Edward VII. The film was shot prior to the actual event (since he was denied access to the coronation) and was commissioned by Charles Urban, head of the Warwick Trading Company and the Star Films representative in London. The film {{was ready to be}} released {{on the day of the}} coronation, however, the event was postponed for six weeks due to Edward's health. This allowed Méliès to add actual footage of the carriage procession in the film. The film was financially successful and King Edward VII was said to have <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it.</b> Next, Méliès made the féeries Gulliver's Travels Among the Lilliputians and the Giants, based on the novel by Jonathan Swift, and Robinson Crusoe, based on the novel by Daniel Defoe.|$|E

His fury increased with each failure as he scored it. With each defeat he flung off one or another rag of his raiment, and every time he started on a fresh inning he made it [...] "double or quits" [...] once more. Twice he reached thirty and broke down; once he reached thirty-one and broke down. These [...] "nears" [...] made him frantic, and I believe I was never so happy in my life, except the time, a few years later, when the Rev. J. H.

He wanted to analyze why some people were offended by its use and others <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it,</b> noting that the word sharpened debate about taboo language in society.|$|E

[...] Belushi later gave Kelley a signed videotape of the sketch; he had written [...] "Live Long and Prosper" [...] on the tape. Kelley sent the videotape to close friends when Belushi died because {{he did not want to}} hold on to the memento which brought up sad memories of his loss.|$|E
500|$|Recognizing McKinley's potential, the Democrats, {{whenever}} they controlled the Ohio legislature, sought to gerrymander or redistrict {{him out of}} office.

We <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> {{as much as he}} did." [...] After the 1882 election, McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party-line House vote. Out of office, he was briefly depressed by the setback, but soon vowed to run again. The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election; McKinley was returned to Congress anyway.|$|E
