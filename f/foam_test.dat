The incidence of HMD in all neonates diminished from 3, 25 % in 1971, when the lung maturity test was not done, to 2, 12 % in 1975, the 4 th year that such determinations were done. In the same period the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) increased from 3, 68 % to 4, 31 %. Only 1 % of fetuses in whom lung maturity was determined during the period 1972 - 1975 developed HMD. This reduced incidence of HMD is considered {{to be the result of}} prenatal determination of fetal lung maturity. No correlation was found between fetal lung maturity and length of gestation or physical condition of the neonate. The <b>foam</b> <b>test</b> results were compared with the L/S ratio, and a false positive figure of 8, 3 % and a false negative figure of 27, 1 % were found.

30|$|The {{published}} {{studies have demonstrated}} the superiority of coreflood stability tests over the bulk <b>foam</b> stability <b>tests.</b> However, {{it is not possible}} to discard the later altogether because of practical reasons. It is not feasible to screen a large number of surfactants using coreflood which require expensive specialized test equipment and take a few days to conduct a single <b>test</b> vs. bulk <b>foam</b> stability <b>tests</b> that use glassware commonly available in laboratories and take only a few hours for a test. Because of the bulk <b>foam</b> stability <b>test’s</b> simplicity and low cost, several screening systems can also run in parallel. Also, some studies show a positive correlation between the two. More studies are needed in an attempt to understand how the bulk <b>foam</b> stability <b>tests</b> can be utilized more intuitively, albeit as an initial screening tool. With this aim in mind, the current study looks into different and more in-depth ways of comparing the two methods of screening. It should be re-emphasized here that this study focuses on oil-free conditions only since studies in the past showed a positive correlation between bulk and core tests in the absence of oil while the use of bulk <b>foam</b> stability <b>test</b> for screening surfactants is ambiguous in the presence of oil.|$|R

40|$|Influences on foam {{stability}} and cling were compared by brewing trials investigating beer hopping rate, hopping type and modification of beer protein composition by {{the inclusion of}} a proline specific protease (PSEP). The comparison of the NIBEM, Rudin and lacing foam assessment methods with the level of hopping demonstrated the superiority of hydrogenated hop α-acids with respect to {{foam stability}} and particularly lacing. In addition, the NIBEM and Rudin foam analysis tests appear to respond relatively similarly with respect to hopping rate and hop type, with the NIBEM being somewhat more responsive in terms of foam stability measurements. The PSEP trials suggested that protein composition may only have a subtle effect on foam stability. Although more specific to haze active proteins, PSEP treatment in the small and pilot scale trials generally, but not always, resulted in a minor reduction in foam stability. This effect was not observed in 20 hL pilot and industrial scale beer productions. It was verified that both NIBEM and Rudin were positively influenced by increased levels of foam positive proteins. Although both foam tests were responsive to hopping rate and type, it is suggested that the Rudin <b>foam</b> <b>test</b> is somewhat biased towards foam positive proteins, particularly albuminous foam positive proteins (LTP 1 and protein Z 4), while in comparison the NIBEM <b>foam</b> <b>test</b> appears somewhat biased towards hordein foam positive proteins.

The effect of viscosity on the two bitumens' decay properties was discussed and explained; and the observation of the tests confirms this explanation is rational. For developing the bitumens' decay functions, a four-parameter power function and a three-parameter exponential function were selected to fit the testing data of PG 60 and PG 100 bitumen, respectively.
