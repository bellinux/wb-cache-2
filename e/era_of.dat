40|$|We {{explore how}} interorganizational {{networks}} coevolve with {{technology in the}} modern flight simulation industry. Since industries characterized by complex technologies, like flight simulation, rely on cooperative groups such as technical committees, task forces, and standards bodies to adjudicate the process of technological evolution, we focus on these groups and term them “cooperative technical organizations ” (CTOs). Focusing on CTOs enables a multi-level examination of interorganizational networks, as individuals represent their employing organizations in CTOs, mapping into overlapping membership patterns which generate community-wide networks. We develop a set of propositions on the emergence, growth and re-formation of CTO networks, and explore how the evolution of these networks both shapes and is constrained by technological outcomes in the flight simulation industry. We argue that varying levels of technological uncertainty between <b>eras</b> <b>of</b> ferment (high uncertainty) and <b>eras</b> <b>of</b> incremental change (low uncertainty) engender fundamentally different modes of network evolution: social construction during <b>eras</b> <b>of</b> ferment, and technological determinism during <b>eras</b> <b>of</b> incrementa...|$|R
