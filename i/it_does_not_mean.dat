5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E
5|$|Truce {{terms are}} {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having a stitch, a shoelace being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Definition of {{employee}} participation: <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> participation in day-to-day decisions, {{which are a}} matter for the management, but participation in the supervision and strategic development of the company.|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> {{that the}} total number of minuscules was 1460, because some of them belonged to the same manuscripts.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} periods of {{diversity}} that {{develop in the}} current Venezuela, which also entering a new period, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> {{the end of the}} previous.|$|R
60|$|That 'if' gave Philip some comfort, though <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> what he fancied. He {{thought of}} Guy's recovery; Guy {{referred}} {{to the possibility of}} Amabel's guardianship.|$|R
25|$|Past simple accent {{retraction}} is regular, {{present tense}} accent retraction is sporadic. If a particular verb retracts its accent in one tense, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> {{that the other}} tense will follow suit.|$|E
25|$|If both Islam and Christianity view {{themselves}} as universal and missionary, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> an impasse but an opportunity to search further into the mystery of that faith {{to see how it}} resonates and relates to the other's faith.|$|E
25|$|Material cause {{describes}} the material {{out of which}} something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that one domino knocks over another domino.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the canal}} was nearing its maximum {{capacity}}, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that ships {{were unable to}} transit it. Rather, the canal's growth capacity stagnated {{and that it could}} not capture additional cargo volumes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that," [...] said Jock, hanging his mischievous black head a little, as he {{felt her}} shudder; [...] "but I {{thought it would be}} such fun to be Columbus." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{received}} a post-card from him, {{and she put}} it in her bosom. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> much to her, really. The second day, she lost it, and never even remembered she had had it, till some days afterwards.|$|R
25|$|A breed {{that is not}} {{recognised}} by a {{kennel club}} means {{that it has not}} been sufficiently vetted according to that particular kennel club's rules. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the breed is not a breed. Major kennel clubs usually require a breed to have a specific amount of documentation, as well as a large enough breed club to warrant the training of judges for the breed, for the breed to be accepted.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak {{repeated}} {{his support for}} the peace plan. He also stated that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> recognizing Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, since that would imply giving up the right of return. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman also made similar statements and he called on the international community to push Israel towards accepting the peace plan. Both leaders had responded to an address by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.|$|E
25|$|The use of 2, 4 and 6 {{as opposed}} to 9, 11 and 13 {{indicates}} that the chord does not include a 7th unless specifically specified. However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that these notes must be played within an octave of the root, nor the extended notes in 7th chords should be played outside of the octave, although it is commonly the case. 6 is particularly common in a minor sixth chord (also known as minor/major sixth chord, as the 6 refers to a major sixth interval).|$|E
50|$|The {{inclusion}} of Mount Ararat brought objections from Turkey because the mountain {{is part of}} its territory. The Kremlin retorted that although the Turkish symbol was the crescent, surely <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that they laid claim to the moon.|$|R
6000|$|... ... Did you ever, {{five years}} ago, hear of {{anybody in the}} world saying that the negro had no share in the Declaration of National Independence; that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> negroes at all; and when [...] "all men" [...] were spoken of, negroes were not included? ...|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} formal title comes was also borne by some dignitaries of the Court (e. g. comes curiae) and other nobles in the Early Middle Ages, {{and then by}} other members of middle nobility in the Late Middle Ages, and <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> count in these cases.|$|R
25|$|Proof {{beyond a}} {{reasonable}} doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one {{would be willing to}} rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.|$|E
25|$|A common {{understanding}} exists {{that in the}} national level HOV model fits well. In fact, Davis and others found that HOV model fitted extremely well with the regional data of Japan. Even when the HOV formula fits well, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that Heckscher–Ohlin theory is valid. Indeed, Heckscher–Ohlin theory claims {{that the state of}} factor endowments of each country (or each region) determines the production of each country (respectively of each region) but Bernstein and Weinstein found that the factor endowments have little predictive power. The factor-endowments-driven model (FED model) has errors much greater than the HOV model.|$|E
25|$|According to Shia theologians, infallibility is {{considered}} a rational necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility {{is based on the}} Shia interpretation of the verse of purification. Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but {{due to the fact that}} they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that is a sin.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{resigned}} {{my position}} in Pertamina because I saw how Pertamina <b>did</b> <b>not</b> deliver its best {{service to the}} public. Although it is a profit-oriented company but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>it</b> solely seek profits since it manages natural resources that are strategic for public needs," [...] said Endriartono.|$|R
2500|$|Lulz Security {{attempted}} to hack into Nintendo, but both {{the group and}} Nintendo itself report that no particularly valuable information was found by the hackers. LulzSec claimed that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> to harm Nintendo, declaring: [...] "We're not targeting Nintendo. We like the N64 too much— we sincerely hope Nintendo plugs the gap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so. That is what 'those places' {{are meant}} for, I suppose. But {{it was not}} {{apparently}} a great infliction." [...] Lord Silverbridge had to explain {{that it was not}} an infliction;--that it was a privilege, seeing that Miss Boncassen was both clever and lovely; but that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> anything in particular.|$|R
25|$|An MOT test {{certificate}} confirms {{that at the}} time of test, the vehicle has met the minimum acceptable environmental and road safety standards. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the vehicle is roadworthy for the life of the certificate. The test does not cover the condition of the engine (other than the emissions), clutch or gearbox. Maintenance that is necessary for the reliable and efficient operation of the vehicle but not its safety forms part of a service inspection that is recommended by manufacturers, but is not a legal requirement for operating the vehicle on the public highway.|$|E
25|$|The term connotes that {{evidence}} establishes a particular {{point to a}} moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no reasonable doubt is possible from the evidence presented. Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, i.e., when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Sachs' critique, Acemoglu and Robinson replied on their book blog with twelve specific points. First, {{on the role}} of geography, Acemoglu and Robinson agree that geography is crucial in shaping institutions but do not recognize a deterministic role of geography in economic performance. Second, on the positive role authoritarian governments can play in economic growth, {{especially in the case of}} China, the fast economic growth could be part of the catch-up effect. However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that authoritarian governments are better than democratic governments in promoting economic growth. It is still way too early, according to Acemoglu and Robinson, to draw a definite conclusion solely based on the example of China. Last, on industrialization, they argue that industrialization is contingent upon institutions.|$|E
50|$|Robert Waite was {{committed}} to objective history. To be objective for him meant that the historian must avoid distorting the evidence to fit a subjective interpretation. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the historian should be morally neutral, however. “How can one be morally neutral about Nazi death camp Auschwitz?” he would demand with a quivering voice.|$|R
5000|$|Māori {{academic}} Dr Ranginui Walker, in {{a detailed}} {{letter to the}} Waikato Times, {{said that in the}} modern age a taniwha was the manifestation of a coping mechanism for some Māori. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> there actually was a creature lurking in the water, it was just their way of indicating they were troubled by some incident or event.|$|R
50|$|Although Indonesia had re-adopted the 1945 Constitution, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>it</b> was {{strictly}} adhered to. The MPR, which {{at this stage}} was still on a provisional basis (MPRS), was subservient to the president despite its status of the Nation's highest Governing Body. It was only in 1966, when the political tide began to turn against Sukarno that the MPRS nominally regained its rightful constitutional status.|$|R
25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E
500|$|John Koller states anekāntavāda to be [...] "epistemological {{respect for}} view of others" [...] {{about the nature}} of {{existence}} whether it is [...] "inherently enduring or constantly changing", but [...] "not relativism; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> conceding that all arguments and all views are equal".|$|E
500|$|On July 16, 2014, Scott {{was honored}} at the ESPY Awards, with the Jimmy V Award for his ongoing battle against cancer. He shared {{that he had}} 4 {{surgeries}} in 7 days in the week prior to his appearance, when {{he was suffering from}} liver complications and kidney failure. Scott told the audience, [...] "When you die, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and {{in the manner in which}} you live." [...] At the ESPYs, a video was also shown that included scenes of Scott from a clinic room at Johns Hopkins Hospital and other scenes from Scott's life fighting cancer. Scott ended the speech by calling his daughter up to the stage for a hug, [...] "because I need one," [...] and telling the audience to [...] "have a great rest of your night, have a great rest of your life." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2007, the Prince caused {{controversy}} when it {{published a}} fictitious editorial in its [...] "joke issue" [...] regarding the Jian Li lawsuit. Some Asian groups complained {{for its use}} of offensive stereotypes, which included portrayals of Asian-Americans as people who cook greasy food and wash clothes. The Prince issued a statement concerning its motivations and expectations for the piece, stating that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> to be offensive but rather satirical.|$|R
50|$|In 10-20% of all men, the semen <b>does</b> <b>not</b> endure cryopreservation. The {{cause is}} unknown. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{necessarily}} <b>mean</b> an otherwise bad semen quality.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{the other}} {{economies in the}} region, The Philippines {{was the only one}} of a mere handful of {{countries}} in the whole world to have recorded a positive economic growth in 2009 and averted the effects of economic recession. However, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the country experienced no effect of the ongoing world financial crisis. The economy was based on the remittances of the Overseas Filipino Workers, most of them working in affected countries like the United States.|$|R
