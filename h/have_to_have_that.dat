5000|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame {{just for the sake of}} fame, no matter what — sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how she could come out of that [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying:"Who better to say those things don't matter than somebody who's experienced them? may say, 'How can you say they don't matter? How can you say that money won't bring you happiness if you don't have a lot of money? How can you say that fame and fortune are not a guarantee for happiness and joy and fulfillment in your life?' You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> experience to know. 'Cause you have all those things, I've had all those things, and I've had nothing but chaos around me. So I'm just sharing what I know with the world. 'Cause I do think that we've become completely consumed with being rich and famous, our society has. And I just want to tell people, take it from me, I have all those things and none of them ever brought me one minute of happiness."The glamorous world of Hollywood also reflected in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that [...] "in Hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of the future. You can lose everything because you can lose yourself." [...] The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate on the things that did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track [...] "Mother and Father". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was [...] "a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on." [...] According to Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, another concept of American Life was about [...] "nothingness". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But [...] "Nothing Fails", along with tracks [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track [...] "Easy Ride," [...] which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} about how {{recreational}} pedagogues need {{to do their work}} to be a good support for children who comes from families that have social problems. The paper is based on a life story method with a recreational pedagogue who has worked at a recreational center her whole career. The purpose of the paper is to contribute with knowledge about the experiences of working with socially vulnerable children as a recreational pedagogue. The investigation {{that took place in the}} home-environment of the pedagogue was then typed out and rewritten by me to a narrative story where the most relevant pieces have been pointed out. The subject of the investigation is about being a child in a family with a problem of abuse and the significance of working with the children from those families. The story also includes the duty to report and how you as a recreational pedagogue do the appraisal if the child is being treated badly in their home. The result of the interview has then been held up against the literature about the social services work, a scientific rapport in form of a quantitative investigation that shows facts of how the duty of reporting incongruity to social services is being handled in real life, other scientific research of socially vulnerable children and youth and a book made by family therapists and is about the roles of the pedagogues. The conclusions that I could show from the investigation was that there has not been much research done about the recreational centers and socially vulnerable children together. That the most important toll that a pedagogue has got to help these children is our language, our experiences and our commitment. Another conclusion I have made is that we are all individuals. Teachers, parents and pupils, we all have different needs and different basic conditions and therefore we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> in mind while we do our work...|$|E
