5|$|The Ornithological Dictionary is George Montagu's best-known work, and the {{one that}} {{established}} his reputation as a pioneer of British ornithology. He compiled the book at his home Knowle House, near Kingsbridge in Devon. It was published soon after the first volume of Thomas Bewick's illustrated handbook, A History of British Birds, which appeared in 1797. It does not describe what is now called Montagu's harrier, which he separated from the <b>hen</b> <b>harrier</b> in 1803, after the publication of the book.|$|E
5|$|As many as 50,000 pink-footed geese, 13,000 Eurasian wigeon and 7,000 brent geese winter at Holkham, {{making it}} of {{international}} importance for these species. Up to 400 white-fronted geese {{and a few}} tundra bean geese may join the wildfowl flocks, and the odd peregrine falcon, short-eared owl, merlin, marsh harrier or <b>hen</b> <b>harrier</b> may hunt over the fields. The shingle banks and foreshore hold wintering flocks of shore larks, snow buntings and twite, and waders like knots, curlews, dunlins and grey plover probe for invertebrates in the mud flats.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as <b>hen</b> <b>harrier</b> and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E

5|$|Wales’ {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets, Manx shearwater, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and razorbills. In comparison, with 60% of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel. Birds of prey include the merlin, <b>hen</b> <b>harrier</b> and the red kite, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy, including seasonal visitors.|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders {{are present in}} the Outer Hebrides, including common redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The islands also provide a habitat for other important species such as corncrake, <b>hen</b> <b>harrier,</b> golden eagle and otter. Offshore, basking shark and various species of whale and dolphin can often be seen, and the remoter islands' seabird populations are of international significance. St Kilda has 60,000northern gannets, amounting to 24% of the world population; 49,000breeding pairs of Leach's petrel, up to 90% of the European population; and 136,000pairs of puffin and 67,000northern fulmar pairs, about 30% and 13% of the respective UK totals. Mingulay is an important breeding ground for razorbills, with 9,514pairs, 6.3% of the European population.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue and {{its tributaries}} support a {{population}} of European eels (Anguilla anguilla). Reptiles found include the European adder (Vipera berus) and grass snake (Natrix natrix). Multiple bird species include Bewick's swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris), Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), *Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), gadwall (Anas strepera), grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), <b>hen</b> <b>harrier</b> (Circus cyaneus), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus), marsh tit (Poecile palustris), merlin (Falco columbarius), northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), peregrine (Falco peregrinus), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), teal (Anas cracca), willow tit (Poecile montanus) and yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella).|$|E
50|$|These {{remnants}} of the Sandlings Heaths consist of dry grass and heather heathland, together with areas of bracken, scrub and pine and birch woodland. Breeding birds include long-eared owls, and <b>hen</b> <b>harriers</b> roost there in the winter.|$|R
50|$|Winter {{is also a}} {{good time}} for birds of prey with buzzard, red kite, <b>hen</b> <b>harriers,</b> merlins and kestrels being {{observed}} around the reservoir and the surrounding moorland. Ospreys and golden eagles are frequently observed on passage.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{amongst the}} {{breeding}} birds are gadwall, shovellers, and reed, sedge, grasshopper and Cetti's warblers. Marsh harriers are regular visitors and occasionally breed. Migrants include Jack snipe and green sandpiper, and winter visitors include <b>hen</b> <b>harriers</b> and bearded tits.|$|R
25|$|Among the birdlife {{which can}} be seen at Cors Caron are buzzard, {{peregrine}} falcon, merlin, Eurasian sparrowhawk and <b>hen</b> <b>harrier.</b> There have also been rare sightings of Montagu's harrier. The reserve provides a habitat for the endangered red kite. Once nearly extinct, the bird of prey has made a dramatic resurgence in the area. The wetlands attract a variety of wild fowl such as the teal, curlew, and water rail. Snipe, red grouse, tree pipit, grasshopper warbler and whinchat can be seen more in the drier areas and the common redstart and willow warbler nest in the willow scrub.|$|E
25|$|There are 147 avian {{species that}} are {{associated}} with the Peneda-Gerês park, especially along the Mourela region {{in the southern part of}} its frontier. In this region, although it might vary throughout the year (given climate and season), approximately 36 species make their nests in the area. Of particular note in this park are the: <b>hen</b> <b>harrier</b> (Circus cyaneus), European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), garden warbler(Sylvia borin) and whinchat (Saxicola rubetra). For the winchat (Saxicola rubetra), the area of Mourela is the unique nesting ground in Portugal, while the red-backed shrike and yellowhammer are limited to Castro Lombeiro plateau and northern corners of the park.|$|E
25|$|The reserve {{comprises}} a vast open lowland {{landscape with}} {{a mosaic of}} swamps, moors, lakes, rivers and forests located between the basins of the Bug and Wieprz rivers. The site {{is part of the}} European Ecological Corridor of the Bug River. The location supports bird species including raptors such as lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina), <b>hen</b> <b>harrier</b> (Circus cyaneus) and Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) and birds such as aquatic warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola), marsh sandpiper (Tringa stagnatilis) and Eurasian cranes (Grus grus). The area is considered to be an important crossing point for migratory birds. The north-south flyways and east-west flyways of birds meet in the region. The areas consists of boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests, black alder (Alnus glutinosa) wetland forests, meadows and peatbog (raised bog, transitional bog and fen) ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders are also present, including redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The reserve {{is also home}} to greylag geese on the loch and in summer corncrakes on the machair. Otters and <b>hen</b> <b>harriers</b> are also seen.|$|R
50|$|This is coastal {{freshwater}} marsh {{which is}} grazed by sheep, and is worked by traditional methods which encourage wildlife. Areas of ungrazed rough pasture have badgers, and field voles and pygmy shrews are hunted by <b>hen</b> <b>harriers</b> and short-eared owls.|$|R
50|$|The {{estate is}} {{noted for its}} two {{families}} of otters (on the northern shore) and a seal colony on the reef of Killunaig. Also seen here are red deer (in the moors), peregrine falcons, sea and golden eagles, ravens, <b>hen</b> <b>harriers,</b> wild goats, and others.|$|R

60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, <b>hen</b> <b>harrier,</b> Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E
40|$|Capsule]: Breeding female <b>Hen</b> <b>Harriers</b> hunted mostly within 1 km {{from the}} nest and males mostly within 2 km. [Aims]: To {{quantify}} {{temporal and spatial}} variation in home-range sizes and hunting distances of breeding male and female <b>Hen</b> <b>Harriers.</b> [Methods]: We radio-tracked ten breeding harriers (five males and five females) in three Special Protection Areas in Scotland between 2002 and 2004. [Results]: Male <b>Hen</b> <b>Harriers</b> travelled up to 9 km from nests but had a home-range size that averaged only 8 km 2 (90 % kernel); average home-range size for females was 4. 5 km 2. Hunting distances did not vary throughout the season. No {{significant differences were found}} among study areas, but there was large individual variability. [Conclusion]: Our results provide information on foraging harriers to support management: actions within 1 km of nesting sites will favour both sexes, and within 2 km will mostly favour males. Our data also suggest overlap between foraging areas of neighbouring birds. Thus, there is the potential for good foraging areas to be utilized by multiple breeding pairs.
