40|$|Apart from {{patients}} with peptic ulcer disease, {{the use of}} eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection has been extended to patients with H pylori-positive dyspepsia and conditions at risk for gastric cancer. Standard treatments comprise a proton pump inhibitor plus two antibiotics {{for at least one}} week. The main factors leading to treatment failure are noncompliance and antibiotic resistance. Provided the patient is sufficiently informed about possible side effects, discontinuation of the newer triple therapies has become rare. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance varies considerably among different geographic regions, reflecting the habits of prescription of these antibiotics for other indications. Largely, it ranges from 1 % to 15 % for macrolides, and from 7 % to 60 % for nitroimidazoles. With nitroimidazole resistance, treatment failure occurs in only less than 50 %; with macrolide resistance, by contrast, in more than 50 % of the cases. Futhermore, bacterial and host-related factors (Cag A virulence <b>factor,</b> <b>grade</b> of inflammation) contribute to eradication success. In case of treatment failure, post-therapeutic resistance is frequent. Important principles for the choice of second-line treatment are: not to repeat an antibiotic with potential post-therapeutic resistance, and to ensure sufficient acid suppression...|$|E

40|$|This mixed methods {{sequential}} {{explanatory study}} was conducted for two purposes: (a) {{to determine the number}} of low-income Nebraska high school students who participated in the state funded Access College Early (ACE) dual enrollment program and subsequently enrolled in college, and (b) to explore the factors related to dual enrollment participation of dually enrolled low-income ACE students and their subsequent enrollment in college. The population for this study consisted of 220 senior ACE scholarship recipients in 2007 - 08. Dual enrollment in high school and subsequent college enrollment, with a concentration on low-income students, had not been researched in Nebraska and minimally in other research studies. The researcher deemed that both quantitative and qualitative research methods would provide a more complete analysis. ^ The quantitative phase determined {{a significant difference between the}} college-going rates of Nebraska low-income high school students who received ACE scholarships to dual enroll in classes and those students who did not receive an ACE scholarship. Furthermore, the analyses determined that only one <b>factor,</b> <b>grade</b> point average (GPA), was predictive of Nebraska low-income ACE students’ subsequent enrollment in college. ^ The qualitative case study involved interviews with ten low-income ACE dual enrollment students. The qualitative phase explained the factors or influences the students cited as encouragement to participate in dual enrollment courses and subsequently enroll in college. Six themes emerged from the qualitative phase: (a) dual enrollment was an opportunity, saved money, and provided a head start; (b) family, friends, and extended family were sources of encouragement; (c) dual enrollment encouraged enrollment in college; (d) scholarships were critical; (e) teachers and counselors were instrumental; and (f) participants expressed strong self-motivation and inner drive. ...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{prognosis}} plays a {{vital role}} in predicting the survival of patients. In the case of breast cancer, prognostic indices are frequently used for estimating survival of patients.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of Levamisole (LMS) was studied on prolongation of patient survival and modulation of cellular immunity {{in a total}} of 220 cases of gastric cancer (136 cases for control and 84 cases for LMS group). In the study, detailed analyses were performed in 64 cases of stage Ⅲ, in which LMS therapy was effective and influence of background factors was minimum (32 cases for control and 32 cases for LMS group). LMS was administered 150 mg/day for three consecutive days every other week beginning from three days before operation, and was continued more than than two months and upto two years. The results obtained were as follows: 1) In cases of gastric cancer, the survival rate of the LMS group, was significantly higher than that of the control group (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, the {{efficacy of}} LMS on prolongation of survival rate was remarkable in the group of stage Ⅲ (p< 0. 05). 2) A detailed study in the group of stage Ⅲ was performed and resulted in the following: First, when stage Ⅲ cases were classified into curative and noncurative cases, LMS was effective in prolonging the survival of patients who received curative resection. Secondly, the efficacy of LMS was investigated in terms of tumor size. No difference in patient survival was observed between the control and LMS group, when tumor size was less than 3. 9 cm or more than 8. 0 cm in diameter. However, a significant effect of LMS therapy was detected for cases whose tumor was between 4. 0 cm and 7. 9 cm in diameter and depth of invasion was se (P< 0. 05). Thirdly, influence of lymph node metastasis on the effect of LMS was analysed. LMS was effective to a significant degree if the metastasis did not extend beyond lymph nodes classified in group I (n(1)) (p< 0. 05). Fourthly, when localization or histopathological grading of tumor was considered, the survival rate of LMS group tended to be high if the tumor was localized in the bulk of the corpus and belonged to a undifferentiated type. Fifthly, the (v) <b>factor,</b> <b>grade</b> of invasion into veins, was evaluated. LMS was effective in cases of v(0). And also, the efficacy of LMS was observed in cases classified as INF β in terms of form of infiltration. 3) Mitogen responses, cell number and T-cell percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes and also PPD skin test were examined to evaluate immunological status of gastric cancer patients receiving LMS therapy. The data suggested that LMS activated promptly and normalized the cellular immunity in cases of advanced gastric cancer classified into stage Ⅲ and Ⅳ in which cellular immunity was reduced.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the approach of}} GRADE to rating quality of evidence. GRADE specifies four categories-high, moderate, low, and very low-that are applied to a body of evidence, not to individual studies. In {{the context of a}} systematic review, quality reflects our confidence that the estimates of the effect are correct. In the context of recommendations, quality reflects our confidence that the effect estimates are adequate to support a particular recommendation. Randomized trials begin as high-quality evidence, observational studies as low quality. "Quality" as used in GRADE means more than risk of bias and so may also be compromised by imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of study results, and publication bias. In addition, several factors can increase our confidence in an estimate of effect. GRADE provides a systematic approach for considering and reporting each of these <b>factors.</b> <b>GRADE</b> separates the process of assessing quality of evidence from the process of making recommendations. Judgments about the strength of a recommendation depend on more than just the quality of evidence...|$|R

Factor A`, three widely grown durum wheat varieties (Urfa- 2005, Firat- 93 and Aydin- 93), Factor B, the five various <b>grading</b> <b>factors</b> [yellow berry (YB), red bread wheat content (RBW), dark red bread wheat content (DRBW), sunn pest damaged kernel content (SP) and combinations of all above factors (combined effect) ] and Factor C, content ratios (2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 %) were utilized. The results, obtained from variance analysis, indicated that all sources of variation turned out to be statistically significant. The grain buyers had different purchasing criteria depending on their needs. Some durum wheat varieties were offered higher prices due to good semolina or bulgur color reputation in macaroni and bulgur industry. <b>Grading</b> <b>factors</b> under study had different effects on marketing price of durum wheat. Marketing price reduced as content ratios of all <b>grading</b> <b>factors</b> in durum wheat increased. It was found that combined effect could reduce the marketing price as much as $ 41 ton - 1, SP damage; $ 36 ton - 1, DRBW; $ 23 ton - 1, RBW; $ 13 ton - 1 and YB; $ 9 ton - 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Marijuana {{use among}} {{high school seniors}} {{increased}} {{during most of the}} 1970 s, decreased throughout the 1980 s, and has been increasing again during the 1990 s. Earlier analyses of the classes of 1976 through 1986 attributed the historic trends during that period to specific changes in views about marijuana. This study examined whether recent increases in marijuana use among seniors and among students in earlier grades reflect similar processes. METHODS: Multivariate regression analyses were conducted on data from large annual nationwide surveys of high school seniors from 1976 through 1996 (approximate n = 61, 000) and 8 th and 10 th graders from 1991 through 1996 (n's = 87, 911 and 82, 475, respectively). RESULTS: Individual lifestyle <b>factors</b> (<b>grades,</b> truancy, religious commitment, evenings out for recreation) correlated substantially with marijuana use but did not explain the historic changes in marijuana use. Rather, decreases in perceived risk of harmfulness and in disapproval can account for the recent increases in all 3 grades and for earlier decreases among seniors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that perceived risks and disapproval are important determinants of marijuana use. Accordingly, prevention efforts should include realistic information about risks and consequences of marijuana use...|$|R

RESULTS: Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, risk <b>factors</b> for <b>grade</b> 4 CIN were identified as older age, lower weight, higher planned dose intensity of doxorubicin, epirubicin, or docetaxel, higher number of planned cycles, vascular comorbidity, lower baseline white blood cell count, and higher baseline bilirubin. Use of colony-stimulating factor before a neutropenic event occurred, dose delays, and dose reductions were protective against grade 4 CIN. CONCLUSIONS: By identifying risk <b>factors</b> for <b>grade</b> 4 CIN, CSF prophylaxis may be appropriately targeted to prevent low RDI in patients treated with curative intent...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the faunas inhabiting an exposed sandy beach and the intertidal flats of an estuary is of interest b e c a u s e:- 1. unprotected sandy beaches are exposed to severe batterings by waves while the sandy flats of small estuaries suffer no such pounding; 2. {{the composition of the}} banks of an estuary varies f rom a coarse sand (s imilar to that of an open beach) at their seaward limits to a fine mud upstream; and 3. the salinity of the interstitial water of estuarine sand banks decreases from about that of the open sea {{at the mouth of the}} river to that of fresh water up-stream beyond the influence of the sea. Marakopa was a particularly suitable locality in which to study the macrofauna of these two environments since there occurred there both an open beach and a small meandering estuary with extensive sand and mud banks. A quantitative survey was carried out on the exposed beach of the fauna and two of the physical <b>factors</b> (<b>grade</b> and water content of the sand), and a qualitative survey was made of the fauna in the estuary together with a quantitative survey of the grade and water content of the sand and the salinity of the interstitial water...|$|R
