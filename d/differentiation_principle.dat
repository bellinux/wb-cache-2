This paper aims to evaluate the influence of physician to personalized medicine in the process of TBSD. Methods. We performed a randomized, triple-blind trial involving patients of primary insomnia treated by 3 physicians individually and independently. The patients (n= 30) were randomly assigned to receive treatments by the 3 physicians for every visit. However, they always received the treatment, respectively, prescribed by the physician at the first visit.

40|$|The paper {{assumes a}} product design around modular {{architectures}} and discusses {{the suitability of}} the principle of delayed product differentiation in assemble-to-order environments. We demonstrate that this principle does not enable one to make optimal decisions concerning how variety should proliferate in the assembly process. Therefore, we propose to complement this principle in that we additionally consider the variety induced complexity throughout the assembly process. The weighted Shannon entropy is proposed as a measure for the evaluation of this complexity. Our results show that the delayed product <b>differentiation</b> <b>principle</b> is reliable when the selection probabilities of module variants at each assembly stage are equal and the pace at which value is added in the whole assembly process is constant. Otherwise, the proposed measure provides different results. Furthermore, the entropy measure provides interesting clues concerning eventual reversals of assembly sequences and supports decisions regarding what modules in an assembly stage could be substituted by a common module. ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryEfficient {{differentiation}} of {{embryonic stem cells}} (ESCs) and {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) to a variety of lineages requires step-wise approaches replicating the key commitment stages found during embryonic development.

By monitoring Flk- 1 and PdgfR-α expression, we found that specification of cardiac mesoderm and cardiomyocytes is determined by remarkably small changes in levels of Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling. Translation to human ESCs and iPSCs revealed that the emergence of cardiac mesoderm could also be monitored by coexpression of KDR and PDGFR-α and that this process was similarly dependent on optimal levels of Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling. Importantly, we found that individual mouse and human pluripotent stem cell lines require optimization of these signaling pathways for efficient cardiac <b>differentiation,</b> illustrating a <b>principle</b> that may well apply in other contexts...|$|R

A review of food production based on development of nanotechnologies, as well as promising and cautioning publications on nanotechnologies in the food sector is presented. On the basis of the literary analysis, the future impact of nanotechnologies on the evolution of the aromatization process of food products is predicted.
