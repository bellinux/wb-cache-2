40|$|A new frontal electroelution {{approach}} {{that can be}} used for the preconcentration of amino acids in in-line solid-phase extraction–capillary electrophoresis (SPE–CE) has been developed. A single capillary was employed featuring a short monolithic SPE column created inside the capillary via photo-initiated, free-radical polymerisation of 3 -sulfopropyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate monomers. A weak electrolyte of dilute H 2 SO 4, pH 2. 9, was found to promote adsorption of the amino acids onto the SPE column. Elution of the amino acids was achieved using a dual solvation/ion-exchange transient boundary mobilised via EOF by using a strong electrolyte containing 62. 5 mM ethylenediamine, pH 2. 9 with H 2 SO 4 and 40 % (v/v) acetonitrile. Using these two electrolytes, tryptophan was adsorbed onto the SPE column in weak electrolyte and eluted via a frontal electroelution mechanism in the strong <b>electrolyte.</b> <b>Injections</b> up to 20 min, corresponding to over 14 column volumes (or 1400 % of the capillary volume) of sample provided quantitative extraction of tryptophan from the weak electrolyte and were eluted without any loss in efficiency.

40|$|Chytridiomycosis {{caused by}} the {{pathogen}} Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is an important cause of amphibian declines globally, and is the worst pathogen on record for causing biodiversity loss. The critically endangered southern corroboree frog, Pseudophryne corroboree, is functionally extinct in the wild and is surviving in captive assurance colonies. These captive colonies must remain disease free, {{and there is no}} known treatment for corroboree frogs with terminal chytridiomycosis. In this study we tested two triazole antifungals (itraconazole and voriconazole) coupled with aggressive electrolyte therapy on moribund corroboree frogs with severe chytridiomycosis. Six moribund frogs were given 20 mL baths of 0. 5 μg/mL itraconazole for 5 min/day for 5 days coupled with <b>electrolyte</b> <b>injections</b> every 8 h for 3 days followed by every 12 h for 3 days. Six other moribund frogs were given 1 mL drops of 1. 25 μg/mL voriconazole daily for 7 days coupled with the aggressive electrolyte therapy. While only one animal survived this treatment regime, time until death was extended for all animals by at least 3 days and infection load decreased by an average of 89. 3 %.

40|$|We {{report a}} force field on a {{particle}} in a concentration (conductivity) gradient under an externally applied oscillating electric field. The conductivity gradient was established through integrated microcapillaries bridging high-and low-conductivity streams in dedicated microchannels. Particles in low-conductivity electrolyte were observed {{to experience a}} strong force with the application of an oscillating field and pulled to the microcapillary openings where they were held against the flow. Particle trapping {{was accompanied by a}} concurrent <b>electrolyte</b> <b>injection</b> from high-to low-conductivity channel, triggered with the externally applied field and further contributed to the conductivity gradient near the trapping sites. We experimentally evaluated the force dependence on the magnitude and frequency of the excitation field for 10 mu m polystyrene particles immersed at various conductivity levels. The experiments suggest that the observed force cannot be simply explained by dielectrophoresis or diffusiophoresis alone and further requires the consideration of a so-called concentration polarization force. This force has been rather recently postulated based on a theoretical treatment and yet to be experimentally validated. Using the theoretical treatment of this force, together with fluidic drag and diffusiophoresis, we correctly predicted trapping trajectories of particles based on a simultaneous solution of Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Stokes equations. The predicted and measured trapping velocities were found in reasonable agreement (within a factor of < 1. 6), suggesting that the consideration of the concentration polarization force is necessary for describing the observed particle behavior.

The PFEMs could be easily loaded into a photovoltaic device without adding a traditional <b>electrolyte</b> <b>injection</b> through a hole. In {{order to meet the}} requirements of both high energy conversion efficiency and proper long-term stability, three different solvents with high boiling point, i. e. valeronitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethylacetamide, were appropriately mixed as a volumetric ratio of 7 : 2 : 1, respectively. As a result, similar conductivity and viscosity as well as better chemical stability were obtained compared to those of conventional 3 -methoxypropionitrile-based electrolyte. In addition, linear relations were observed between the photovoltaic efficiency and porous film properties (i. e. porosity and tortuosity). The DSSC employing the PFEM doped with the mixed solvent based electrolyte exhibited the photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 6. 30 % at one sun condition.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report a}} pump−probe {{spectroscopy}} study of electron injection rates in {{dye-sensitized solar cell}} (DSSC) devices. We examine the case of working devices employing an N 719 ruthenium sensitizer and an iodide <b>electrolyte.</b> Electron <b>injection</b> is found to occur mainly on a sub- 100 fs time scale, followed by a slower component with a lifetime of 26. 9 ps, in accordance with previous reports on model samples. The amplitude of this latter component varies with electrolyte composition from 25 to 9 %. The appearance of slower components in the electron injection dynamics {{may be attributed to}} an aggregated or weakly bound state of the surface-adsorbed N 719 sensitizer. Further measurements are reported varying the cell light bias and load conditions, revealing no influence on electron injection dynamics. No other electron injection event is found to occur up to 1 ns.

40|$|Electron {{injection}} in dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSC) has been extensively studied in the present thesis. Many transient and steady-state experimental techniques were utilized: ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in the visible, near-IR and mid-IR regions; time-correlated single photon counting; incident photon to current conversion measurement; temperature dependence of luminescence and device efficiency; determination of energy conversion efficiency parameters. All these methods were collated and analysed as a whole, providing a very detailed picture of the electron injection. It was found that in devices utilizing the most efficient Ru-bipyridyl dyes and commercially viable, performance optimized iodine/triiodide <b>electrolytes,</b> electron <b>injection</b> kinetics are multiphasic, with significant components in the femtosecond, tens of picoseconds and in nanosecond regimes. The broad non-exponential kinetics gave rise to non- 100 % efficient injection. A fraction of the dyes manage to decay giving rise to luminescence. All of these observations were fully quantified and validated by performing measurements on different systems. The huge length of the delay lines in TAS measurements and very broad probe wavelengths used in the current work gave a very detailed picture of the injection process. Along the way, some very basic experiments were done, which added confidence to the results obtained in the thesis. In addition, interesting phenomena occurring in the ultrafast timescales were found and spectra of transient species such as the dye excited states were recorded.

This method was comprehensively optimized {{in terms of the}} leading electrolyte (LE) and terminating <b>electrolyte</b> (TE) <b>injection</b> lengths, as well as electrokinetic sample injection time. The optimized EKS conditions employed were as follows: hydrodynamic injection (HI) of 10 mM potassium chloride as LE at 150 mbar for 36 s (4 % of total capillary volume). The sample was injected at 10 kV for 300 s, followed by HI of 10 mM pimozide as TE at 150 mbar for 36 s (4 % of total capillary volume). Separation was performed in 7. 5 mM deoxycholic acid sodium salt, 15 mM acetic acid and 1 mM 18 -crown- 6 in 100 % methanol at + 25 kV with UV detection at 205 nm. Under optimized conditions, the sensitivity was enhanced between 160 - and 600 -fold when compared with our previously developed method based on HI at 150 mbar for 12 s.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Chemical EngineeringLarry A. GlasgowFeedlots, animal {{production}} facilities, and agricultural lands are point and non-point sources for nutrient enrichment of surrounding waterways {{and result in}} human enhanced eutrophication. Artificial elevation and increased enrichment from animal wastes, fertilizer, and runoff greatly increase the speed of this natural process and leads to degraded water quality, algae blooms, and fish kills. Phosphorous is typically the limiting nutrient for plant growth, and thus is {{the main focus of}} this paper. Phosphates enable excessive and choking plant growth that lead to depleted dissolved oxygen and excessive decaying plant matter, subsequently damaging the aquatic ecosystem. In order to provide an inexpensive and feasible solution to minimize phosphate eutrophication, a passive, vortex generating flume has been proposed to provide the necessary mixing for the removal of phosphorus from waste waters. Preliminary tests with dye tracers and <b>electrolyte</b> pulse <b>injections</b> have been conducted to model the flow characteristics and determine the residence time under a variety of flow conditions, angle of inclination and flow rate. The flume was modeled by two methods: four continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) in series and as four CSTRs in series operating in parallel with a plug flow reactor (PFR). The hydraulic model fit a total of five parameters to the experimental data: Residence time, the inlet concentrations of the electrolyte pulse tracer, and the injection times of the tracer to both types of reactors. The kinetic model was built based on data collected from a different study of swine lagoons using magnesium chloride to precipitate phosphorus as the mineral struvite. The precipitation kinetics were modeled using first order and irreversible reaction and incorporated into the hydraulic model. The vortex generating flume provided an operating space that sufficiently removed phosphorus from the waste stream.

40|$|A {{solid-phase}} extraction method {{based on}} an ion-exchange retention mechanism {{has been used for}} in-line preconcentration of inorganic anions prior to their separation by capillary electrophoresis (CE). A single capillary containing a preconcentration and a separation zone has been used in a commercial CE instrument without instrumental modification. Analyte anions were retained on a preconcentration zone comprising an adsorbed layer of cationic latex particles, while separation was achieved in a separation zone comprising fused silica modified by adsorption of a cationic polymer. Elution of the adsorbed analytes was achieved using an eluotropic gradient formed by a transient isotachophoretic boundary between a fluoride electrolyte and a naphthalenedisulfonate electrolyte. Optimization of the <b>electrolyte</b> concentrations, sample <b>injection</b> times, and back-flushing times allowed the successful separation of sub-ppb levels of inorganic anions using a 100 -min injection at 2 bar pressure, introducing over 40 capillary volumes of sample.

At moderate applied potentials (- 0. 2 V vs Ag/AgCl), and in the presence of potential determining ions (0. 1 M Li+) in the <b>electrolyte,</b> the electron <b>injection</b> kinetics were found to be multiphasic, with a half time for electron injection of 500 fs. These injection kinetics were retarded by either the omission of potential determining ions or the application of more negative potentials. Omission of Li+ ions from the electrolyte resulted in a 7 -fold retardation of the injections kinetics. The application of- 0. 7 V to the TiO 2 electrode resulted in a 25 -fold retardation of the injection kinetics. These observations are discussed in terms of nonadiabatic interfacial electron transfer theory. The retardation of the injection kinetics in the absence of potential determining ions is attributed to the influence of these ions upon the electronic density of states of the TiO 2 electrode. The retardation of the injection kinetics at negative applied potentials is attributed to the increased occupancy of this density of states.

40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) {{has shown}} to be highly suitable {{for the analysis of}} polar and ionogenic compounds in biomedical and pharmaceutical samples. Separation with CE is based on the charge-to-size ratio of analytes. The application of CE for bioanalysis may be hindered by its relatively low sensitivity. Two sample preconcentration techniques have been applied in this thesis, a dynamic pH junction and an in-capillary solid phase extraction column. In-capillary analyte stacking via dynamic pH junction was investigated with underivatised phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) as model amino acids. Samples were mixed with acidic background <b>electrolyte</b> prior to <b>injection.</b> A plug of ammonium hydroxide solution was injected before the sample to produce a pH junction. Zwitterionic amino acids have opposing charges in the respecting solvents and will thus get opposing mobilities. The amino acids stack at the interface between the solvents. LODs for Phe and Tyr in urine were 0. 054 and 0. 019 μM for a sample injection volume of 10 % of the capillary. Another technique for preconcentration of analytes employs an in-line frit-free solid-phase extraction (SPE) column. A 2 mm * 150 µm column was packed with mixed-mode sorbent for the preconcentration of the test compounds 2 -ethylidene- 1, 5 -dimethyl- 3, 3 -diphenylpirrolidine (EDDP), dihydrocodeine and codeine. The sorbent had a particle diameter of more than 50 µm and was retained between a short inlet capillary and a separation capillary (50 µm id). The injected sample volume was 60 µL (i. e., 30 capillary volumes). Using MS-detection, LODs were 0. 22 pg/mL for EDDP, 2. 1 pg/mL for dihydrocodeine and 24 pg/mL for codeine. For the analysis of opioid peptides, a similair SPE-column was packed with a C 18 sorbent. The column size was 4 mm * 150 µm, and the injected sample volume was 12 µL. Using SPE-CE-MS, the LODs varied between 0. 5 and 1. 0 ng/mL which represent an enhancement of two orders of magnitude when compared with CE-MS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples spiked with the opioid peptides were analyzed, and the opioid peptides could be detected down to 1. 0 ng/mL. In 2008, oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) present in certain lots of heparin was identified as the toxic contaminant responsible for severe side effects following intravenous heparin administration. A preliminary CE method published by the US Food and Drugs Administration showed only partial separation of the OSCS contaminant from heparin. In this thesis an improved CE method is described. Enhancement of the OSCS–heparin separation was achieved by using high concentrations of Tris phosphate (pH 3. 0) as background electrolyte. Good separations of OSCS, heparin and DS are obtained within 17 min. The method permits OSCS and DS determination in heparin down to the 0. 05 % and 0. 5 % (w/w) level, respectively. The CE method was further optimized to achieve shorter analysis times. Using a much shorter capillary, separation of OSCS, heparin and DS was obtained within 7 min. Detection limits for OSCS and DS were well below 0. 5 mg/mL. Further reduction of analysis time could be achieved by employing an effective capillary length of 10 cm, providing full separation within 4 min...|$|R
