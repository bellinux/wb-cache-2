5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

25|$|By 1911, {{there had}} been four English teams in Ceylon. Those were led by Ivo Bligh in 1882-83; George Vernon in 1889-90; Lord Hawke in 1892-93; and Andrew Stoddart in 1894-95. The Bligh and Stoddart teams were en route to Australia while the Vernon and Hawke ventures took in Ceylon as part of visits to India.

25|$|During a {{literary}} luncheon she is attending, Mrs Ariadne Oliver finds herself {{approached by a}} woman called Mrs Burton-Cox, whose son is engaged to Oliver's godchild, Celia Ravenscroft. During their conversation, Mrs Burton-Cox askes her an important question regarding the deaths of Celia's parents - {{was one of them}} murdered, and if so, who killed who? Ten years earlier, the bodies of Margaret Ravenscroft, a close school friend of Oliver, and General Alistair Ravenscroft, Margaret's husband, were found near their manor house in Overcliffe. The original investigation into their deaths revealed that both had bullet wounds, and that a revolver found between their bodies bore the fingerprints of the married couples, making it impossible to prove whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of double suicide or if it was a murder/suicide and who then was the victim and the other the murderer. The death of the Ravenscrofts left both Celia and another of their children orphaned.|$|E
25|$|After the 1973 general {{election}} Fine Gael {{came to power}} in a coalition government with the Labour Party with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, particularly after a good performance in a pre-election debate with the then Minister for Finance George Colley. However the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of history repeating itself as FitzGerald's father had held that post in a government led by Liam Cosgrave's father W. T. Cosgrave fifty years earlier. His appointment to Iveagh House (the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs) would have a huge effect on FitzGerald's own career and the future of Fine Gael. Cosgrave was suspicious of FitzGerald's liberal ideas and believed that he had designs on the leadership. During his period at Foreign Affairs, Fitzgerald developed a good relationship with Liam Cosgrave and all the tension that had existed between them in opposition disappeared.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{began on}} 1 October 1999 {{in the newly}} built Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, with Wales beating Argentina in a hard fought game 23–18 to get their {{campaign}} off to a positive start. The Pool stage of the tournament played out as was widely expected with the Tri Nations teams of New Zealand (who inflected a massive 101–3 win against Italy at the McAlpine Stadium in Huddersfield), South Africa and Australia all winning their pools easily without losing a single game. For the then Five Nations Championship teams who all played their pool matches {{in their own countries}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of mixed fortunes with France winning their pool without losing a game. Host Wales also won their pool, though they suffered 31–38 defeat at the hands of Samoa in front of a home crowd at the Millennium Stadium. However, as expected England, Ireland and Scotland all finished second in their pools and were forced to try to qualify for the quarter-finals via the play-offs alongside fellow runners-up Samoa and Fiji, and Argentina as the best third placed side from all five pools.|$|E

25|$|The trial against Bevan Spencer von Einem for {{the murder}} of Richard Kelvin opened at the Supreme Court Building of South Australia on 15 October 1984 before Mr. Justice White. A jury of 12 people (seven women and five men) were {{selected}} and were agreed upon by the prosecution and defence. Einem pleaded not guilty, and his defence was led by barrister Barry Jennings, who was assisted by Helena Jasinski, who had been Einem's solicitor {{from the start of the}} police investigation of him in the murder during the previous year. The prosecution was led by Brian Martin QC (later the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory), with assistance from Paul Rofe QC (who went on to be Director of the Department of Public Prosecutions). For the prosecution, it was a matter of proving Einem's guilt (along with that of unknown persons) by presenting the strong scientific evidence that had been gathered during the investigation, and disproving Einem's story of being in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. For the defence, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of trying to make Einem's story hold up in court, and raising doubts about his ability to keep Richard Kelvin captive for five weeks and committing the murder.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1713, Nehemiah Chiya Chayun {{arrived at}} Amsterdam and {{requested}} {{permission of the}} Portuguese congregation to circulate his writings, which had been published at Berlin. Ashkenazi thought Chayun was an old enemy of his from Sarajevo and Salonica, and at once requested Solomon Ayllon, Chacham of the Portuguese congregation, not to accord patronage to the stranger, who was unfavorably known to him. Ashkenazi believed himself justified in making this demand, as the Portuguese congregation and its rabbi had, from the beginning, treated him most courteously, and had already, during his term at Altona, repeatedly sent {{to him from the}} Sephardim of Hamburg, Amsterdam, and London religio-legal questions for his decision. Chayun thereupon called on Ashkenazi personally and made an explanation; whereupon the rabbi retracted his accusation, stating that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of mistaken identity. Meanwhile, several members of the Portuguese congregation had submitted Chayun's writings to the judgment of Moses Hagiz, a messenger from Jerusalem then sojourning at Amsterdam, who immediately discovered their Sabbatian principles and tendencies and gave the alarm. He also called the attention of Ashkenazi to the dangerous doctrines published in Chayun's book, whereupon the rabbi again warned the directorate of the Sephardim congregation not to support the author. Ashkenazi rejected a proposition to designate the objectionable passages, and declined to act as member of a committee of investigation, because he did not regard Ayllon, the rabbi of the Sephardim, as a competent authority on such questions. Thereupon a fierce contention ensued, during the progress of which Hagiz fought valiantly beside Ashkenazi.|$|E

Harris and Dickinson agreed to meet at Smallwood's home in Brighton in January 1999 for the first conversation they would have with each other since 1993.
