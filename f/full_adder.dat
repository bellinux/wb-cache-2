While studying the complicated ad hoc circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed switching circuits based on Boole's concepts. In 1937, he wrote his master's degree thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits, A paper from this thesis was published in 1938. In this work, Shannon proved that his switching circuits {{could be used to}} simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays that were used then in telephone call routing switches. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve. In the last chapter, he presents diagrams of several circuits, including a 4-bit <b>full</b> <b>adder.</b>|$|E

Both XOR and AND gates are straightforward to realize in digital logic allowing the realization of <b>full</b> <b>adder</b> circuits which in turn may be combined into more complex logical operations. In modern digital computers, integer addition is typically the fastest arithmetic instruction, yet it has the largest impact on performance, since it underlies all floating-point operations as well as such basic tasks as address generation during memory access and fetching instructions during branching. To increase speed, modern designs calculate digits in parallel; these schemes go by such names as carry select, carry lookahead, and the Ling pseudocarry. Many implementations are, in fact, hybrids of these last three designs. Unlike addition on paper, addition on a computer often changes the addends. On the ancient abacus and adding board, both addends are destroyed, leaving only the sum. The influence of the abacus on mathematical thinking was strong enough that early Latin texts often claimed that in the process of adding [...] "a number to a number", both numbers vanish. In modern times, the ADD instruction of a microprocessor often replaces the augend with the sum but preserves the addend. In a high-level programming language, evaluating [...] does not change either a or b; if the goal is to replace a with the sum this must be explicitly requested, typically with the statement [...] Some languages such as C or C++ allow this to be abbreviated as [...]|$|E

40|$|Tree Multipliers are {{frequently}} {{used to reduce}} the delay of array multipliers. The objective of tree multipliers is to utilize the concept of carry save adders in reducing the partial product.

This paper implements a multiplier which will perform reduction of partial products using 4 bit Carry Lookahead Adders primarily instead of <b>Full</b> <b>adders.</b> This will result in fewer reduction stages as <b>Full</b> <b>adders</b> reduces 3 partial products bits to 2 giving a 1. 5 to 1 ratio whereas 4 bit CLA will reduce 9 partial products bits to 5 giving 1. 8 to 1 ratio.

30|$|It may be {{understood}} that {{the difference in the}} latency values of the various RCAs, as seen in Table  2, is a direct consequence of the diverse elements recurring in their critical paths as shown in Table  3. It {{is important to note that}} less the number of logic element(s) and less complex the logic element(s) are in the critical path would imply reduced latency. Also, the difference between the area metrics of the various RCAs is attributable to the difference between the area metrics of the constituent <b>full</b> <b>adders,</b> with the areas of different <b>full</b> <b>adders</b> given in the 5 th column of Table  2. It is clear from Table  2 that the AOPT_EO_FA has the least area occupancy of 23.89  µm 2 in comparison with all the other asynchronous <b>full</b> <b>adders,</b> and the LOPT_EO_FA consumes 15  % more Silicon.|$|R

These <b>full</b> <b>adders</b> are in standard static logic and in dynamic logic. Dynamic logic style has some advantages compared to the static logic style. These advantages are as follows: the number of transistors is low, these transistors {{do not have any}} static power consumption, the speeds of switching are high, and the voltage levels are full swing. Dynamic logic style has also disadvantage of high switching activity [10].|$|R
30|$|Several 32 -bit {{asynchronous}} RCAs {{were constructed}} in a semi-custom design fashion at the gate-level by utilizing different strong-indication, weak-indication, and early output asynchronous <b>full</b> <b>adders</b> separately. The structural {{integrity of the}} different asynchronous <b>full</b> <b>adders</b> and RCAs was preserved during physical realization (i.e., technology mapping) {{to pave the way}} for legitimate comparison after synthesis. They were implemented using the elements of the 32 / 28  nm digital cell library (Synopsys 2012). The 2 -input C-element was alone designed manually using the AO 222 gate by incorporating feedback and was made available to realize the various asynchronous <b>full</b> <b>adders</b> and RCAs, registers, and the completion detector. Logic decomposition of higher fan-in C-element(s), where necessary, was performed according to the safe quasi-delay-insensitive logic decomposition procedure put forward in (Balasubramanian and Mastorakis 2011). The asynchronous system implemented, as shown in Fig.  1, comprises the RCA for the function block, the input registers, and the completion detection circuit. The input registers and the completion detector of various RCAs are identical, and only their asynchronous function blocks (i.e., RCAs) differ in their physical composition. Hence the differences between the simulation results obtained for the various asynchronous RCAs can be directly attributed to the physical differences between their constituent <b>full</b> <b>adders.</b>|$|R
