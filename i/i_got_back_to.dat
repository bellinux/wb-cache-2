2500|$|The band's 1999 double album The Fragile was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics and was a commercial success, selling over two million copies {{by the end of}} the year.

60|$|I {{was out of}} the river, and {{dressing}} instantly. In the shock I had taken some water into my mouth, and it turned me sick, for I fancied that the contamination of the creature was in it. <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my cool darkened room in the hotel, and was lying on a sofa there, before I began to reason with myself.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. <b>I</b> {{have never}} <b>got</b> any {{happiness}} outside Hintock that I know of, and I have suffered many a heartache at being sent away.
