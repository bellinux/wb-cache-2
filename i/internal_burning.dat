"On his right, by the sea-shore, Munnich finds some {{remains of}} gardens, palisades; scrapes {{together}} some vestige of shelter there (five thousand, or even ten thousand pioneers working desperately all that first night, 11th July, with only half success); {{and on the}} morrow commences firing with what artillery he has. Much outfired by the Turks inside;--his enterprise as good as desperate, unless the Dnieper flotilla come soon. July 12th, all day the firing continues, and all night; Turks extremely furious: {{about an hour before}} daybreak, we notice burning in the interior, 'Some wooden house kindled by us, town got on fire yonder,'--and, praise to Heaven, they do not seem to succeed in quenching it again.

'Advance within musket-shot, General Keith!' orders Munnich's Aide-de-Camp cantering up. 'I have been this good while within it,' answers Keith, pointing to his dead men.

Aide-de-Camp canters up a third time: 'Feldmarschall Munnich is for trying a scalade; hopes General Keith will do his best to co-operate!' 'Forward, then!' answers Keith; advances close to the glacis; finds a wet ditch twelve feet broad, and has not a stick of engineer furniture. Keith waits there two hours; his men, under fire all the while, trying this and that to get across; Munnich's scalade going off ineffectual in like manner:--till at length Keith's men, and all men, tire of such a business, and roll back in great confusion out of shot-range. Munnich gives himself up for lost. And indeed, says Mannstein, had the Turks sallied out in pursuit at that moment, they might have chased us back to Russia. But the Turks did not sally.

50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{radiation}} burn is a sunburn caused by UV radiation. High exposure to X-rays during diagnostic medical imaging or radiotherapy can also result in radiation burns. As the ionizing radiation interacts with cells within the body—damaging them—the body responds to this damage, typically resulting in erythema—that is, redness around the damaged area. Radiation burns are often associated with radiation-induced cancer due to the ability of ionizing radiation to interact with and damage DNA, occasionally inducing a cell to become cancerous. Cavity magnetrons can be improperly used to create surface and <b>internal</b> <b>burning.</b> Depending on the photon energy, gamma radiation can cause very deep gamma burns, with 60Co internal burns are common. Beta burns tend to be shallow as beta particles are not able to penetrate deep into the person; these burns can be similar to sunburn.|$|E

50|$|Attorney General Reno had {{specifically}} directed that no pyrotechnic devices {{be used in}} the assault. Between 1993 and 1999, FBI spokesmen denied (even under oath) the use of {{any sort}} of pyrotechnic devices during the assault; however, pyrotechnic Flite-Rite CS gas grenades had been found in the rubble immediately following the fire. In 1999, FBI spokesmen were forced to admit that they had used the grenades; however, they claimed that these devices—which dispense CS gas through an <b>internal</b> <b>burning</b> process—had been used during an early morning attempt to penetrate a covered, water-filled construction pit 40 yards (35 m) away, and were not fired into the building itself. According to FBI claims, the fires started approximately three hours after the grenades had been fired. When the FBI's documents were turned over to Congress for an investigation in 1994, the page listing the use of the pyrotechnic devices was missing. The failure for six years to disclose the use of pyrotechnics despite her specific directive led Reno to demand an investigation. A senior FBI official told Newsweek that as many as 100 FBI agents had known about the use of pyrotechnics, but no one spoke up until 1999. On May 12, {{less than a month after}} the incident, Texas state authorities bulldozed the site, rendering further gathering of forensic evidence impossible.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that shock-free <b>internal</b> <b>burning</b> is possible in a supersonic airstream, calculations are made for the performance of ramjets using supersonic combustion velocities. Diffusion of the air from the flight speed to a lower supersonic velocity is generally found to be desirable before the air enters the combustor. With a constant-area combustor, both maximum thrust and over-all engine efficiency are achieved when sufficient heat is added to choke the flow at the combustor exit. In the flight Mach number range considered, from 4 to 7, the over-all efficiency of both the supersonic-combustion and the conventional ramjet engines increases with flight speed. When compared with a con-ventional engine having a two-cone inlet, the supersonic-combustion engine with a Pitot inlet is less efficient at all speeds, with a wedge inlet is more efficient above Mach 7, and with an isentropic inlet is more ef-ficient above Mach 5. At Mach 7, the maximum over-all efficiency is 45 and 54 percent for the wedge and isentropic inlets, respectively. When simplified weight estimates are used, no weight advantage is found for the supersonic-combustion engine, as compared with the con-ventional ramjet...|$|E
40|$|Oxidation of {{carbonaceous}} {{materials in}} flames {{is a key}} phenomenon in determining the final emission of these compounds in the atmosphere {{both in terms of}} concentrations and particle sizes. Oxidation is generally considered as a surface process able to subtract carbon atoms from the particles reducing their size. However, fragmentation of particles can also occur if the oxidizing species is able to penetrate the particles and remove C atoms from weak points causing the break-up of the particles. This process can be referred to as oxidation - induced fragmentation and can be seen as particular events of oxidation. It produces a huge number of very small size particles increasing their subsequent burn-out. Recent experimental data obtained in flames have shown the importance of oxidation-induced fragmentation and have individuate O 2 as the main responsible for particle fragmentation because of its relatively slow oxidation rate and the capability to penetrate the particles. Fragmentation can involve large aggregates containing a large number of individual particles leading to smaller aggregates, but also primary particles where <b>internal</b> <b>burning</b> fragments single particle into smaller clusters. In order to have more insights on the process of oxidation - induced fragmentation of soot, the oxidation of various carbonaceous materials has been carried out in a quartz tubular flow micro reactor electrically heated to controlled temperatures ranging from 800 to 1300 K. Continuous analysis of CO and CO 2 concentrations allowed the evaluation of carbon conversion at varying temperatures and material characteristics. Measurements of specific surface area of the fresh carbon materials and of the samples after partial carbon conversion have also been carried out. Results showed a huge increase of the specific surface area as the carbon conversion proceeds. The increase was more evident in the low temperature range where the specific surface area was increased up to 800 %. Analysis of the data have shown that fragmentation of the particles occurs particularly at lower temperatures where molecular oxygen is able to penetrate the pores to internally oxidize the particle causing their break-up. A fragmentation kinetic constant has been retrieved from the experimental data and compared with literature data...|$|E
40|$|The recent wave {{of student}} protests in Europe, which gained {{momentum}} in 2008, {{has had some}} impact on appearance {{of a number of}} Polish student movements, such as one movement in Gdańsk, called OKUPÉ – Open Committee for Liberation of the Educational Space. Using international student networks as background for our analysis, we focus on OKUPÉ, which we were participants of. The movement had an active beginning and managed to gather a considerable number of people demanding changes at the university, including relations of power, surveillance policy, equality issues, participation in decision-making processes and spatial planing at the new campus. However, the promising beginning has not yet led to a continuous mobilisation and the movement had to face <b>internal</b> conflicts, <b>burning</b> out of the members, fragmentation of interest and problems with decision-making and communication.

In this paper we are going to describe {{the rise and fall of}} OKUPÉ, giving special emphasis to the possible reasons for the latter. We are arguing that in the specific context of academia, where conflicts may be perceived as beneficial for its members, balance – that is, avoiding opponents and meeting friends – is often not sought, which suggests that balance theory may not have an explanatory power in this particular case...|$|R

40|$|Unsteady <b>burning,</b> <b>internal</b> heating, and {{modeling}} comparison of an n-octane fuel droplet in high-temperature flows are studied numerically. In the devel-oped numerical method, the governing equations {{of the gas}} and the liquid phases are fully solved and linked at the interface. In addition, a moving grid system and the particle deceleration are also considered {{to account for the}} droplet regression and impact of drag force. The obtained results show that the convective droplet is ignited with a wake flame after a heating-up period. With increasing time the relative velocity between the droplet and sur-rounding flow becomes smaller due to the drag. As a result, the flame changes from a wake type, through a transition type, and eventually to an envelope type. With regard to the droplet interior, internal heat transfer is always dominated by internal circulation and unsteady heating prevails over the entire droplet lifetime.

40|$|Self-induced <b>internal</b> boiling in <b>burning</b> {{functional}} droplets {{has been}} observed to induce severe bulk shape oscillations in droplets with characteristic bubble ejection events that corrugate the droplet surface. Such bubble-droplet interactions are characterized by a distinct regime of a single bubble growing inside the droplet where evaporative Darrieus-Landau instability occurs at the bubble-droplet interface. In this regime the bubble-droplet system behaves as a self-excited coupled oscillator. In this study, we report the external flame-acoustic interaction with bubbles inside the droplet resulting in controlled droplet deformation. In particular, by exciting the droplet flame in a critical, responsive frequency range (80 Hz <= f(p) <= 120 Hz) the droplet deformation cycle could be altered through suppression of these self-excited instabilities and intensity/frequency of bubble ejection events. This selective acoustic tuning also enabled the control of bubble dynamics, bulk droplet-shape distortion and the final precipitate morphology even in burning nanoparticle laden droplets.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to establish credible disruption mitigation scenarios based on the technique of massive gas injection. Disruption mitigation seeks to minimize or eliminate damage to internal components that can occur due to the rapid dissipation of thermal and magnetic energy during a tokamak disruption.

With recent technological advancements in electric vehicle industry, governments {{throughout the world}} are promoting wider adoption of electric vehicles to mitigate environmental issues. However, increasing popularity of electric vehicles will pose a great threat to existing electric grids due to added load of electric vehicles in power systems distribution network. This study provides solution to stabilize electric grid health {{in the form of}} two objectives. First, to develop a fast charging station to reduce consumer anxiety problems related to slow charging stations.

The second objective {{of this study is to}} develop smart charging strategy for the benefit of electric utilities and EV owners. The approach adopted in this study to develop smart charging schedule is based on optimization technique to minimize cost of charging for both, electric utilities and EV owners. This will essentially level utility load throughout the day by providing power to charge EV batteries during off-peak hours, and, on the other hand, utilities will take power from EV batteries for peak power shaving during peak power demand hours of the day.

40|$|Rocketry {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of topics, each of which takes many years of study to master. This chapter provides an initial foundation toward the study of rocket theory by addressing the physical laws governing motion/propulsion, rocket performance parameters, rocket propulsion techniques, reaction masses (propellants), chemical rockets and advanced propulsion techniques. PROPULSION BACKGROUND Rockets are like other forms of propulsion in that they expend energy to produce a thrust force via an exchange of momentum with some reaction mass in accordance with Newton’s Third Law of Motion. But rockets differ from all other forms of propulsion since they carry the reaction mass with them (self contained) and are, therefore, independent of their surrounding environment. Other forms of propulsion depend on their environment to provide the reaction mass. Cars use the ground, airplanes use the air, boats use the water and sailboats use the wind. The rockets we are most familiar with are chemical rockets in which the propellants (reaction mass) are the fuel and oxidizer. With chemical rockets, the propellants are also the energy source. A conventional chemical rocket is a type of <b>internal</b> combustion engine <b>burning</b> fuel and oxidizer in a combustion chamber producing hot, high pressure gases and accelerating them through a nozzle. In electric and nuclear rockets, the propellant is essentially an inert mass. According to Newton’s Second Law, the thrust force is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the ejecte...|$|R
40|$|Supernovae (SNe) {{powered by}} {{interaction}} with circumstellar material {{provide evidence for}} intense stellar mass loss during the final {{years leading up to}} core collapse. One of the most promising energy sources for powering this mass loss is the prodigious core fusion luminosities during late stages of stellar evolution. We have argued that during and after core neon <b>burning,</b> <b>internal</b> gravity waves excited by core convection can tap into the core fusion power and transport a super-Eddington energy flux out to the stellar envelope, potentially unbinding up to ∼ M of material. In this work, we explore the internal conditions of SN progenitors using the 1 -D stellar evolution code MESA star, in search of those most susceptible to wave-driven mass loss. We focus on simple, order of magnitude considerations applicable {{to a wide range of}} progenitors. Wave-driven mass loss during core neon and oxygen fusion happens preferentially in either lower mass (. 20 M ZAMS) stars or massive, sub-solar metallicity stars. Roughly 20 per cent of the SN progenitors we survey can excite ∼ 1046 − 48 erg of energy in waves that can potentially drive mass loss within a few months to a decade of core collapse. This energy can generate a circumstellar environment with 10 − 3 − 1 M reaching ∼ 100 AU before explosion. We predict a correlation between the energy associated with pre-SN mass ejection and the time to core collapse, with the most intense mass loss preferentially happening closer to core collapse.

40|$|There is a {{fundamental}} shift occurring {{in the design of}} passenger vehicles for North American markets. While for decades automotive manufacturers have relied on <b>internal</b> combustion engines <b>burning</b> fossil fuels, the early 21 st century has seen a departure from conventional thinking about powertrain design towards two new design paradigms: hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Hybrid electric vehicles incorporate a high power electric motor and an electrical storage system which are used for motive power in addition to their conventional internal combustion engine (ICE). Fuel cell vehicles use a stack of individual cells to produce electric power which is then used in an electric motor to move the vehicle. They are generally fueled by a stream of high purity hydrogen, and produce only water as an emission. Both vehicle types use electric motors as an integral component in their configuration. The objective for this thesis is to propose a control strategy for the traction motors of a hybrid or electric vehicle. In particular, it addresses {{the question of how to}} split torque between two onboard electric motors while considering the efficiency, stability, and traction of the vehicle. This work is based upon two hybrid vehicles: a Chevrolet Equinox converted to a Fuel Cell HEV, and a Chrysler Pacifica converted to an internal combustion engine HEV. A torque control strategy is recommended that focuses on improved efficiency while addressing vehicle stability, and traction control. The strategy also incorporates powertrain component protection. Simulations indicate that the manner in which torque is split between the motors can have a large impact on the total efficiency of the powertrain; greater than 7 % improvement fuel economy is projected by using an intelligent torque control system over a iii FTP- 75 drive cycle. It is recommended that this work be extended to incorporate regenerative braking and a more thorough analysis of vehicle stability and drivability...|$|R
