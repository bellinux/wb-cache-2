It was found that a temperature jump could cause the deactivation of the Pd-Fe/-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The catalyst deactivated at dierent temperatures has dierent characteristics. After deactivation the crystal structure of -Al 2 O 3 did not change, but the Pd particle size was enlarged. Most of the Pd 0 were oxidized to Pd 2 +, and Fe 2 + was oxidized to Fe 3 + {{on the surface of}} the deactivated catalyst. The catalyst could be regenerated, but its original activity could not be recovered completely.

40|$|Consuming {{two major}} {{greenhouse}} gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4), to produce synthesis gas, {{which is a}} mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2), CO 2 reforming of CH 4 shows significant environmental and economic benefits. However, the process has not found wide industrial application due to severe catalyst deactivation, basically caused by carbon formation. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop stable catalysts without severe deactivation. This work is primarily focused on the development of novel nickel-based catalysts to achieve stable operation for CO 2 reforming of CH 4. Following Dowden’s strategy of catalyst design, a series of nickel-based catalysts are designed with a general formula: Ni-Me/AlMgOx (Me = Co, Cu, Fe, or Mn). The designed catalysts are prepared using co-precipitation method and tested for CO 2 reforming of CH 4. Catalyst screening showed that the Ni-Co/AlMgOx catalyst has superior performance in terms of activity and stability to other Ni-Me/AlMgOx (Me = Cu, Fe, or Mn) catalysts. A 2000 h long-term <b>deactivation</b> <b>test</b> has shown that the Ni-Co/AlMgOx has high activity and excellent stability for CO 2 reforming of CH 4. Further investigation on the Ni-Co/AlMgOx catalysts shows that adjusting Ni/Co ratio and Ni-Co loading can significantly affect the catalyst performance. Carbon free operation for CO 2 reforming of CH 4 can be achieved on the catalysts with a Ni/Co close to 1 and Ni-Co overall loading between 4 - 10 %. In addition, calcination temperature shows important impacts on the performance of Ni-Co/AlMgOx catalysts. A calcination temperature range of 700 - 900 oC is recommended. The Ni-Co/AlMgOx catalysts are characterized using various techniques such as ICP-MS, BET, CO-chemiosorption, XRD, TPR, TG/DTA, TEM, and XPS. It has been found that the high activity and excellent stability of Ni-Co/AlMgOx catalysts can be ascribed to its high surface area, high metal disperation, small particle size, strong metal-support interaction, and synergy between Ni and Co. Kinetic {{studies have shown that the}} CH 4 decomposition and CO 2 activation could be the rate-determining steps.

Special {{attention was paid to}} the improvement of the resistance of the catalyst against sulphur poisoning by the H 2 S present in the gasification gas. <b>Deactivation</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on catalytic filter discs using either benzene, naphthalene or a mixture of benzene and naphthalene as tar model compounds in a simulated gasification gas containing up to 200 ppm H 2 S. At 900 degreesC and at a filtration velocity of 2. 5 cm/s, the developed catalyst formulation shows a benzene conversion of 93 % (50 ppm H 2 S), 78 % (100 ppm H 2 S) and 57 % (200 ppm H 2 S). However, benzene is not a problematic compound concerning the utilization of biomass gasification. More important is the removal capacity of this catalytic filter disc for the problematic heavy tars like naphthalene. Subsequent <b>deactivation</b> <b>tests</b> with naphthalene and with a mixture of benzene and naphthalene as tar model compounds showed that for simulated gasification gas containing up to 100 ppm H 2 S and for a filtration velocity of 2. 5 cm/s (typical value in real gas) the naphthalene conversion is 98 % in both cases. As a result, the target tar conversion (> 95 %) was achieved in typical hot gas filtration conditions. The significant improvement over a pure nickel based catalyst by adding the appropriate amount of CaO is encouraging towards the further improvement of the sulphur tolerance of this catalyst.

The removal of H 2 from the reaction zone is expected to enhance the reaction conversion over the equilibrium limitations based on feed conditions, producing simultaneously highly pure hydrogen. A lab set-up was built to perform the experimental work. The unit was designed to measure the activity of low-temperature WGS catalysts, to determine the reaction kinetics, to characterize the separation ability towards hydrogen of the Pd-Ag membrane and to study the application of the MR for the WGS reaction. The catalytic activity for the low-temperature WGS reaction of three commercial samples (Au/TiO 2, CuO/Al 2 O 3 and CuO/ZnO/Al 2 O 3) was evaluated and compared with a lab-prepared catalyst (Au/CeO 2, synthesized at ITQ – Valencia, Spain).

40|$|Significant {{work has}} been done by the {{investigators}} on the cerium oxide-copper oxide based sorbent/catalysts for the combined removal of sulfur and nitrogen oxides from the flue gases of stationary sources. A relatively wide temperature window was established for the use of alumina-supported cerium oxide-copper oxide mixtures as regenerable sorbents for SO{sub 2 } removal. Evaluation of these sorbents as catalysts for the selective reduction of NO{sub x} gave promising results with methane. Since the replacement of ammonia by methane is commercially very attractive, in this project, it was planned to investigate the effect of promoters on the activity and selectivity of copper oxide/cerium oxide-based catalysts and to obtain data on the reaction mechanism for the SCR with methane. The investigation of the reaction mechanism will help in the selection of promoters to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity of the sorbents in the SCR with methane. This will result in new catalyst formulations. The last component of the project involves our industrial partner TDA Research, and the objective is to evaluate long- term stability and durability of the prepared sorbent/catalysts. In the second year of the project, the catalysts were investigated for their SCR activity with methane in a microreactor setup and also, by the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique. The results from the SCR experiments indicated that manganese is a more effective promoter than rhodium on the supported copper oxide-ceria catalysts under study; the effectiveness of the promoter increases with the increase in Ce/Cu ratio. The TPD profiles of the unpromoted catalyst (Cu/Ce= 3) is different than those promoted with 0. 1 % rhodium.

40|$|Catalytic {{combustion}} is {{an important}} area of catalysis and is used in energy production {{as well as in}} the abatement of harmful emissions of various types. This thesis is focused on three different areas of catalytic combustion: - Catalytic combustion of diesel soot - Development of catalytically active wire meshes through thermal spraying - Stabilisation and activation of g-alumina for methane combustion The first part of the thesis gives an introductory description of different aspects of catalytic combustion. This part also includes a review of different catalytic burners which have been studied during the course of the research work. Emissions of diesel soot may be trapped and combusted in a particulate trap coated with catalytically active materials. The soot particles must be combusted at temperatures prevailing in diesel exhausts, generally between 150 and 400 °C. To facilitate effective combustion at these temperatures, the particulate trap should be coated with an oxide catalyst consisting of V 2 O 5 /CuO (V:Cu= 0. 9 on molar basis). Catalytically active wire meshes offer a number of advantages over pellets and monolith catalysts. They combine geometric flexibility with excellent mass- and heat- transfer characteristics and a low pressure drop. By using a modified thermal spray technique, it is possible to produce porous adhesive ceramic coatings on metal surfaces. The specific surface area can be increased through deposition of a high-surface-area material into the macro-porosity of the as-sprayed layer. The ceramic layer is finally activated through a conventional impregnation technique. Palladium dispersed onto a Si-stabilised g-alumina is an appropriate combustion catalyst at temperatures below 1000 °C. Adding small amounts of rhodium or platinum to the palladium increases the catalyst activity but decreases the catalyst's stability to thermal deactivation. The addition of rare-earth-metal oxides will lead to increased thermal stability but to a decreased activity. Long-term <b>deactivation</b> <b>tests</b> show that the activity for combustion of methane decreases to the same extent as the value of the specific surface area, thus indicating that the alumina surface may play an important role during the activation of adsorbed methane molecules...|$|R

However, as the reaction continues, the polymers formed eventually block the active sites of the enzyme. The inclusion of titanium dioxide in the support was designed so that under UV irradiation the increased hydrophilicity and photocatalytic activity of its surface would cause repulsion of the hydrophobic polymeric enzyme products from the active site, and cleave the adsorbed product from the immobilized enzyme, thus assisting in partial restoration of the enzyme activity.

In this study Fe and Cu containing zeolites are investigated as catalysts {{for the production}} of C 2 oxygenated products from ethane using H 2 O 2 as an oxidant. We utilise a trickle bed reactor to effectively control the contact time between reactants and catalyst to minimise C–C scission and over oxidation to COx. Reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure and reactant concentration in combination with Fe and Cu content of the catalysts are investigated to optimise conversion and selectivity to C 2 oxygenated products. A marked effect is observed upon increasing pressure between 1 and 30 bar, as the oxygenate selectivity increases from 46 % to 98 %.

40|$|Abstract: The Kv 14 {{families}} of K+ channels contain a tandem proline motif (PXP) in the S 6 helix that {{is crucial for}} channel gating. In human Kv 1. 5, replacing the first proline by an alanine resulted in a nonfunctional channel. This mutant was rescued by introducing another proline at a nearby position, changing the sequence into AVPP. This resulted in a channel that activated quickly (ms range) upon the first depolarization. However, thereafter, the channel became trapped in another gating mode that was characterized by slow activation kinetics (s range) with a shallow voltage dependence. The switch in gating mode was observed even with very short depolarization steps, but recovery to the initial "fast" mode was extremely slow. Computational modeling suggested that switching occurred during channel <b>deactivation.</b> To <b>test</b> {{the effect of the}} altered PXP sequence on the mobility of the S 6 helix, we used molecular dynamics simulations of the isolated S 6 domain of wild type (WT) and mutants starting from either a closed or open conformation.

However, the S 6 with a AVPP sequence displayed flexibility only when started from the closed conformation and was rigid when started from the open state. These results indicate that the region around the PXP motif may serve as a "hinge" and that changing the sequence to AVPP results in channels that deactivate to a state with an alternate configuration that renders them "reluctant" to open subsequently...|$|R

40|$|MasterA Ni-YSZ cermet {{catalyst}} with {{or without}} K 2 Ti 2 O 5 additives was studied under various types of methane reforming conditionsteam reforming, CO 2 reforming, mixed reforming. The appearance of deactivation of Ni-YSZ is quite different. The amount of deposited carbon is much larger after steam reforming than CO 2 reforming, but Ni-YSZ catalyst deactivated continuously during CO 2 reforming. The addition of K 2 Ti 2 O 5 additives definitely lower carbon deposition on both types of reforming, but can not improve stability on CO 2 reforming, and even reduce Ni-YSZ activity. Mixed reforming on Ni-YSZ and with 10 wt% K 2 Ti 2 O 5 was also performed. The addition of steam decreased deactivation rate of Ni-YSZ, {{but it can not}} prevent <b>deactivation</b> totally. 	Switching <b>test</b> of steam and CO 2 reforming over Ni-YSZ tell us its reaction mechanism is different. The deactivation and regeneration of the catalyst independently occurs on steam and CO 2 reforming condition respectively. In view of the results so far achieved, steam reforming might follow mono-site mechanism, while CO 2 reforming might follow dual-site mechanism. The carbon deposition, mainly considered as reasons for catalyst deactivation on reforming reaction, seems not a critical factor on CO 2 reforming of methane over Ni-YSZ. 	From the result of switching test, poisoning occurs in two ways, one is on Ni active site which could be regenerated on steam reforming, the other occurs on Ni and ZrO 2 perimeter, possibly responsible for catalyst deactivation on CO 2 reforming. It revealed CO 2 treatment can regenerate catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ while steam wasn’t effective at all for removal of poisoning reason. The process of both deactivation of Ni-YSZ on CO 2 reforming reaction and its regeneration by CO 2 treatment are not clear. Poisoning on Ni and ZrO 2 perimeter might be possible cause so far, but it was not clearly examined in the present study...|$|R
40|$|Bio-oil {{reforming}} {{is considered}} for syngas or H 2 production. In this work, we studied the steam reforming (SR) of two raw bio-oils without adding external steam, using a recently-developed catalyst, Ni-UGSO. Experiments were performed at temperature (T) = 750 – 850 °C and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 1. 7 – 7. 1 g/gcat/h to assess C conversion (XC) and product yields. The results show that, in all conditions and with both bio-oils tested, the catalyst is stable {{for the entire}} duration of the tests (~ 500 min) even when some C deposition occurred and that only at the highest WHSV tested there is a slight <b>deactivation.</b> In all <b>tests,</b> catalytic activity remained constant after a first, short, transient state, which corresponded to catalyst activation. The highest yields and conversions, with YH 2,YCO and XC of 94 %, 84 % and 100 %, respectively, were observed at temperatures above 800 °C and WHSV = 1. 7 g/gcat/h. The amount of H 2 O in the bio-oils had a non-negligible effect on catalyst activity, impacting YH 2,YCO and XC values. It was observed that, above a critical amount of H 2 O, the catalyst was not fully activated. However, higher H 2 O content led to the reduction of C deposits as well as lower YH 2 and YCO and, through the water-gas-shift reaction, to higher YCO 2 (CO 2 selectivity). Fresh and spent catalysts were analyzed by physisorption (BET), X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis: the results reveal that, during the oils’ SR reaction, the initial spinel (Ni-Fe-Mg-Al) structures decreased over time-on-stream (TOS), while metallic Ni, Fe and their alloy phases appeared. Although significant sintering was observed in used catalysts, especially at high H 2 O/C ratio, the catalyst’s specific surface generally increased; the latter was attributed {{to the presence of}} nanometric metallic Ni and Ni-Fe alloy particles formed by reduction reactions. A small amount of C (4 %) was formed at low H 2 O/C...|$|R
40|$|This is the Final Report for DOE Cooperative Agreement No: DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 40753. The goal of {{the project}} was to develop {{cost-effective}} analysis tools and techniques for demonstrating and evaluating low-NOx control strategies and their possible impact on boiler performance for boilers firing US coals. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) provided co-funding for this program. This project included research on: (1) In furnace NOx control; (2) Impacts of combustion modifications on boiler operation; (3) Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst testing and (4) Ammonia adsorption/removal on fly ash. Important accomplishments were achieved in all aspects of the project. Rich Reagent Injection (RRI), an in-furnace NOx reduction strategy based on injecting urea or anhydrous ammonia into fuel rich regions in the lower furnace, was evaluated for cyclone-barrel and PC fired utility boilers. Field tests successfully demonstrated the ability of the RRI process to significantly reduce NOx emissions from a staged cyclone-fired furnace operating with overfire air. The field tests also verified the accuracy of the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling used to develop the RRI design and highlighted the importance of using CFD modeling to properly locate and configure the reagent injectors within the furnace. Low NOx firing conditions can adversely impact boiler operation due to increased waterwall wastage (corrosion) and increased soot production. A corrosion monitoring system that uses electrochemical noise (ECN) corrosion probes to monitor, on a real-time basis, high temperature corrosion events within the boiler was evaluated. Field tests were successfully conducted at two plants. The Ohio Coal Development Office provided financial assistance to perform the field tests. To investigate soot behavior, an advanced model to predict soot production and destruction was implemented into an existing reacting CFD modeling tool. Comparisons between experimental data collected in a pilot scale furnace and soot behavior predicted by the CFD model showed good agreement. Field and laboratory tests were performed for SCR catalysts used for coal and biomass co-firing applications. Fundamental laboratory studies were performed to better understand mechanisms involved with catalyst <b>deactivation.</b> Field <b>tests</b> with a slip stream reactor were used to create catalyst exposed to boiler flue gas for firing coal and for co-firing coal and biomass. The field data suggests the mechanisms leading to catalyst deactivation are, in order of importance, channel plugging, surface fouling, pore plugging and poisoning. Investigations were performed to better understand the mechanisms involved with catalyst regeneration through mechanical or chemical methods. A computer model was developed to predict NOx reduction across the catalyst in a SCR. Experiments were performed to investigate the fundamentals of ammonia/fly ash interactions with relevance to the operation of advanced NOx control technologies such as selective catalytic reduction. Measurements were performed for ammonia adsorption isotherms on commercial fly ash samples subjected to a variety of treatments and on the chemistry of dry and semi-dry ammonia removal processes. This work resulted in the first fundamental ammonia isotherms on carbon-containing fly ash samples. This work confirms industrial reports that aqueous solution chemistry takes place upon the introduction of even very small amounts of water, while the ash remains in a semi-dry state...|$|R
40|$|K+ {{channels}} encoded by {{the human}} ether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG) are distinguished from most other voltage-gated K+ channels by an unusually slow deactivation process that enables cardiac IKr, the corresponding current in ventricular cells, {{to contribute to the}} repolarization of the action potential. When the first 16 amino acids are deleted from the amino terminus of HERG, the deactivation rate is much faster (Wang, J., M. C. Trudeau, A. M. Zappia, and G. A. Robertson. 1998. J. Gen. Physiol. 112 : 637 – 647). In this study, we determined whether the first 16 amino acids comprise a functional domain capable of slowing <b>deactivation.</b> We also <b>tested</b> whether this “deactivation subdomain” slows deactivation directly by affecting channel open times or indirectly by a blocking mechanism. Using inside-out macropatches excised from Xenopus oocytes, we found that a peptide corresponding to the first 16 amino acids of HERG is sufficient to reconstitute slow deactivation to channels lacking the amino terminus. The peptide acts as a soluble domain in a rapid and readily reversible manner, reflecting a more dynamic regulation of deactivation than the slow modification observed in a previous study with a larger amino-terminal peptide fragment (Morais Cabral, J. H., A. Lee, S. L. Cohen, B. T. Chait, M. Li, and R. Mackinnon. 1998. Cell. 95 : 649 – 655). The slowing of deactivation by the peptide occurs in a dose-dependent manner, with a Hill coefficient that implies the cooperative action of at least three peptides per channel. Unlike internal TEA, which slows deactivation indirectly by blocking the channels, the peptide does not reduce current amplitude. Nor does the amino terminus interfere with the blocking effect of TEA, indicating that the amino terminus binding site is spatially distinct from the TEA binding site. Analysis of the single channel activity in cell-attached patches shows that the amino terminus significantly increases channel mean open time with no alteration of the mean closed time or the addition of nonconducting states expected from a pore block mechanism. We propose that the four amino-terminal deactivation subdomains of the tetrameric channel interact with binding sites uncovered by channel opening to specifically stabilize the open state and thus slow channel closing...|$|R

Pain impairs working memory, but so do depression and sleep problems, which are also common in CP. Depression {{has been linked to}} changes in brain activity in CP during working memory tasks, but the effect of sleep problems on working memory performance and brain activity remains to be investigated. Methods: Fifteen CP patients and 17 age-, sex-, and education-matched controls underwent blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T while performing block design 0 -back, 2 -back, and paced visual serial addition test paradigms. Subjects also reported their level of pain (Brief Pain Inventory), depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), and sleep problems (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and were tested outside the scanner with neuropsychological tests of working memory. Results: The CP group reported significantly higher levels of pain, depression, and sleep problems. No significant performance difference was found on the neuropsychological tests in or outside the scanner between the two groups. There were no correlations between level of pain, depression, and sleep problems or between these and the neuropsychological test scores. CP patients exhibited significantly less brain activation and deactivation than controls in parietal and frontal lobes, which are the brain areas that normally show activation and deactivation during working memory tasks. Sleep problems independently and significantly modulated the BOLD response to the complex working memory tasks and were associated with decreased brain activation in task-positive regions and decreased deactivation in the default mode network in the CP group compared to the control group. The pain and depression scores covaried with working memory activation. Discussion: Sleep problems in CP patients {{had a significant impact on}} the BOLD response during working memory tasks, independent of pain level and depression, even when performance was shown not to be significantly affected.

40|$|Für die Nutzung von Wasser als nicht fossile Ressource zur Erzeugung solarer Brennstoffe sind aktive, stabile und aus häufig vorkommenden Elementen bestehende Wasseroxidationskatalysatoren (WOCs) vonnöten. In dieser Arbeit wurden über eine neue Syntheseroute CoO, NiO sowie hochgradig mit Cobalt (41 %) und Nickel (9 %) substituierte zinkoxidische Nanopartikel hergestellt (Co:ZnO, Ni:ZnO). Dies gelang durch die Verwendung von homo- bzw. heterobimetallischen Komplexverbindungen des Di- 2 -pyridylmethandiolat (dpdH; [M 4 -xZnx (dpdH) 4 (OAc) 3 (H 2 O) ]ClO 4; M = Co, Ni; x = 0 - 4) als metallorganische Einkomponentenvorstufen (SSP) mit prädefinierten M-µO-M/Zn Bindungen. Durch Solvolyse in Benzylamin konnten die Nanopartikel trotz der rigiden, tris-koordinierten dpdH Liganden im SSP bei niedrigen Temperaturen erhalten werden. In den Reaktionsmischungen konnten homoleptische Komplexverbindungen des Di- 2 -pyridylmethanamin (dpNH 2, [Zn(dpNH 2) 2](ClO 4) 2, [Ni(dpNH 2) 2](ClO 4) 2, [Co(dpNH 2) 2](ClO 4) 3), die heteroleptischen Komplexe [Zn(OAc) 2 (NH 2 Bn) 2, [Ni(OAc) 2 (NH 2 Bn) 4] und [Ni 4 (dpdH) 4 (OAc) 2 (NH 2 Bn) 2](ClO 4) 2 und N-Benzylidenbenzylamin nachgewiesen werden. Auf Basis dieser Beobachtungen konnten mechanistische Überlegungen zu den Initialschritten der Nanokristallitbildung aus den SSPs angestellt werden. Die heterobimetallischen Nanopartikel wurden in chemischen, elektrochemischen und photochemischen OER Experimenten gegenüber homometallischen Referenzmaterialien (CoO, NiO, Co 3 O 4) als WOCs getestet. Durch die Berechnung von Kennzahlen (Rate der Sauerstoffentwicklung, Aktivität normiert auf Masse, Aktivität normiert auf spezifische Oberfläche, Überpotential, TOF) zeigte sich eine den homometallischen Referenzmaterialien gegenüber erhöhte katalytische Aktivität. Die Präkatalysatoren durchliefen dabei einen Selbstaktivierungsprozess, in welchem sich Nanokomposite aus Kern-Schale Strukturen bildeten. Diese bestanden aus Kernen der kristallinen Partikel des Präkatalysators und einer amorphen, oxyhydroxidischen Schale. Diese in-situ erzeugten Strukturen zeigten im Gegensatz zu den homometallischen Referenzen keine Desaktivierung in den Tests zur katalytischen Aktivität, obwohl die homometallischen Referenzen analoge Nanokomposite bildeten. Die beobachtete Stabilität und Aktivität wurde mit den ladungstrennenden und PCET vermittelnden Eigenschaften der hexagonalen Wurtzitphasen des Präkatalysatormaterials im Komposit, sowie der begünstigten Bildung und Stabilisierung von katalytisch aktiveren Modifikationen der oxyhydroxidischen Phasen diskutiert. To use {{water as}} a non-fossil {{resource}} for the generation of solar fuels, water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) that are active, stable and composed out of earth abundant elements are needed. In this work, CoO, NiO as well as highly cobalt (41 %) and nickel (9 %) substituted zinc oxide nanoparticles were fabricated (Co:ZnO, Ni:ZnO). This was achieved by employing homo- and heterobimetallic tetranuclear complexes of di- 2 -pyridylmethanediolate (dpdH; [M 4 -xZnx(dpdH) 4 (OAc) 3 (H 2 O) ]ClO 4; M = Co, Ni; x = 0 - 4) as metal organic precursors with pre-defined M-µO-M/Zn bonds. Solvolysis of these metal organic compounds in benzylamine afforded the targeted homo- and heterobimetallic nanoparticles. The materials were formed at low temperatures albeit the rigid, triscoordinated dpdH Ligand. Homoleptic complexes of di- 2 -pyridylmethaneamine (dpNH 2, [Zn(dpNH 2) 2](ClO 4) 2, [Ni(dpNH 2) 2]ClO 4) 2, [Co(dpNH 2) 2](ClO 4) 3) were isolated from these reaction mixtures, {{as well as the}} heteroleptic complexes [Zn(OAc) 2 (NH 2 Bn) 2], [Ni(OAc) 2 (NH 2 Bn) 4] and [Ni 4 (dpdH) 4 (OAc) 2 (NH 2 Bn) 2](ClO 4) 2 and N-benzylidenebenzylamine. Based on these findings, mechanistic aspects for the initial steps of nanocrystallite formation from the SSPs were discussed. The heterobimetallic nanoparticles were tested as WOCs in chemically, electrochemically and photochemically driven OER experiments and compared to homometallic references (CoO, NiO, Co 3 O 4). By calculating operating figures (rate of oxygen evolution, activity normalized to mass, activity normalized to surface area, overpotential, TOF), a higher catalytic activity as compared to the reference materials was found. The precatalysts were self-activated during the experiments, forming nanocomposites composed of core-shell structures. The cores were the remnants of the crystalline precatalyst particles, while the shell was composed of an amorphous oxyhydroxous layer. These in-situ formed composites showed no <b>deactivation</b> during <b>testing</b> their catalytic activity. Although the homometallic reference materials formed similar nanocomposites, the catalysts deactivated quickly. This enhanced stability was linked to the charge-separating and PCET-mediating properties of the hexagonal precatalyst wurtzite-phase in the composite and to the favored formation and stabilization of catalytically more active modifications of the oxyhydroxidic phases.
