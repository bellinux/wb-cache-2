5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant {{version of the same}} meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs as well as how longer they think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> prepare it. The chefs are then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.|$|E

In some fields, however, the big O notation (number 2 in the lists above) would be used more commonly than the Big Theta notation (bullets number 3 in the lists above). For example, if T(n) represents the running time of a newly developed algorithm for input size n, the inventors and users of the algorithm might {{be more inclined to}} put an upper asymptotic bound on how long <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> run without making an explicit statement about the lower asymptotic bound.|$|E

The 2009-2011 terminal renovation did not include a customs facility, nor did US Customs & Border Protection open an office at the airport until 2014. However, construction is now underway for a passenger customs facility that will be linked to Gate A9 via a walkway. This facility is scheduled to open in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Software {{development}} is a complex process, and developers are often uncertain how long <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up {{a significant portion of}} its development time, and developers are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.|$|E

I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no reading and let her know nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see how long <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> make her insane. Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.|$|E
25|$|These ants are {{not hard}} to control, and most ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled {{as soon as the}} problem is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control in just a few days. However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with polyurethane foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it encourages nest building. People should {{be on the lookout for}} these ants in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), as this is when they most commonly appear.|$|E

500|$|For most {{applications}} of hashing, {{it is necessary}} to compute the hash function for each value every time that it is hashed, rather than once when its object is created. In such applications, random or pseudorandom numbers cannot be used as hash values, because then different objects with the same value would have different hashes. And cryptographic hash functions (which are designed to be computationally indistinguishable from truly random functions) are usually too slow to be used in hash tables. Instead, other methods for constructing hash functions have been devised. These methods compute the hash function quickly, and can be proven to work well with linear probing. In particular, linear probing has been analyzed from the framework of -independent hashing, a class of hash functions that are initialized from a small random seed and that are equally likely to map any -tuple of distinct keys to any -tuple of indexes. The parameter [...] {{can be thought of as}} a measure of hash function quality: the larger [...] is, the more time <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> compute the hash function but it will behave more similarly to completely random functions.|$|E

It is unknown, however, how long <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> divert and correct the river's current path back into the lake. Dell Creek is still flowing down to the Wisconsin River, and the lake would be refilled from the creek, once the breach in the highway and collaterally damaged areas are repaired.|$|E

2500|$|SQL Server {{includes}} a cost-based query optimizer which tries to optimize on the cost, {{in terms of}} the resources <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> execute the query. Given a query, then the query optimizer looks at the database schema, the database statistics and the system load at that time. It then decides which sequence to access the tables referred in the query, which sequence to execute the operations and what access method to be used to access the tables. For example, if the table has an associated index, whether the index should be used or not: if the index is on a column which is not unique for most of the columns (low [...] "selectivity"), it might not be worthwhile to use the index to access the data. Finally, it decides whether to execute the query concurrently or not. While a concurrent execution is more costly in terms of total processor time, because the execution is actually split to different processors might mean it will execute faster. Once a query plan is generated for a query, it is temporarily cached. For further invocations of the same query, the cached plan is used. Unused plans are discarded after some time.|$|E
