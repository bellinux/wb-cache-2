Also found in the study, long term exposure to pennyroyal increased incidences of urinary bladder tumors.|$|E
5000|$|Ethionine is an {{analogue}} of {{the essential}} amino acid methionine. It has an ethyl group where methionine has a methyl group. Unlike methionine, ethionine {{is known to be}} a <b>hepatotoxin.</b> The molecule also induces several other pathologies. Ethionine is an antimetabolite and methionine antagonist. It prevents amino acid incorporation into proteins and interferes with cellular use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Because of these pharmacological effects, ethionine is highly toxic and is a potent carcinogen. Some of these toxic effects may be reversed by the administration of methionine. [...] However, when continuously administered, ethionine is lethal.|$|E

50|$|Garvey Grain {{elevator}} is a 22-acre {{grain storage}} facility located {{just south of}} Hastings, Nebraska. Garvey constructed, owned and operated a more than 8-million bushel grain storage facility on its property from 1959 until 1998. In 1998, Ag Processing Inc. (AGP) took over operations. From 1959 to 1985, a grain fumigant consisting primarily of carbon tetrachloride, a volatile organic compound (VOC) which is a significant <b>hepatotoxin</b> (substance toxic to the liver), was used which contaminated the soil and groundwater.It was proposed as a Superfund site on April 27, 2005, and it was listed September 14, 2005.|$|E
50|$|Some {{adverse health}} effects {{may be due to}} the acidity of the tea, which can cause acidosis, and brewers have been cautioned to avoid over-fermentation. Other {{adverse health effects}} may be a result of {{bacterial}} or fungal contamination during the brewing process. Some studies have found the <b>hepatotoxin</b> usnic acid in kombucha, although it is not known whether the cases of damage to the liver are due to the usnic acid contamination or to some other toxin. Topical use of the tea has been associated with anthrax infection on the skin in one report, but kombucha contamination may have occurred during storage.|$|E

50|$|It is {{postulated}} {{that the disease}} {{may be due to}} ingestion of cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) toxins, in particular cylindrospermopsin, a toxin from Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and other cyanobacteria, which is a <b>hepatotoxin.</b> The symptoms of the disease are consistent with a hepatitis or liver disorder, and Cylindrospermopsis is known to be widespread in inland Australian water sources. The toxin is not destroyed by boiling and, although it would flavor water, this flavor would be masked by tea, the common beverage in the Australian bush. Provision of safe drinking water sources in Australia, with the development of bores and covered tanks to collect rainwater, explain the demise of a once-common illness.|$|E
50|$|The massive blooms of A. flos-aquae in Upper Klamath Lake {{affect the}} {{dynamics}} of the system significantly. In many years the blooms crash during the summer. The subsequent decomposition of the massive amounts of organic matter can deplete the water column of dissolved oxygen producing severely impaired conditions for fish species, including redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and two endangered species of suckers, the Lost River sucker (Deltistes luxatus) and shortnose sucker (Chasmistes brevirostris). This decomposition also releases previously unavailable nitrogen into the water, often fueling rapid growth of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, which is known to produce the <b>hepatotoxin</b> microcystin. It is widely believed that these dynamics are a central factor in the lack of recruitment of the two endangered sucker species, thereby contributing to their continued decline.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Data about hepatic {{effects of}} {{ethylene}} glycol ethers had been limited and inconsistent. In this study, we determined whether {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EGEEA) was a <b>hepatotoxin</b> in exposed workers. Workers from one silk-screening shop (n= 29), using EGEEA {{as the major}} cleaning solvent, were recruited as high exposure group. Another group of workers with indirect and low exposure to EGEEA (n= 57) were selected as the comparison group. Air concentration of EGEEA was measured by 8 -h personal sampling. The mean of air EGEEA concentration in the high exposure group was 7. 41 – 16. 5 ppm. The mean of air EGEEA concentration in the low exposure group was 0. 07 – 3. 62 ppm. Liver function profiles showed that the AST, ALT, ALP and γGT in both male and female EGEEA-exposed workers were not significantly different from those in the comparison group. After adjustment for potential confounders such as gender, body mass index, hepatitis B status, and duration of employment, no difference in hepatic dysfunction were found between exposed and comparison groups. In addition, a two-year follow-up study of these EGEEA-exposed workers, no significant change in hepatic function was noted either. The findings suggest that EGEEA is not a <b>hepatotoxin</b> in this workplace.

50|$|Cyanotoxins usually {{target the}} nervous system (neurotoxins), the liver (<b>hepatotoxins)</b> or the skin (dermatoxins). The {{chemical}} structure of cyanotoxins falls into three broad groups: cyclic peptides, alkaloids and lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins).|$|R

40|$|Previously we have {{developed}} a transgenic zebrafish line (LiPan) with liver-specific red fluorescent protein (DsRed) expression under the fabp 10 a promoter. Since red fluorescence in the liver greatly facilitates the observation of liver in live LiPan fry, we envision that the LiPan zebrafish may provide a useful tool in analyses of hepatotoxicity based on changes of liver red fluorescence intensity and size. In this study, we first tested four well-established <b>hepatotoxins</b> (acetaminophen, aspirin, isoniazid and phenylbutazone) in LiPan fry and demonstrated that these <b>hepatotoxins</b> could significantly reduce both liver red fluorescence and liver size in a dosage-dependent manner, thus the two measurable parameters {{could be used as}} indicators of hepatotoxicity. We then tested the LiPan fry with nine other chemicals including environmental toxicants and human drugs. Three (mefenamic acid, lindane, and arsenate) behave like <b>hepatotoxins</b> in reduction of liver red fluorescence, while three others (17 β-estradiol, TCDD [2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin] and NDMA [N-nitrosodimethylamine]) caused increase of liver red fluorescence and the liver size. Ethanol and two other chemicals, amoxicillin (antibiotics) and chlorphenamine (pain killer) did not resulted in significant changes of liver red fluorescence and liver size. By quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we found that the changes of red fluorescence intensity caused by different chemicals correlated to the changes of endogenous fabp 10 a RNA expression, indicating that the measured hepatotoxicity was related to fatty acid transportation and metabolism. Finally we tested a mixture of four <b>hepatotoxins</b> and observed a significant reduction of red fluorescence in the liver at concentrations below the lowest effective concentrations of individual <b>hepatotoxins,</b> suggesting that the transgenic zebrafish assay is capable of reporting compound hepatotoxicity effect from chemical mixtures. Thus, the LiPan transgenic fry provide a rapid and convenient in vivo hepatotoxicity assay that should be applicable to high-throughput hepatotoxicity test in drug screening as well as in biomonitoring environmental toxicants...|$|R
40|$|Blooms of {{cyanobacteria}} are {{an increasingly}} frequent phenomenon in freshwater ecosystems worldwide {{as a result}} of eutrophication. Many species can produce hepatotoxins that cause severe health hazards to humans. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the bloom forming cyanobacteria species by molecular methods and to amplify genes responsible for <b>hepatotoxin</b> biosynthesis from the environmental samples and isolated strains of cyanobacteria from Küçükçekmece Lagoon, Sapanca, İznik, Manyas and Taşkısı Lakes. A total of 10 bloom samples and 11 isolated strains were examined and Microcystis spp., Planktothrix spp., Nodularia spumigena, Anabaenopsis elenkinii, Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were identified. <b>Hepatotoxin</b> genes were detected in 60 % of the bloom samples and 45 % of the strains. Two Microcystis strains were obtained from Küçükçekmece Lagoon. While the strain assigned to Microcystis flosaquae was non-toxic, Microcystis aeruginosa strain produced microcystin. According to PCR results, the M. aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii bloom samples of Küçükçekmece Lagoon contained the microcystin synthetase gene E (mcyE) indicative of microcystin production, however, no microcystin was detected by HPLC. The mcyE gene was also found in Microcystis wesenbergii isolated from Taşkısı Lake, and in all Planktothrix rubescens bloom samples from Sapanca Lake. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study for identifiying different toxic cyanobacteria species and their <b>hepatotoxin</b> production from several waterbodies in Turkey using molecular methods...|$|E

In this study, hepatocytes from DRH. F 344 -Drh 1, a congenic strain in which the Drh 1 chromosomal region was replaced with that of F 344 rats, were compared to hepatocytes from Donryu (original strain), DRH, and F 344 rats. Although DRH hepatocytes exhibited low proliferation and p 38 dephosphorylation after lead nitrate (LN) treatment despite cytokine and Cox 2 activation, DRH. F 344 -Drh 1 hepatocytes exhibited high responses, as did Donryu and F 344 hepatocytes. Moreover, although DRH hepatocytes were resistant to <b>hepatotoxins,</b> DRH.

40|$|The {{presence}} of cyanotoxins in surface and drinking {{water is a}} serious threat to the environment and human health. The most dangerous and widespread cyanotoxins include the microcystin and nodularin families (<b>hepatotoxin),</b> domoic acid (neurotoxin), and cylindrospermopsin (CYN) (<b>hepatotoxin).</b> The primary goal of these studies is to investigate several innovative technologies for the removal and remediation of selected cyanotoxins. The first involves application of cyclodextrins (CDs) as a host to encapsulate cyanotoxins, microcystin, nodularin and domoic acid. Proton NMR was employed for real-time monitoring of the complexation and encapsulation by different sized CDs and specific toxins. The second application involved TiO 2 photocatalysis of CYN, a cyanotoxin which was not complexed by CD, TiO 2 photocatalysis leads to the rapid degradation of CYN. The third part of the research project employed functionalized C 60 adducts as renewable photoactive materials for the remediation of cyanotoxins.

40|$|Herbal {{hepatotoxicity}} by the anxiolytic kava (Piper methysticum Forst. f.) emerged unexpectedly and {{was observed}} in a few patients worldwide. Liver injury occurred after the use of traditional aqueous kava extracts in the South Pacific region and of acetonic and ethanolic extracts in Western countries in rare cases, suggesting that the solvents used play no major causative role. In this review, we discuss actual pathogenetic issues of kava hepatotoxicity with special focus on developments regarding pipermethystine, flavokavain B, and mould <b>hepatotoxins</b> as possible culprits. There is abundant data of in vitro cytotoxicity including apoptosis by pipermethystine and flavokavain B added to the incubation media, yet evidence is lacking of in vivo hepatotoxicity in experimental animals under conditions similar to human kava use. Furthermore, in commercial Western kava extracts, pipermethystine was not detectable and flavokavain B was present as a natural compound in amounts much too low to cause experimental liver injury. There is concern, however, that due to high temperature and humidity in the South Pacific area, kava raw material might have been contaminated by mould <b>hepatotoxins</b> such as aflatoxins after harvest and during storage. Whether kava hepatotoxicity {{may be due to}} aflatoxicosis or other mould <b>hepatotoxins,</b> requires further studies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
