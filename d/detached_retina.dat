5|$|A {{strike by}} NFL players and an eye injury limited Delaney's playing {{time in the}} 1982 NFL season. He {{underwent}} surgery to repair a <b>detached</b> <b>retina,</b> and only registered 380 rushing yards in the eight-game shortened season, which the Chiefs finished with a 3–6 record. Delaney averaged 4.6 yards per carry, 9.1 yards per reception, and registered 1,811 all-purpose yards during his career with three touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Early in July, Gilmore {{was rushed}} to the {{emergency}} room after suffering from vision problems. He was immediately hospitalized and compelled to undergo surgery after he was diagnosed with a <b>detached</b> <b>retina.</b> Gilmore's campaign was stalled as the candidate was ordered by doctors to restrict travel for an indefinite period. The doctors revealed that Gilmore's vision problems could have deteriorated to the loss of eyesight.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was {{operated}} on by Michael E.

5|$|Success exposed TISM to {{mainstream}} Australian radio and television, {{most of which}} was perplexed by the band's guerrilla approach to interviews and {{lack of interest in}} the music industry. A four CD box set of early albums was released and steady record sales allowed extensive tours of Australia and New Zealand. In 1996 TISM toured on the Big Day Out, during which Ron Hitler-Barassi was either absent or wheelchair-bound due to a <b>detached</b> <b>retina</b> and broken arm caused by a stage dive he performed at the Pacific Hotel, Lorne, Victoria prior to the tour. Later the same year, TISM toured England, the group's sole Northern Hemisphere excursion.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} storyline {{involving}} Ric Flair, Michaels faced Flair in a Career Threatening {{match at}} WrestleMania XXIV, in which he won by performing Sweet Chin Music and thus ending Flair's career. Afterwards, Batista confronted Michaels about his actions at WrestleMania, calling him selfish and egotistical. The two faced off at Backlash with Chris Jericho as the guest referee. Michaels won after faking a knee injury and performing Sweet Chin Music. Jericho then confronted Michaels on this matter, in which Michaels admitted to faking the injury in order to defeat Batista. Michaels then defeated Jericho at Judgment Day. At One Night Stand, Michaels lost to Batista in a stretcher match, thus ending their feud. On the June 9 episode of Raw, Michaels was attacked by Chris Jericho during his talk show segment, The Highlight Reel, being thrown directly through a television screen. The following week, it was revealed that, {{within the context of}} the storyline, Michaels had suffered a <b>detached</b> <b>retina.</b> At The Great American Bash, a match between Michaels and Jericho was scheduled, in which Jericho assaulted Michaels' eye, which caused Jericho to win by referee stoppage.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between axial length and equatorial diameter and eye volume {{has been studied}} in 4 groups of eyes: intact emmetropic eyes, emmetropic eyes with retinal detachment, eyes with moderate myopia and retinal detachment, and eyes with high myopia and retinal detachment. It was found that eyes with <b>detached</b> <b>retinas,</b> {{regardless of whether they}} are myopic or emmetropic, are of significantly different dimensions from emmetropic control eyes. There is usually a significant increase in equatorial diameter and therefore in equatorial circumference. The results indicate that eyes with <b>detached</b> <b>retinas</b> differ from normal eyes in their abnormally large size...|$|R

25|$|The most {{prominent}} symptoms of Norrie disease are ocular. The first visible finding is leukocoria, a grayish-yellow pupillary reflex that originates from {{a mass of}} unorganized tissue behind the lens. This material, which possibly includes an already <b>detached</b> <b>retina,</b> may be confused with a tumor and thus is termed pseudoglioma. However, an affected baby may have a normally sized eye globe and inconspicuous iris, anterior chamber, cornea and intraocular pressure.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{factors that}} limit acuity {{are located in}} the retina or the brain (or the pathway leading there). Examples for the first are a <b>detached</b> <b>retina</b> and macular degeneration, to name just two. Another common impairment, amblyopia, is caused by the visual brain not having {{developed}} properly in early childhood. In some cases, low visual acuity is caused by brain damage, such as from traumatic brain injury or stroke. When optical factors are corrected for, acuity can be considered a measure of neural well-functioning.|$|E
25|$|When Genie's father reached {{adulthood}} {{he changed}} his first name to one which was more typically masculine, and his mother began {{to spend as much}} time with him as she could. He became almost singularly fixated on his mother, despite their relentless arguments about her attempts to convince him to adopt a less rigid lifestyle, and treated all other relationships as secondary at best. Soon after Genie's parents married, he prevented his wife from leaving home and beat her with increasing frequency and severity. Her eyesight steadily deteriorated due to lingering effects from the existing neurological damage, the onset of severe cataracts, and a <b>detached</b> <b>retina</b> in one eye, leaving her increasingly dependent on her husband.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the mechanism of}} photoreceptor cell death after traumatic retinal detachment in humans. Design: Clinical records from 1975 to 1993 of 75 patients, whose eyes were enucleated after traumatic retinal detachment, were reviewed for age, sex, previous ocular or systemic medical history, interval from initial trauma to enucleation, visual acuity, and types of trauma. The patients were divided into five groups of 15 cases each, based on the interval from initial trauma to enucleation. The retinal tissue was examined for two markers of apoptosis: (1) nicked nuclear DNA in situ by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique and (2) apoptotic bodies by light and electron microscopy. Result: Of the 75 cases of ruptured globe and traumatic retinal detachment that were evaluated, 19 eyes (25. 3 %) showed TUNEL-positive labeling of photoreceptor cells. Nicked nuclear DNA was detected in photoreceptor cells of <b>detached</b> <b>retinas</b> as early as 8 hours after trauma. The <b>detached</b> <b>retinas</b> in seven of 15 eyes enucleated within 2 days after ocular trauma showed TUNEL-positive photoreceptor nuclei. The number of cases showing TUNEL-positive photoreceptor nuclei decreased as the interval between initial trauma and enucleation increased. The TUNEL-positive photoreceptor cells could still {{be seen in the}} <b>detached</b> <b>retinas</b> of two eyes enucleated 22 days after trauma. Light microscopy disclosed condensation and fragmentation of photoreceptor nuclei in the <b>detached</b> <b>retinas.</b> Electron microscopy showed structures resembling apoptotic bodies phagocytosed by neighboring cells in the TUNEL-positive retinas. Conclusions: Apoptosis is an important mechanism of photoreceptor cell degeneration in the early stage after traumatic retinal detachment in humans. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{presence}} of lipocalin-like prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS), a dominantly brain derived protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{with a low}} concentration in serum, in the subretinal fluid (SRF) of <b>detached</b> <b>retinas,</b> has not been reported. L-PGDS has been demonstrated in the ciliary body and the retinal pigment epithelium in rats. METHODS: SRF was sampled during surgery (scleral buckling) of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments in 20 eyes. Biochemical and nephelometric analysis for L-PGDS concentration were performed. Albumin concentrations were determined in the same samples. RESULTS: L-PGDS concentrations in SRF (mean 18. 9 mg/L +/- 14. 8 mg/L) were markedly higher than the normal L-PGDS concentration in serum (> 0. 55 mg/L) and appears to decrease with {{the duration of the}} retinal detachment (P = 0. 0064). CONCLUSIONS: As the subretinal space is not accessible in attached retinas there are no data on normal levels of L-PGDS in the subretinal space. The L-PGDS concentrations measured in the SRF of <b>detached</b> <b>retinas</b> are on average 34 times higher than normal L-PGDS serum concentration and about in the range of normal L-PGDS CSF concentration (15. 3 mg/L). As the concentrations of L-PGDS exceed normal serum levels, a choriocapillary transudation is highly improbable as the source of L-PGDS in SRF of <b>detached</b> <b>retinas...</b>|$|R

25|$|Koivu {{suffered}} further knee {{problems in}} 2003–04 {{and was forced}} to miss 13 games. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he returned to Finland to play for TPS, whose head coach at the time was his father, Jukka Koivu. He was joined in Turku by Canadiens teammate Craig Rivet. When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Koivu returned to the Canadiens to tally 62 points in 72 games. On April 26, 2006, however, during a home playoff game against the Carolina Hurricanes, Koivu sustained a serious injury to his left eye; Hurricanes forward Justin Williams attempted to lift Koivu's stick but instead struck him in the eye. Koivu was rushed to the hospital, where he would remain overnight and {{for the remainder of the}} playoffs. He remained out of the lineup for the rest of the series and underwent surgery to repair a <b>detached</b> <b>retina</b> during the off-season.|$|E
25|$|Taylor's strong keeping {{continued}} to secure {{his place in}} the side, though despite a career best 719 runs in the 1966 season his batting struggled, with no half-centuries to add to his tally. In 1967 his career was again put on hiatus through injury, when he edged a delivery into his own eye and suffered a <b>detached</b> <b>retina</b> which put him on his back for three weeks. He nevertheless took another 63 catches from 23 appearances, but managed only 442 runs at 18.41. His batting in the County Championship saw marginal improvement over the next two seasons, with a half century in 1968 and a career best 65 in 1969. The 1969 season also saw Taylor make his first major forays into List-A cricket. He made 19 appearances that year, having made only seven others over the previous six. He only scored 180 runs, however he took 28 catches behind the stumps which would be a season best {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E

40|$|The intravitreal {{injection}} of autologous cultured fibroblasts {{has been used}} by many groups to study proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Ninety-five New Zealand white rabbits were used to study the pathological effects on the ocular tissues following such an injection over various time periods up to six months. The ocular tissues were studied by light microscopy, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and autoradiography. The cells which contributed to the inflammatory response (initially neutrophils, then later macrophages and lymphocytes) were found to gain entry into the vitreous via the pars plana, pars plicata, and the vessels associated with the optic nerve head. In the experimental eyes the <b>detached</b> <b>retinae</b> had a reduced ability to incorporate 3 H proline. Both epiretinal and subretinal membranes were found on the retinal surfaces. The majority of the glial cells within the membranes were identified as Müller cells. The retinal pigment epithelium beneath the <b>detached</b> <b>retinae</b> incorporated 3 H thymidine and detached into the subretinal space. Clear evidence was obtained of both epithelial cell migration through the retina and involvement within epiretinal membranes...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether stimulation of purinergic P 2 Y 1 receptors modulates the activation of microglial and Müller glial {{cells in the}} rabbit retina in vivo, adenosine 5 -O-(2 -thiodiphosphate) (ADPβS; 2  mM in 100  μl saline), a non-hydrolyzable ADP analogue, was intravitreadly applied into control eyes or onto retinas that were experimentally detached from the pigment epithelium. Both retinal detachment and application of ADPßS onto control retinas induced phenotype alterations of the microglial cells (decrease of soma size, retraction of cell processes) and had no influence on microglial cell density. ADPßS application onto <b>detached</b> <b>retinas</b> accelerated the process retraction and resulted in a strongly decreased density of microglial cells. The effects of ADPßS on microglia density and phenotype in <b>detached</b> <b>retinas</b> were partially reversed by co-application of the selective inhibitor of P 2 Y 1 receptors, MRS- 2317 (3  mM in 100  μl saline). ADPßS apparently did not influence Müller cell gliosis, as determined by electrophysiological and calcium imaging records. It is concluded that rabbit retinal microglial cells express functional P 2 Y 1 receptors in vivo, and that activation of these receptors stimulates phenotype alterations that are characteristical for microglia activation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) as a surgical adjunct in prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) after retinal detachment surgery. Methods: In this controlled, randomized pilot study, 27 patients with primary retinal detachment undergoing pars plana deep vitrectomy were included. Of these, 12 received IVB {{at the end of}} procedure. The anatomic success and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were compared to the control group at months 3 and 6 postoperatively. Results: At three month follow-up, 3 of 11 eyes (27. 3 %) had <b>detached</b> <b>retinas</b> in the IVB group versus 6 of 12 (50. 0 %) in the control group (P = 0. 40). At six-month follow-up, 3 of 10 eyes (30 %) had <b>detached</b> <b>retinas</b> in the IVB group versus 3 in 8 (37. 5 %) in the control group (P > 0. 99). Mean logMAR BCVA improved significantly in both groups relative to baseline, but did not show a significant difference at three-and six-month follow-ups between the two groups. Conclusion: Our preliminary results show neither a benefit nor any harm from intervention in both anatomic and visual outcomes. Our results support conducting additional studies to {{evaluate the}} effect of intravitreal bevacizumab on postoperative PVR...|$|R
