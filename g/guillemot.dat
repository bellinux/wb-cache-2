5|$|During World War I the South Arklow Lightvessel <b>Guillemot,</b> {{operated}} by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, had given warning of a U-boat. In consequence on 28 March 1917 UC-65 surfaced, ordered the crew into their lifeboat, and sank the <b>Guillemot.</b> Against this background the sinking of Irish Oak became a hotly debated issue.|$|E
5|$|Both the <b>guillemot</b> tick Ixodes uriae and {{the flea}} Ornithopsylla laetitiae (probably {{originally}} a rabbit flea) {{have been recorded}} from the nests of puffins. Other fleas which have been found on the birds include Ceratophyllus borealis, Ceratophyllus gallinae, Ceratophyllus garei, Ceratophyllus vagabunda and the common rabbit flea Spilopsyllus cuniculi.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{made his}} {{international}} debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. He {{took his first}} medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph <b>Guillemot</b> in the 5000 m. This would remain {{the only time that}} Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics. He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past <b>Guillemot</b> on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute, the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku. Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.|$|E

50|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. It supports breeding populations of black-legged kittiwakes (40,000 pairs), thick-billed <b>guillemots</b> (150,000 individuals) and black <b>guillemots</b> (1000 pairs).|$|R
50|$|There are 300-400 m cliffs {{along the}} west coast, which are home to many <b>guillemots.</b> Egg {{harvesting}} takes place in early June, though this occurs {{in the first week}} only so as to allow the <b>guillemots</b> to lay again. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially northern fulmars (50,000 pairs), Manx shearwaters (10,000 pairs), European storm petrels (20,000 pairs), great skuas (25 pairs), Atlantic puffins (40,000 pairs), common <b>guillemots</b> (135,000 pairs) and black <b>guillemots</b> (150 pairs), as well as 40 breeding pairs of whimbrels.|$|R
5|$|Otters, grey seals, {{killer whales}} and harbour {{porpoises}} are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour. Atlantic puffin, Arctic and common tern, bonxie and Arctic skua, northern fulmar, common <b>guillemot,</b> razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and {{great black-backed gull}} all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Over 200 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in the area including black <b>guillemot,</b> eider, peregrine falcon and the golden eagle. In 1981 there were 28 ptarmigan on Arran, but in 2009 {{it was reported that}} extensive surveys had been unable to record any. Similarly, the red-billed chough no longer breeds on the island.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are what}} Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the {{markedly}} pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the <b>guillemot.</b> He {{shows that the}} shape of the egg favours its movement along the oviduct, a gentle pressure on the trailing end sufficing to push it forwards. Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E
25|$|Bear {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. It supports breeding populations of northern fulmars (50,00060,000 pairs), purple sandpipers, red phalaropes (10 pairs), glaucous gulls (2000 pairs), black-legged kittiwakes (100,000 pairs), little auks (10,000100,000 pairs), common <b>guillemots</b> (50,000 pairs), thick-billed <b>guillemots</b> (190,000 individuals) and black <b>guillemots</b> (1000 pairs). It also supports migratory populations of pink-footed geese (30,000 individuals), barnacle geese and long-tailed ducks.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, {{as many as}} 197 pigeon <b>guillemots</b> (or 1.9% of the {{estimated}} national population) were recorded among the islands. By the following year, just 54 pigeon <b>guillemots</b> were recorded. glaucous-winged gulls and black oystercatchers have also been recorded at the site.|$|R
50|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uria <b>guillemots,</b> nest {{in large}} colonies on cliff edges; others, like the Cepphus <b>guillemots,</b> breed in small groups on rocky coasts; and the puffins, auklets and some murrelets nest in burrows. All species except the Brachyramphus murrelets are colonial.|$|R
5|$|The Wii's success caught {{third-party}} developers by surprise, {{leading to}} apologies {{for the quality}} of their early games. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Ubisoft's Yves <b>Guillemot</b> and Alain Corre admitted that they made a mistake in rushing out their launch titles, promising to take future projects more seriously. Take-Two Interactive, which released few games for the Nintendo GameCube, changed its stance towards Nintendo by placing a higher priority on the Wii.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of bird {{life on the}} island has both relied on and helped to advance the spread of plant life. Birds use the plants for nesting material, but also continue {{to assist in the}} spreading of seeds, and fertilize the soil with their guano. Birds first began nesting on Surtsey three years after the eruptions ended, with fulmar and <b>guillemot</b> the first species to set up home. Twelve species are now regularly found on the island.|$|E
5|$|As an {{isolated}} island on major migration routes, Lundy has a rich bird life {{and is a}} popular site for birdwatching. Large numbers of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) nest on the cliffs, as do razorbill (Alca torda), <b>guillemot</b> (Uria aalge), herring gull (Larus argentatus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), common blackbird (Turdus merula), robin (Erithacus rubecula) and linnet (Carduelis cannabina). There are also smaller populations of peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and raven (Corvus corax).|$|E

5|$|All dinosaurs lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting common <b>guillemot</b> lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as Troodon, exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{eggs are}} usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; albatross nests {{are no more than}} a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation. Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common <b>guillemot</b> lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial.|$|E
5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common <b>guillemot</b> chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E

5|$|Buoyed by {{his defeat}} to <b>Guillemot,</b> Nurmi's races became {{a series of}} {{experiments}} which he analyzed meticulously. Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics {{to a point where}} the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921. In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m. A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile. His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since. Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record. After excelling in mathematics, Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include <b>guillemot,</b> razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectacular}} sea cliffs around Noup Head {{are home}} to thousands of seabirds including 60,000 common <b>guillemot</b> and black-legged kittiwake, 30,000 razorbill and numerous Atlantic puffin and black <b>guillemot.</b> During the 1990s the black rat (Rattus rattus) may have been present although {{they have not been}} recorded since. mice, and the Orkney vole are present however, as are European otters.|$|E
50|$|The island’s {{northern}} and eastern coast {{has been identified}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (500 pairs), black-legged kittiwakes (5300 pairs), Atlantic puffins (25,000 pairs), common <b>guillemots</b> (6700 individuals) and black <b>guillemots</b> (200 pairs).|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of the distribution of prey and hydrographic fronts on the spatial distribution of foraging Brunnich's <b>guillemots</b> (Uria lomvia) in Storfjorden, southeastern Svalbard in late July 1992. Two large breeding colonies, comprising a total of 540, 000 individuals, were located adjacent to the study area, and large numbers of Brunnich's gullemots from these colonies foraged within the area, {{as well as to the}} south, outside of Storfjorden. Within the study area, most <b>guillemots</b> foraged on the west side of the fjord, coincident with a weak subsurface front between warm Atlantic water, which penetrated Storfjorden from the south, and cold Arctic water. Food samples from the <b>guillemots</b> collected in the study area contained primarily crustaceans (Parathemisto spp. and Thysanoessa inermis) and polar cod Boreogadus saida. Acoustic observations of prey were differentiated into two classes of signals, which we interpreted as originating from aggregated and dispersed organisms. The numbers of foraging <b>guillemots</b> were strongly correlated with the strength of echoes of the aggregated type, whereas correlations with dispersed echoes were consistently weaker. The distribution of foraging <b>guillemots</b> showed no significant correlations with either horizontal or vertical gradients of physical properties of the water column. Our finding that <b>guillemots</b> respond differently to aggregated and dispersed prey has important implications both for the interpretation of past work on the foraging ecology of marine birds, and for the management of fisheries...|$|R
