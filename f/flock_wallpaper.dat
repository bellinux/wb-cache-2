It was followed in 1990 by Chutney Mary in Chelsea. In 2001, two Indian restaurants in London, Tamarind (opened 1995) and Zaika (opened 1999) gained Michelin stars {{for the quality of}} their cooking.|$|E

The house's fame stems from George Washington's five night stay in the house, where he planned the Siege of Yorktown that led to American Independence with French general Comte de Rochambeau.

2500|$|The Tender Trap {{arrived in}} a vibrant period for eclectic {{contemporary}} clubs in Sydney, including Spicy Friday, Jamie and Vanessa's, The Sunset Club, Madd Club, Club Kooky, Get Down, and the bohemian Rat Parties. But from the beginning, The Tender Trap was aiming to recapture the vibe of swinging sixties Sydney in the perfect venue, [...] "a celebration of cocktail culture at its most sophisticated and savage". The Tender Trap referenced legendary Sydney clubs of an earlier era such as Chequers, The Latin Quarter, the Silver Spade Room, and Tabou. The essential mix was live cabaret entertainment, together with DJs playing their cherished vinyl LP collections featuring lounge music, jazz, Latin, funk, soul, and the incredibly strange. The original fixtures of the room were embraced and enhanced, including red cloth-covered tables, candles, chandeliers, velvet <b>flock</b> <b>wallpaper,</b> and the central focus – the cabaret stage. The effect was remarkably like stepping back in time. Every Sunday the running order was fixed – from 7pm cocktails, laid back music, and sophisticated discussion; then the live act at 10.30 pm; and then the wild dancing commenced.|$|E

5000|$|Réveillon apprenticed as a tradesman, {{haberdasher}} and stationer. In 1753 {{he began}} to import and hang <b>flock</b> <b>wallpapers</b> from England. At that time, wallpaper was becoming popular among the bourgeoisie as a creative and economical way to decorate interior spaces. During the Seven Years' War Reveillon started to produce wallpaper himself, marrying well and using his wife's dowry to produce velvet paper, pasted up into rolls and using vibrant colours, developed by Jean-Baptiste Pillement.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{entrance to}} the Soldiers' Memorial Hall is through the arcade of the projecting bay on Ruthven Street which aligns with the projecting entrance bay of the City Hall. On {{the face of the}} Soldiers' Memorial Hall, under the arched entrance are three openings, a double half glazed door at the southern end and two window openings. On the wall {{to the right of the}} entrance door is a plaque with the inscription:This stone was laid by MAJOR-GENERAL SIR T.W. GLASGOW, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., V.D., K.C.B., Anzac Day, April 25, 1923. In Memory of the Fallen, And in appreciation of the living who took part in the great War, 1914-1918.The entrance door provides access to a Memorial vestibule which is lined on the northern and southern walls with large timber Honour Rolls; that on the southern wall lists participation in the Second World War and that on the northern wall lists participation in the First World War. The Honour Rolls comprise a number of timber panels within frames on which is written in gold lettering the name of each soldier. The panels are framed with a moulded timber surround and surmounted by a broken pediment detail. The floor of the Memorial room is covered with fine grey terrazzo divided into panels with brass strips and featuring centrally located brass lettering [...] "RSL". A large four panelled doorway provides access into the foyer beyond this room. The doors have high mid rails and are glazed above with a combination of arctic and clear glass. Surmounting the doors are transom lights, again with a combination of arctic and clear glass arranged in square and rectangular panels and with a central circular motif, recalling the circular motif of the Ruthven Street gable end. This timber glazed detail is repeated throughout the early part of the building. The walls of the Memorial room are lined with a <b>flocked</b> <b>wallpaper</b> with a design of Gothic inspiration.|$|R

50|$|A tiny, 23-seat venue, sited {{in a back}} {{garden in}} the town of Gorseinon, near Swansea, 'La Charrette' (French for 'the carriage') was built from a disused railway carriage. With <b>flock</b> <b>wallpaper</b> and {{hand-operated}} curtains, 'La Charrette' began showing films in 1953.|$|E
50|$|The Rivoli Ballroom is {{the only}} intact 1950s ballroom {{remaining}} in London, England. It is famed for its original decor and interior fittings (red velvet, <b>flock</b> <b>wallpaper,</b> chandeliers, glitter balls and oversized Chinese lanterns) and is often used as a film location and plays host to many dance and musical events.|$|E
50|$|In 1748 the British Ambassador to Paris {{decorated}} his salon {{with blue}} <b>flock</b> <b>wallpaper,</b> which then became very fashionable there. In the 1760s the French manufacturer Jean-Baptiste Réveillon hired designers working in silk and tapestry to produce {{some of the}} most subtle and luxurious wallpaper ever made. His sky blue wallpaper with fleurs-de-lys was used in 1783 on the first balloons by the Montgolfier brothers. The landscape painter Jean-Baptiste Pillement discovered in 1763 a method to use fast colours.|$|E

5000|$|Barry {{intended}} {{to retain its}} 1605 plaster ceiling but {{replaced it with a}} design reproducing the old pattern in an enriched form. In May 1852 red <b>flock</b> <b>wallpaper</b> designed to simulate 16th-century Italian velvets was supplied from J. G. Crace & Co. It survived until the 1960s and in 1987 new wallpaper was reprinted from the original [...] "Rutland blocks", using distempered colours. Wool and silk brocade curtains by Crace have a pattern based on 15th-century Italian figured silk velvets devised by Pugin in 1844.|$|E

5000|$|A state bedroom, {{prepared}} in 1821 for King George IV (un-used by the King, {{who failed to}} arrive), retains original furnishings, state bed and <b>flock</b> <b>wallpaper.</b> A drawing room furnished in a French Empire style, a Grecian staircase hall, and a ladies' workroom furnished in a Chinese style reflect the importance of worldly knowledge and awareness during the Regency period. Family motifs, engraved into Italian marble chimneypieces and adorning the plaster frieze of the Entrance Hall, reflect the first Earl's pride in his family heritage. The rooms to the mansion's garden front have views of Lough Coole.|$|E
50|$|Around this time, Edmund Resch Jnr {{undertook}} alterations {{to improve}} the living and working conditions of his staff and repair the wall. He commissioned plans by architects Robertson & Marks for new laundries and the gardener's compound. In addition, concrete was placed over the carriage drive and garden paths. The changes made for the servants from the original Tooth-era structures reveal the general employment circumstances of domestic staff in the inter-war era with their diminishing numbers limiting employers’ opportunities for engaging and retaining reliable staff. Edmund Resch Jnr also redecorated the interiors of the main house in the late 1920s, {{with much of the}} heavy <b>flock</b> <b>wallpaper</b> still in situ by the 1990s.|$|E

5000|$|Built in 1909, the town's Lutheran church hasn't {{always been}} a church. The {{beginnings}} of this historic building were as a hospital in the [...] "Cement City" [...] area east of the Baker River. Built by Dr. E.F. Mertz, the doctor and his wife lived in the second-story residence and maintained the hospital facility on the first floor. Dr. Mertz was the only doctor in central through eastern Skagit County for many years {{as well as for}} both the town's cement plants. In 1929 the hospital was remodeled to be a grand mansion complete with hardwood oak flooring, mahogany woodwork, imported mural and <b>flock</b> <b>wallpaper,</b> crystal light fixtures and hot water heat radiators in each room. The mansion was then furnished with antique and custom-built furniture and soon became a show place where the Mertzes entertained both local and distant visitors. When both the doctor and his wife had died by 1945, the home, property, and contents was put up for auction and purchased for only $13,500 - well below the 1929 renovation price of $40,000. The purchaser, Concrete Herald newspaper owner and editor Charles Dwelley, sold the home and property in 1953 to the Evangelical Lutheran Church. The ELC then did extensive remodeling, adding a wing on the east room which would house the sanctuary. The new church was dedicated on Sunday, March 7, 1954 and is still in use by the incorporated Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.|$|E
40|$|We {{have all}} dreamed of finding hidden treasures, another Tutankhamun, or a Terracotta Army. But what if, searching closer to home, we {{unearthed}} the decaying crypt of a man, preserved for eternity {{in his own}} flat? In the murky depths of the gallery, artists Shaun Doyle and Mally Mallinson have created the tomb of a modern recluse – a man they call King Tat. Enter the gallery and a corridor leads you to the antechamber. Gaping holes in the walls afford views into a room, scattered with flimsy household goods. Grimy mattresses loll against peeling <b>flock</b> <b>wallpaper</b> and a small car nestles in a corner, a carriage for the afterlife. Two four-foot high polystyrene dogs guard the burial chamber, which is barred by breeze-blocks The corridor leads on to reveal the burial chamber itself, dominated by a hulking chest-freezer, the sarcophagus. The chamber is adorned with housing estate murals and gaudy street-racing imagery, visions of a ‘live fast’ modern culture, a distorted echo of Egyptian tomb decoration. The corridor leads out into the gallery, where {{the exterior of the}} construction is visible King Tat has been organised by the John Hansard Gallery. Project Room film courtesy of Lux. King Tat has been financially supported by Arts Council England<br/...|$|E
