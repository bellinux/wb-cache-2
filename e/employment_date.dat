O ccupational exposure to extremely low-frequency (50 – 60 Hz) electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) has been investigated as a possible cause of leukaemia and brain and breast cancer in many epidemiological studies.

40|$|International audienceBackground: In France, {{most women}} of childbearing age work. The {{prenatal}} leave law in France protects women during pregnancy and their employment. We aimed to describe how long before delivery women stopped working and analyse the association between occupational, social and medical factors and early prenatal leave (before 24 weeks' gestation). Methods: The sample was extracted from the 2010 French National Perinatal Survey. Women were interviewed in French maternity units during a 1 -week period. We focused on all women with a singleton live birth who were working during pregnancy (n = 10 149). Women were interviewed between delivery and discharge to collect information on <b>employment,</b> <b>date</b> of leave, sociodemographic and medical characteristics. Results: Among women who worked during pregnancy, 27. 5 % reported early occupational leave (before 24 weeks' gestation). Early occupational leave was more frequent among women with unstable jobs (fixed-term vs. non–fixed-term contract: adjusted odds ratio aOR = 1. 60 [95 % confidence interval 1. 40 – 1. 84]) and with less-qualified occupational categories (manual workers vs. managers and upper-intellectual positions: aOR = 2. 96 [2. 30 – 3. 82]), even after adjusting for sociodemographic and other employment characteristics. Women with a pathological or at risk pregnancy left work earlier than other women. After stratification on type of pregnancy there was still a higher rate of early leave for women with less qualified occupational group. Conclusion: In France, social vulnerability of pregnant women, linked to low sociodemographic situation or low occupational categories, is associated with early leave during pregnancy, even after stratification on type of pregnancy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background As more {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) reach adulthood {{and participate in}} age-appropriate activities (e. g. <b>employment,</b> <b>dating),</b> disclosure of medical status becomes more important. This study assessed rates of disclosure and its perceived impact on relationships using the Adult Data for Understanding Lifestyle and Transitions (ADULT) online survey. Methods Adults with CF participated in the survey via the United States national network of CF Centers. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized. Results Participants (n = 865) {{were more likely to}} disclose to relatives (94 %) and close friends (81 %) than to dating partners (73 %), bosses/supervisors/teachers (51 %) or co-workers (39 %). Respondents generally reported a neutral/positive effect on relationships following disclosure. Negative effects of disclosure were infrequent, but more likely with dating partners or bosses/supervisors/teachers. Results also indicated that disclosure may be influenced by severity of lung disease and gender, with those having normal/mild lung disease less likely to disclose their diagnosis to both co-workers (p Conclusions Most adults with CF disclosed their disease to relatives and close friends. Individuals with severe CF lung disease were more likely to disclose their diagnosis to coworkers and supervisors/teachers.

Migration and remittance are generally perceived as risk-spreading and coinsurance livelihood strategies pursued by households and families. They have the potential to improve well-being, stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty directly and indirectly. Remittances are one of the key benefits that migration brings to originating countries. Migrant workers’ remittances have now become {{an important}} source of foreign capital for developing countries. With the fall of foreign direct investment and capital market flows due to recession in high-income countries, inflow of remittance has single handedly supported the economy of developing countries. Evidence shows that a significant amount of remittance transfers to developing countries are spent on household consumption. Remittance flows worldwide are projected to reach USD 515 billion by the year 2015. The history of Nepali citizens going overseas to seek <b>employment</b> <b>dates</b> back to the early 19 th century when the British army began to recruit Gurkhas into their armed forces.
