At this time, they lived in New Brighton on Staten Island, but his company, George Washington Lighting Company, was based in nearby Jersey City.

By {{the time of the}} 1900 US Census, Washington, recorded in the census as an inventor, was 29 years old and living in a rented house in Brooklyn with his 23-year-old wife, their three young children, his younger sister (age 25), three servants, and a child of two of the servants.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical <b>incandescent</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1880s {{electricity}} {{had been used}} mainly in telegraphy and electroplating. Efficient dynamo's were introduced in the 1870s and began being used to power electric carbon arc lamps after 1879.

25|$|For a given {{quantity}} of light, an <b>incandescent</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> produces more heat (and thus consumes more power) than a fluorescent lamp.

25|$|In the United States, one {{supporter}} of the <b>incandescent</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> is the lighting designer Howard Brandston, {{a fellow of the}} Illuminating Engineering Society of North America and Honorary Fellow of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers.

25|$|To {{the extent}} that a hot surface emits thermal {{radiation}} but is not an ideal black-body radiator, the color temperature of the light is not the actual temperature of the surface. An incandescent lamp's light is thermal radiation, and the bulb approximates an ideal black-body radiator, so its color temperature is essentially {{the temperature of the}} filament. Thus a relatively low temperature emits a dull red and a high temperature emits the almost white of the traditional <b>incandescent</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> Metal workers are able to judge the temperature of hot metals by their color, from dark red to orange-white and then white (see red heat).|$|E

25|$|An <b>{{incandescent}}</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb,</b> {{incandescent lamp}} or incandescent light globe is an electric light {{with a wire}} filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|E
