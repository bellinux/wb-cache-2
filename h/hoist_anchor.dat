6000|$|... "Yes, Roger, I'd {{rather do}} it than sit twirling my thumbs, a-waiting {{for you to}} come back," [...] said he. [...] "I used to do such work years ago, before I shipped on the Anna Siegel, and to do it again will make me feel like a boy once more. But come; let's go to mess and then <b>hoist</b> <b>anchor</b> and away." ...|$|E
60|$|But we are {{not done}} with that engine yet. The engine is powerful. We are two small men and a small woman. It will break our hearts and our backs to <b>hoist</b> <b>anchor</b> by hand. Let the engine do it. And then comes {{the problem of how}} to convey power for'ard from the engine to the winch. And by the time all this is settled, we {{redistribute}} the allotments of space to the engine-room, galley, bath-room, state-rooms, and cabin, and begin all over again. And when we have shifted the engine, I send off a telegram of gibberish to its makers at New York, something like this: Toggle-joint abandoned change thrust-bearing accordingly distance from forward side of flywheel to face of stern post sixteen feet six inches.|$|E
60|$|The {{day after}} I came aboard, wind and tide being fair, and Captain Croker having {{received}} his orders, we <b>hoisted</b> <b>anchor</b> and sailed {{out of the}} harbor, and by four o'clock had dropped the land astern.|$|R
60|$|The Greek galleys {{immediately}} <b>hoisted</b> their <b>anchors</b> and fled; the Persian galleys manned their oars, {{and pressed}} on after them.|$|R

60|$|And {{in the end}} we sailed away, on Tuesday morning, April 23, 1907. We started rather lame, I confess. We had to <b>hoist</b> <b>anchor</b> by hand, {{because the}} power {{transmission}} was a wreck. Also, what remained of our seventy-horse-power engine was lashed down for ballast {{on the bottom of the}} Snark. But what of such things? They could be fixed in Honolulu, and in the meantime think of the magnificent rest of the boat! It is true, the engine in the launch wouldn't run, and the life-boat leaked like a sieve; but then they weren't the Snark; they were mere appurtenances. The things that counted were the water-tight bulkheads, the solid planking without butts, the bath- room devices--they were the Snark. And then there was, greatest of all, that noble, wind-punching bow.|$|E
60|$|We rowed him aboard in {{much better}} style than he had come ashore, and saw for {{ourselves}} the helplessness of the passengers. There were a dozen men and women, {{and all of them}} too sick even to appear grateful at our coming. The yacht was rolling savagely, broad on, and no sooner had the owner's feet touched the deck than he collapsed and joined, the others. Not one was able to bear a hand, so Charley and I between us cleared the badly tangled running gear, got up sail, and <b>hoisted</b> <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the sailor}} said. [...] "The Mary Anne is just <b>hoisting</b> her <b>anchor</b> now, {{out there in}} midstream. You will be but just in time, for the anchor's under her foot." ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not believe}} that his pursuers, if there were any upon his track, could have {{travelled}} in the night, for it had been pitchy black; and, as he now had a good start of them, he thought he might go so far that they would give up the search. Then he hoped {{to be able to keep}} himself alive until he was reasonably sure that the Revenge had <b>hoisted</b> <b>anchor</b> and sailed away, when it was his purpose to make his way back to the spring and wait for some other vessel which would take him away.|$|R
60|$|These {{were found}} to contain an {{enormous}} quantity of goods, the spoil evidently of many ships, and the men were at once set to work to transfer it to the prizes, and when these were full, to the native craft. A boat had been sent off, directly the fighting was over, with news to {{the captain of the}} success they had gained, and in the morning another message was sent saying that it would take four or five days to transfer the stores to the ships, and the Furious had in consequence <b>hoisted</b> <b>anchor</b> and gone for a short cruise away from the dangerous proximity of the sands.|$|R
60|$|An {{order was}} issued for the sailors {{to come on}} deck, and all did so, and the second mate, {{a young man named}} Bob Sanders, also appeared. Then Paul Shepley issued orders to <b>hoist</b> the <b>anchors</b> and raise some of the sails.|$|R
50|$|After <b>hoisting</b> the <b>anchor</b> {{and setting}} the {{windlass}} brake, the claw is placed on a chain link and the turnbuckle is tightened {{to take up the}} tension on the chain. If more than one stopper is used, the turnbuckles can be adjusted to evenly distribute the load.|$|R
6000|$|The Energon, however, {{promptly}} <b>hoisted</b> <b>anchor</b> {{and cleared}} out to sea. A great clamour {{was raised by}} the papers; the government was charged with cowardice and vacillation in its dealings with a mere pleasure yacht and a lunatic who called himself [...] "Goliah," [...] and immediate and decisive action was demanded. Also, a great cry went up {{about the loss of}} life, especially the wanton killing of the ten [...] "statesmen." [...] Goliah promptly replied. In fact, so prompt was his reply that the experts in wireless telegraphy announced that, since it was impossible to send wireless messages so great a distance, Goliah was in their very midst and not on Palgrave Island. Goliah's letter was delivered to the Associated Press by a messenger boy who had been engaged on the street. The letter was as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|For a time {{he earned}} a {{livelihood}} by cutting logwood, {{but it was not}} long before he quarrelled with the captain of the vessel for whom he was working, and finally became so enraged that he tried to kill him. He did not succeed in this dastardly attempt, but as he could not commit murder he decided to do the next worst thing, and so gathering together twelve of the greatest rascals among his companions, they seized a boat, went out to the captain's schooner, which was lying near shore, and took possession of it. Then they <b>hoisted</b> <b>anchor,</b> ran up the sail, and put out to sea, leaving the captain and the men who were with him {{to take care of themselves}} the best that they could and live on logwood leaves if they could find nothing else to eat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purchase}} of a new dredger, two hopper barges, two harbour tugs, two water barges, an <b>anchor</b> <b>hoist</b> vessel, two pilot boats, and a dredger tender ...|$|R
50|$|Capstan A {{vertical}} {{metal or}} wooden winch secured to the foredeck of a ship, used for <b>hoisting</b> the <b>anchor.</b> Capstans may be manually operated or powered hydraulically or electrically. A traditional wooden capstan is fitted with removable wooden arms fitted into sockets {{on which the}} seaman push. Seashanties were often chanted to keep the seamen together as they pushed.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Karlsefin {{and the rest}} of the party came back to the shore and put an end to the conversation. Returning on board they drew up the <b>anchor,</b> <b>hoisted</b> sail, and again put out to sea.|$|R
5000|$|... ====Cosmao and MacDonnell sortie==== [...] Only eleven ships {{escaped to}} CÃ¡diz, and, of those, only five were {{considered}} seaworthy. The seriously wounded Admiral Gravina passed {{command of the}} remainder of the fleet over to Captain Julien Cosmao on 23 October. From shore, the allied commanders could see an opportunity for a rescue mission existed. Cosmao claimed in his report that the rescue plan was entirely his idea, but Vice-Admiral Escano recorded a meeting of Spanish and French Commodores at which a planned rescue was discussed and agreed upon. Enrique MacDonell and Cosmao were of equal rank and both raised commodores pennants before <b>hoisting</b> <b>anchor.</b> Both sets of mariners were determined to make an attempt to recapture some of the prizes. Cosmoa ordered the rigging of his ship, the 74-gun Pluton, to be repaired and reinforced her crew (which had been depleted by casualties from the battle), with sailors from the French frigate Hermione. Taking advantage of a favourable northwesterly wind, Pluton, the 80-gun Neptune and Indomptable, the Spanish 100-gun Rayo and 74-gun San Francisco de Asis, together with five French frigates and two brigs, sailed out of the harbour towards the British.|$|R
60|$|The Abbot smiled, then, {{lifting his}} hand, {{pronounced}} some words in Latin, which, {{as he did}} not understand them, Goody found very comforting. As they passed his lips the Great Yarmouth began to move, for the sailors were <b>hoisting</b> up her <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} they had canted the water out of the swamped boat, Bill and his partner {{appeared}} on the scene. All hands worked rapidly, and, almost before Joe could realize, the mainsail and jib had been <b>hoisted,</b> the <b>anchor</b> broken out, and the Dazzler was leaping down the channel. Off a bleak piece of marshland Bill and the Cockney said good-by and cast loose in their skiff. French Pete, in the cabin, bewailed their bad luck in various languages, and sought consolation in the wine-bottle.|$|R
50|$|The Hesper, and Luther Little {{were both}} built in Somerset, Massachusetts the later {{half of the}} 1910s, each having a {{different}} career. Both ships had non-propulsion small coal-fired boilers that were used for things like the capstan, and <b>hoisting</b> the <b>anchor.</b> Their usage was primarily to ship coal and lumber, but by the mid 1920s new steam powered vessels were making cargo sailing ships obsolete. One by one the ships were taken out of service, and {{found their way to}} Wiscasset where they were placed up for auction.|$|R

60|$|The {{first thing}} that struck me as being {{different}} from anything I had yet seen during my short career on the sea, was the <b>hoisting</b> of the <b>anchor</b> on deck and lashing it firmly down with ropes, {{as if we had}} now bid adieu to the land for ever and would require its services no more.|$|R
5000|$|Relieved {{by another}} old Asiatic Fleet {{companion}} - the oiler [...] on 8 November 1943, Victoria <b>hoisted</b> <b>anchor</b> {{and headed for}} Milne Bay. Even her last day at Porlock Harbor was lively. An Army Air Corps P-38 Lightning from the 475th Fighter Group, 431st squadron went down nearby, and her pilot, 2nd Lt. John J. Durkin, USAAF, ditched into the water near the ship. Victoria's crew immediately hauled him on board, thus accomplishing the ship's first rescue. John was returning from Kiriwina Island, after escorting bombers to Rabaul the previous day. His flight leader Verl Jett wished him good luck as heavy rain shorted our his propellor advance electric controls and he lost RPM and was going down in 1/3 mile visibility - he had his boy scout compass with him he recalls and by luck he saw the ship and circled and choose to ditch and hit his head hard on cockpit panel, His MAE West life jacket did not inflate automatically, a design flaw with length of the CO2 cartridge, which was forwared up the line so a design change could be made, instead, they improvised and packed the cartridge holder with a newspaper pad to ensure it would work. John's 475th FG records show him ditching in Porlock Harbor on this date. Reaching Milne Bay on 9 November after proceeding independently from Porlock Harbor, Victoria then pressed on, without escort, for Australian waters, reaching Brisbane on the 15th {{for a period of}} well-deserved recreation for the crew and engine repairs for the ship herself.|$|R
60|$|The Snark is a sail-boat. She {{was built}} {{primarily}} to sail. But incidentally, as an auxiliary, a seventy-horse-power engine was installed. This is a good, strong engine. I ought to know. I {{paid for it}} to come out {{all the way from}} New York City. Then, on deck, above the engine, is a windlass. It is a magnificent affair. It weighs several hundred pounds and takes up no end of deck-room. You see, it is ridiculous to <b>hoist</b> up <b>anchor</b> by hand-power when there is a seventy-horse-power engine on board. So we installed the windlass, transmitting power to it from the engine by means of a gear and castings specially made in a San Francisco foundry.|$|R
60|$|The boats {{started as}} soon as their cargoes were on board, and the work went on uninterruptedly {{for the next two}} hours, by which time the last keg was on shore, and the boats {{returned}} to the lugger. The men were in high spirits. The cargo had been a valuable one, and the whole had been got rid of without interruption. The boats were at once <b>hoisted</b> up, the <b>anchor</b> weighed, and the lugger made her way out to sea.|$|R
60|$|We were {{no sooner}} on board than we <b>hoisted</b> sail; the <b>anchors</b> being up, {{and the wind}} fair, we cut the waves at a great rate, till about four o'clock in the morning, when a French boat came to fetch the mail to carry it to the post-house, and the boat cast her anchors, for we were a good {{distance}} from the shore, neither could we sail to the town till next tide, the present one being too far advanced in the ebb.|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} the crew {{set to work}} to re-water the ship, and by nightfall all the casks were filled up, and the vessel was ready to proceed again on her way. The next morning sails were <b>hoisted</b> and the <b>anchor</b> weighed. The natives came out in great numbers in their canoes, and surrounded the Swan as she glided away from her anchorage, waving their hands and raising cries of farewell--evidently greatly satisfied at the treatment they had received {{at the hands of}} their white visitors.|$|R
60|$|The {{consequences}} were so evident, to all {{engaged in}} the expedition, that despondency took {{the place of the}} enthusiasm with which they had embarked. The fact that the expedition, after being so carefully and secretly prepared, should at its outset meet with so serious a misfortune, was considered an omen of evil. At last, however, James embarked, under a salute by the guns of the ships of war; and as the sails were <b>hoisted</b> and the <b>anchors</b> weighed, the spirits of all again rose.|$|R
2500|$|The Wetmore was [...] {{long with}} {{a beam of}} [...] and a [...] draft and gross tonnage of 3,000. Her power was a single [...] steam engine, but she also had four jury masts with sails for {{emergency}} use. As typical for freight whalebacks, {{there was a small}} turret at the bow which had <b>anchor</b> <b>hoisting</b> machinery and other equipment. Three turrets at the stern raised the stern cabin and pilothouse off the hull. Her single stack exited through one of the turrets. A typical crew complement was 22.|$|R
50|$|Lieutenant Thorn, {{happy with}} the prices he was getting for the furs, {{realized}} too late the danger the ship was in and gave the orders to <b>hoist</b> the <b>anchor</b> and sails. At this moment the Nuu-chah-nulth chief gave a signal to attack. Thorn {{and most of the}} crew were killed quickly since they were generally unarmed, Thorn kept the guns below deck. The Nuu-chah-nulth were armed with clubs and knives. A few surviving Tonquin crew began to resist from below deck where the store of rifles and powder was located. The Nuu-chah-nulth withdrew to shore as night fell. Five men remained alive, one seriously injured. They debated the options but saw no possibility of sailing the ship with so few hands. They decided that four would leave in one of the ship's skiffs (a small open boat) under the cover of darkness and try to make it back to Fort Astoria along the coast.|$|R
50|$|Zoro has a stern, {{serious and}} distanced personality, but unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style {{due to his}} short-tempered and {{impatient}} attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is <b>hoisting</b> the <b>anchor</b> using his great strength and maintaining look out in the ships crow's nest (which on the Thousand Sunny ship also doubles as his personal gym). He also likes sake, almost {{to the degree that}} Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.|$|R
60|$|It {{held the}} New Englanders, {{who were being}} {{conveyed}} to the ship which was to take them home. There were the four seamen huddled together, {{and there in the}} sheets were Captain Ephraim Savage and Amos Green, conversing together and pointing to the shipping. The grizzled face of the old Puritan and the bold features of the woodsman were turned more than once in his direction, but no word of farewell and no kindly wave of the hand came back to the lonely exile. They were so full of their own future and their own happiness, that they had not a thought to spare upon his misery. He could have borne anything from his enemies, but this sudden neglect from his friends came too heavily after his other troubles. He stooped his face to his arms and burst in an instant into a passion of sobs. Before he raised his eyes again the brig had <b>hoisted</b> her <b>anchor,</b> and was tacking under full canvas out of the Quebec basin.|$|R
5000|$|The Wetmore {{was built}} in 1891 as hull #112 of the American Steel Barge Company works. The Wetmore was 264 ft long with a beam of 38 ft and a 16.4 ft draft and gross tonnage of 3,000. Her power was a single [...] steam engine, but she also had four jury masts with sails for {{emergency}} use. As typical for freight whalebacks, {{there was a small}} turret at the bow which had <b>anchor</b> <b>hoisting</b> machinery and other equipment. Three turrets at the stern raised the stern cabin and pilothouse off the hull. Her single stack exited through one of the turrets. A typical crew complement was 22.|$|R
5000|$|The buoys were {{of square}} or {{hexagonal}} construction {{and had a}} floor space of about 43 square feet with an 8-foot cabin rising above the float. On the upper deck of this cabin, there was an oval turret 6 feet high with a signal mast carrying a wireless antenna. Tube railings to which the distressed flyers could cling ran along the outer circumference below and above the water line. A ladder {{led up to the}} turret, in which there was a door opening into the cabin below.A 320-foot red and yellow striped rope anchored the buoy at a fixed location, but allowed a limited drift, thereby indicating the direction of the current to aircraft in distress. The buoy was painted light yellow above the water line, and red crosses against white oval backgrounds were painted {{on each side of the}} turret.The cabin accommodated four persons comfortably for several days, and in an emergency, the crews of several aircraft could be taken care of. It was electrically lit by storage batteries, but in case of a breakdown kerosene lamps or other lighting devices were provided. There were two double-deck beds and adequate cupboard space for first-aid equipment, dry clothing and shoes, emergency rations, and a water supply. Hot food could be prepared on an alcohol stove. Cognac to relieve chill and cigarettes to quiet the nerves were also provided. Games, stationery, playing cards, etc. afforded diversion until rescue was effected. Depleted supplies were always immediately replaced upon the arrival of the rescue ship. A tubular lifeboat was available for transferring the downed aviators from the buoy to the ship.Signalling was accomplished by <b>hoisting</b> a black <b>anchor</b> ball and a yellow and red striped flag on the mast during the day. At night, red and white lights in the turret indicated that rescued men were on board. A white anchor light on the mast was visible for 3,000 feet or more. SOS signals giving the location of the buoy were automatically sent out by an emergency wireless transmitter. Signal pistols with red and white lights, white-light parachute flares, or a smoke, distress-signalling apparatus completed the signalling equipment. Other equipment included plugs to stop up bullet holes in the walls of the cabin and a pump for the expulsion of seepage.|$|R
