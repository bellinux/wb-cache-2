5|$|As of October 2009, 190 {{asteroid}} moons and 63 trans-Neptunian moons <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|E
5|$|A twelfth {{specimen}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> by amateur collectors in 2010 at the Schamhaupten quarry, but {{the finding}} was only announced in February 2014. It {{is as yet}} not scientifically described.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April 2009, the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights {{announced}} that mass graves containing {{the remains of}} approximately 4,500 members of the division <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> near Zaprešić. Locals indicated that the Partisan 21st Serbian Division {{was responsible for the}} massacre.|$|E
50|$|Soddy's hexlet, thought {{previously}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in {{the west}} in 1937, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> on a Sangaku dating from 1822.|$|R
50|$|Several {{inscriptions}} from Jayachandra's reign <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered,</b> {{most of them}} in {{and around}} Varanasi. One of the inscriptions <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> at Bodh Gaya in present-day Bihar.|$|R
50|$|Legionella <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> to <b>be</b> {{a genetically}} diverse species with 7-11% of genes strain-specific. The {{molecular}} function {{of some of}} the proven virulence factors of Legionella <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 6 October 2012 the Finnish {{newspaper}} Helsingin Sanomat {{reported that}} the wreck of Pallada <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> by a diver group outside Hanko near the coast of Finland in 2000, but the group had waited until 2012 before publishing their find.|$|E
5|$|The {{stony-iron}} Pallasite meteorites are {{not connected}} to the Pallas asteroid, being instead named after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas. The chemical element palladium, on the other hand, was named after the asteroid, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> just before the element.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{powerful}} and influential nobles {{began to be}} buried with the royal family; {{the most famous of}} these tombs is the joint tomb of Yuya and Tjuyu, KV46. They were possibly the parents of Queen Tiy. Until the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, this was the best-preserved of the tombs that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in the Valley.|$|E
50|$|The village exists {{since the}} 12th century. In the village lands <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> traces of a pre-historic settlement. Votive tablets with the Thracian horseman, silver coins {{and other objects}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|R
25|$|No {{skeletal}} remains of Paleoindians <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in Kentucky, and while many Paleoindian clovis <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered,</b> there's scant {{evidence that the}} Paleoindians at Big Bone Lick State Park in Kentucky hunted Mastodons.|$|R
50|$|Datousaurus {{was named}} by Dong Zhiming and Tang in 1984. To date, only two partial skeletons <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> Neither <b>had</b> an {{articulated}} skull, although one skull <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{attributed to the}} genus.|$|R
5|$|In 2006 it was {{announced}} that a population of comets <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line, which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models, there was insufficient outgassing of water during the Earth's formative period to form the oceans, requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, {{the site}} {{was used as a}} beacon for the Pilgrimage of Grace. During the 18th century, the castle was of {{interest}} to treasure hunters following rumours that gold and silver <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> at Buckton. The site was used as an anti-aircraft decoy site in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|It {{was named}} by Wollaston in 1802 after the {{asteroid}} 2 Pallas, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> two months earlier. Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in aqua regia, neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide, and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride. He added mercuric cyanide {{to form the}} compound palladium(II) cyanide, which was heated to extract palladium metal.|$|E
50|$|Paleolithic sites <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in Pothohar near Pakistan's capital Islamabad, {{with the}} stone {{tools of the}} Soan Culture. In ancient Gandhara, near Islamabad, {{evidence}} of cave dwellers dated 15,000 years ago <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> at Mardan.|$|R
50|$|No other homologs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also in the Northern and {{southern}} Sri Lanka, coins having a bull {{on one side}} and an elephant on the other side <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> In India coins with a bull {{on one side and}} a lion on the other side <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|R
5|$|The second isotope 242Am was {{produced}} upon neutron bombardment of the already-created 241Am. Upon rapid β-decay, 242Am converts into the isotope of curium 242Cm (which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> previously). The half-life of this decay was initially determined at 17 hours, which {{was close to}} the presently accepted value of 16.02 h.|$|E
5|$|A major {{renovation}} of the auberge in the Baroque style began in 1680. The façade was remodelled by Mederico Blondel, and a third floor was constructed {{at the expense of}} Grand Master Gregorio Carafa. An ornate centrepiece with a trophy of arms containing a bust of Carafa was added above the main entrance. The trophy was sculpted by Raymond de La Fage out of marble taken from the ruins of the Temple of Proserpina, an ancient Roman temple in Mtarfa which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in 1613.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, 3487 {{locations}} of rock art <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in Cundinamarca alone, of which 301 on the Bogotá savanna. Other locations {{have been found}} over the years. The rock art of the Archaeological Park of Facatativá is heavily vandalised. Plans {{for the preservation of}} the unique cultural heritage have been formulated since the mid 2000s. The petrographs of Soacha are endangered by the mining activities in the fastly growing suburb of Bogotá, as is happening with other mining districts; Chía, Sibaté, Tunja, Sáchica and others.|$|E
50|$|It {{is one of}} the proto-{{historic}} {{sites that}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> By about 1000 BC chalcolithic people had settled on the north bank of the Dwarakeswar. After the early historic period nothing noticeable <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> at Dihar till Saivite activity around 14th century AD.|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} complex system, many {{security}} problems <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> and fixed since Java was first released. Some of these (like the Calendar serialization security bug) persisted {{for many years}} with nobody being aware. Others <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in use by malware in the wild.|$|R
50|$|No {{treatment}} or cure <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> yet.|$|R
5|$|In late 1922, Boyce {{departed}} {{on another}} expedition to Africa, {{this time for}} six months. Morocco {{reminded him of the}} Dakotas, Kansas, Texas, Florida, and Arizona. In Egypt he visited the tomb of Tutankhamun, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> just a few months earlier. His expedition then went to Luxor and sailed up the Nile River to Edfu, where the houses had no roofs and while he was there it rained and hailed {{for the first time in}} decades. Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa, he had shot at least one of every game animal.|$|E
5|$|Most coincidentally, a small {{theropod}} dinosaur named Oviraptor philoceratops <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> while Heilmann {{was working}} on his book, and was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924. Figure 8 of Osborn's paper, redrawn from the fossil, shows what was later proven to be an oviraptorid wishbone between the animal's arms. Unfortunately, this important structure was misidentified at the time. If Heilmann had examined this paper as closely as he had much of his source material – or had traveled to New York to see the specimens in person – he may have reversed his conclusions entirely.|$|E
5|$|The {{southbound}} carriageway of {{the bridge}} was closed on 1 December 2015 after steelwork defects <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> during routine inspections and traffic was restricted 7.5 tonne or less (public service vehicles excepted). On 23 December the Road Bridge reopened for all traffic except heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). On 4 February, it was announced this had been pushed back to March, due to further problems with the truss end link pins in the southern towers, which required additional remedial work.|$|E
50|$|These {{internal}} particle spaces <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> empirically.|$|R
50|$|Tarsiers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in Maitum's mountainous areas.|$|R
50|$|Roman era graves <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in Maggia.|$|R
5|$|When {{the models}} were built, only skulls of the Cretaceous fossil Mosasaurus <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in the Netherlands, so Hawkins only built {{the head and}} back of the animal. He {{submerged}} the model deep in the lake, leaving the body unseen and undefined. The Mosasaurus at Crystal Palace is positioned in an odd place near the secondary island that was originally a waterfall, {{and much of it}} is not visible from the lakeside path.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} two Uranian moons were {{discovered}} in 1787, they were not named until 1852, a year after two more moons <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the sylphs Ariel and Umbriel from Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (Ariel is also a sprite in Shakespeare's The Tempest). The reasoning was presumably that Uranus, as god {{of the sky and}} air, would be attended by spirits of the air.|$|E
5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
25|$|As of 5 June 2017, {{the remains}} of Danwon High School student Cho Eun-hwa and {{passenger}} Lee Young-sook <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> and positively identified. The remains of a third victim <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> relatively intact, although DNA testing is still ongoing to determine the identity of those remains.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of archaeological finds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> on the site, {{including}} many imported luxury items. Examples include beads of mountain crystal and pieces of glass jars. A damaged golden ring <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> on the site as well; a replica is displayed in the Aggersborg museum.|$|R
50|$|Egyptologist Bob Brier {{has noted}} that despite its {{widespread}} depiction in royal portraits, no ancient Egyptian crown ever <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> Tutankhamun's tomb, discovered largely intact, did contain such regalia as his crook and flail, but no crown was found, however, among the funerary equipment. Diadems <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|R
