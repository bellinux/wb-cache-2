On leaving the valve or nozzle through one or more small openings, the fuel is split up into innumerable fine drops, which penetrate the combustion chamber in divergent directions {{in the form of}} a conical jet. The efficiency of this jet is judged from the following three viewpoints: 1) with respect to the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> atomization; 2) with respect to the direction or distribution <b>of</b> <b>sprayed</b> particles; 3) with respect to the penetration of the particles...|$|R

40|$|Strength {{development}} of lime-pozzolana mortars {{is affected by}} the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the pozzolan. This paper examines the effect <b>of</b> the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> artificial pozzolana on the strength {{development of}} lime-pozzolana mixtures. An artificial pozzolana produced by calcining clays from Oman was used in this study. The artificial pozzolana is locally known as “Sarooj”, and is currently being used in a big project for the restoration of historical monuments undertaken by the Omani Ministry of National Heritage and Culture. The artificial pozzolana was ground to various degrees <b>of</b> <b>fineness,</b> blended with hydrated lime with a ratio of 3 : 1, and the resulting mortar was used to make hardened mortar cubes. Strength of mortar cubes was measured at ages of 7, 14, 28 and 90 days of casting. The experimental results show that good artificial pozzolanas show a linear correlation between the Blaine <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the artificial pozzolana and the compressive strength, but such relationship does not exists for weak type pozzolanas. The <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the artificial pozzolana has its most significant effect on delayed strength gain, with more pronounced effect for good type pozzolan...|$|R
40|$|The so‐called ‘re‐identification condition’ (K elly 2011) {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the most prominent argument for nonconceptualism, the argument from <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> grain. A number of authors have recently argued that the condition should be modified or discarded altogether, with devastating implications for the nonconceptualist (see, e. g., B rewer 2005, C huard 2006). The aim of this paper is to show that the situation is even more dire for nonconceptualists, for even if the re‐identification condition remains in its original form, the argument from <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> grain still fails to make the case for nonconceptualism. The paper's central case rests on two claims: according to the first, if the re‐identification condition holds, then some beliefs will represent some properties nonconceptually; and according to the second, if some beliefs represent some properties nonconceptually, the argument from <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> grain fails to make the case for nonconceptualism in any relevant sense. It follows that if the re‐identification condition holds, the argument from <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> grain fails to make the case for nonconceptualism...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> fly ash on expansion of fly ash-cement mortar in magnesium sulfate solution. Fly ash from the Mae Moh {{power plant in}} Thailand was classified in to three different levels <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> Blaine of 3215, 4440 and 5890 cm 2 /g with a median particle size of 25. 57, 7. 69, and 4. 81 microns, respectively. Fly ash at each level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> was used to replace Portland cement type I and type V at percentages of 0, 20, 30, and 40 by weight of the cementitious material, to cast mortar bars of 2. 5 x 2. 5 x 30 cm 3. Expansion of the fly ash-cement mortar bars, which were immersed in 5 % by weight of magnesium sulfate solution, were measured {{at the age of}} 1 to 540 days. The results showed that the replacement of Portland cement type I and type V by fly ash reduced expansion of the mortar bars. When the same level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> and same percent of replacement of fly ash were used in the mortar bars, the replacement of Portland cement type V by fly ash produced less expansion than that of Portland cement type I. For the same level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> fly ash, the mortar bars made with 40 % fly ash replacement had less expansion than those made with 20 and 30 % replacement. The mortar bars with 20 - 25 % replacement of fine fly ash (Blaine <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> 4440 or 5890 cm 2 /g) and the mortar bars with 40 % replacement of original fly ash (Blain <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> 3125 cm 2 /g) had the same expansion. The smaller particle size of fly ash not only reduced expansion of the fly ash-mortar bars but also produced higher strength activity index of mortar than the bigger particle size of fly ash. Therefore, very fine fly ash could be used effectively for reducing the expansion and improving sulfate resistance of mortar...|$|R
