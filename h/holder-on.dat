5000|$|Erie {{was ordered}} in June 1933 and laid {{down at the}} New York Naval Shipyard on 17 December 1934. This marked a couple of [...] "firsts" [...] for the New York Navy Yard. One, was that the first rivets driven into Erie's keel were by {{civilian}} employees rather than ranking Navy officers. This included, Rober H. Hanlon, labor foreman, was the rivet heater, William H. Jennings, master electrician, was the rivateer, Charles E. Botts, master rigger, the <b>holder-on,</b> and Victor Carissime, master boilermaker, and Frank Connors, master ship fitter, were the rivet-passers. The other was that the ship {{was built in the}} Yard's No. 1 Dry Dock instead of on a slip. Rear Admiral Yates Stirling, Jr., Commandant of the Third Naval District and the New York Navy Yard, Captain Charles Dunn, industrial manager of the Yard, and Mrs. Edmund Knoll (n√©e Ida May Illig), Erie's sponsor, were all present for the keel-laying ceremony. Mrs. Knoll wouldn't be formally announced as the sponsor until October 1935.|$|E
