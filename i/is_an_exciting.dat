25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E

[...] "Probably the best Roxette album since Joyride," [...] wrote Leslie Mathew of Allmusic, [...] "Room Service <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting,</b> immediate, high-gloss pop gem that contains very little filler indeed." [...] Per Bjurman from Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet {{was critical of}} the album. [...] "It is not very good." [...] he wrote.

Executive producer Cameron Welsh said [...] "She <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> talent and I think audiences are going to love her character and respond really well to her." [...] James then moved to Sydney especially for the role. Speaking of working on the serial James stated: [...] "Working on a series like this [...] is the best training you can get, I look at it like an apprenticeship and never forget how lucky I am." [...] Fellow cast member Celeste Dodwell who plays Melody Jones originally auditioned for the part of Nicole. After Coleby who plays Roman quit the serial, James' time with the show was in doubt.|$|E

[...] Record Mirror awarded the album four stars out of five and Allen Evans of the NME also praised the LP: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> album, at times brash and noisy ('So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star', 'Have You Seen Her Face'), spooky (the science-fiction outer-space sounds on 'C.T.A.-102'), folksy ('Everybody's Been Burned'), weird (the irritating, monotonous backing to 'Mind Gardens'), and pleasant (the soft swinging of 'The Girl with No Name').

500|$|On September 20, 2001, dates were {{released}} {{along with the}} track listing of the album. The tour was slated to begin on October 26, 2001, but {{the opening of the}} show was pushed back until October 31 after Spears became ill and was prescribed five days of rest. The tour was postponed one more day due to production delays and finally kicked off at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. Before the tour began, Spears announced she planned to give $1 of each ticket to the children of firefighters and police officers killed during the September 11 attacks. She also planned to sell merchandise and auction front row seats, hoping to raise $2million. On February 26, 2002, more North American dates {{were released}} through her official website to kick off in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay. The second leg of the tour was sponsored by Samsung. In conjunction with entertainment company WFX, they offered [...] a cell-phone service that featured collectible merchandise and a membership card with access to backstage reports directly from Spears.

500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E
500|$|Following the expiry of his {{contract}} at Stevenage, rejecting the club's offer of a new contract, Roberts signed for League Two side Fleetwood Town on a free transfer. On joining Fleetwood, Roberts stated — [...] "I was massively impressed with this club from the first moment. Joining Fleetwood <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> prospect and I {{jumped at the chance}} after seeing the plans and hearing the chairman's vision". Shortly {{before the start of the}} 2013–14 season, Roberts was named as Fleetwood's new captain, stating it was a [...] "massive honour to be named as club captain for the season". He scored just six minutes into his Fleetwood debut, also the first League Two goal of the new campaign, courtesy of a powerful header in a 3–1 home victory over Dagenham & Redbridge. Roberts was almost ever-present during the campaign and, similarly to his time at Stevenage, he also chipped in with a number of goals from central defence. He scored the winner in a 21 away victory at Rochdale on 14 December 2013, netting from close range after Nathan Pond's header had rebounded off the post and fallen into Roberts' path. He also scored in a 31 win over Bristol Rovers in March 2014, heading in a Josh Morris corner to double Fleetwood's lead. As a result of Fleetwood's fourth place finish in League Two, the club competed in the League Two play-offs. Roberts played in all three matches, with the team keeping three consecutive clean sheets, as Fleetwood won promotion to League One for the first time in the club's history after a 10 victory over Burton Albion at Wembley Stadium in the final. Roberts made 45 appearances in all competitions during his first season with the club, scoring three goals.|$|E

[...] IGN's Ryan Clements praised its differences from other RPGs, due to its focus on Zack's growth and {{his relationship with the}} SOLDIERs.

[...] It also received a place amongst the [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] gallery of recommended games for the PSP platform. GameSpy also gave it a good review, stating it [...] "is equal parts tribute and original, marrying classic design choices with refreshingly new techniques, harmoniously bringing together something old with something new." [...] Gamespy also commented that although some players may dislike Zack, [...] "you'll have to be pretty jaded for the character not to grow on you as you progress through the adventure." [...] VideoGamer.com gave an overall score of 9, finding its fighting system [...] "addictive", and arguing that its CGI scenes had a similar quality to the ones from Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Similarly, GamePro gave it a positive review, calling it the [...] "best looking PSP title," [...] and praising how it incorporated elements from the Compilation, {{and at the same time}} created new aspects. GamesRadar's AJ Glasser stated that with the DMW system, the gameplay could be easy, causing the [...] "rare gamer" [...] to try to play it in Hard Mode. Glasser also found the game likeable enough so that even gamers who dislike the Final Fantasy VII series may enjoy it. Plays Samuel Roberts called it the best game of 2008.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Myrie-Williams {{returned}} to Cheltenham Town, signing on a one-month loan deal on 14 August 2008. On bringing Myrie-Williams back to the club, Cheltenham manager Keith Downing said [...] "Jennison <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> young player who will give us some different options. We've perhaps been lacking a bit of pace and he will give us that as well". He made his second debut for the club four days later, scoring with a header in the 80th minute to ensure Cheltenham picked up their first win of the 2008–09 season with a 2–0 win against Swindon Town. Myrie-Williams made five appearances for Cheltenham during his one-month loan spell, scoring one goal. He returned to Bristol City on 15 September 2008. Shortly after returning to his parent club, Myrie-Williams was loaned out to another League One club, this time in the form of Carlisle United. Myrie-Williams stated that the move appealed to him because of manager John Ward, who he had played under at Cheltenham Town— [...] "We have kept in contact since I was at Cheltenham. He's a good manager and I enjoyed playing for him. I heard about a possible move in pre-season which came to nothing but I'm delighted to finally be here". He made his Carlisle debut on 20 September 2008, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute in a 2–0 home defeat to Leeds United, a result that ended Carlisle's 100% home record. His loan spell was extended for another month on 15 October 2008. His final appearance for Carlisle was in the club's FA Cup 1–1 draw with Grays Athletic, a game in which Myrie-Williams was substituted after 59 minutes. He made 10 appearances during his two months at Carlisle. Myrie-Williams was loaned out for a third time during the 2008–09 season, his fifth loan spell in total, when he joined Hereford United in January 2009. He scored his first goal for Hereford on 17 February 2009 in the club's 2–0 home victory against Leeds United, scoring with a low shot to give Hereford the lead just before half-time. He returned to Bristol City after Hereford's 1–0 home loss against Peterborough United on 21 February 2009. A month later, Myrie-Williams rejoined Hereford {{until the end of the}} season. Myrie-Williams scored his second goal for Hereford in an away draw with Yeovil Town in April 2009. He made 15 appearances over the period of the two loan spells, scoring twice, as Hereford were relegated back to League Two after finishing bottom of the table.|$|E
