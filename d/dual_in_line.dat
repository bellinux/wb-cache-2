40|$|Field {{electron}} emission from aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes has been assessed {{to determine if}} the performance, defined by power consumption, lifetime and emission current, is suitable for use in spacecraft charge neutralisation for field emission electric propulsion (FEEP). Carbon nanotubes grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) were mounted on a <b>dual</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> chip with a macroscopic (nickel mesh) extractor electrode mounted ∼ 1 mm above the tubes. The nanotubes' field emission characteristics (emission currents, electron losses and operating voltage) were measured at ∼ 10 - 4 Pa. An endurance test of one sample, running at a software-controlled constant emission current lasted > 1400 h, approaching the longest known FEEP thruster lifetime. The emission corresponds to a current density of ∼ 10 mA/cm 2 at a voltage of 150 V. These results, implementing mature extractor-electrode geometry, indicate that carbon nanotubes have considerable potential for development as robust, low-power, long-lived electron emitters for use in space. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An experimental study has been conducted into the effects of package related failures in plastic encapsulated semiconductors. As {{a result of an}} extensive literature survey particular emphasis was placed on thermal and moisture related failure mechanisms. A number of accelerated life testing techniques including Highly Accelerated Stress Testing (HAST) were used to induced parameter drift and catastrophic failures. Examples of both insertion and surface mount package types were studied. Observations were made on the parameter drift and catastrophic failure mechanisms of plastic encapsulated Bipolar Junction Transistors in <b>dual</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> packages. Gain degradation was observed to be the most sensitive parameter of those measured. It is proposed that this is a result of an increase in the extended surface depletion region area due to a degradation in the surface cleanliness. A theoretical analysis of the build up these traps is presented. Package performance test chips were used to monitor the moisture resistance properties and thermal performance of Quad Flat Pack packages. Surface leakage path effects, corrosion onset and thermally induced stresses were monitored using this technique. A computer controlled measurement system was assembled for data acquisition and logging. It is believed that these techniques will be of use in the investigation into the suitability of different package plastic styles for high reliability applications such as military and aerospace systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A two-facet {{approach}} {{was used to}} investigate the parametric performance of functional high-speed DDR 3 (Double Data Rate) DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) die placed in different types of BGA (Ball Grid Array) packages: wire-bonded BGA (FBGA, Fine Ball Grid Array), flip-chip (FCBGA) and lead-bonded microBGA®. In the first section, packaged live DDR 3 die were tested using automatic test equipment using high-resolution shmoo plots. It {{was found that the}} best timing and voltage margin was obtained using the lead-bonded microBGA, followed by the wire-bonded FBGA with the FCBGA exhibiting the worst performance of the three types tested. In particular the flip-chip packaged devices exhibited reduced operating voltage margin. In the second part of this work a test system was designed and constructed to mimic the electrical environment of the data bus in a PC’s CPU-Memory subsystem that used a single DIMM (<b>Dual</b> <b>In</b> <b>Line</b> Memory Module) socket in point-to-point and point-to-two-point configurations. The emulation system was used to examine signal integrity for system-level operation at speeds in excess of 6 Gb/pin/sec in order to assess the frequency extensibility of the signal-carrying path of the microBGA considered for future high-speed DRAM packaging. The analyzed signal path was driven from either end of the data bus by a GaAs laser driver capable of operation beyond 10 GHz. Eye diagrams were measured using a high speed sampling oscilloscope with a pulse generator providing a pseudo-random bit sequence stimulus for the laser drivers. The memory controller was emulated using a circuit implemented on a BGA interposer employing the laser driver while the active DRAM was modeled using the same type of laser driver mounted to the DIMM module. ...|$|E

40|$|The tendon {{vibration}} illusion {{has been}} extensively used to manipulate the perceived position of one's own body part. However, findings from previous research do not seem conclusive sregarding the perceptual effect of the concurrent stimulation of both agonist and antagonist tendons over one joint. On the basis of recent data, {{it has been suggested}} that this paired stimulation generates an inconsistent signal about the limb position, which leads to a perceived shrinkage of the limb. However, this interesting effect has never been replicated. The aim of the present study was to clarify the effect of a simultaneous and equal vibration of the biceps and triceps tendons on the perceived location of the hand. Experiment 1 replicated and extended the previous findings. We compared a dual tendon stimulation condition with single tendon stimulation conditions and with a control condition (no vibration) on both 'upward-downward' and 'towards-away from the elbow' planes. Our results show a mislocalisation towards the elbow of the position of the vibrated arm during <b>dual</b> vibration, <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with previous results; however, this did not clarify whether the effect was due to arm representation contraction (i. e., a 'telescoping' effect). Therefore, in Experiment 2 we investigated explicitly and implicitly the perceived arm length during the same conditions. Our results clearly suggest that in all the vibration conditions there was a mislocalisation of the entire arm (including the elbow), but no evidence of a contraction of the perceived arm length...|$|R
40|$|UK Energy {{policy is}} focused on the {{challenges}} posed by energy security and climate change, however, efforts to develop a low-carbon economy have overlooked tidal energy a vast and unexploited worldwide resource. Since 1981, UK tidal lagoon schemes have been recommended as an economically and environmentally attractive alternative to tidal barrages. More recently, two proposals for tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay have emerged and there have been several reports documenting the potential to harness significant tidal energy from Swansea Bay using a tidal lagoon. This paper assists in determining a realistic approximation of the energy generation potential in Swansea Bay, a numerical estimation is obtained from a zero dimension, 0 D, ‘backwards difference’ computational model, utilising the latest turbine data available and high-resolution bathymetric data. This paper models the behaviour of the tidal lagoon <b>in</b> <b>dual</b> mode generation, <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the above proposals. The results of model testing using a variety of fixed and variable parameters are displayed.

40|$|Sulfiredoxin (Srx) couples {{the energy}} of ATP {{hydrolysis}} to the energetically unfavorable process of reducing the inactive sulfinic form of 2 -cysteine peroxiredoxins (Prxs) to regenerate its active form. In plants, Srx as well as typical 2 -cysteine Prx have been considered as enzymes with exclusive chloroplast localization. This work explores the subcellular localization of Srx in pea (Pisum sativum) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Immunocytochemistry, analysis of protein extracts from isolated intact organelles, and cell-free posttranslational import assays demonstrated that plant Srx also localizes to the mitochondrion in addition to plastids. The <b>dual</b> localization was <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the prediction of a signal peptide for dual targeting. Activity tests and microcalorimetric data proved the interaction between Srx and its mitochondrial targets Prx IIF and thioredoxin. Srx catalyzed the retroreduction of the inactive sulfinic form of atypical Prx IIF using thioredoxin as reducing agent. Arabidopsis Srx also reduced overoxidized human Prx V. These results suggest that plant Srx could {{play a crucial role}} in the regulation of Prx IIF activity by controlling the regeneration of its overoxidized form in mitochondria, which are sites of efficient reactive oxygen species production in plants...|$|R
