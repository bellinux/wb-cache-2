25|$|Table olive {{varieties}} {{are more difficult}} to harvest, as workers must take care not to damage the fruit; baskets that <b>hang</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> worker's neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production.|$|E
25|$|In 1515, Raphael was {{commissioned}} by Pope Leo X to design a series of ten tapestries to <b>hang</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> lower tier of the walls. The tapestries depict events from the Life of St. Peter and the Life of St. Paul, {{the founders of the}} Christian Church in Rome, as described in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. Work began in mid-1515. Due to their large size, manufacture of the hangings was carried out in Brussels, and took four years under the hands of the weavers in the shop of Pieter van Aelst. Raphael's tapestries were looted during the Sack of Rome in 1527 and were either burnt for their precious metal content or were scattered around Europe. In the late 20th century, a set was reassembled from several further sets that had been made after the first set, and displayed again in the Sistine Chapel in 1983. The tapestries continue in use at occasional ceremonies of particular importance. The full-size preparatory cartoons for seven of the ten tapestries are known as the Raphael Cartoons and are in London.|$|E

500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than <b>hang</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> house – even though there are days when I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E
500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who <b>hang</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fourth season}} saw The A-Team {{experience}} a dramatic fall, as {{it started to}} lose its position while television viewership increased.

2500|$|The tallit gadol (Yiddish/Ashkenazic Hebrew tallis godoil; {{traditionally}} {{known as}} tallét gedolah among Sephardim), or [...] "large" [...] tallit, is worn over one's clothing {{resting on the}} shoulders. This is the prayer shawl that is worn during the morning services in synagogue by all male participants, and in many communities by {{the leader of the}} afternoon and evening prayers as well. The tallit gadol is usually woven of wool [...] especially among Ashkenazim. Some Spanish and Portuguese Jews use silk tallitot. The Portuguese Jewish community in The Netherlands has the tradition of decorating the corners of the Tallit. Today some tallitot are made of polyester and cotton. Tallitot may be of any colour but are usually white with black, blue or white stripes along the edge. Sizes of tallitot vary, and are a matter of custom and preference. Some are large enough to cover the whole body while others <b>hang</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> shoulders, the former being more common among Orthodox Jews, the latter among Conservative, Reform and other denominations. The neckband of the tallit, sometimes woven of silver or gold thread, is called the atarah which literally means crown but {{is often referred to as}} the collar.
