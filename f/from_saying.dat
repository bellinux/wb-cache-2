On the next day, 1 July 1976, the Press Office of the Holy See declared that in accordance with canon 2373 of the then Code of Canon Law, Lefebvre was automatically suspended for one year from conferring ordination, and that those whom he had ordained were automatically suspended from the exercise of the order received. It was also announced that the Holy See was examining Lefebvre's disobedience to the orders of the Pope that were communicated by the above-mentioned letters of the Secretariat of State dated 12 and 15 June 1976.|$|E
25|$|Qur'anic {{commentators}} seem to {{have concluded}} the denial of the crucifixion of Jesus by following material interpreted in Tafsir that relied upon extra-biblical Judeo-Christian sources, venturing away from the message conveyed in the Qur'an, with the earliest textual evidence having originated from a non-Muslim source; a misreading of the Christian writings of John of Damascus regarding the literal understandings of Docetism (exegetical doctrine describing spiritual and physical realities of Jesus as understood by men in logical terms) as opposed to their figurative explanations. John of Damascus highlighted the Qur'an's assertion that the Jews did not crucify Jesus being very different <b>from</b> <b>saying</b> that Jesus was not crucified, explaining {{that it is the}} varied Quranic exegetes in Tafsir, and not the Qur'an itself, that denies the crucifixion, further stating that the message in the 4:157 verse simply affirms the historicity of the event.|$|E
25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others <b>from</b> <b>saying</b> or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E

500|$|Germain and Klasky {{initially}} {{planned to}} portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers.

500|$|However, {{the speech}} was little noticed, and McGovern backed away <b>from</b> <b>saying</b> {{anything}} publicly {{for over a year}} afterward, partly because of the November 1963 assassination of President Kennedy and partly to not appear strident. Though more skeptical about it than most senators, McGovern voted in favor of the August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, {{which turned out to be}} an essentially unbounded authorization for President Lyndon B. Johnson to escalate U.S. involvement in the war. McGovern thought the commander-in-chief should be given limited authority to retaliate against an attack; subsequently he said his instinct had been to vote no, but that he had voted yes based on Senator J. William Fulbright's urging to stand behind Johnson politically. Indeed, the day after the resolution vote, McGovern spoke concerning his fears that the vote would lead to greater involvement in the war; Wayne Morse, one of only two senators to oppose the resolution, sardonically noted that this fell into the category of [...] "very interesting, but very belated".

500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, who criticized the song, {{saying that it}} did not portray Gaga as an artist moving forward with her music, and did not {{contribute}} anything musically to distinguish itself from other sexual songs.

[...] is a [...] "complicated" [...] track where the production is so chaotic that it drowned the commendable hook of the song, making it sound like a [...] "whirring bee's nest". Melinda Newman from Hitfix gave the song a [...] "C" [...] rating and criticized its production as [...] "clunky". Preston Jones from Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the song [...] "blunt", and believed that it showed Gaga [...] "has been, all along, more or less creatively bankrupt". Allan Moses Rodricks from The Hindu felt that too much experimenting with the music led to a low quality production on the song. Allison Stewart from The Washington Post criticized the song's lyrics for including [...] "role playing, bad puns, a killer hook". Stewart also characterized it as [...] "highly sexualized, which is different <b>from</b> <b>saying</b> it's sexy, because Gaga's air of sexual detachment rivals Rihanna's." [...] Chris Bosman from Time found the song's sexual themes to be [...] "very similar" [...] and redundant to those from [...] "Venus".

[...] Inspired by Genovese boss Vincent Gigante, Massino forbade his men <b>from</b> <b>saying</b> his name out loud due to FBI surveillance.

Massino took a great number of precautions in regards to security and the possibility of anything incriminating being picked up on a wiretap. He closed the long-standing social clubs of the Bonanno family. He also arranged family meetings to be conducted in remote locations within the United States. [...] In some cases, he held meetings in foreign countries, and had his capos bring their wives along so they could be passed off as vacations. Remembering how Pistone's infiltration had damaged the family, he also decreed that all prospective made men had to have a working relationship with an incumbent member for at least eight years before becoming made, in hopes of ensuring new mafiosi were as reliable as possible. Unusually for bosses of his era, he actively encouraged his men to have their sons made as well. [...] In Massino's view, this would make it less likely that a capo would turn informer, since if that happened the defector's son would face almost certain death.|$|E
