25|$|Unlike the {{counties}} and regional municipalities of Southern Ontario, which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> and administrative structure and jurisdiction over specified government services, a district lacks {{that level of}} administration. Districts are too sparsely populated to maintain a county government system, so many district-based services are provided directly by the provincial government. For example, districts have provincially maintained secondary highways instead of county roads.|$|E
25|$|Two {{currents}} existed {{within the}} reformists of the Parti canadien: a moderate wing, whose members were fond of British institutions and wished for Lower Canada to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> more {{accountable to the}} elective house's representative and a more radical wing whose attachment to British institutions was rather conditional to this proving {{to be as good}} as to those of the neighbouring American republics.|$|E
25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

500|$|On April 12, 1861, the American Civil War {{began as}} Confederate troops {{attacked}} Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. Grant {{wrote to his}} father in a letter of April 21 that [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> and laws and a flag, and they must all be sustained. There are but two parties now, Traitors and Patriots ..." [...] Two days after the attack, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers and a mass meeting was held in Galena to assess the crisis and encourage recruitment. Before the attack, Grant had not reacted strongly to Southern secession. The news {{came as a shock}} in Galena, and Grant shared his neighbors' concern about the war. The captain of the local militia nominated Grant, the only man in town with professional military training, to lead the recruitment effort. A speech by his father's attorney, John Aaron Rawlins, stirred Grant's patriotism. Rawlins later became Grant's aide-de-camp and close friend during the war. Grant recalled with satisfaction that after that first recruitment meeting in Galena, [...] "I never went into our leather store again." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that in contrast to previous statements {{about the number of}} firings related to the scandal [...] "new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them you can no longer hide just because you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> job, unclog the middle management that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get the right people in those positions.” ...|$|E

500|$|Smith {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices of white dissent against the new constitution. He opposed its {{splitting}} of the heretofore non-racial, qualified electorate into graduated [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] rolls, saying the proposed system had [...] "racialist" [...] connotations, and objected to the idea that the first black MPs would be elected on what he said would be a [...] "debased franchise". [...] "Our policy in the past has always been that we would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government,</b> in Rhodesia, based on merit and that people wouldn't worry whether you were black or whether you were white," [...] he said. He also pointed out that the document did not actually guarantee Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the only member out of 280 to vote against it. Deeply disillusioned by these developments, he resigned from the UFP soon after to sit in the Federal Assembly as an independent. He lent his support to the [...] "United Group", an awkward coalition wherein Winston Field's conservative Dominion Party closed ranks with Sir Robert Tredgold and other liberals against the constitutional proposals, despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons. The black nationalist leaders initially endorsed the constitution, signing the draft document, but almost immediately repudiated it and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 June 1876, Councillor E. H. Higham {{suggested}} that the Council should approach the Colonial Secretary to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> reserve, {{on the corner of}} South Terrace and Essex Street, set aside to build a town hall. [...] The use of the site was approved by the state governor, Sir William Robinson, who offered convict labour for the construction as well as free design and specification preparation by the government engineer, and promised to seek a liberal grant from the Legislative Council for the construction project.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent to}} which a bill changes during this process varies. If the Select Committee that {{considered}} the bill did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> majority and made significant alterations, the Government may make significant [...] "corrective" [...] amendments. There is some criticism that bills may be amended to incorporate significant policy changes without the benefit of Select Committee scrutiny or public submissions, or even that such major changes can be made with little or no notice. However, under the MMP system when the Government is less likely to have an absolute majority, any amendments will usually need to be negotiated with other parties to obtain majority support.|$|E

[...] Who denies them the right? [...] Standing with the principles of '76 behind us, who can deny them the right? ...

He charged Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq's weapons program, deceiving the nation about Iraq's connection to al-Qaeda, and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the United Nations charter. Kucinich opened his press conference by quoting from the Declaration of Independence, and stated: [...] "I believe the Vice President's conduct of office has been destructive to the founding purposes of our nation.

We have miserable franchises, and every day makes them worse. We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> that first makes us poor, and then tempts our poverty with bribes and promises.

2500|$|Despite the {{reluctance}} to legally recognise the Premiership, ambivalence toward it waned in the 1780s. During the first 20 {{years of his}} reign, George III (1760–1820) tried to be his own [...] "prime minister" [...] by controlling policy from outside the Cabinet, appointing and dismissing ministers, meeting privately with individual ministers, and giving them instructions. These practices caused confusion and dissension in Cabinet meetings; King George's experiment in personal rule was generally a failure. After the failure of Lord North's ministry (1770–1782) in March 1782 due to Britain's defeat in the American Revolutionary War and the ensuing vote of no confidence by Parliament, the Marquess of Rockingham reasserted the Prime Minister's control over the Cabinet. Rockingham assumed the Premiership [...] "on the distinct understanding that measures were to be changed as well as men; and that the measures for which the new ministry required the royal consent were the measures which they, while in opposition, had advocated." [...] He and his Cabinet were united in their policies and would stand or fall together; they also refused to accept anyone in the Cabinet who did not agree. King George threatened to abdicate {{but in the end}} reluctantly agreed out of necessity: he had to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) {{has many}} {{affluent}} members and a famous golf course. A large sized Rotary Club is also located in Tijuana. The Grand Hotel Tijuana and many luxurious restaurants {{have been developed}} along Bulevar Agua Caliente (often called [...] "El Bulevar" [...] by locals) and in the Zona Rio. Around the country club and Agua Caliente, many developments of wealthy and luxurious gated communities have filled the hillsides, most of which have views similar to Mount Soledad in San Diego or areas of Orange County. Tijuana's most prestigious entertainment center is the Tijuana Country Club golf club, but the Agua Caliente Racetrack {{would be the most}} notable that is open to the general public. Parque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a park located downtown with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns. All public libraries in Tijuana have Internet access; unfortunately, many of the available computers are not in service. Plus a library card is needed to use the computers. To get a library card one must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> issued id card plus one has to provide two special size photographs. This of course leaves much of the huge immigrant population of Tijuana out of luck, as many of them don't have identification cards.|$|E
