5|$|Haynes and {{his wife}} toured the American West after his retirement, indulging {{themselves}} while searching for a permanent residence. Some of the general's friends suggested Wichita Falls, the city of his last military post, but he left to assess the possibility of living in Taos, New Mexico, {{where he and his}} airman son hiked and explored ancient human settlements. Deciding against Taos, Haynes {{and his wife}} continued in their tour, soon finding Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to their liking. There, he bought two adjoining lots on North Carmelo Street with one existing house. Rather than accepting any of the offers he received promising an executive career in the aeronautics industry, <b>he</b> <b>relaxed</b> by hunting and fishing.|$|E
25|$|McCarl {{struggled}} to make GAO a competent and authoritative agency. In the first six years in office, he strictly controlled work start and stopping times, banned employees from discussing anything which was not work-related, and required employees to stay at their desks. <b>He</b> <b>relaxed</b> these rules significantly in 1927 after realizing they were harming staff morale.|$|E
25|$|The Allied {{victory in}} World War II {{pressured}} Moríñigo to liberalize his regime in 1946. Paraguay experienced {{a brief period}} of openness as <b>he</b> <b>relaxed</b> restrictions on free speech, allowed political exiles to return, and formed a coalition government with Liberals and febreristas. Moríñigo's intentions about stepping down were unclear, however, and he maintained a de facto alliance with Colorado Party hardliners and their right-wing Guión Rojo (Red Banner) paramilitary group led by Juan Natalico Gonzalez, which antagonized and terrorized the opposition. The result was a failed coup d'état in December 1946 and full-scale civil war erupted in March 1947. Led by the exiled dictator Rafael Franco, the revolutionaries were an unlikely coalition of febreristas, Liberals and Communists, united only in their desire to overthrow Moríñigo.|$|E

25|$|During the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln {{visited the}} Silver Spring mansion {{multiple}} times. During {{some of the}} visits <b>he</b> <b>relaxed</b> by playing town ball with Francis P. Blair's grandchildren. In 1864, Confederate Army General Jubal Early occupied Silver Spring prior to the Battle of Fort Stevens. After the engagement, fleeing Confederate soldiers razed Montgomery Blair's Falkland residence. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, the region began to develop into a town of decent size and importance. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's Metropolitan Branch opened on April 30, 1873, and ran from Washington, D.C. to Point of Rocks, Maryland, through Silver Spring. The first suburban development appeared in 1887 when Selina Wilson divided part of her farm on current-day Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and Brookeville Road into five- and ten-acre (20,000- and 40,000 m²) plots. In 1893, Francis Preston Blair Lee and his wife, Anne Brooke Lee, gave birth to E. Brooke Lee, who is known as the father of modern Silver Spring for his visionary attitude toward developing the region.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, <b>he</b> <b>relaxed</b> {{the boycott}} to allow other {{directors}} to direct his [...] "classic" [...] {{plays in the}} West End again, although his moratorium on the recent plays remained, and Absurd Person Singular was performed at the Garrick Theatre. The following year, he allowed The Norman Conquests to be revived at The Old Vic, which went {{to the length of}} re-staging the theatre in the round, as the play was originally intended.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the press}} noting {{parallels}} between the current series and England's win at the Oval in 1926, the deciding Test began amid great interest from the public. Hutton lost his fifth successive toss in the series but England had their most balanced attack of the series with the recall of Trueman, whom Hutton used in short bursts to take four wickets in Australia's first innings of 275. Surviving an early scare when a bouncer from Lindwall nearly knocked his cap onto his wickets, Hutton scored 82, but England only managed a narrow first innings lead. In their reply, Australia collapsed before the England spinners, for which Wisden gave the credit to Hutton, both for realising that the pitch favoured spin and barely using his pace bowlers, and for some of his tactical decisions in the innings. Although Hutton was run out early in England's pursuit of 132 to win the Ashes, the remaining batsmen took England to their first series win against Australia since 193233 and their first home series win since 1926. Hutton was widely acclaimed after the series, particularly for the good spirit which he and Hassett maintained. Norman Preston wrote in Wisden, [...] "To my mind not sufficient credit was given to Hutton last summer {{for his part in}} lifting England out of the long period of depression ... led his men conscientiously against Australia and, in addition, he shouldered the main responsibility of the batting. He scored nearly 100 runs more than any other player on either side ... His 145 [...] was easily the finest innings of the whole series. Moreover, Hutton then showed the enterprise we expected..." [...] In the series, he scored 443 runs at an average of 55.37. Hutton ended the summer with another century against the Australians at the Scarborough Festival. However, he had felt the strain of leading England that summer, with some at Yorkshire feeling that <b>he</b> <b>relaxed</b> too much to improve discipline at the county, despite his batting successes.|$|E

60|$|Not {{until he}} heard his wife moving about in the kitchen below did <b>he</b> <b>relax</b> the {{severity}} of his countenance. Then his expression changed to one of extreme anxiety, and he restlessly paced the room seeking for light. It came suddenly.|$|R
50|$|He draws {{much of his}} {{inspiration}} from the songs he {{heard on the radio}} growing up, and particularly the compositions of Tōru Takemitsu. He listens to the enka and kayōkyoku genres, as well as classical music, jazz, and more general American-style pop music. When <b>he</b> <b>relaxes,</b> <b>he</b> listens to African-American music from the 1960s and 1970s. Other inspirations include Gil Evans and John Williams.|$|R

50|$|Sen is {{the oldest}} of the three brothers. At first he pretends to be {{convinced}} that Akira is an animated scarecrow, but relents after he upsets her. Sen is loud and confident, but extremely lazy, leaving Haru to do all of the work around the house while <b>he</b> <b>relaxes.</b> <b>He</b> permanently wears dark glasses, which Haru has never seen him without, and his eyes remain a mystery, as Kai's attempt to paint a picture of what they look like fails due to his artistic ineptitude.|$|R
