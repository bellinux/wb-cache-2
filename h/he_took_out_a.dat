5|$|In 1836 Staunton came to London, where <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{subscription}} for William Greenwood Walker's Games at Chess, actually {{played in}} London, {{by the late}} Alexander McDonnell Esq. Staunton was apparently twenty-six {{when he took a}} serious interest in chess. He said that at that time the strongest players he saw in London, Saint-Amant and George Walker, could easily have given him rook odds. In 1838 he played many games with Captain Evans, inventor of the Evans Gambit, and also lost a match against the German chess writer Aaron Alexandre. He had improved sufficiently by 1840 to win a match against the German master H. W. Popert, a slow, cautious player with great defensive skill.|$|E

Friede had heard gossip about The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, {{would be the one}} prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they saw nothing wrong with the book.|$|E
