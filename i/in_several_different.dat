5|$|One of {{the points}} of {{interest}} of the English cathedrals {{is the way in}} which much of the history of medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building, which typically has important parts constructed <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>different</b> centuries with no attempt whatever to make the later work match or follow through on an earlier plan. For this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another. Only at one building, Salisbury Cathedral, is stylistic unity demonstrated.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>different</b> ways. One such way {{is if it}} moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure {{within a day or}} two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case with}} Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E
