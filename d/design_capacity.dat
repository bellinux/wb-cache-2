5|$|On opening, Melbourne Airport {{consisted}} of three connected terminals: International in the centre, with Ansett to the South and Trans Australia Airlines to the North. The <b>design</b> <b>capacity</b> of the airport was eight Boeing 707s {{at a rate of}} 500 passengers per hour, with minor expansion works completed in 1973 allowing Boeing 747s to serve the airport. By the late 1980s peak passenger flows at the airport had reached 900 per hour, causing major congestion.|$|E
5|$|The Port Authority then {{proposed}} an inter-terminal rail connector at JFK in 1987. The connector, proposed {{as part of}} a $3 billion renovation of the three airports, would originate from a new five-story, $500 million transportation center, connecting all the terminals to that transportation hub. The two-track system would be able to accommodate 2,000 riders an hour and would also connect to another new structure, a $450 million terminal proposed by Pan American World Airways. The connector and transport hub were proposed to alleviate traffic at the airport, since during the previous year, all three airports had experienced an unusually large increase in passenger counts and were now accommodating 1.5 to 2 times their <b>design</b> <b>capacity.</b> This construction was proposed in conjunction with the JFK Expressway, which was already under construction. Architect Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners created a design for the terminal and the proposed people mover system. However, the Port Authority withdrew its plans for the large transport hub in 1990 after opposition from the airlines there, which could not pay for the costly renovation.|$|E

25|$|Metropolitan water {{supplies}} {{were also a}} big issue, with dams supplying the city of Sydney falling to 30% of their <b>design</b> <b>capacity</b> during the campaign. Iemma's predecessor Bob Carr had committed Labor to building a desalination plant at Kurnell in Sydney's south.

A dam was also planned to boost {{water supplies}} on the state's Central Coast.|$|E
25|$|Wastewater treatment. According to an {{assessment}} report {{carried out in}} 2009, there are 43 sewerage systems in Kenya and waste water treatment plants in 15 towns (total population served: 900,000 inhabitants). The operation capacity of these wastewater treatment plants is estimated at around 16% of <b>design</b> <b>capacity.</b> The main reasons for this inefficiency are inadequate operation and maintenance and low connection rate to sewers. In Kenya, the estimated connection rate is 19% (12% according to another report).|$|E
25|$|By 1990, {{population}} growth and development on the Kitsap Peninsula caused vehicular traffic on the bridge to exceed its <b>design</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 1998, voters in several Washington counties approved an advisory measure to create a twin bridge to span the Tacoma Narrows. After a series of protests and court battles, construction began on the second span in 2002. The second span opened in July 2007 to carry eastbound traffic, and the 1950 bridge was reconfigured to carry westbound traffic.|$|E

40|$|As an {{alternative}} seismic <b>design</b> to the <b>capacity</b> <b>design</b> method, partial <b>capacity</b> <b>design</b> offers the more effective design procedure because columns and beams {{can be designed}} independently. Some columns are designed based on the ultimite load multiplied by a magnification factor to keep them remains in elastic codition, while the other columns are designed based on the ultimate load and are allowed to become plastic. Several researches show that partial <b>capacity</b> <b>design</b> applied well on regular structures. However, {{in the case of}} irregular structures partial <b>capacity</b> <b>design</b> failed to achieve the expected mechanism due to the occurence of some plastic hinges at the elastic columns. This study is aimed to compare and evaluate the performance of partial <b>capacity</b> <b>design</b> through two different design schemes. In the first scheme, the elastic columns are designed using the magnification factor as determined by the conventional partial <b>capacity</b> <b>design.</b> While in the second scheme, the elastic col...|$|R

25|$|Red Line trains run every 7 minutes {{off-peak}} (averaging 8.5 trains per hour), with {{a minimum}} headway of 3 minutes 45 seconds (16 trains per hour) during peak hours, with 44 trainsets in service. From 2010, when 51 trains were in service, the line had a peak-hour capacity of 11,675 passengers per hour in each direction. , the Red Line operates 60 trains (train registrations 5001-5045, 5065-5079) The theoretical maximum <b>design</b> <b>capacity</b> is 25,720 passengers per hour, which would require 106 trains.|$|E
25|$|As {{originally}} built, {{the bridge}} had six traffic lanes, and was 5,900 feet (1,798 m) long. The structure was {{built as a}} bascule bridge to allow large, ocean-going vessels access to the port facilities of Washington, D.C. Designed to handle 75,000 vehicles a day, the old Woodrow Wilson Bridge became extremely overcrowded by 1999, as it was handling 200,000 vehicles a day, more than 2.6 times the original <b>design</b> <b>capacity.</b> The bridge had serious maintenance problems, and underwent continuous patchwork maintenance beginning in the 1970s. It was completely re-decked from 1982 to 1983.|$|E

25|$|In December 2013, the Transport and Housing Bureau {{submitted}} detailed definitions to legislators regarding average train loading without {{specifying the}} figures: they were eventually released in February 2014 in a Legco subcommittee submission.

At 4pax/square metre, the critical link on the line ran at 99% capacity (34,600 pax/hr) in 2013, partly due to lengthy turnaround times at the present Hung Hom terminus which depressed realizable carrying capacity by 20%.|$|E
25|$|Postwar {{population}} growth {{led to the}} expansion of two buildings in the late 1950s. The first was the Presbyterian Church, which received a new Sunday School wing in 1955. Two years later the high school across the street followed. It had been in excess of its original <b>design</b> <b>capacity</b> since 1937. The new wing, completed in 1957, was used at first for the junior high school students (since then a separate building has been constructed for those students and the entire building is used by the high school). It was built of brick and intended to be architecturally sympathetic.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} role of {{an internal}} drainage board is to manage the water level within its district. The majority of lowland rivers and watercourses have been heavily modified by man or are totally artificial channels. All are engineered structures designed and constructed for the primary function of conveying surplus run-off to their outfall efficiently and safely, managing water levels to sustain a multitude of land functions. As with any engineered structure it must be maintained in order to function at or near its <b>design</b> <b>capacity.</b> Annual or bi-annual vegetation clearance and periodic de-silting (dredging) of these rivers and watercourses is therefore {{an essential component of}} the whole life cycle of these watercourses.|$|E
