50|$|In principle, spiral ropes are round strands as {{they have}} an {{assembly}} of layers of wires laid helically over a centre {{with at least one}} layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer. Spiral ropes can be dimensioned {{in such a way that}} they are non-rotating which means that under tension the rope torque is nearly zero.The open spiral rope consists only of round wires. The <b>half-locked</b> <b>coil</b> <b>rope</b> and the full-locked coil rope always have a centre made of round wires. The locked coil ropes have one or more outer layers of profile wires. They have the advantage that their construction prevents the penetration of dirt and water to a greater extent and it also protects them from loss of lubricant. In addition, they have one further very important advantage as the ends of a broken outer wire cannot leave the rope if it has the proper dimensions.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the fire {{behaviour}} of full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> under axial loading conditions is addressed. Since there are no standards for these structural elements, ISO 834 standard curve was considered as fire model for its severity. The analysis of full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> fire behaviour was carried out both from the experimental and numerical point of view, thus obtaining a complete description of rope responses. Two distinct full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> were tested and heat fluxes, temperature fields in the rope cross-section and fire endurance times were determined. An experimental campaign, aimed to establish how wires mechanical properties change with temperature, was also carried out. Subsequently, a parametric Finite Element model (FE) able to predict the rope response, undergoing to the experimental thermal and mechanical loads, was implemented, thus obtaining the time evolution of damage and the failure mechanisms for the rope. The numerical model was then validated by comparing the predicted fire endurance times with those obtained from the experimental tests {{and a very good}} agreement was found. A method for determining the fire endurance times of full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> by using the numerical model, once the material properties and loading conditions are established, was thus define...|$|R

50|$|The {{lightweight}} cable roof is {{designed as a}} classic looped cable roof containing one compression and one tension ring. While {{the majority of the}} roof is covered with a membrane, the inner edge has a glass roof. The roof of Vodafone Park is composed of 260 tons of 246 rope assemblies. The inner tension ring, which is made of 8 Ø110 mm full locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> with a single length of nearly 200 meters, is connected to the outer compression ring by radial cables that consist of full locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> with Ø110, Ø85, Ø65 and Ø45 mm.|$|R

50|$|The shield is {{supported}} by a serpent and a <b>coiled</b> <b>rope.</b> The serpent, in blue with white and gold markings, represents the Rainbow Serpent, a creator-being said to have formed the landscape in the Dreamtime as it travelled through the country. Its markings are based on those used by the Eora people, who lived in the area on which Sydney was founded. The rope continues the maritime imagery, and symbolises the diverse origins of the people of Sydney. The rope and serpent are intertwined, representing cultural harmony.|$|R
60|$|Creech leaned down, {{swinging}} the <b>coiled</b> <b>rope.</b> He {{meant to do}} more than lash her with it. Lucy's hands flashed up, closed tight in his long hair.

There was an instant in which Lucy felt herself swung and torn; she saw everything as a whirling blur; she felt an agony in her wrists at which Creech was clawing. When he broke her hold there were handfuls of hair in Lucy's fists.|$|R
