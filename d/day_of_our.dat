John Paul I met with Sister Lúcia on July 11, 1977, {{while he was still}} Cardinal Patriarch of Venice. He reported being deeply moved by the experience and vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia as Lucia said Mary had asked. John Paul II was particularly attached to Fátima and credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Fátima in May 1981.

500|$|During {{her time}} in Egypt, Manning became a {{contributor}} to two Middle East-based literary magazines, [...] "Desert Poets" [...] and [...] "Personal Landscapes", founded by Bernard Spencer, Lawrence Durrell, and Robin Fedden. The latter sought to explore the [...] "personal landscapes" [...] of writers experiencing exile during the war. The founders, like Manning, maintained a strong attachment to Greece rather than an artistic and intellectual engagement with Egypt. In remembering the departure from Greece, Manning wrote [...] "We faced the sea / Knowing until the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> return we would be / Exiles from a country not our own." [...] During their time in Egypt and Palestine, Manning and her husband maintained close links with refugee Greek writers, including translating and editing the work of George Seferis and Elie Papadimitriou. Manning described her impressions of the Cairo poetry scene in [...] "Poets in Exile" [...] in Cyril Connolly's magazine Horizon. She defended the writers from the claim of a London reviewer that they were [...] "out of touch", suggesting that their work was strengthened by their access to other cultures, languages and writers. Her review was much critiqued by those featured, including Durrell who objected to Spencer's poetry being praised at his expense.|$|E
2500|$|The Yuledays are {{the days}} that signify {{the end of an}} old year and the {{beginning}} of a new one, so 2 Yule is the first day of the year. The Lithedays are the three days in the middle of the year, 1 Lithe, Mid-year's Day, and 2 Lithe. In leap years (every fourth year except centennial years) a day is added after Mid-year's Day called Overlithe. [...] All these days are placed outside of any month. These days are primarily holidays and feast days. Mid-year's Day is meant to correspond to the summer solstice, which Tolkien describes as being 10 days earlier than the middle <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> year.

2500|$|A [...] or succah (Ashkenazic Hebrew and English , Sephardic Hebrew , , plural, [...] sukkoth, often {{translated}} as [...] "booth") {{is a temporary}} hut constructed for use during the week-long Jewish festival of Sukkot. It is topped with branches and often well decorated with autumnal, harvest or Judaic themes. [...] The Book of Vayikra (Leviticus) describes it as a symbolic wilderness shelter, commemorating the time God provided for the Israelites in the wilderness they inhabited after they were freed from slavery in Egypt. [...] It is common for Jews to eat, sleep and otherwise spend time in the sukkah. In Judaism, Sukkot is considered a joyous occasion and is referred to in Hebrew as Yom Simchateinu (the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> rejoicing) or Z'man Simchateinu (the time of our rejoicing), and the sukkah itself symbolizes the frailty and transience of life and its dependence on God.|$|E
