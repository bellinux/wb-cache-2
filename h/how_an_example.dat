40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, digital {{libraries}} are inherently dispersed over several peers of a steadily increasing network. Dedicated peers may provide specialized, computationally expensive {{services such as}} image similarity search. Usually, the peers of such a network are uncoordinated {{in the sense that}} their content and services are not linked together. Nevertheless, users expect to transparently access and modify all the (multimedia) content anytime from anywhere not only in an efficient and effective but also consistent way. To match these demands, future {{digital libraries}} require an infrastructure that combines various information technologies like (mobile) databases, service-oriented architectures, peer-to-peer and grid computing. In this paper, we sketch such an infrastructure and illustrate <b>how</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> digital library application can work atop it. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel use of spectral clustering algorithms to support {{cases where the}} entries in the affinity matrix are costly to compute.

The method is well suited to the problem of appearance-based, on-line topological mapping for mobile robots. In this problem domain, we show that we can reduce environment-dependent parameters of the clustering algorithm to just a single, intuitive parameter. Experimental results in large outdoor and indoor environments show that we can close loops correctly by computing {{only a fraction of the}} entries in the affinity matrix.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{software}} technology for on-line performance analysis and visualization of complex parallel and distributed systems. Often heterogeneous, these systems need capabilities for flexible integration and configuration of performance analysis and visualization. Our technology {{is based on}} an object-oriented framework for rapid prototyping and development of distributable visual objects. The visual objects consist of two levels, a platform/device-specific low level, and an analysis- and visualization-specific high level. We have developed a very high-level, markup language, called VOML, and a compiler for component-based development of high-level visual objects. The VOML is based on a software architecture for on-line event processing and performance visualization called EPIRA. The technology lends itself to constructing high-level visual objects from globally distributed component definitions. We present details of the technology and tools used, and show <b>how</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> visual object can be rapidly prototyped from several reusable components. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} a class of type IIA vacua {{recently}} found within the N= 4 effective approach corresponds to compactification on Ads_ 4 × S^ 3 × S^ 3 /Z_ 2 ^ 3. The results obtained using the effective method completely match the general ten-dimensional analysis {{for the existence of}} N= 1 warped compactifications on Ads_ 4 × M_ 6. In particular, we verify that the internal metric is nearly-Kahler and that for specific values of the parameters the Bianchi identity of the RR 2 -form is fulfilled without sources. For another range of parameters, including the massless case, the Bianchi identity is satisfied when D 6 -branes are introduced. Solving the tadpole cancellation conditions in D= 4 we are able to find examples of appropriate sets of branes.

40|$|In “The Order,” Matthew Barney {{transforms}} the Guggenheim Museum {{into a space}} reminding of a computer game or sports-arena. The protagonist struggles his way through different ‘levels’ and {{at the heart of}} the setting, he is confronted with the para-athlete Aimee Mullins, a cyborg embodying the Deleuzian notion of the ani/omalous. To complete his final task, the protagonist kills the creature. The question arises, why the ani/omalous has to be violently eliminated. In this respect, it is important to know that the DVD offers two viewing options: a film version structured according to a fixed narrative order and an interactive version where one can switch between the levels simultaneously. Thus, Barney’s film also raises the question of the aesthetic order at work and invites to consider how what is shown relates to the way in which it is shown. Keywords: Matthew Barney, becoming ani/omalous, Deleuze & Guattari, violence in artMatthew Barney’s hybrid monumental aesthetic work the Cremaster Cycle, consisting of film material, but also integrating drawings, sculpture, photography and performance elements can as such be considered as a multiplicity in Gilles Deleuze’s and Félix Guattari’s terms. In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari argue against Art (with a capital A) as a nominal concept and in favour of “the possibility of a simultaneous usage of the various arts within a determinable multiplicity” (331). That Barney’s work is indebted to Deleuze’s and Guattari’s philosophy seems unquestionable. What interests me in this paper is the relation between Deleuze’s and Guattari’s thinking and Barney’s own theoretical conceptions of art as well as <b>how</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of Barney’s artistic work locates itself against the background of these frameworks. To do so, I want to concentrate on a so-called “choric interlude” in Cremaster 3 titled “The Order,” “which rehearses the initiation rites of the Masonic fraternity through allegorical representations of the five-part Cremaster cycle” (Barney 2004, par 5), and thus constitutes a microcosm of Barney’s film project (Spector 54). Comprising a self-contained narrative, the sequence is also available independently on DVD. In the context of the Cremaster Cycle, it is located almost at the very end – that Cremaster 3 is the last part of the five films already shows that a linear sequence, a conventional order of numbers is subverted. Rather than following the numerical order from 1 to 5, the Cremaster Cycle is organized rhizomatically, in the very words of Deleuze and Guattari generating “an acentered, non-hierarchical, non-signifying system without […] an organizing memory […] defined solely by a circulation of states” (23) ...|$|E
