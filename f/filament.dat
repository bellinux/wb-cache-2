5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin <b>filament</b> pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin <b>filament</b> in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the <b>filament</b> can be correlated with <b>filament</b> temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike <b>filament.</b> These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} <b>filament</b> depend on the competing rates of <b>filament</b> addition and removal.|$|E

The subunits Arp2 & Arp3 closely resemble monomeric actin allowing for a thermodynamically stable actin-like dimer. p41 has been proposed to interact with nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) because it is only known to have minor contacts with the mother <b>filament</b> {{and there is a}} major loss of nucleation efficiency in the absence of p41. p34 and p20 dimerize to form a structural backbone that mediates the interaction with the mother <b>filament.</b> p21 forms a bridge between Arp3 and the mother <b>filament,</b> increasing nucleation efficiency. p16 tethers Arp2 {{to the rest of the}} complex.|$|E

5|$|Further {{purification}} {{is done by}} {{a chemical}} transport reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer. In a closed vessel, the metal reacts with iodine at temperatures above 500°C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a tungsten <b>filament</b> of nearly 2000°C the reverse reaction happens and the iodine and metal are set free.

50|$|Keratin <b>filaments</b> are {{intermediate}} <b>filaments.</b> Like all intermediate <b>filaments,</b> keratin proteins form filamentous polymers in {{a series}} of assembly steps beginning with dimerization; dimers assemble into tetramers and octamers and eventually, if the current hypothesis holds, into unit-length-filaments (ULF) capable of annealing end-to-end into long <b>filaments.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin <b>filament.</b> The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated <b>filament</b> ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin <b>filament.</b>|$|E

We perform different investigations on {{the different types of}} <b>filaments</b> to reveal their electrical properties and their nature. By measuring the current-voltage characteristics we examine the electric properties of the <b>filaments.</b> Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy investigations were performed on the <b>filaments</b> to find out their nature.

5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of <b>filament</b> lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot <b>filament</b> involved.|$|E

40|$|Intermediate-sized (100. /~) <b>filaments</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} in many cell types in vivo (1, 4, 24, 27) and in vitro (2, 12, 17, 25).

Intermediate-sized <b>filaments</b> can be induced by treatment of cells with the drugs colchicine and Colcemid (5, 12, 17, 28).

40|$|Organelle {{movement}} {{is essential for}} proper function of living cells. In plants, these movements generally depend on actin <b>filaments,</b> but the underlying mechanism is unknown.

40|$|We measured, by {{fluorescence}} correlation spectroscopy, {{the motion}} of actin <b>filaments</b> in solution during hydrolysis of ATP by acto-heavy meromyosin (acto-HMM). The method relies {{on the fact that}} the intensity of fluorescence fluctuates as fluorescently labeled actin <b>filaments</b> enter and leave a small sample volume. The rapidity of these number fluctuations is characterized by the autocorrelation function, which decays to 0 in time that is related to the average velocity of translation of <b>filaments.</b> The time of decay of the autocorrelation function of bare actin <b>filaments</b> in solution was 10. 59 +/- 0. 85 s. Strongly bound (rigor) heads slowed down the diffusion. Direct observation of <b>filaments</b> under an optical microscope showed that addition of HMM did not change the average length or flexibility of actin <b>filaments,</b> suggesting that the decrease in diffusion was not due to a HMM-induced change in the shape of <b>filaments.</b> Rather, slowing down of translational motion was caused by an increase in the volume of the diffusing complex. Surprisingly, the addition of ATP to acto-HMM accelerated {{the motion of}} actin <b>filaments.</b> The acceleration was the greatest at the low molar ratios of HMM:actin. Direct observation of <b>filaments</b> under an optical microscope showed that in the presence of ATP the average length of <b>filaments</b> did not change and that the <b>filaments</b> became stiffer, suggesting that acceleration of diffusion was not due to an ATP-induced increase in flexibility of <b>filaments.</b> These results show that some of the energy of splitting of ATP is impaired to actin <b>filaments</b> and suggest that 0. 06 +/- 0. 02 of HMM interferes with the diffusion of actin <b>filaments</b> during hydrolysis of ATP...|$|R
