5|$|While {{conventional}} English sonnet form {{described by}} Gascoigne {{is seen in}} Sonnet 86, the Petrarchan sonnet form, which requires a pause between the first eight lines and the last six lines is also evident. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> eight Shakespeare uses a period to bring the sonnet to a stop, changing the sonnet's direction by moving away from rhetorical questions to a more decisive tone within the sestet, which seems to answer the distress of the octave.|$|E
25|$|This {{is one of}} {{the texts}} Metoro Tau‘a Ure 'read' for Jaussen. However, he read the verso upside down, {{included}} the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 1 as part of line 2 and read it backwards, from right to left.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{direction}} of reading has been determined, {{the point where the}} text starts has not. Philippi's line numbers were arbitrary, but kept by Barthel. The main asymmetry is that line 12 (Fischer's line 1) is 90cm long, running three quarters the length of the Staff. The space occupied by lines 12 and 13 is 30mm wide at the thick end of the staff (at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 12 and beginning of line 13), but only 17mm wide at the tapered end (at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 13). Past the cut-off point (the beginning) of line 12, the baseline of line 13 shifts upward, and the glyphs widen to fill in the gap. From that point on, 13 is parallel with line 11 rather than antiparallel as is normally the case for adjacent lines.|$|E

Minor service at Palo Alto, right over the border from San Mateo County was also planned originally. However, San Mateo County also opted out, leaving Fremont the closest <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line.</b> In 2000, Santa Clara County voters approved a 30-year-long half cent sales tax increase to fund a BART extension to San Jose.|$|E
25|$|Netascii is a {{modified}} form of ASCII, defined in RFC 764. It {{consists of an}} 8-bit extension of the 7-bit ASCII character space from 0x20 to 0x7F (the printable characters and the space) and eight of the control characters. The allowed control characters include the null (0x00), the line feed (LF, 0x0A), and the carriage return (CR, 0x0D). Netascii also requires that the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> marker on a host be translated to the character pair CR LF for transmission, and that any CR must be followed by either a LF or the null.|$|E
500|$|The Sognsvann Line (...) is a {{rapid transit}} {{line on the}} Oslo Metro of Norway. It {{branches}} from the Common Tunnel at Majorstuen and runs [...] to Sognsvann. After Ullevål stadion, the Ring Line branches off. The Sognsvann Line serves the northwestern and northern neighborhoods of Oslo, mostly within the borough of Nordre Aker. The line is owned and maintained by Kollektivtransportproduksjon and has nine stations. The western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 5 serves the entire line. Line 4 and the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 5 serve {{the southern part of}} the line up to Ullevål stadion before branching off and continuing along the Ring Line. This gives an average five-minute headway on the southern part and an average fifteen-minute headway on the northern part of the line.|$|E

In the resulting fight, Flynn rescues his son, but Quorra is injured and Zuse gains possession of Flynn's disc. Zuse attempts to bargain with Clu for the disc, but Clu simply takes the disc and destroys the club along with Zuse.

2500|$|Fischer {{takes the}} short line 12 {{to be the}} {{beginning}} of the text, reasoning {{that it would have been}} easier to indent the first line than to estimate how long the last line would be when fitting it in, and that the large glyphs in line 13 past the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 12 were written that way to fill in the gap. However, he does note that there are remnants of pre-inscription tracings that would have enabled such an estimate. Horley (2011) makes a case that 12 was the last line: That the text starts at line 11, wraps around (in descending order) to 13, and that 12 was fit into the gap between the slightly skew lines 11 and 13. The way lines 12 and 13 squeeze together (the glyphs are 12–14mm high at the thick end of the staff, but only 8–10mm high at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 12 where 13 takes over) is consistent with these being the last lines engraved.|$|E

Fischer notes that the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> Na1 is squeezed into {{the end of the}} tablet, and believes that it must therefore {{be the end of the}} inscription, with the likely beginning being [...] line Nb5—the opposite of Barthel's presentation. However, Pozdniakov believes that text N is paraphrased in text Ev, which would establish Barthel's sides a and b as recto and verso. The basic correspondences are: ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, line 3 was {{extended}} some [...] from Sillon de Bretagne to the pre-existing bus depot of Marcel Paul, which was converted to also accommodate trams.

In October 2012, a new [...] branch was created at the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 1, running to a terminus at Ranzay, {{as part of the}} first phase of the project to make a connection between lines 1 and 2.

Samuel Prideaux Tregelles found that the [...] "letters are in general an imitation of those used before the introduction of compressed uncials; but they do not belong to the age when full and round writing was customary or natural, so that the stiffness and want of ease is manifest".|$|E
2500|$|The first quatrain {{introduces}} {{the reader to}} the author's general argument of mankind's endeavors. In the author's opinion, earthly ventures such as carrying the [...] "canopy", {{which would have been}} held above the head of a celebrity during a ceremony, or [...] "great bases" [...] to mean massive foundations, are meaningless because time and [...] "ruining" [...] destroy them. Booth also notes the author's play on words in lines 3-4. By placing eternity at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 3 and saying, [...] "proves more short", Shakespeare is highlighting the lack of timelessness in such endeavors. As aforementioned, this is a common theme of Shakespeare's sonnets and this quatrain of Sonnet 125 reiterates the motif of mortality.|$|E
2500|$|His work A Dictionary of the Otchipwe Language, {{explained}} in English {{is still considered}} the best reference regarding the Ojibwe vocabulary of western Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northern Wisconsin. [...] In his dictionary, grammar books and prayer book, the sound representations of Ojibwe are shown in the table below. [...] There has also been discussion regarding if Baraga represented nasal. [...] In his earlier editions of the dictionary, circumflex accents were used to indicate nasals (-nh / -ny-) but in his later editions, they appear to instead either represent long vowels or stressed vowels, believed to be changed by the editor of his dictionary. Baraga represented pronominal prefixes separate from the word, but did indicate preverbs attached with a hyphen to the main word; <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> word breaks not at the preverb hyphen was written with a hyphen {{at the end of}} the line, then another hyphen at the beginning of the next line.|$|E
