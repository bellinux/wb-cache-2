5|$|After a naval career lasting {{more than}} forty years, in 1912 he was {{appointed}} First Sea Lord, the professional head of the British naval service. With World War I looming, he took steps to ready the British fleet for combat, but his background as a German prince <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> retirement once the war began, when anti-German sentiment was running high. He changed his name and relinquished his German titles, {{at the behest of}} King George V, in 1917.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant General Sir Edwin Alfred Hervey Alderson, KCB (8 April 1859 – 14 December 1927) was {{a senior}} British Army officer who served in several campaigns {{of the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. During the First World War he was placed in command of the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the first half of the war but made enemies amongst the Canadian {{political}} and military elite and suffered disastrous casualties during operations in 1915/16 which <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> sidelining and eventual retirement from service.|$|E
5|$|After a {{slow start}} to the {{historic}} campaign, Loxton struck form midway through the English summer and <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> way into the team {{for the last three}} Tests. He played a prominent role in the Fourth Test, scoring an aggressive and counterattacking 93 that helped Australia pry the initiative from England; the tourists eventually won the match. In 1949–50, Loxton cemented his position in the national team, playing in all five Tests in South Africa and scoring his only century at international level. He remained a regular member of the Test team until a form slump during the 1950–51 home season; he was dropped after three Tests against England and never played for Australia again. Loxton continued to play for Victoria in domestic competition until retiring {{at the end of the}} 1957–58 season.|$|E
5|$|Having {{personal}} experience with worker safety concerns, Lynch found himself with aspirations beyond his trade. When a 1979 blizzard <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> project in Wisconsin to shut down, he spent the extra time taking courses at the University of Wisconsin. Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston. In the early 1980s Lynch {{was elected to the}} executive board of the Iron Workers Local 7 union. At age 30 he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local's history. During this time he spent his nights and weekends attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology, from which he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in construction management in 1988.|$|E

5|$|He {{kept his}} place, but in November, an injury {{sustained}} against Mallorca {{was diagnosed as}} a bruised kidney and fractured vertebrae, which kept him out for some weeks, during which time Zé Castro <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> way into consideration as a starter. In January 2007, Pablo marked his 100th game for the club with a rare goal to earn a draw with Racing Santander, and completed the season with 24 league games. He helped the club qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup, and retained a regular spot in the starting eleven as Atlético finished fourth {{in the league and}} qualified for the Champions League, but mistakes in the Madrid derby in January 2008 led to both Real's goals and rekindled the fans' hostility.|$|E
5|$|In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, {{where he}} died; he was succeeded as ANCYL {{president}} {{by the more}} moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary. Mandela disagreed with Mda's approach, and in December 1947 supported an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL, considering their ideology un-African. In 1947, Mandela {{was elected to the}} executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe. When Ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the committee by co-operating with Indians and communists, Mandela {{was one of those who}} <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> resignation.|$|E
5|$|Inman's health had {{suffered}} during his long career at sea, {{and although he}} returned to sea in December 1805 aboard Triumph during the Atlantic campaign of 1806 {{as part of the}} squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan, his ill-health <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> replacement by Sir Thomas Hardy in May. Returning to his family ashore, Inman was initially given command of the sea fencibles at King's Lynn before he was made Admiralty commissioner at Madras by Lord Mulgrave in 1809. The journey to India broke his health completely and he died on 15 July 1809, just ten days after arriving in Madras.|$|E

5|$|Nonnebakken, a {{hill in the}} Odense area, is {{the site}} of one of Denmark's six former Viking ring castles, built during the reign of Sweyn Forkbeard, who had <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> father Harold Bluetooth to leave the country and seek refuge by the Jomsvikings in Wollin (modern Poland) in around 975. The fort {{provided}} its occupier the command of the Odense River passing next to the hill. The archaeological remains of the fort were heavily damaged when a building for the Odd Fellow lodge was constructed on the site during the late nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|O'Leary {{was born}} in 1890, one of four {{children}} of Daniel and Margaret O'Leary, who owned a farm at Inchigeela, near Macroom in County Cork, Ireland. Daniel O'Leary was a fervent Irish nationalist and keen sportsman who participated in competitive weightlifting and football. Aged 16 and unwilling {{to continue to work}} on his parent's land, Michael O'Leary joined the Royal Navy, serving at the shore establishment HMS Vivid at Devonport for several years until rheumatism in his knees <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> departure from the service. Within a few months however, O'Leary had again tired of the farm and joined the Irish Guards regiment of the British Army.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August, the RAN {{was placed}} under Admiralty control. Orders for RAN {{warships}} were prepared {{over the next}} few days: Australia was assigned to the concentration of British naval power on the China Station, but was allowed to seek out and destroy any armoured warships (particularly those of the German East Asia Squadron) in the Australian Station before doing so. Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, was aware of Australias presence in the region and her superiority to his entire force; the German admiral's plan was to harass British shipping and colonies in the Pacific until the presence of Australia and the China Squadron <b>forced</b> <b>his</b> fleet to relocate to other seas.|$|E
