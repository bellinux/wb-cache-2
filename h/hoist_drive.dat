40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a method of}} controlling a slip-ring induction motor so as to provide characteristics suitable for <b>hoist</b> <b>drive</b> applications. The primary of the machine was supplied from a three-phase voltage regulator which in addition to producing a motoring torque can also provide plug braking by phase reversal and dynamic braking by d. c. injection. The <b>hoist</b> <b>drive</b> characteristics are of a constant torque nature and these were obtained by the control of a variable duty cycle forced commutated thyristor chopper in the secondary circuit of the motor. The operation of the voltage regulator has been examined for a load consisting of a delta wound induction motor. A simple model of the regulator has been developed from which speed-torque characteristics have been determined. Analysis of {{the operation of the}} motor and thyristor chopper was used to determine the appropriate relationship between duty cycle and speed necessary to produce a constant torque characteristic. This relationship was realized by a function generator which was used to control the thyristor chopper. Closed loop control of motor speed by the voltage regulator combined with open loop operation of the thyristor chopper as a function of speed gave the required constant torque characteristic. Logic circuits were incorporated in the design to allow automatic selection of the motoring and braking modes. The four-quadrant controller has been designed and successfully operated throughout the required speed range. The operation of the controller has been considered from both steady state and dynamic aspects...|$|E
40|$|Electric mining shovels {{are used}} in open pit mining. Their {{efficiency}} of operation directly effects mine productivity and profitability. Shovel technologies such as trajectory following are a first step towards autonomous operation and have perceived cost saving benefits through improved efficiency and collision avoidance strategies. The development of such technologies requires rigorous testing which carries {{a high risk of}} lost production time and the potential for damaging machinery. The cost of lost production, and the remote location and nature of the environments in which electric mining shovels operate, make on site testing expensive and often infeasible. This thesis develops and validates a Simulink model of a P&H-class electric mining shovel. The model provides a framework for developing and testing shovel technologies. Its usefulness is shown in simulations which test model predictive control (MPC) as a control strategy for point-to-point motion control of each of the three freedoms of a P&H-class electric mining shovel. The thesis first presents a Simulink model describing the rigid body dynamics of a P&H-class mining shovel. The model is based on work presented by Wauge [1] and relates torques applied by the three actuating drives to motions of the shovel dipper. The material of this thesis differs from that of Wauge [1] in two respects; (i) the model is presented from a systems (input/output) perspective for implementation in Simulink, and (ii) explicit expressions for various terms are given. The rigid body dynamics model is extended to include models of the DC motors, power electronics and the control loops. The input to the extended shovel model is a joystick position and outputs are drive position, speed, armature current, armature voltage, and field current. The model is validated against data collected from a P&H 2100 BLE mining shovel and the predicted shovel response is shown to be in close agreement with measured values. MPC uses fit-for-purpose models to predict future plant behavior, from which a set of control inputs is computed that commands the plant to a desired output. Calculating good control inputs relies heavily on the ability to accurately predict future plant behavior. This thesis develops linear state space prediction models for each of the shovel’s three freedoms. The prediction models are verified against data collected from a P&H 2100 BLE mining shovel and shown to provide “accurate enough predictions” for the purpose of predicting future plant behavior. A typical MPC optimization problem is formulated that uses the linear state space prediction models to optimize a cost function and command time-optimal point-topoint motion of each of the shovels three freedoms. Simulations which use the shovel model as a proxy for a real machine show that MPC is capable of commanding timeoptimal point-to-point motion control for the swing and crowd drives. <b>Hoist</b> <b>drive</b> non-linearities cause predictions to become inaccurate and the <b>hoist</b> <b>drive</b> is shown to become unstable when controlled using MPC...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Host {{number of}} {{publications}} in which special attention {{was given to}} the behavior of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>drives</b> in abnormal modes was found. The effect of the failure of the main power supply on the electrical and mechanical parts of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>drive</b> when the motor is operating in the regenerative braking mode was not enough studied. Approach: In this study, the effect of the failure of the main power supply on the electrical and mechanical parts of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>drive</b> when the motor was operating in the regenerative braking mode and give recommendations and solutions to minimize the negative consequences of that abnormal mode. A special comprehensive mathematical mode was developed. The model comprised different submodels that describe the real operation of the power supply, four-quadrant thyristor AC/DC dual converter, firing system, protective devices and mechanism including the elastic elements like ropes and long shafts. This comprehensive model was used to study the behavior of the drive and choose the optimum protective device against the corresponding abnormal mode. Results: The failure of the supplying voltage of the dc <b>hoisting</b> <b>drive</b> at power regeneration leads to {{a significant increase in the}} motor armature current due to the formed closed loop comprising the armature winding, pair of thyristors and the secondary coil of the supplying transformer, in this mode the converter counter EMF will disappear. The protective device should protect the converter and the motor against such abnormal mode. The produced inrush current in role generates a huge motor torque that result in possible ropes and crane boom deformation, thus the mechanism design should include such possible abnormal mode. Conclusion: These results were implemented in the design of a special fast-responding circuit breaker which guarantees the exclusion of the armature current increase in the mentioned mode...|$|R
40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering for the MScDeveloping a faithful and interactive model for the DC <b>Hoist</b> <b>Drive</b> System of the Container Cranes at Port of Colombo is the base of this research work. Hoisting a maximum load of 45. 5 ton, including the container weight under the spreader of the container crane at 45 meters per minute is the base requirement of the system. But lighter loads can be hoisted at higher speeds than the base speed utilizing the rated capacity of the system. A closed loop DC drive system, being arranged in Ward-Leonard Speed Control method is providing acceleration torque to all loads to speed up on a fixed ramp increasing the motor armature voltage. While the load is on acceleration the system calculates the load torque and sets the load dependent final speed limit beyond the base speed if possible. Motor field has to be weakened to raise the rotor speed beyond the base speed. // A model is developed to simulate complete closed loop system as in actual operations using MATLAB-SEMULINK software with all available data. The model output matches almost perfectly with steady state portions of the actual operational cycle but deviates from the actual measurements at transient states. // The Model is then enhanced to behave as actual operational cycle and to reflect output as much as closer to the field measurements modifying the dynamic function blocks. For some blocks it only needed adding delay components but load torque and motor excitation control function blocks have to be modified with more complex system...|$|E

50|$|The {{steam engine}} {{was located in}} a brick {{building}} built against the north-east side of the windmill, and drove two pairs of millstones, a centrifugal governor, and a sack <b>hoist.</b> The steam <b>driven</b> millstones were located on 2 levels and driven by a 2+1/2 in square shaft of 50 ft length, those on the upper floor being driven by a cast-iron bevel wheel with wooden cog inserts. It was also able to work various dressing machines in the windmill, but not the wind driven stones. There is some difference over the exact type of engine, it being variously described as a grasshopper engine built by Napiers, and a Cornish boiler by Davey Paxman & Co. Both sources agree that the engine had formerly been used in a Thames steamboat. The steam engine itself was removed in 1940 and taken to South West Essex Technical College in Walthamstow, while the building and remaining contents were removed in 1960 {{with two of the}} millstones remaining at the windmill entrance.|$|R
50|$|From 1720 the Maaßen Hoisting Shaft (Maaßener Treibschacht) and Maaßen Water Shaft (Maaßener Kunstschacht) of the Lautenthals Glück Pit {{were used}} to hoist ore and surplus water to the surface. At that time, both shafts were {{so-called}} winzes and did not open at the surface. From 1718, the hoisting shaft had a winding engine. From 1842 to 1844 the <b>hoisting</b> shaft was <b>driven</b> to the surface. In the subsequent period, the headframe and other above-ground facilities were added. The reversible water wheel lay 29 metres down the shaft and around 70 metres to the north. It was powered by water from the Oberer Richtschachter Graben.

5000|$|Chegworth mill is {{probably}} not the Domesday mill recorded at Ulcombe. The first reference to Chegworth occurs in 1200. The first definite reference to this mill was in 1317, when the mill was held by John de Cheggeworth. John de Chageworth was recorded at the mill in 1324. The mill was in the ownership of Sir Cheney Culpeper in 1657. It was then known as the Lower Mill. The previous owners were Thomas Hatche and Richard Austen, who had recently sold the mill at that date. John Pecke was the miller. Seventeenth century millers in Ulcombe include Willia Pettit (1612), Percival Austen (1669), Thomas Sylliborne (1673) and John Baker (1682). It is not known which mill each was at, there being two watermills and a windmill in Ulcombe during this period. William Taylor was the miller in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1702, John Feverstone was the miller. The mill was known as Pendmill in 1745 when the miller was recorded as John Feverstour the Elder. John Feverstone the older was the miller in 1766, when the lease was renewed. Richard Tilbe being the owner at this time. Thomas Willett leased the mill in 1792 and in 1800 Chegworth Mill, otherwise Pendmill was mortgaged by Willett. The mill was recorded as Checqworth Mill on the 1801 Ordnance Survey map. John Taylor was the miller in 1847, followed by G Craddock in 1852, J Gilbert, William and Thomas Taylor in 1854, Mrs M Cradduck, J Gilbert and Thomas Taylor 1855 - 1861, Charles Wicks in 1874, Alfred Wick 1895 - 1907, Frederick James Potter 1930 - 1934. The last miller was Ted Uren, who started at the mill in 1961, and took over from Harold Potter. The mill was house converted c.1990.The present mill was a corn mill and worked until the late 1960s. It has an overshot waterwheel of 10 ft diameter and 7 ft wide, made by Weeks of Maidstone. The axle is cast iron and 7+1/2 in square. The pit wheel is cast iron with 96 lignum vitae cogs.
