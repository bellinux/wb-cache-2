5|$|The agency's Small Investment Program aims {{to promote}} FDI into {{specifically}} small and medium enterprises. The program offers standard MIGA coverage types except {{it does not}} cover breaches of contract. Under the program, small and medium enterprises may take advantage of discounted insurance premiums and no application fees, which are not available to larger investors. To qualify an investment for the Small Investment Program, MIGA defines small and medium enterprise projects as having 300 or fewer employees, total assets not to exceed $15million and annual revenues not to exceed $15million. MIGA limits the request amount for the <b>investment</b> <b>guarantee</b> to $10million, and will guarantee only up to 10years with a possible 5-year extension.|$|E
5|$|In September 1985, the Board of Governors of the World Bank {{endorsed}} the Convention establishing the Multilateral <b>Investment</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Agency. MIGA was established and became operational on April 12, 1988 {{under the leadership}} of then-Executive Vice President Yoshio Terasawa, becoming the fifth member institution of the World Bank Group. MIGA initially had $1 billion ($1.94 billion in 2012 dollars) in capital and 29 member states. All members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) were eligible to become members of the agency. MIGA was established as an effort to complement existing sources of non-commercial risk insurance for investments in developing countries, and thereby improve investor confidence. The agency's mandate to be apolitical has been said to be an advantage over private and national risk insurance markets. By serving as a multilateral guarantor, the agency reduces the likelihood of confrontations among the investor's country and the host country.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 MIGA paid {{its first}} {{insurance}} claim since the agency's founding. In 2001 MIGA's issuance of new investment guarantees grew to $2billion. The agency launched its Small Investment Program in 2005 {{in an effort}} to promote investment among small and medium enterprises. That same year, MIGA set up its Afghanistan <b>Investment</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Facility {{in an effort to}} promote FDI into Afghanistan. In 2007 MIGA issued investment guarantees for a Djibouti port, marking its first support in the form of Islamic finance. The agency also launched PRI-Center.com (now no longer active) as a portal for information on political risk management and investment insurance, which also contained its FDI information services. In 2009, the Board of Directors enacted changes to MIGA's operating procedures and authorized coverage for default of sovereign financial obligations. The agency also launched an annual publication titled World Investment and Political Risk which reports on trends in worldwide investment and corporate perceptions of prospects and risk, as well as shifts in the political risk insurance industry.|$|E
40|$|The {{variable}} annuity market in Japan is still young, but growing rapidly. Most variable annuities in Japan are sold {{with one or}} more <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees,</b> such as a Guaranteed Minimum Maturity Benefit (GMMB), which guarantees that the ultimate annuity principal will not fall below a pre-set level regardless of the underlying investment performance. Of interest to financial institutions selling variable annuities is the cost associated with such a guarantee. Although the Black-Scholes option pricing formula can be applied readily, the resulting price might be inaccurate because returns on the Japanese stock price index do not seem to behave as assumed in the formula. In this study, we propose a method for valuing <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees</b> {{on the basis of a}} GARCH-type model, which better captures the characteristics of the stock price index. A difficulty in option-pricing with GARCH is the identification of a risk-neutral probability measure. We solve this problem by considering the conditional Esscher transform. Computational details of the proposed method are illustrated by valuing costs of two popular <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees</b> in Japan.

5|$|MIGA's inaugural {{investment}} guarantees {{were issued}} in 1990 to cover $1.04billion ($1.83billion in 2012dollars) worth of foreign direct investment(FDI) comprising four individual projects. The agency also issued its first reinsurance contracts signed {{in collaboration with}} Export Development Canada and the United States' Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). That same year, MIGA held a conference in Ghana to promote investment. The agency joined the Berne Union, an international community of export credit and investment insurance providers in 1994. In 1997, MIGA issued the inaugural contract under its Cooperative Underwriting Program to support an energy project in Indonesia. In collaboration with the European Union Investment Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the agency set up a fund for investment guarantees amounting to $12million ($17million in 2012dollars). The agency also established the West Bank and Gaza <b>Investment</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Trust Fund with a capacity of $20million ($29million in 2012dollars). In 1998 the Council of Governors of MIGA adopted a resolution establishing a general capital increase of $850million ($1.2billion in 2012dollars), and transferring a grant of $150million ($212million in 2012dollars) from the IBRD. MIGA exceeded $1billion ($1.4billion in 2012 dollars) in investment guarantees within a single {{year for the first}} time in 1999. The agency also approved an Environmental Assessment and Disclosure Policy and began attempting to implement such standards for new projects.|$|E

This led Union Fenosa to call its MIGA (Multilateral <b>Investment</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Agency) guarantee. The crisis was further aggravated by the inability of INE and CNE to cooperate in a constructive manner.

40|$|Unit-linked {{contracts}} are wrapped with some death, maturity and accumulation guarantees {{such as the}} guaranteed minimum maturity benefit, the guaranteed minimum death benefit, the guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit, the guaranteed minimum income benefit, and/or the guaranteed minimum surrender benefit. According to Romanian legislation which regulates the unit-linked life insurance market, unit-linked life insurance contracts pass most of the investment risk to the policyholder and involve no investment risk for the insurer. Although the Romanian legislation authorizes the Romanian insurers to offer unit-linked contracts without <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees,</b> this research provides a proposal of a theoretical and empirical basis for modelling liabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts with incorporated <b>investment</b> <b>guarantees.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to offer an optimal theoretical approach for simulating liabilities for unit-linked life insurance contracts with incorporated death benefit and maturity benefit...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} <b>guaranteed</b> <b>investment</b> funds, {{which have become}} very popular among investors in the Czech Republic in recent years.

This analysis tries to provide an answer to the question if investing in these funds is reasonable. A large part of the thesis is dedicated to the option theory and option valuation methods, including the famous Black-Scholes formula, as <b>guaranteed</b> <b>investment</b> funds have the characteristics of an option.

25|$|The World Bank {{has been}} {{involved}} in mining since 1955, mainly through grants from its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with the Bank's Multilateral <b>Investment</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Agency offering political risk insurance. Between 1955 and 1990 it provided about $2 billion to fifty mining projects, broadly categorized as reform and rehabilitation, greenfield mine construction, mineral processing, technical assistance, and engineering. These projects have been criticized, particularly the Ferro Carajas project of Brazil, begun in 1981. The World Bank established mining codes intended to increase foreign investment; in 1988 it solicited feedback from 45 mining companies on how to increase their involvement.|$|E

25|$|The Peruvian Constitution {{establishes}} {{equal protection}} for {{domestic and foreign}} investors who may enter into agreements with the Government and guarantees free access, possession, and disposal of foreign currency. Hydrocarbon Law No. 26844 of May 1997 eliminated the exclusive rights of the state-owned Petr√≥leos del Per√∫ S.A. to control the secondary recovery of crude oil, refining, and imports and subsequent resale of petroleum and byproducts. The Peruvian laws have attempted to ensure more-favorable minerals and crude {{oil and gas exploration}} and production contract terms for investors. Legal procedures to obtain mining rights were made easier by the enactment of complementary legislation Supreme Decree No. 018 of July 9, 1992. The Government relinquished exclusive control over exploration, mining, smelting, and refining of metals and fuel minerals. Individuals and private companies are allowed to hold mining permits in Peru. In the legal framework for investment and taxation, no distinction is made among domestic and foreign investors, corporations, joint ventures, and consortia formed in Peru or abroad. Municipalities and Regional governments in areas where mineral resources (metals and industrial minerals) are exploited will receive 50% of the taxes collected to be invested in education and social programs (health, housing, and others) in conformance with the Canon Minero (Ministry Resolution No. 266-2002-EF/15 of May 1, 2002). The remittance of dividends, depreciation, and royalties abroad has no restrictions. Contracts can be signed by investors, and the Government guarantees the stability of legal commitments and taxes. To increase protection of investors‚Äô interests, Peru signed agreements with the World Bank‚Äôs Multilateral <b>Investment</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Agency in April 1991, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25312 and with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in December 2002, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25809.|$|E
