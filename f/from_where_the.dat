5|$|A few of {{the roads}} {{surrounding}} the area that was Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake have names reflecting what once was there. Highway 94, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and is a few hundred feet <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year the}} Association {{presents}} {{up to two}} of its members with the Elton House Award for outstanding contribution to the Manor Hall Community. The award itself was established in 2008 to not only mark the recent reformation of the Association but {{as a way of}} recognising the often considerable time and effort select individuals invest into the life of the hall. The name is taken from Elton House, one of the student hostels that Manor Hall was built to replace in 1932 and <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> predecessor of the Manor Hall Association took its name.|$|E

5|$|In late 2004, a man {{allegedly}} gave Murray's {{father a}} rusty, stained knife {{that belonged to}} the man's brother, who had a criminal past and lived less than a mile <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> car was discovered. His brother and his brother's girlfriend were said to have acted strangely after the disappearance, and the man's brother claimed he believed the knife had been used to kill Murray. Several days after the knife was given to Fred Murray, the man's brother allegedly scrapped his Volvo. Family members of the man who turned in the knife claimed he had made up the story in order to obtain reward money in the investigation, and that he had a history of drug use.|$|E

Plymouth, located 75miles (120km) <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> hurricane made landfall, reported gusts to 95mph (155km/h). Sustained winds were lighter, {{with only a}} few locations receiving tropical storm strength winds.

5|$|Operation Pig Bristle was {{an unusual}} {{transport}} task conducted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in May 1946.

No. 38 Squadron of the RAAF was given the task of transporting 25 tonnes of pig bristles from Chongqing in China to Hong Kong, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> bristles were shipped to Australia. The squadron completed this task over a two-week period.|$|E

5|$|The Nandi in Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur is seen placed {{off centre}} as a {{testimony}} of Nandanar's devotion and the miracle. A stone {{image of the}} saint is worshipped in the temple.

In 1959, a shrine was created outside the Shiva temple, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> stone image of Nandanar looks eternally at Shiva. Nandanar is depicted with his hands joined above his head, praying to Shiva. Scenes of Bharati's opera and the local legend of Nandanar and Ganesha digging the temple tank are seen on the shrine.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} was designed, as was its predecessor at Watten, to receive, process and launch V-2 rockets {{at a high}} rate. Trains carrying V-2s would enter {{the heart of the}} complex through the Ida rail tunnel, where they would be unloaded. A large number of V-2s could be stored in the side tunnels; LOX would also be produced on-site ready for use. When the time came, the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber where they would be lifted to a vertical position for fuelling and arming. From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages, still in a vertical position, through the Gustav and Gretchen passageways. The launch pads were located {{at the end of the}} track on the floor of the quarry, <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> missiles would be fired.|$|E
