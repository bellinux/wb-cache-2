40|$|Traditionally European {{farmland}} {{management has}} declined {{during the last}} century, mainlydue to abandonment or intensification. When traditional management is replaced by newmethods many species are negatively affected and often threatened with extinction. In thisthesis, the Stockholm archipelago {{is used as a}} platform to study the effects of land use changeover time. The overall aim is to examine how time and space affects plant biodiversity in arural landscape, with focus on heterogeneous pastures. Historical records and maps were interpreted together with aerial photos and used to constructfour time-layers of land use: reflecting the landscape 200 years ago, 100 years ago, 50 yearsago and present. Investigations of plant species richness was conducted in seven habitats; 1) grazed fields, 2) <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> edges, 3) <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> interior, 4) former grazed fields, 5) former <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> edges, 6) former <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> interior, and 7) historical pasture islands,on 35 islands in Hjälmö-Lådna archipelago on the east-coast of Sweden. Plant speciesrichness was measured for all plant species and for grassland specialist species at three scales:i) fine-scale diversity (α div), ii) large-scale diversity (γ div), and iii) spatial turnover (β div). Using Structural Equation Models (SEM) the variation in species diversity and plantcommunity composition was investigated in relation to landscape context, space andmanagement history. The land use change in the Hjälmö-Lådna archipelago followed the general trends on themainland in Sweden and the rest of Europe with loss of traditional managed habitats, such asmeadows or wooded pastures. However, no intensification and large-scale agriculture hasdeveloped on the islands, mainly because of physical limitations, but also because ofeconomical and conservation reasons. Surprisingly, the grazing pressure on the remaininggrazed habitats had not changed notable over the last century; although the study area was notparticularly species rich (highest average was 15 species/ m 2 in grazed fields). Adjacenthabitats; field and wood pasture, showed a higher similarity in community composition thanexpected compared to random pairs. Grazing and proportion of openness had a positiveinfluence on species richness and especially on grassland specialists. The variation of totaldiversity at the landscape scale was best explained by the heterogeneity of <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> edgesand the local species diversity in fields. The results from the study suggest that grazing is important also in species-poor landscapes,and that it can aid in protecting and promote species-richness also in other types of speciespoorlandscapes. To prevent further loss of biodiversity it is necessary to keep fields andforest edges open with continuous management. To maintain values of high biodiversity andculture in the archipelago it is therefore important that farmers are subsidised by EU tocontinue to grazie heterogeneous habitats and pastures with many trees...|$|R

They are mainly terrestrial while foraging, harvesting {{food from the}} herbaceous layer. These monkeys are threatened mainly because of anthropogenic habitat degradation. We studied the adaptive capacities of wild groups of Barbary macaques that lived in different cedar forests undergoing varying extents of grazing pressure from domestic livestock. In all three sites, diet varied seasonally. Heavy grazing led to {{a significant decrease in}} herbaceous production and species richness. As a consequence, the monkeys' diet in this poor habitat showed a decreased plant species richness. Moreover, it incorporated fewer above‐ground herbaceous resources, and a greater proportion of subterranean resources (especially hypogeous fungi and subterranean invertebrates such as earthworms, eggs and adults of earwigs, and ant's larvae) than the diet of monkeys inhabiting ungrazed forest. Cedar bark, cedar strobiles, earthworms, and earwigs were part of the monkeys' diet only in <b>grazed</b> <b>forest.</b> Monkeys in heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> compensated for a lack of herbaceous foods by eating subterranean foods preferentially to tree and shrub products. The foods they consumed take longer to harvest and process than the seeds or leaves consumed by Barbary macaques in less heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> habitats. Our results suggest that monkeys do differ in their diets according to the degree of habitat change induced by human activities. They also highlight the dietary flexibility of Barbary macaques as a key element that allows them to cope with degraded habitats.

40|$|Forest {{planting}} {{is increasingly}} being incorporated into land management policies to mitigate diffuse pollution and localised flooding because forest soils {{are associated with}} enhanced hydraulic properties and lower surface runoff compared to soils under other vegetation types. Despite this, {{our understanding of the}} effects of different tree species and forest land use on soil hydraulic properties is limited. In this study we tested for the effects of two tree species, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), subject to contrasting land use systems, namely ungrazed <b>forest</b> and livestock <b>grazed</b> <b>forest,</b> on soil surface saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) at a long term (23 year) experimental site in Scotland. Additionally these forest land use systems were compared to grazed pasture. Kfs was found to be significantly higher under ungrazed Scots pine forest (1239 mm hr− 1) than under ungrazed sycamore forest (379 mm hr− 1) and under both of these forest types than under pasture (32 mm hr− 1). However, this measure did not differ significantly between the sycamore and Scots pine <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> and pasture. It was inferred, from comparison of measured Kfs values with estimated maximum rainfall intensities for various return periods at the site, that surface runoff, as infiltration excess overland flow, would be generated in pasture and <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> by storms with a return period of at least 1 in 2 years, but that surface runoff is extremely rare in the ungrazed forests, regardless of tree species. We concluded that, although tree species with differing characteristics can create large differences in soil hydraulic properties, the influence of land use can mask the influence of trees. The choice of tree species may therefore be less important than forest land use for mitigating the effects of surface runoff...|$|R

30|$|It is {{a common}} {{misunderstanding}} that droughts cause desertification because dry periods are common in arid and semiarid lands and {{are part of the}} ebb and flow of climate in these regions (Walker 1997). Well-managed lands can recover from the dry segments of climate cycles when rainfall increases. However, continued land abuse from agriculture, <b>grazing,</b> <b>forest</b> harvesting, wildland fire, and mining during droughts certainly increases the potential for permanent land degradation (MacDonald 2000). Desertification results in the loss of the land’s proper hydrologic function, biological productivity, and other ecosystem services as a result of human activities and climate change (Black 1997; Walker 1997; Millenium Ecosystem Assessment 2005 a, b). Desertification affects one third of the earth’s surface and over a billion people. In the past, desertification was considered a problem of only arid, semiarid, and dry sub-humid areas. However, humid zones can also undergo desertification with the cumulative effects of human impacts (MacDonald 2000). The Amazon region is an example of where forest harvesting, shifting cut-and-burn agriculture, and large-scale grazing are producing desertification of a tropical rain forest on a large scale (Malhi et al. 2008).|$|E

In this area, forest managers differ in management targets. Managers with a productivity-oriented target feel limited in meeting their target because neighbouring managers with biodiversity as main target do not or insufficiently control ungulate levels. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess to what extent ungulate herbivores affect natural regeneration and to gain insight in the spatial interactions between ungulate <b>grazing,</b> <b>forest</b> management and natural regeneration. This was assessed using the model FORSPACE, which is a process-based and spatial-explicit simulation model that integrates the impacts of ungulate grazing (cattle, horse, red deer, fallow deer, roe deer and wild boar) and forest management. We found that spatial interactions caused important local differences including: (i) spatial effects due to forest management; (ii) spatial interactions between ungulate species; (iii) spatial effects due to the distribution of seed sources of trees; and (iv) spatial interactions between plant species and grazing intensity. In general, we conclude that the effects of forest management on regeneration of trees are much more profound than that of ungulate grazing and browsing. Moreover, there are relatively small differences in the effects of the ungulates at very low to very high densities. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

We examined sustainable use of forests in a Csángó community in Gyimes region (Eastern Carpathians, Romania), providing insights into attitudes within folk forestry towards natural resources, driving forces, and changes in human relations with the forest.

40|$|Fire {{has been}} {{described}} as both a major ecological force necessary for long-term functioning of Sierra Nevada ecosystems and {{as one of the greatest}} threats to human and natural resources (SNEP 1996 a). Fire has shaped the terrestrial ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada for millennia. Before the mid- 1800 s, fires generally were frequent and mostly of low to moderate intensity, from lower-elevation blue oak woodlands through upper-montane red fir forests (Skinner and Chang 1996). Modern fire regimes are highly altered from their historical character because of the combined effects of fire exclusion, logging, <b>grazing,</b> <b>forest</b> clearing, urbanization, and climate change. These highly altered fire regimes have fostered changing ecosystems, including commonly discussed increases in vegetation density and accumulation of detritus (fuel for fires) that support more high-intensity fires than occurred under historical conditions (Chang 1996; McKelvey and Busse 1996; McKelvey and others 1996; Skinner and Chang 1996). The changing fire environment, along with increasing urbanization and human use of the Sierra Nevada, have created conditions where human life and property, as well as key ecosystem components, are at increasing risk from the effects of high-intensity wildfires (Biswell 1989, California Spotted Owl Federal Advisory Committee 1997, SNEP 1996 a). There is significant Congressional interest in finding a way to reverse the trend toward increasing funding necessary for fire suppression (GAO 1999, Schuster and others 1997).

Dry forests of Ethiopia are heavily affected by such human induced factors. The iconic Boswellia papyrifera (Del.) Hochst is a dominant tree species of this forest and the principal source of the globally traded frankincense. The species lacks regeneration in all forests evaluated so far. Frankincense forests in relatively wetter dry land areas with little or no human related disturbance are not evaluated so far.

The frankincense tree populations showed two different regeneration patterns: inverse J-shaped and bell-shaped pattern. The presence of regenerating populations in three of our study areas is in sharp contrast to all earlier studies on this species. The healthy regeneration might be related with the availability of more favourable conditions such as better precipitation, lower levels of anthropogenic disturbances and younger ages of the three woodlands.

40|$|Forest {{degradation}} is {{broadly defined}} as {{a reduction in the}} capacity of a forest to produce ecosystem services such as carbon storage and wood products as a result of anthropogenic and environmental changes. The main causes of degradation include unsustainable logging, agriculture, invasive species, fire, fuelwood gathering, and livestock <b>grazing.</b> <b>Forest</b> degradation is widespread and has become an important consideration in global policy processes that deal with biodiversity, climate change, and forest management. There is, however, no generally recognized way to identify a degraded forest because perceptions of forest degradation vary depending on the cause, the particular goods or services of interest, and the temporal and spatial scales considered. Here, we suggest that there are types of forest degradation that produce a continuum of decline in provision of ecosystem services, from those in primary forests through various forms of managed forests to deforestation. Forest degradation must be measured against a desired baseline condition, and the types of degradation can be represented using five criteria that relate to the drivers of degradation, loss of ecosystem services and sustainable management, including: productivity, biodiversity, unusual disturbances, protective functions, and carbon storage. These criteria are not meant to be equivalent and some might be considered more important than others, depending on the local forest management objectives. We propose a minimum subset of seven indicators for the five criteria that should be assessed to determine forest degradation under a sustainable ecosystem management regime. The indicators can be remotely sensed (although improving calibration requires ground work) and aggregated from stand to management unit or landscape levels and ultimately to sub-national and national scales...|$|E

Agroforestry management of cacao (Theobroma cacao) is an alternative system that may maintain the agricultural livelihood of the region while more closely mimicking native ecosystems. This study compared physical, biological and chemical soil quality indicators of a cacao plantation under organic agroforestry management with banana, pineapple, and pasture systems; a native forest nearby served as a control. For bulk density and earthworm analysis, 18 samples were collected between March and April 2012 from each ecosystem paired with 18 samples from the cacao. Cacao had a lower bulk density than banana and pineapple monocultures, but greater than the forest (p< 0. 05). Cacao also hosted a greater number and mass of earthworms than banana and pineapple (p< 0. 05), but similar to forest and pasture. For soil chemical characteristics, three composite samples were collected in March 2012 from each agroecosystem paired with three samples from the cacao plantation. Forest and pineapple ecosystems had the lowest pH, cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable nutrient cations, while cacao had the greatest (p< 0. 05). Total nutrient levels of P and N were slightly greater in banana, pineapple and pasture than in cacao; probably related to addition of chemical fertilizer and manure from cattle <b>grazing.</b> <b>Forest</b> and cacao also had greater %C, than other ecosystems, which {{is directly related to}} soil organic matter content (p< 0. 0001).
