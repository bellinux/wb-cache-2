5|$|Hanna {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to direct his first cartoon in 1936; the result was To Spring, part of the Harman-Ising Happy Harmonies series. The following year, MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman-Ising and bring production in-house. Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman-Ising to their new cartoon studio. During 1938–1939, he served as a senior director on MGM's Captain and the Kids series, based upon the comic strip of the same name (an alternate version of the Katzenjammer Kids that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit). The series did not do well; consequently, Hanna was demoted to a story man and the series was canceled. Hanna's desk at MGM was opposite that of Joseph Barbera, who had previously worked at Terrytoons.

40|$|We {{examine the}} method used for seeding teams in {{professional}} sports leagues after the regular season has ended. In particular, {{we are interested in}} which teams are in the playoffs and which of these playoff teams get the home field advantage and/or a first round bye. We show that the regular season schedule is biased against <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> (since teams are separated into divisions) and that in addition to the current schedules and their inherent biases the playoff systems add more bias against <b>good</b> <b>teams</b> (since division winners are typically ranked higher than nondivision winners). The amount of bias in various cases is presented. Furthermore, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for a schedule to be completely unbiased.

5|$|Tennessee had {{a three-game}} road trip up next, {{starting}} with the Bulldogs in Athens. Tennessee started the game strong, grabbing the lead, and finished the half on a 13–0 run. However, Georgia came back, cutting the lead down to nine with seven minutes remaining in the game. It {{was at this point}} that Semeka Randall scored thirteen points, sealing a 96–71 victory. This is the largest margin of victory in the Lady Bulldogs-Lady Vols series. Tennessee had 19 steals in the game, while shooting over 50%, and Holdsclaw and Catchings both scored over 20. The next game, against Kentucky, also had Tennessee making a late first half run, giving them a 19-point lead at the break. This lead was never given up, as the Lady Vols won by twenty-eight. The final game of the road trip was against DePaul, a <b>good</b> <b>team</b> who was, however, missing their two best players. Without these players, it was not much of a game, as Summitt's team started the game with twenty-one straight points and ended the game with a 125–46 victory, giving the team a 20–0 record.

25|$|From {{this point}} up to 1925, Derbyshire were perennially among the weakest counties, losing every single match in 1920 {{despite the efforts}} of Sam Cadman and Arthur Morton, persevering professionals. From 1926, the nucleus of a <b>good</b> <b>team</b> emerged around some doughty batting from Denis Smith, Stan Worthington and George Pope. Pope's bowling and that of his brother Alf, leg spinner Tom Mitchell and seam bowler Bill Copson took the team to their one and so far only Championship victory in 1936. They won 13 of their 28 matches {{outright}} and five on first innings. Worthington, Les Townsend, Smith and Alderman all passed 1,000 runs and Copson and Mitchell took over 100 wickets, with Alf Pope taking 94. Charlie Elliott, who later became a Test umpire and selector, was another member of this team which was captained by AW Richardson.|$|E

In more fortunate circumstances the senior players could have eased the newcomers into the team, but Ray Illingworth was a captain who exploited every weakness and they did not get the chance.

25|$|The eighteenth {{stage was}} an {{individual}} time trial, with a finish on the Mont Ventoux.

But already in the next stage, Bernard lost considerable time. He had a flat tire just before the top of a climb, and lost contact with the other riders while he had to wait for repairs, and had to spend energy to get back. His rivals Mottet and Roche had made a plan to attack in the feed zone, where cyclists could get their lunch. Mottet and Roche had packed extra food at the start of the stage, and attacked while Bernard was at the back of the peloton. Bernard chased them, but was not able to get back to them, and lost four minutes in that stage, which made Roche the new leader, closely followed by Mottet and Delgado.|$|E
