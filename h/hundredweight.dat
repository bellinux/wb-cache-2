5|$|In February 1941 the Commandos were reorganized in {{accordance}} with a new war establishment. Each Commando unit now consisted of a Headquarters and six troops (instead of the previous 10). Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type landing ship and one unit in the 'Dutch' type landing ship. The motor transport issued to each commando consisted of one car for the commanding officer, 12 motorcycles (six with sidecars), two 15 <b>hundredweight</b> (cwt) trucks, and one 3-ton truck. These vehicles were only provided for administration and training and were not intended to accompany the men on operations.|$|E

On the 27th Stengel with 8,000 soldiers from the Army of Belgium won a minor action at Voroux-lez-Liers near Liège over Anton Sztáray and four battalions of Austrians. Antwerp fell on 29 November to Miranda's 17,600 infantry and 1,245 cavalry. The Austrian garrison of the 1st Battalion of the Hohenlohe Nr. 17, two companies of the Vierset Nr. 59 and four companies of the Würzburg Infantry Regiments, plus 140 gunners surrendered after losing two dead and four wounded. The French captured 57 cannons, 50 additional 3-pound regimental cannons, 3,150 muskets and 1,523 <b>hundredweight</b> of gunpowder. The 2,599-man garrison of Namur under Johann Dominik von Moitelle surrendered on 2 December to Valence and Harville after a four-week siege. The Austrian defenders included two battalions of the Kinsky Infantry Regiment Nr. 36, one battalion of the Vierset, two companies of the Le Loup Jäger Battalion, a half-squadron of the Esterhazy Hussar Regiment Nr. 32 and 90 gunners.

50|$|Despite the expansion, boats on the Lahn {{could travel}} fully loaded only from Gießen to Löhnberg. There, {{they had to}} lighten their load {{in order to reduce}} their draft and {{continue}} the journey. Also, this was only during two to three months. In a further four to five months per year, the load had to be reduced even earlier due to the low water level. The rest of the year the Lahn was not passable. From Wetzlar to Lahnstein, where the freight was unloaded onto the large barges of the Rhine, the boats took three to four days. A trip from Wetzlar to the mouth and then towed back with horses lasted for about 14 days in good conditions.

50|$|Ahmed Pasha gained his epithet bakırcı ("coppersmith") {{through the}} main issue {{surrounding}} his term: coining new copper money for Egypt {{in the wake of}} the copper shortage in the province. When transferring power to Ahmed Pasha, Hasan Bey reported to him the state of matters. In order to coin small denominations, Ahmed Pasha asked the sultan to send him 1,000 <b>hundredweights</b> (100,000 lbs.) of copper. Instead, the sultan sent him 12 times as much copper, 12,000 <b>hundredweights</b> (1,200,000 lbs.), and asked for its value in coins back, which amounted to 300,000 gold pieces. To convert the copper into coinage, Ahmed Pasha assembled the sanjak-beys to give opinions on the subject; they suggested that the copper be turned into obol coins. Thus, Ahmed Pasha gathered as many smiths and workmen as he could to convert the copper into a usable form. However, the coinage produced by the workmen turned out to only be worth about half of the ancient obol coins. This resulted in severe inflation in Egypt, and furthermore, many of the workmen began to die from the hot conditions of the workhouses. After inspecting the workhouses, Ahmed Pasha cancelled the coinage and sent the workers home.|$|R

The sloop was armed with two 12-pounders on slides and two long 4-pounders, and carried a crew of 24. Her crew ran her ashore and then left her, taking their muskets up behind some sand hills where some local civilians joined them. Baker, concerned that the schooner might harm British trade, sent in his boats to bring her out or destroy her. The British cutting out party boarded the privateer, without loss despite the small arms fire from the beach, got her off the shore, and turned her guns on the beach. While the boarding party was securing the vessel, one of the men fortunately discovered a lighted candle set in a powder cartridge in the magazine and extinguished it when it had only a half an inch to burn. The privateer's magazine contained about a <b>hundredweight</b> of powder; had it exploded it would have killed the boarding party. The prize crew then brought the sloop off.

Żejtun was the cotton producing centre of the islands, producing 10,312 cwt (<b>hundredweights)</b> of cotton, or 20.8% of the total production in 1836. Such was the importance of the town for commerce, that a local merchant owned a single deck polacre, named Zeitun.

25|$|Imperial {{units are}} still used in {{ordinary}} conversation. Today, Canadians typically use {{a mix of}} metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. However, {{the use of the}} metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers' licences use SI units. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per <b>hundredweight</b> (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. Imperial units still dominate in recipes, construction, house renovation and gardening. Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units, although initial surveys used imperial units. For example, partitioning of farm land on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the Prairie Provinces. The size of most apartments, condominiums and houses continues to be described in square feet rather than square metres, and carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot. Motor-vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per 100km and statute miles per imperial gallon, leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are 20% more fuel-efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per US gallon (neither country specifies which gallon is used). Canadian railways maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe train length (feet), train height (feet), capacity (tons), speed (mph), and trackage (miles).|$|E

40|$|More than 40 million <b>hundredweights</b> of rice are {{produced}} in California’s Sacramento Valley every year. After harvest, the rice {{is stored in}} facilities on-farm or off-farm until it is transported to mills or to ports for export. We conducted a survey of storage operations to characterize grain storage and pest management practices to guide future UC Cooperative Extension research efforts. The results indicate that grain moisture content, temperature and insect pest management {{are the most important}} challenges for both on- and off-farm stor-age operations. Survey responses show high adoption of integrated pest management programs, with most storage operations relying on monitoring, thresholds, sanita-tion and aeration to manage pest problems. Fumigant use was reported more frequently in off-farm storage operations than on-farm operations. Cooperative Extension edu-cational efforts should focus on grain and temperature monitoring, insect identifica-tion and safe use of fumigants. Research is needed to improve management of grain temperature and moisture content, and insect infestations. Rice {{is one of the most}} important crops in California’s Sacramento Valley. Ap-proximately 500, 000 acres are planted an-nually (Hill et al. 2006). From 2000 to 2011, California produced an average of 43. 4 million <b>hundredweights</b> (cwt, 1 cwt = 100 pounds) of rough rice (unprocessed rice that includes hull and caryopsis) per year. After harvest, rice is dried and stored ei-ther on-farm or at commercial drying and storage facilities off-farm. Rice is typically harvested when grain moisture content is between 18 % and 22 %. To preserve its quality and allow long-term storage, rice needs to be dried down to 13 % to 14 % moisture content (Mutters and Thompson 2009). Most on-farm storage facilities use metal bins of various capacities for dry-ing and storage; the rice is dried using outside air. Off-farm storage facilities use column dryers to dry rice to 16 % or 17 % moisture content and finish the drying in storage structures using outside ai...|$|R
