40|$|NTRODUCTION: Thrombolytic {{therapy for}} acute ischemic stroke {{is based on}} {{clinical}} assessment, blood tests, and computed tomography (CT) findings. The presence of early CT ischemic changes may help support therapeutic decision. Our aim is {{to call attention to}} a likely overlooked "stroke mimic," Gliomatosis Cerebri (GC). CASE SERIES: Clinical and neuroimaging analysis of 3 patients with documented GC, whose acute clinical onset and CT data (lenticular <b>and</b> ribbon <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> a ipsilateral <b>dot</b> <b>sign)</b> were suggestive of ischemic stroke. CONCLUSION: Noncerebrovascular conditions may present with both acute onset <b>and</b> false CT <b>signs</b> of early ischemic stroke.

40|$|Post-hoc {{analyses}} {{consist of}} three parts. First, unexpected group differences with better linguistic performance in visual matching will be analysed {{in more detail}} in order {{to figure out whether}} this difference might have resulted from more global processing of pseudowords vs. serial processing of digits strings <b>and</b> <b>dot</b> patterns. In the second part, we will examine subgroups of patients resulting from configural frequency analyses (CFA) of dissociation patterns for the second task group (automatized sequences, visual matching, and morpho-lexical knowledge). In the third part, subgroups of patients for the third task group (semantic comparison and fact retrieval) will be further analysed. 1 Global processing of pseudowords vs. serial processing of digit strings <b>and</b> <b>dot</b> pattern Since pseudowords were processed more accurately and efficiently than strings of digits <b>and</b> <b>dot</b> patterns, we examined, whether this difference was caused by global processing of pseudowords vs. serial processing of digits strings <b>and</b> <b>dot</b> patterns (hypothesis 1). If pseudowords were processed in a more parallel manner and strings of digits/dot patterns in a more serial manner, increments in response time would be smaller for pseudowords than for digit strings <b>and</b> <b>dot</b> patterns with increasing stimulus length (cf. [1]). As can be seen in Figure 2, reaction times for pseudowords increased to a lesser extent with increasing number of symbols than for digits <b>and</b> <b>dots...</b>|$|R
