5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the lung is inflamed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|The Close {{owes its}} origins to {{a grant of}} land and {{buildings}} by Walter de Hulle, a canon of Wells Cathedral, {{for the purpose of}} accommodating chantry priests; however the land is likely to have been used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> before the construction of the close, as prehistoric flint flakes and Romano-British pottery shards were recovered from the garden of number four during work to construct an extension.|$|E

5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata.

Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E

The area just north of JR Gifu Station contains a variety of small clothing stores catering to many types of consumers. Furthermore, the city's main downtown covered shopping arcade, Yanagase, features many clothing, shoe, and accessory shops that carry both domestic and overseas goods. Over the past decade, though, as Gifu's fashion industry has declined steeply, the city has begun developing other industries to support the local economy.|$|E
5|$|The system {{inverters}} typically provide {{power output}} at voltages {{of the order}} of 480 VAC. Electricity grids operate at much higher voltages {{of the order of}} tens or hundreds of thousands of volts, so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid. Due to the long lead time, the Long Island Solar Farm chose to keep a spare transformer onsite, as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period.</b> Transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years, and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station.|$|E

5|$|Appointed vice-captain for {{the tour}} of Pakistan and New Zealand that winter, Boycott assumed the {{captaincy}} in 1978 for two Tests when Mike Brearley was injured, and brought with him his successful summer form. However, he was replaced upon Brearley's return. While {{the rest of the}} England team took part in warm-up matches, Boycott remained in Lahore and organised a special warm up match where the team would play itself. However he went on to occupy the crease <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of time, limiting the amount of time other players had to practice. He later stated that, as the number one batsman, he should have the most time in the middle. In the second Test match, he scored 79 and 100 not out, increasing his statistics since his return to the England team to 684 runs at 136.80. It was between this match and the third Test that Brearley broke his arm, giving Boycott the captaincy. Boycott led England to a draw in the third match, his leadership meeting mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to date it have {{undergone}} similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel {{was believed to}} be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424‚Äì29, then <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432‚Äì34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto P√§cht judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan.|$|E
5|$|Cobain and Novoselic {{met while}} {{attending}} Aberdeen High, although they never connected, according to Cobain. The pair eventually became friends while frequenting the practice {{space of the}} Melvins. Cobain wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of time. In persuading Novoselic to form a band, Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project Fecal Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. The pair recruited Bob McFadden on drums, but after a month the project fell apart. In early 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard. The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape but started writing new material soon after forming.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Sattelberg, the 2/48th {{continued}} the advance north {{along with the rest}} of the 26th Brigade, pushing on over difficult terrain to Wareo, where they arrived on 8 December. Following this, the Japanese began to fall back to Sio in retreat and the battalion's involvement in combat operations on the peninsula came to an end as troops from the 5th Division arrived to relieve them. In January, the battalion camped around the Dallman River before being withdrawn back to Finschhafen, camping around the Song River. In February 1944, the 2/48th was withdrawn back to Australia along with the 9th Division. Sailing aboard an American Liberty ship, the battalion landed in Brisbane on 20 February, and made camp at Kalinga before personnel marched out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of home leave. During its time in New Guinea, the battalion had suffered 125 casualties, of which 36 were killed, three died of wounds, eight died of illness and 77 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katrina {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and was heading towards Louisiana. For precaution, Six Flags closed down the New Orleans theme park during mid-season {{to prepare for}} the storm. Due to {{substantial}} flooding, many of the park's rides were damaged beyond repair causing the park to remain closed until the floods retrieved. Many of the park rides were destroyed as the park's drainage system failed and were submerged in water <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of time, long after the hurricane. Anything found in the park still in good use was removed and moved to other parks in the company as Six Flags had no plans on reopening the theme park.

5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} Ren√© Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E
