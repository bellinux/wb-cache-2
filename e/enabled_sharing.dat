50|$|Unlike the iTunes music sharing feature, {{which allows}} {{a maximum of}} five users every 24 hours to connect {{and listen to the}} music of another user who has <b>enabled</b> <b>sharing</b> on a given subnetwork, ourTunes allows users to {{download}} music files to their own computer and provides the functionality to search through the songs from all connected hosts. ourTunes cannot download music purchased from the iTunes Music Store. Unlike peer-to-peer programs like Kazaa and Napster, ourTunes cannot search for or download music from users who do not share a subnetwork. ourTunes does not offer its users the opportunity to share files. ourTunes offers the ability to both download and stream music off the available shares. Because the program does not operate over the public Internet, users do not attract scrutiny or legal responses from the RIAA, which has asked colleges and universities {{to crack down on the}} programs in response.|$|E

Contents from student workstations can be displayed on the Hiperwall while they collaborate in small groups. The instructor also has the option to display the content {{of any of the}} student workstations on the Hiperwall at any time thus allowing the entire class to watch and discuss each others’ work. So due to Hiperwall’s flexibility, it enables the class to work collectively on challenging problems, as well as data analysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The ever {{increasing}} speed {{of access to}} the Internet has <b>enabled</b> <b>sharing</b> of data on an unprecedented scale. Data of all forms and shapes is becoming easily accessible: large multi-media files are being routinely downloaded onto a plethora of end user devices. Peer-to-peer content delivery approaches enable massive scale in the amount of data volume that can be efficiently delivered. The openness of delivery demands adaptive and robust management of intellectual property rights. In this paper we describe a framework and its implementation to address the central issues in content delivery: a scalable peer-to-peer-based content delivery model, paired with an access control model that balances trust in end users with a risk analysis to the data provider. Our framework enables data providers to extract the maximum amount of return, i. e. value, from making their original content available. Our implementation architecture provides a protocol to leverage the greatest amount of reward from the intellectual property that is released to the Internet.

40|$|Nowadays social {{networks}} have millions or some even billions of users who {{spend most of}} their free time there. Therefore there is no surprise that the potential impact on society becomes part of many experts research. According to some authors, {{social networks}} offer an opportunity for political participation especially for those who generally do not participate. Even politicians start to use these networks to mobilize voters. We can observe this new trend in the first direct presidential elections in the Czech Republic 2013, when some of the candidates tried to reach and mobilize voters through social networks. During presidential campaign 2012 / 2013, users could have participated in various political activities which <b>enabled</b> <b>sharing</b> political views. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the impact of using social networks during presidential elections, particularly using of Facebook, on interest in politics between users 18 - 35 years. The diploma thesis focuses on the impact of Facebook because it is the most popular and used social network in the Czech Republic and also due to the fact that some experts argue that this social network played an important role in the presidential campaign.

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that problem-based learning has many advantages {{for learning and}} teaching, especially in practice-oriented professions. Although there is consensus on the generalized view of the process, {{there is not much}} in the form of specific guidelines on how problem-based learning (PBL) can be put to maximum use in group-based learning and teaching environments. Furthermore, little is known about what actually happens in the various phases of the process (such as problem analysis) and how these can be activated and systematically enhanced. The project reported in this paper set out to fill this particular void. Nurses encounter problem situations on a regular basis as part of their work, which makes it imperative that graduating nurses are conversant with the problem-solving process as they make their transition from the classroom into the workforce. A sure and quick way to ensure this transition is to engage students in problem-based learning. In the course selected for this project, students were presented with three authentic problem situations representative of the content of the course. Students were required to approach the study of the problem with a defined architecture, which required focused reflections and the presentation of a critical reflection record {{at the end of a}} study period. All of these learning activities took place in a computer-mediated communications environment that <b>enabled</b> <b>sharing</b> of opinions and views on each of the problems among the student group. A study of the critical reflections of students on the problem situations revealed evidence of a systematic approach to problem analysis and problem solving...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Internationally, newborn hearing {{screening}} {{is becoming}} part of standard neonatal healthcare service guidelines {{for the implementation of}} early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) initiatives, including screening, diagnosis, data management and intervention. Data management includes the processes of data collection and storage thereof, as well as analysis and interpretation of data to guide the future planning, implementation and evaluation of EHDI programmes. There have been limited studies on data management in the South African EHDI context. Methods: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the type of data management systems in use in South Africa and whether they allow for cross-disciplinary sharing and evaluation of the EHDI processes. A survey instrument on the management of EHDI data was developed and sent to HI HOPES referral agents in both public and private sectors. Results: A return rate of 80 % was achieved, with 19 (59 %) public sector and 13 (41 %) private sector audiologists participating in the study. The data revealed that there was no uniform data management system in use nationally, and no consistent shared system within the public or private sectors. The majority of respondents (44 %) used a paper-based system for data recording. No institutions were using data management systems that <b>enabled</b> <b>sharing</b> of information with other medical professionals. Conclusion: Data management and tracking of the pathway from screening to diagnosis to intervention is necessary to ensure quality care and outcomes for children identified with hearing loss. International studies reveal the importance of effective implementation of data management systems; however, to date these have focussed on developed country contexts. Data management challenges identified in this study reflect international challenges as well as challenges unique to a developing country context. </p...|$|E
40|$|To learn, {{students}} {{must do more}} than just listen; learning demands involvement and active participation in the process (Davis, 2002). The ever-increasing suite of digital tools available in higher education means using technology for teaching and learning can be engaging for both instructors and students. However to enable a transformative approach to instructional design and to harness this digital capacity to its full potential it is important to ensure that technology addresses a real need - to enhance student learning and to support the learner (McCulloch, 2009). As part of a student selected component (SSC) for the Undergraduate Medical degree (MBChB) students became active participants and co-creators of their learning experience in Anatomy teaching through the development of E-tutorials using Articulate Storyline 2 software. A group of 9 students selected this module. Initially they reflected on issues experienced by students on the MBChB programme, engaging with their peers on the course <b>enabled</b> <b>sharing</b> multiple perspectives. The inclusion of the student voice was a key value in the initial development of these digital resources. Based on their discussions the students selected three anatomical regions of the body to focus on, with the aim of using technology to personalise the learning material currently available in a variety of resources into one interactive self-evaluation tool. The SSC encouraged collaboration and interaction among the students within their groups, the process of designing, planning, and creating the e-tutorials, empowered them to be creative, independent, analytical thinker. The evaluation process encouraged problem solving and assimilation of meaningful information; in addition to these graduate attributes the students developed digital skills and knowledge improving their digital literacy and awareness. The e-tutorials can be produced for publication on the web, for using on mobile devices or in a format that is easily uploaded to Moodle or another LMS. Although this study focused on Anatomy, this software could easily be adapted to any discipline. The finished products will be presented demonstrating that students (in collaboration with teaching staff) should be encouraged to utilise technology to become more active participants and co-creators of their learning experiences enabling the development of personalised learning material to encourage autonomous self-directed learning and to develop new versatility when it comes to interaction in learning environments...|$|E

40|$|A {{decade ago}} {{comparatively}} little {{was known about}} design in China, either in Australia or overseas. The existing sentiment was overwhelmingly that China was a looming threat to Australia&rsquo;s manufacturing industry and that her design sector unashamedly copied everything. Industrial design in Australia has been concerned about a diminishing client base and how engagement with the Chinese manufacturing sector might adversely affect professional practice. A Eurocentric view prevails in Australian design. On top of that, a parochial approach has meant Australian designers and manufacturers have missed out on opportunities to engage with China in a meaningful way. This study seeks to demonstrate where previously unexplored potential exists for meaningful and mutually beneficial interactions between the two countries, rather than maintaining the current antagonistic design relationship. Through striving for an earnest and deep interaction with academic, business and social ecosystems in China, this study uses long term observations and experiences to speculate on developing ongoing and meaningful interactions. These include engagement through academic and commercial projects {{with the aim of}} transforming Australian and Chinese designers&rsquo; practice. The process of converting these understandings into theoretical models has been transformative. It has <b>enabled</b> <b>sharing</b> and discussion of the significance of this learning, and offered insights for others to use in understanding China within a broader design discourse. These models offer opportunities to examine the Australian design context as well as opportunities for recasting the role of design. This includes capitalising on existing expertise and industrial capacity while investing in market opportunities, which are innovative, uncontested or unattractive to centres of economic activity orientated towards mass manufacture. The significance of this research has potential far beyond its immediate results. There is tremendous potential in transforming Australian designers&rsquo; understanding of China and encouraging &lsquo;engagement with&rsquo;, rather than &lsquo;employment of&rsquo; China. This opens up exciting and highly beneficial platforms for long term, ongoing projects both in the academic and business ecosystems. The Chinese field trips, combined with integration of Chinese modes of teaching, designing and producing have altered this writer&rsquo;s identity and approach to design and the world considerably. The pursuit of academic publication, discussing models and methods for understanding China, will open up the possibility of further design relationships between Australia and China. These publications will be supplemented by a website with links to enable China-Design to be accessible to emerging designers and design graduates. This will be combined with designing and providing training programs for teaching staff in Melbourne, to assist with the introduction and dissemination of these models as a means of connecting with China. Continued trips to China, engaging with academics and students, will allow for a continued deepening of understanding and engagement...|$|E
