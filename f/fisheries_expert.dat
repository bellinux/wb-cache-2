40|$|There {{has been}} a long-standing {{interest}} in local knowledge in fisheries research and management. Much of this interest has been {{in terms of how}} local knowledge can be interpreted scientifically and used by <b>fisheries</b> <b>experts</b> and managers. Local knowledge becomes the property of scientists, wrapped up in a format and language that is inaccessible to local people. There has been less interest in how local people can use and develop their own knowledge as part of their fisheries management practice, or of the implications of such a degree of ownership for the role of <b>fisheries</b> <b>experts</b> and managers. This paper draws on the experience of local people conducting their own fisheries research according to their own agenda in Northeast Cambodia. The paper begins by describing the process and motivations of this villager-led research and how this was perceived by <b>fisheries</b> <b>experts</b> and managers. The discussion then moves to an analysis of how this research process has generated demands on <b>fisheries</b> <b>experts</b> and managers. Rather than experts defining what is learnt and extracting scientifically valid information from local knowledge, this case study illustrates how local people can identify what needs to be learnt and what role science and experts have in answering these questions.

It is 'based on a process of dialogue between fishermen, through fishing committees. Information sessions were held at departmental, subprefectoral, and village level to inform fishermen of the issues involved. These were followed by village seminars, each one run by local people and with about 100 fishermen attending. The seminars closed with the election of fishing committees, which have the twin roles of informing local people about fishing regulations and helping to enforce them. After a month's training, and with support from the government, the committees held a census of thousands of fishermen; they re-organised the sites of a hundred 'sitting fishermen'; and they regenerated the aquatic ecosystem by replanting several kilometres of Rhizophora and trees on the banks. The committees are not state bodies, but they are seen as auxiliaries of the fishing authorities, in terms of cutting back violation of fishing regulations, and of having a positive effect in water-borne fauna and flora.

40|$|Abstract—A genetic {{algorithm}} {{is combined with}} two variants of the modularity (Q) network analysis metric to examine a substantial amount fisheries catch data. The data set produces {{one of the largest}} networks evaluated to date by {{genetic algorithm}}s applied to network community analysis. Rather than use GA to decide community structure that simply maximizes modularity of a network, as is typical, we use two fuzzy community membership functions applied to natural temporal divisions in the network so the GA is used to find interesting areas of the search space through maximization of modularity. The work examines the performance of the genetic algorithm against simulated annealing using both types of fuzzy community membership functions. The algorithms are used in an existing visualization software prototype, where the solutions are evaluated by a <b>fisheries</b> <b>expert.</b> Keywords-spatiotemporal visualization; fisheries; genetic algorithm; Q modularity; fuzzy community membership I...|$|E

The parallel search solution is capable of determining global maxima of the search space using brute force search, compared to local optima located by machine learning solutions such as evolutionary computation. The actual solutions from the best machine learning technique, called Probabilistic Adaptive Mapping Developmental Genetic Algorithm, are compared by a <b>fisheries</b> <b>expert</b> to the global maxima solutions returned by parallel search. In addition, the time required for parallel search, for both CPU and GPU-optimized solutions, are compared to those required for machine learning solutions. The GPU parallel computing solution was found to have a speedup of over 10, 000 x, in excess of most similar performance comparison studies in the literature.

40|$|Since “balanced harvest” was {{proposed}} in 2010 {{as a possible}} tool in the operationalization of the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), the concept gained extensive international attention. Because maintaining ecosystem structure and achieving maximum sustainable yields have become two of the key international legal obligations in fisheries management, balanced harvest is as topical as ever. An international workshop on balanced harvest, organized by the IUCN <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Expert</b> Group at FAO headquarters in 2014, reviewed the progress {{in the field and}} discussed its prospects and challenges. Several articles in this theme set, mostly based on presentations from the workshop, discuss ecological, economical, legal, social, and operational issues surrounding the key management goals.

40|$|The {{practical}} implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) management has proved difficult to achieve. Without simple and structured guidelines for implementing an EAF, managers {{are grappling with}} the complexity of implementation {{and the need to}} prioritise resources and management actions. Ecological risk assessment has been put forward as a structured procedure. There is a need to review regularly whether progress is being made in addressing the issues and priorities identified through ecological risk assessment. Such reviews require a framework providing clear objectives for the respective fishery and delineating the steps required towards their achievement. This paper proposes a generic framework for reviewing ecological risk assessments through stakeholder workshops. This framework is aided by a fuzzy logic tool to track EAF implementation and informs the development of proactive work plans which incorporate EAF objectives. The advantages and disadvantages of a generic and participatory approach are discussed and compared with other related methods for evaluating progress in implementing an EAF.

40|$|Traditionally, {{a genetic}} {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} analyze net-works by maximizing the modularity (Q) measure to create a favorable community. A coevolutionary algorithm is used here to not only find the appropriate community division for a network, but to find interesting networks containing sub-stantial changes in data within a very large network space. The network {{is one of the}} largest, if not the largest, analyzed by evolutionary computation techniques to date and is cre-ated using a real world data set consisting of fisheries catch data in the north Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Canada. This work examines the quantitative performance of two types of coevolutionary algorithms against both a standard GA that uses a natural (but not necessarily optimal) division of the data set into communities, and simulated annealing. The goal for all search algorithms was to automatically find anomalies (differences in catch) within the data. To measure practical usefulness of the system, a <b>fisheries</b> <b>expert</b> analyzed the best networks located by the search algorithms using an existing visualization software prototype.
