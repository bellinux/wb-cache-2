40|$|In today’s world nothing local is just local anymore, writes Roshni Hegerman, {{strategic}} planning director of McCann Sydney. Globalization has gifted {{lot to the}} consumers. Consumers in India are now becoming more informed, sophisticated and demanding. India {{is one of the}} youngest countries in the world, and the attitudes of the Indian consumers are changing at a rapid pace. A glocal strategy standardizes certain core elements and localizes other elements. It is a compromise between global and domestic marketing strategies. Glocal marketing reflects both the ideal of pure global marketing strategy and the recognition that locally related issues of marketing activities need to be considered. One of the most <b>important</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is that getting localisation right doesn’t have to involve a big change to have a big effect. The impact achieved by simply taking the time to consider local sensitivities and adapting your brand appropriately can be huge. The rise of a global culture doesn’t mean that consumers share the same tastes or values. Rather, people in different nations, often with conflicting viewpoints, participate in a shared conversation, drawing upon shared symbols. Spending the time and money to localise the marketing activity is the priority for any organisation. If not, one must take the risk of losing the money spent on global campaign – and to repair the lost image. It is however, important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that localisation can go wrong...|$|R

50|$|Communicate — this is {{probably}} the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> when playing a 2-3 zone.

40|$|However, {{as there}} are many {{versions}} of Harvard referencing this guide has been produced to demonstrate the referencing system that the SSES uses across all undergraduate and MSc programmes. This is the referencing style that you should adopt for ALL your work. Why do I need to reference? There are several reasons why you need to reference your work. 1. References are used to demonstrate the depth and breadth of your reading {{and you can use}} references to support your analysis and argument. Using referencing in your work is therefore a way in which you can enhance your grade. 2. Referencing is the way that you acknowledge other people’s work within your own coursework. If you do not use referencing or use it incorrectly it could potentially be viewed as plagiarism (copying someone’s work without acknowledgement). There can also be copyright issues associated with using other people’s work without acknowledgement. 3. Referencing allows other people to identify the source of the information that you have used. Referencing is not difficult as it is all about following the instructions. The most <b>important</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> are <b>to</b> be organised and be consistent. You should use referencing within any piece of your work where you are using sources of information that are not your own. This includes essays, case studies, presentations, leaflets and written exams. All sources of information that you use should be included within your work in two places: 1. In the text- this is called a citation. 2. At the end in the references list...|$|R

If you will cease to have that admirable house in Mayfair and the park in Kent and the moorlands and the Welsh castle, yet you will have another ownership of a finer kind <b>to</b> replace those <b>things.</b> For all London will be yours, a city to serve indeed, {{and a sense of}} fellowship that is, if you could but realize it, better than respect. The common people will not be common under Socialism. That is a very <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> for you <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> But better than those thoughts is this, that you will own yourself too, more than you do now.

60|$|We {{have only}} <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that with him, {{as with the}} rest of us, there was entire unity of nature, without cataclysm or marvel or inexplicable rupture of mental continuity. All the facts came in an order that might have been foretold; they all lay together, with their {{foundations}} down in physical temperament; the facts which made Rousseau's name renowned and his influence a great force, along with those which made his life a scandal to others and a misery to himself. The deepest root of moral disorder lies in an immoderate expectation of happiness, and this immoderate unlawful expectation was the mark both of his character and his work. The exaltation of emotion over intelligence was the secret of his most striking production; the same exaltation, by gaining increased mastery over his whole existence, at length passed the limit of sanity and wrecked him. The tendency of the dominant side of a character towards diseased exaggeration is a fact of daily observation. The ruin which the excess of strong religious imagination works in natures without the quality of energetic objective reaction, was shown in the case of Rousseau's contemporary, Cowper. This gentle poet's delusions about the wrath of God were equally pitiable and equally a source of torment to their victim, with Rousseau's delusions about the malignity of his mysterious plotters among men. We must call such a condition unsound, but the <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that insanity was only a modification of certain specially marked tendencies of the sufferer's sanity.|$|R

50|$|The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> when fitting a bit {{is that no}} {{two horses}} are {{completely}} alike. What is preferred by one, may cause severe problems in another. It is therefore the rider's duty to find a bit that not only suits the horse (both mouthpiece and ring), but one that fits correctly. The three main criteria in fitting the snaffle are the height the bit is raised in the mouth (adjusted by the cheekpieces), {{the width of the}} bit (from where the mouthpiece hits one ring, to where it hits the other), and the thickness of the mouthpiece.|$|E
5000|$|So that {{democracy}} can be revived, and sustained, throughout the world, the U.S. and other developed countries must play their part. The U.S. should only give {{financial aid to}} countries that are using the money to further develop their governance. [...] This selectivity is defined in the Millennium Challenge Account (part of Bush’s foreign policy). Under this policy, it says a country will receive aid dependent on “whether they rule justly, whether they invest in basic health care and education, and whether they promote economic freedom.” The <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is promoting democracy will take time and effort.|$|E
40|$|Working in the Educational Programs Office, my task {{this summer}} is to model a 3 D habitat {{that will be}} part of a future Mars base. With the President's charge to further explore mars by way of robotic-led and human-led missions, there has been a surge in the {{activity}} regarding the "red planet". Since all present designs are merely conjecture, I have some creative freedom in deciding what the habitat will look like. To get ideas for what a Mars habitat might be like, I looked at several references including websites and NASA documents. One of these was a NASA Technical Memorandum about Space Transportation Systems that I looked at to get insight on spaceship design. Information about the planet's environment, such as the gravity and the weather, is useful as well when designing the structure. The main software that I am using is Lightwave 3 D and Modeler 7. 5 that comes along with it. Lightwave is very complex in that it lets you model, surface, and animate so there was a lot to learn. To learn the software I watched a series of instructional videos, looked at online tutorials, and referenced several books. Modeling is like shaping clay with a computer. Every item modeled is made of smaller shapes called polygons. For example, each side of a box would be a different polygon. Modelers must be careful to design with users' systems in mind. Having a model made with too many polygons can slow down a walk-through, but it usually improves the small details on a model. Getting speed and quality proved tricky. An <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> when modeling the habitat was to save space. Also, I must consider that technology in the future will be much different than now, so I must be especially creative. My project will be used in an educational walkthough simulation in which users can interact with the environment. I worked closely with intern Stephen Henke who built a Mars Rover, terrain and programmed code for the simulation. This summer's project will help me with future aspirations in computer graphics. Modeling is a valuable skill that I appreciate having the chance to learn and practice...|$|R

50|$|When {{we refer}} to the {{historical}} term 'violone', we must include almost all the instruments of both the violin and viol families (plus some hybrid instruments) that functioned as either tenor or bass members of those families. As the name 'violone' really means (see below), truly, these are all large string instruments. It {{was not until the}} 20th century that players and scholars started to realize that there were so many types of violoni and that not all of them functioned or sounded like double basses. Because of this, the classification of violoni according to tuning, family and function makes it start to be possible to clarify composers' intentions at different times and places. The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is that different types of violoni sound (and often function) quite differently from each other.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} part of a {{deliberate}} attempt by the Rank Organisation to break into the American market, following the path blazed with films like Henry V (1944) and Caesar and Cleopatra (1945). John Woolf, head of international distribution for Rank, said in 1946 that:Before we smacked Henry V and Caesar and Cleopatra into the American Markets, we were getting a poor showing in the United States. Although the most optimistic figures have been put out in London about the achievements of Henry and Caesar, in fact they have had to fight hard to make their way. The <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is this— that these big films enabled us to break through the highly controlled theatre circuits in America. We are using them as a spearhead to get a showing of British films.Stewart Granger was originally announced as the star.

5000|$|Regular plying {{consists}} of taking 2 or more singles and twisting them together, the opposite way. This {{can be done}} on either a spinning wheel or a spindle. The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> though is that the twist must go the opposite direction. If in spinning the single the wheel was spinning clockwise (which is called a [...] "Z" [...] twist, as on any given side the fibres appear to cross diagonally {{in the same direction}} as the diagonal of a [...] "Z"), in order to ply it the wheel must spin counter-clockwise (an [...] "S" [...] twist). This is because otherwise you are not balancing the twist, just twisting it more. The concept is similar to when a heavily twisted piece of yarn is folded, and it twists up on itself. It is most common for singles to be spun with a [...] "Z" [...] twist, and then plied with an [...] "S" [...] twist.|$|E
5000|$|Lambert {{became a}} notable screenwriter of the Hollywood studio era. In 1954, while {{still living in}} England, he wrote his first screenplay, Another Sky, about the sexual {{awakening}} of a prim English woman in North Africa. In 1955, he also directed Another Sky in Morocco. This was followed in 1958 by the Hollywood screenplay, Bitter Victory and in 1960 by Sons and Lovers. The latter, for which Lambert gained an Academy Award nomination, {{is based on a}} novel by D. H. Lawrence. The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1961) adapted a novella by Tennessee Williams on the affairs of an older actress with a young Italian gigolo. As, from the 1920s through the late 1960s, homosexuality was rarely portrayed on the screen, gay screenwriters like Lambert learned to express their personal sensibilities discreetly between the lines of a film. [...] "The <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> about 'gay influence' in movies," [...] observed Gavin Lambert, [...] "is that it was obviously never direct. It was all subliminal. It couldn't be direct because the mass audience would say, Hey, no way." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the term is unknown but {{it appears to have}} been familiarly {{associated}} with Hollywood screenwriting by at least 1941. The earliest example given by the Oxford English Dictionary is from Anthony Boucher's mystery novel The Case of the Solid Key (1941), in which a character says [...] "We met cute, as they say in story conferences". As this example implies, the term was already well-known, and in a 1996 The Paris Review interview, screenwriter Billy Wilder, referring to his 1938 screwball comedy film Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (in which two characters meet while shopping for pajamas, one seeking a pajama top and the other a pajama bottom) says that the concept was [...] "a staple of romantic comedies back then". In George Axelrod's play Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1955), a character explains, Dear boy, the beginning of a movie is childishly simple. The boy and girl meet. The only <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is that—in a movie—the boy and the girl must meet in some cute way. They cannot...meet like normal people at, perhaps, a cocktail party or some other social function. No. It is terribly important that they meet cute.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{consider}} the NFL {{to be the}} most [...] "fair" [...] or competitive league, with many different teams having a chance to win each year. In the NFL, complete parity would be a state where on any given Sunday, any given team can win any given game. The illusion of parity in the NFL may be somewhat of a misconception, given that several teams such as the New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers, Indianapolis Colts, and Green Bay Packers have appeared in the playoffs in almost all of the past ten years, while a team such as the Buffalo Bills has a playoff drought that is currently over a decade long. At the same time, you often hear people say [...] "the same teams win every year" [...] when speaking about baseball, but in reality 27 of the 30 teams have made the playoffs since 2008, and all thirty have made it since 2001. Then again, others would say that statistically you could expect some of that variation even in a parity league. Just the same way that you flip a coin ten times in a row, sometimes heads will come up ten times, doesn't mean it's not a fair coin. The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is that a franchise can be struggling and the reason for it can be due to the team's ineptitude when it comes evaluating talent, coaching strategies, developing players, having a good organizational structure, and overall team and player operations.|$|E
5000|$|Sheppard's second single, [...] "Geronimo", {{was issued}} in February 2014 on Empire of Song/Chugg Music. It was {{recorded}} and produced at Analog Heart Studios in Brisbane by Stuart Stuart and written by {{three of the}} band's members, George Sheppard, Amy Sheppard and Jay Bovino. Brendan Plowman of AdamNotEve noted that the [...] "lyrics throughout the song suggest an idea of taking the plunge together. Risking {{it all in the}} hope of something bigger and better that lies ahead, even if it is 'through the curtain of a waterfall' and you don't know what's on the other side" [...] while [...] "the music and repetitive chorus are uplifting and exciting and everyone still can't get enough of it. But it appears this is no accident". George told Plowman how he wrote songs with Amy and Bovino: [...] "We all have very different music tastes ... the <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> when collaborating with two other writers is compromise ... you have to work together to find the common ground ... all of us being happy with it means it will have the widest appeal, if that makes sense". From late April to early May, [...] "Geronimo" [...] spent three weeks at No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart, knocking Pharrell Williams' single [...] "Happy" [...] from the top spot after its 12-week run.
