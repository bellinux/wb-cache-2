500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] is one {{of those}} songs that's in the DNA of so much going on these days that it's hard to know where to start. Its tape collage alone makes it one of the first tracks to use {{sampling}} really successfully. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Brian Eno's idea of the studio-as-instrument comes from this kind of recording.|$|E
2500|$|This new-found Punic militarism alarmed many Romans, {{including}} Cato the Elder who, after {{a voyage}} to Carthage, ended all his speeches, {{no matter what}} the topic, by saying: [...] "Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam" [...] – [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Carthage must be destroyed".|$|E

Frankly <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is not {{in the best interests of}} the Russia to set this kind of precedent, because then the questions arise why can’t other representatives of the separatist movements be allowed at the UN forums.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Sundaygar Dearboy {{was born}} in District 2, Grand Bassa County, Liberia. He {{is the father of}} two and the {{guardian}} of several others. Dearboy graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice from AME Zion College. He is the Project Manager for Liberia Trading & Investment Company (LINTRACO), one of Liberia's newest trading groups. Dearboy has a huge following among Liberians in the diaspora, particularly in the United States. In an interview posted on Oberia.net, Sundaygar said: [...] "Outside Liberia, my music is highly appreciated and supported by those who think my music helps virtually transport and reconnect them with their homeland. I find it gratifying that they support me. However, it is very disappointing that such support is not given to my music or artists locally. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> my music comes fore front as we rebuild our lives and try to reconsolidate our culture and tradition." [...] Speaking on the challenges currently facing the Liberian Music Industry, Dearboy said: [...] "Not many local artists listen to other music and try to emulate or learn from them. Plus, the local market is not accustomed to promoting what belongs to them. They prefer something from outside. Perhaps, the generally quality of production does not meet the standard as those produced in other countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's {{going to be a little}} more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's going on in the world and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon Dahlquist of The Kubrick FAQ {{argues that}} the name change [...] "deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous {{situation}} {{and the man who}} has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that The Shining brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance – once more, perhaps – to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may {{have had a chance to}} escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to." [...] Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two different people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; [...] "I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [...] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly'." ...|$|E

60|$|I am {{of opinion}} that the Americans will show no unwillingness to pay the amount of {{taxation}} which must be exacted from them; and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> as regards their actual means {{they will have the}} power to pay it. But as regards their power of obtaining access to those means, I must confess that I see many difficulties in their way. In the first place they have no financier, no man who by natural aptitude and by long-continued contact with great questions of finance, has enabled himself to handle the money affairs of a nation with a master's hand. In saying this I do not intend to impute any blame to Mr. Chase, the present Secretary of the Treasury. Of his ability to do the work properly had he received the proper training, I am not able to judge. It is not that Mr. Chase is incapable. He may be capable or incapable. But it is that he has not had the education of a national financier, and that he has no one at his elbow to help him who has had that advantage.|$|E
6000|$|That the Didelphia were {{developed}} {{out of some}} ornithodelphous form, as Professor Haeckel supposes, seems to be unquestionable; but the existing Opossums and Kangaroos are certainly extremely modified and remote from their ancestors the [...] "Prodidelphia," [...] of which we have not, at present the slightest knowledge. The mode of origin of the Monodelphia from these {{is a very difficult}} problem, for the most part left open by Professor Haeckel. He considers the Prosimiae, or Lemurs, to be the common stock of the Deciduata, and the Cetacea (with which he includes the Sirenia) to be modified Ungulata. As regards the latter question, I have little doubt that the Sirenia connect the Ungulata with the Proboscidea; and none, that the Cetacea are extremely modified Carnivora. The passage between the Seals and the Cetacea by Zeuglodon is complete. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is much to be said for the opinion, that the Insectivora represent the common stock of the Primates (which passed into them by the Prosimiae), the Cheiroptera, the Rodentia, and the Carnivora. And I am greatly disposed to look for the common root of all the Ungulata, as well, in some ancient non-deciduate Mammals which were more like Insectivora than anything else. On the other hand, the Edentata appear to form a series by themselves.|$|E
50|$|Or {{in another}} translation: <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the ololuge or cry of praise emitted during {{the worship of}} Athena started in Libya, because it is often {{employed}} by Libyan women, who do it extremely well.|$|E
