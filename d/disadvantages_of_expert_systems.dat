40|$|Legal {{expert systems}} use a {{knowledge}} base of legal rules to address legal issues. Such systems {{are said to}} be undesirable (a) because of the difficulty of replicating a multitextured process such as legal reasoning, and (b) because law in its highest and best forms is humanistic rather than mechanistic. Both of these objections seem particularly apt {{in the context of the}} exercise of judicial discretion. This paper identifies some disadvantages of judicial discretion and some benefits of legal expert systems. By reference to a prototype expert system for making bail recommendations, it discusses how the advantages of expert systems can be used to improve the exercise of judicial discretion and how the perceived <b>disadvantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> can be minimized or avoided. 1. The special role of judicial discretion The formulation and application of rules is a flexible partnership between legislators and judges. In some cases, the legislators play the dominant role in the partnership by specifying most or all of the detail relevant to the application of the rule. In other cases, the legislators specify a limited amount of detail and delegate the responsibility for th...|$|E
40|$|Predicting {{the risk}} of toxic and {{environmental}} effects of chemical compounds is of great importance to all chemi-cal industries [1]. <b>Expert</b> <b>systems</b> have shown success in predicting toxic risk by applying established knowledge of toxicology encoded as a knowledge base of structural alerts and a reasoning model. A <b>disadvantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> is that developing new structural alerts requires considerable time and effort from domain experts. In order to expedite this process a software tool has been developed that can automatically mine representations of activating features directly from toxicity datasets and pre-sent them in an interpretable form. Our knowledge discovery tool applies emerging pattern (EP) mining [2]: a form of association rule mining [3] that is well known to computer science, but is relatively new t...|$|R

40|$|The Alvey Report has {{resulted}} in a growing interest in the UK in 'expert systems'. It is fairly generally accepted, at least in the UK, that such systems function in a particular type of way, i. e. they arrive at decisions through a process of rule based inference. It is suggested that it may be more fruitful to regard rule based inference as one approach to the construction <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems,</b> and that proven techniques of operational research may well be more useful in constructing other types <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> Alternative applications <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> are derived {{on the basis of a}} broader definition <b>of</b> an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> in terms <b>of</b> what it does rather than how it does it.

They are capable of this reasoning because of their stored knowledge of a specific area within their memory and their ability to reason. The use of this knowledge allows the <b>Expert</b> <b>System</b> to arrive at particular conclusions and solutions to a problem, similar to the conclusions that human experts arrive at. The novelty of this technology results in defining a need for an explanatory overview <b>of</b> <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> and guidelines to building <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> especially for managers interested in incorporating <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> development and use in the company's framework of operation.
