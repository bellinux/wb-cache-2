5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which {{found its way into}} Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had <b>depressurised</b> over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out of the window and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it.|$|E
5|$|The orbital {{assembly}} of Mir began on February 19, 1986 with {{the launch of}} the Proton-K rocket. Four of the six modules which were later added (Kvant-2 in 1989, Kristall in 1990, Spektr in 1995 and Priroda in 1996) followed the same sequence {{to be added to the}} main Mir complex. Firstly, the module would be launched independently on its own Proton-K and chase the station automatically. It would then dock to the forward docking port on the core module's docking node, then extend its Lyappa arm to mate with a fixture on the node's exterior. The arm would then lift the module away from the forward docking port and rotate it on to the radial port where it was to mate, before lowering it to dock. The node was equipped with only two Konus drogues, which were required for dockings. This meant that, prior to the arrival of each new module, the node would have to be <b>depressurised</b> to allow spacewalking cosmonauts to manually relocate the drogue to the next port to be occupied.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} during the flight, a fire {{developed}} in the cargo section on the main deck; the fire was probably not extinguished before impact. The 'smoke evacuation' checklist calls for the aircraft to be <b>depressurised,</b> and for two of the cabin doors to be opened. No evidence exists that the checklist was followed, or the doors opened. A crew member might have gone into the cargo hold to try to fight the fire. A charred fire extinguisher was later recovered from the wreckage on which investigators found molten metal.|$|E
50|$|Sprinkler valve (otherwise {{known as}} a solenoid valve): The use of {{irrigation}} sprinkler valves as pneumatic valves has become increasingly popular for spudgunning. These valves are intended to be electrically triggered causing a solenoid to <b>depressurise</b> a diaphragm and allow airflow through. It is also possible to remove the solenoid and, instead, to actuate the valve manually with a blowgun to <b>depressurise</b> the diaphragm. Such modifications allow the valve to open as much as 3 to 5 times faster.|$|R
5000|$|Onnes' method {{relied upon}} <b>depressurising</b> the subject gases, {{causing them to}} cool by {{adiabatic}} cooling. This follows from the first law of thermodynamics; ...|$|R
50|$|He {{is killed}} when Bond uses {{a knife to}} shatter the window next to his seat on an aircraft, which <b>depressurises</b> the plane and blows Oddjob out of the window, a fate {{transferred}} to Auric Goldfinger in the film version.|$|R
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be <b>depressurised</b> for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E
2500|$|... "On 25 July 2008, a Boeing Company 747-438 {{aircraft}} carrying 369 {{passengers and}} crew rapidly <b>depressurised</b> following the forceful rupture {{of one of the}} aircraft's emergency oxygen cylinders in the forward cargo hold. The aircraft was cruising at 29,000 ft and was 55 minutes into a flight between Hong Kong and Melbourne." ...|$|E

50|$|The field {{underwent}} a massive £1.3 billion upgrade {{project in the}} mid 1990s, which involved <b>depressurising</b> the entire reservoir and making extensive modifications to {{three of the four}} Brent platforms. This converted them to low-pressure operation, which unlocked significant quantities of natural gas from the reservoir and extended the field life beyond 2010.|$|R
50|$|The captain {{tried to}} land the plane on the sea, but the <b>depressurising</b> cabin and the failing {{circuits}} made that impossible. Additionally, smoke was seeping into the cockpit. Left with no other option, the crew issued life jackets and opened the emergency doors to ensure a quick escape as the plane plunged into the sea below.|$|R
50|$|Once docked the CSM pilot would <b>depressurise</b> the Command Module {{and open}} the hatch to space, so the astronauts on the LESS could use the {{external}} hand-holds on the Command Module to crawl to the hatch and climb inside. The crew would then separate the CSM from the LESS and leave it in lunar orbit {{when they returned to}} Earth.|$|R
50|$|Non-portable {{chambers}} {{are generally}} constructed from steel, {{as it is}} inexpensive, strong and fire resistant. Portable chambers have been constructed from steel, aluminium alloy, and fibre reinforced composites. In some cases the composite material structure is flexible when <b>depressurised.</b>|$|E
50|$|Using two {{adsorbent}} vessels allows near-continuous {{production of}} the target gas. It also permits so-called pressure equalisation, where the gas leaving the vessel being <b>depressurised</b> is used to partially pressurise the second vessel. This results in significant energy savings, and is common industrial practice.|$|E
50|$|On June 30, 1971, {{the crew}} of Soyuz 11 died when their {{spacecraft}} <b>depressurised</b> during re-entry. One of {{the recommendations of the}} investigating government commission was that pressure suits should be worn by future crews during critical phases of their mission - launch, docking and landing.|$|E
5000|$|Zond 6 used a {{relatively}} uncommon technique called [...] "skip reentry" [...] to shed velocity upon returning to Earth. A {{few hours before}} reentry, on 17 November 1968, a faulty O-ring rubber gasket caused the cabin to <b>depressurise,</b> killing all the animal test subjects aboard. Zond 6's parachutes also deployed too early and it crashed in Kazakhstan, near the designated landing area.|$|R
50|$|Three {{days after}} the launch of Salyut 2, the Proton's spent third stage exploded. Thirteen days into its mission, Salyut 2 began to <b>depressurise,</b> and its {{attitude}} control system malfunctioned. An inquiry into the failure initially determined that a fuel line had burst, burning {{a hole in the}} station. It was later discovered that a piece of debris from the third stage had collided with the station, causing the damage.|$|R
40|$|Pre-mining <b>depressurising</b> {{of a deep}} {{ore body}} at the McArthur River mine in {{northern}} Saskatchewan was considered to decrease the risk associated with mining near 5 MPa water pressure and {{increasing the amount of}} ore that can be extracted. Based on a limited amount of field data, a three-dimensional finite element ground-water flow model was developed to predict the amount of water {{that would have to be}} pumped from surface wells or extracted with underground drainholes to meet this goal and the associated magnitude and extent of drawdown that would propagate to the surface over the life of the operation and its impact on surface-water resources. In addition, the results from the preliminary model were used to design a prototype <b>depressurising</b> well and a 30 -day pumping test. Because of the predicted large volume of water that would have to be discharged, another still on-going investigation has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of localized depressurisation in improving mine tunnel stability in conjunction with ground freezing and cementaceous grouting...|$|R
50|$|During routine {{maintenance}} of a liquid-fuelled ICBM, the fuel tank is penetrated by a falling socket. The film traces {{the efforts of the}} maintenance crew and associated military and civilian personnel to recover the potentially disastrous situation before the fuel tank is sufficiently <b>depressurised</b> that the stack collapses and explodes.|$|E
50|$|For {{propaganda}} {{reasons the}} Soviets claimed {{the flight was}} a success. A State Commission investigating the crash later determined that the coronal discharge effect which caused the parachute to jettison would only occur at the 25 mm capsule pressure. If the capsule had been completely <b>depressurised</b> to a high vacuum, the accident would not have occurred.|$|E

50|$|Thunderwing battles {{the entire}} Ark crew, as Prime hesitates, unwilling to risk {{damage to the}} Matrix. Presently, the Matrix itself makes itself known, taking over control of Thunderwing's body and {{revealing}} itself to have been corrupted by evil. The Autobot's are unable to resist {{the power of the}} Dark Matrix until Nightbeat, imprisoned since Issue #62, shoots Thunderwing with a grappling harpoon from the shuttle and <b>depressurises</b> the shuttlebay, sucking Thunderwing and the Matrix out into deep space.|$|R
40|$|A new {{inverted}} biphasic catalysis system using supercritical CO 2 as the stationary catalyst {{phase and}} water as the continuous phase is described for Rh-catalysed hydroformylation of polar substrates. Product separation and catalyst recycling is possible without <b>depressurising</b> the autoclave. Turnover numbers {{of up to}} 3560 were obtained in three consecutive runs and Rh leaching into the aqueous phase was below 0. 3 ppm. The absence of organic solvents allows convenient product isolation from the aqueous layer {{without the need for}} waste water treatment...|$|R
50|$|Before {{internal}} inspection {{the valve}} {{must be removed}} after <b>depressurising</b> and verifying that the valve is open. Cylinders containing breathing gases do not need special precautions for discharge except that high oxygen fraction gases should not be released in an enclosed space because of the fire hazard. If the valve is blocked or stuck closed {{it may be necessary}} to release the pressure by removing the burst disc or drilling into the valve body below the valve seat. These operations require care to avoid injury.|$|R
50|$|The {{density of}} both gases and liquids {{depends on the}} {{pressure}} and temperature of the fluid. Thus volumes measured in cold conditions or in pressurised conditions will be lower than the same mass of fluid at warmer or <b>depressurised</b> conditions. This fact {{gives rise to the}} necessity of choosing a benchmark pressure and temperature in which all 'net' volumes will be expressed.|$|E
50|$|Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi is {{reported}} {{as saying that}} the disaster began when a pipeline valve failed under pressure allowing the oil to leak into the sewer. Selest Kilinda, the managing director of KPC, {{is reported}} to have said the spill occurred from two pipelines, and that engineers had already <b>depressurised</b> the Sinai pipeline but not in time to prevent fuel leaking into the sewer.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, UNSW's players {{competed in}} regular {{competition}} {{for the first time}} in a combined Universities side with Sydney University. The club also fielded a team at intervarsity in Perth, which created headline stories. Some unnamed players almost <b>depressurised</b> their plane by puncturing holes in the window seals and many players jumped from one side of the plane to the other trying to get it to roll.|$|E
50|$|For wind speeds {{greater than}} 5.7 m/s at ridge height then {{the side walls}} are in pro-flux mode with a U value {{dramatically}} increasing with wind speed (Fig 6) At wind speeds greater than 9.0 m/s at ridge height the lee-ward switches from contra-flux to pro-flux mode. The average U-value for the four walls is now 0.36 W/(m2K), which is significantly greater than the 0.2 W/(m2K) for an air-tight construction. These changes from contra-flux to pro-flux mode could be delayed by <b>depressurising</b> the building below -10 Pa.|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional foam {{mouldings}} {{made of a}} biodegradable thermoplastic polymer, {{in particular}} starch, and preferably a second biodegradable component can be manufactured in a discontinuous process by heating the polymer, {{in the form of}} an expandable bead or sheet or the like, in a mould having any desired shape under pressure in the presence of a blowing agent and subsequently <b>depressurising.</b> The second component can be used to enhance the water-resistance or the mould product and can be applied after, or preferably during or before the moulding step...|$|R
5000|$|Slow, or gradual, {{decompression}} occurs slowly {{enough to}} go unnoticed and might only be detected by instruments. [...] This type of decompression may also come about from a failure to pressurize as an aircraft climbs to altitude. An {{example of this is}} the 2005 Helios Airways Flight 522 crash, in which the pilots failed to check the aircraft was pressurising automatically and then to react to the warnings that the aircraft was <b>depressurising,</b> eventually losing consciousness (along with most of the passengers and crew) from hypoxia.|$|R
50|$|Salyut 2 (OPS-1) (Салют-2 meaning Salute 2) was a Soviet {{space station}} which was {{launched}} in 1973 {{as part of the}} Salyut programme. It was the first Almaz military space station to fly. Within two weeks of launch the station had lost attitude control and <b>depressurised,</b> leaving it unusable. Its orbit decayed and it re-entered the atmosphere on 28 May 1973, without any crews having visited it.|$|E
50|$|The {{maximum length}} of time the suits {{may be used in}} a vacuum is 125 minutes. The time is limited because the oxygen flow to the suit is enough for life support, but {{insufficient}} to carry away the cosmonaut's body heat and longer use of the suit risks Heat exhaustion. If the capsule becomes <b>depressurised,</b> either accidentally or deliberately to extinguish a fire, it must land within that time.|$|E
50|$|Methane adsorbed into a {{solid coal}} matrix (coal macerals) will be {{released}} if the coal seam is <b>depressurised.</b> Methane may be extracted by drilling wells into the coal seam. The goal is to decrease the water pressure by pumping water from the well. The decrease in pressure allows methane to desorb from the coal and flow as a gas up the well to the surface. Methane is then compressed and piped to market.|$|E
500|$|Before {{starting}} {{work the}} cylinder must be identified from the labelling and permanent stamp markings, and the ownership and contents verified, and the valve {{must be removed}} after <b>depressurising</b> and verifying that the valve is open. Cylinders containing breathing gases do not need special precautions for discharge except that high oxygen fraction gases should not be released in an enclosed space because of the fire hazard. [...] Before inspection the cylinder must be clean and free of loose coatings, corrosion products and other materials which may obscure the surface.|$|R
50|$|They {{advance on}} the Moonbase through the vacuum of the Moon’s surface. Two Cybermen {{on the surface}} damage the aerial, {{preventing}} the Moonbase from contacting Earth; however, a relief ship is on the way. The Cybermen use radio beams to reactivate their zombies inside the base, who infiltrate the Gravitron {{and use it to}} deflect a relief ship sent by Earth into the sun. A hole is blasted in the wall, which <b>depressurises</b> the base, but Hobson and Benoit use a coffee tray to plug the leak. The depressurisation deactivates Evans and the other zombies.|$|R
50|$|When Koenig recovers, he and Maya quickly seal off and <b>depressurise</b> Alpha, {{then proceed}} to the {{disposal}} site in Eagle Two. Older and located some distance from Disposal Areas One and Two, it {{was not involved in}} the cataclysmic explosion of 1999. Six concrete-capped shafts store atomic waste ten thousand feet below the surface. One will be blasted open, then an atomic trigger-device introduced and remote-detonated to start the chain reaction. From above, Verdeschi's Eagle Three spots a moon buggy parked amid the surrounding hills; Sanderson has driven from Alpha and is waiting for them.|$|R
