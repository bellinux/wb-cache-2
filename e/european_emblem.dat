50|$|As {{in several}} other fables by Aesop, the lesson it is {{teaching}} appears ambiguous. In Classical times {{it was not the}} Tortoise’s plucky conduct in taking on a bully that was emphasised but the Hare’s foolish over-confidence. An old Greek source comments that 'many people have good natural abilities which are ruined by idleness; on the other hand, sobriety, zeal and perseverance can prevail over indolence'. When the fable entered the <b>European</b> <b>emblem</b> tradition, the precept to ‘hasten slowly’ (festina lente) was recommended to lovers by Otto van Veen in his Emblemata Amorum (1608), using a relation of the story. There the infant figure of Eros is shown passing through a landscape and pointing to the tortoise as it overtakes the sleeping hare under the motto “perseverance winneth.” Later interpreters too have asserted that the fable's moral is the proverbial 'the more haste, the worse speed' (Samuel Croxall) or have applied to it the biblical observation that 'the race is not to the swift' (Ecclesiastes 9.11).|$|E

25|$|Parallel to {{the process}} of {{development}} and consolidation of <b>European</b> royal <b>emblems</b> from the late 13th century, collections of them, the Armorials, displayed lists of kingdoms and their royal symbols. In the case of Galicia, antiquity and the prominence which the Kingdom had had during centuries saw its inclusion in the early European armorials, however the absence of an exclusive symbol for Galician kings, who were also kings of León since the 12th century, forced to the medieval heraldists to use Canting arms, which was a symbol derived from the phonetics of the name.|$|R

2500|$|Carlisle {{were often}} {{referred}} to as 'The Foxes' due to the local connection with huntsman John Peel. In 1970 the club badge changed to reflect this and featured a golden fox jumping over the abbreviation C.U.F.C. The fox further became part of the club's image with a mounted stuffed fox named Olga (an anagram of [...] "goal") which is traditionally carried onto the pitch by the mascot before the match. Later versions of this badge featured a fox's head with a castle (representing Carlisle Castle) and a fox jumping through a ring of stars, somewhat resembling the <b>European</b> Union <b>emblem.</b>|$|R

500|$|For {{most of its}} history, the Byzantine Empire did {{not know}} or use {{heraldry}} in the West <b>European</b> sense. Various <b>emblems</b> ( [...] , sēmeia; sing. σημείον, sēmeion) were used in official occasions and for military purposes, such as banners or shields displaying various motifs such as the cross or the labarum. The use of the cross, and of images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and various saints is also attested on seals of officials, but these were personal rather than family emblems.|$|R
5000|$|The blue outer circle {{surrounding}} the emblem shows {{the continuity of}} the U.S. joint interagency effort between all elements involved in operations to aid Lebanon and protect American citizens. The gold olive branch wreath represents peaceful humanitarian assistance. Lebanon and Cyprus highlight the U.S. enduring partnerships with both governments and specific joint task force support to the American embassies in Beirut and Nicosia. The compass is derived from the U.S. <b>European</b> Command (EUCOM) <b>emblem</b> and indicates the JTF-L willingness to accomplish all assigned missions throughout the region whenever called upon. Within EUCOM, the circle emphasizes component commands providing Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines who are working together in the joint arena. The motto [...] "Strengthen Hope" [...] originates from remarks made by the President of the United States and communicates a strategic objective to support the people of Lebanon and provide lasting regional stability.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{outcomes}} of olanzapine- and valproate-treated patients in an observational study of acute mania with the results of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing the same treatments. Methods: <b>EMBLEM</b> (<b>European</b> Mania in Bipolar Evaluation of Medication) was a 2 -year, prospective, observational study of health outcomes associated with the treatment of mania. Severity of mania and depression were assessed at baseline and 6 weeks using the YMRS and the 5 -item version of the HAMD, respectively. Results: 621 patients were analysed (n= 107 valproate, n= 514 olanzapine). Both groups improved from baseline to 6 weeks in mean YMRS and HAMD- 5 total scores, with greater mean improvements in the olanzapine compared with the valproate group. Olanzapine was associated with more weight gain and less gastrointestinal difficulties than valproate. Discussion: The EMBLEM results support those of the RCT, which suggest that olanzapine monotherapy seems to be more effective than valproate monotherapy in the treatment of acute mania...|$|R
40|$|Background: The risk of {{switching}} from mania to depression in bipolar disorder has been poorly studied. Large observational studies {{may be useful}} in identifying variables that predict switch to depression after mania and provide data on medication use and outcomes in "real world" patients. Method: <b>EMBLEM</b> (<b>European</b> Mania in Bipolar Longitudinal Evaluation of Medication) is a 2 -year, prospective, observational study of patients with a manic/mixed episode. Symptom severity measures included Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder scale (CGI-BP), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and 5 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Switching was defined using CGI-BP mania and depression such that patients changed from manic and not depressed to depressed but not manic over two consecutive observations within the first 12 weeks of follow-tip. Cox proportional hazards models identified baseline variables independently associated with switch to depression. Results: Of 2390 patients who participated in the maintenance phase (i. e. up to 24 months), 120 (5. 0 %) switched to depression within the first 12 weeks. Factors associated with greater switching to depression include previous depressive episodes, substance abuse, greater CGI-BP overall severity and benzodiazepine use. Factors associated with lower switching rates were greater CGI-BP depression, lower YMRS severity and atypical antipsychotic use. Limitations: The definition of switching biased against patients with mixed episodes being likely to switch. Conclusions: Strictly defined, switch to depression from mania occurs in a small proportion of bipolar patients. Clinical history, illness severity, co-morbidities and treatment patterns are associated with switching to depression. Atypical antipsychotics may protect against switch to depression.
