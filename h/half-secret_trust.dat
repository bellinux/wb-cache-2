5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully secret trust, but not a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust,</b> would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret trust shared a single justification. A <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust</b> appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust.</b> Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust</b> should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust,</b> such as where the {{beneficiaries}} of the trust cannot be shown, or communication is not at or before {{the execution of the}} will.|$|E
5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to {{at all on the}} face of the will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere. The trustee will instead be named only a beneficiary. In the case of a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust,</b> the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} also of {{importance}} when classifying the trust as either constructive or express, {{a matter of}} considerable debate. On one view, if the traditional theory is correct, secret trusts are created by the courts, and are thus constructive; if the more modern view is correct, the trusts exist without the court's permission, and are express trusts. However, a secret trust {{does not have to}} obey the separate formalities of the Law of Property Act 1925, even when it concerns land and one solution to this problem is to consider them constructive. Some commentators believe that <b>half-secret</b> <b>trusts</b> may fall into a different category to fully secret trusts in this regard.|$|R
500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{practical}} rules in these trusts' use, which span both fully secret and <b>half-secret</b> <b>trusts.</b> If a testator alters the terms of the trust or the trust property, he must inform the intended trustee; if not, as in Re Colin Cooper, the trustee will be permitted to keep the newly added property. Where the trustees are co-owners of the property, informing them of the trust's terms or amendments becomes complicated. If they hold the property as tenants-in-common, only those tenants who were informed of the trust are bound to follow it. Where they hold the property as joint tenants, they are all bound by the trust if even one tenant accepts it before the execution of the will. Where they hold the property as joint tenants and some accept it, but only after the execution of the will, only those who accepted it are bound. This area has been called [...] "rather illogical".|$|R
2500|$|Secret trusts are {{sometimes}} considered constructive trusts. They {{do not follow}} the Wills Act 1837; a requirement for express trusts. The argument {{is that it is}} such trusts are intended to prevent fraud by statute. Under this rule, secret trusts would be constructive trusts; the reason {{they do not have to}} follow the Wills Act is because they are created by the courts. This is a difficult argument with which to justify <b>half-secret</b> <b>trusts,</b> because since the will mentions the trust, fraud is not directly possible. A more modern argument is that secret trusts are independent and operate outside the will. The trust was created by the donor and trustee during the donor's life, and simply not constituted until his death; it does not have to follow the Wills Act, because it was not created by a will. This view was expressed by Megarry VC in Re Snowden, where he said [...] "The whole basis of secret trusts...is that they operate outside the will, changing nothing that is written in it, and allowing it to operate according to its tenor, but then fastening a trust on to the property in the hands of the recipient". This suggests that secret trusts are not constructive trusts but rather express trusts.|$|R
5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust,</b> the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust</b> must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
500|$|With a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust,</b> {{the fact}} that the {{beneficiary}} of the will holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust. This must go further than the mere [...] "hope" [...] that the beneficiary (again I believe this should read [...] "trustee" [...] - the beneficiary is the passive party to a trust) of the will will act in accordance with its terms. The requirements for a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust</b> to be valid are similar to those for fully secret trusts, and were laid out in Blackwell v Blackwell, where a testator gave five trustees pieces of property, instructing them (in the will) to hold on to this property as they had been asked. Prior to the testator's death, the trustees had all been told what to do with the property. Lord Sumner said that: ...|$|E
500|$|Some authors place fully {{secret and}} half-secret trusts in {{different}} categories, including Alastair Hudson and Lionel Astor Sheridan. To this {{it has been}} argued that, if the [...] "outside the will" [...] theory is the true basis for the secret trust, whether the mention of the existence of the trust {{on the face of the}} will should affect its nature. In Hudson's opinion, fully secret trusts are constructive trusts, because they exist to prevent fraud. But sometimes they are express trusts, if [...] "au dehor" [...] doctrine is concerned. Half-secret trusts are constructive trust, because their mention in wills makes fraud unlikely; they are instead in line with a constructive notice, e.g. the use of sealed document. The House of Lords in Blackwell v Blackwell, however, considered the <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust</b> to have the same basis as the fully secret trust.|$|E
500|$|Secret trusts do {{not comply}} with the {{formality}} requirements (such as witnessing) laid down in the Wills Act 1837. Despite this, the courts have chosen to uphold them as valid. Although various justifications have been given for this, they are generally categorised as either based on preventing fraud, or as regarding secret trusts as outside (dehors) {{the operation of the}} Wills Act. The first is considered the traditional approach [...] if the courts do not recognise secret trusts, the trustee given the property in the will would be able to keep it for himself, committing fraud. The fraud theory utilises the equitable maxim that [...] "equity will not allow a statute {{to be used as a}} cloak for fraud". A more modern view is that secret trusts exist outside the will altogether, and thus do not have to comply with it. Accepting this theory would undermine the operation of the Wills Act, since the Wills Act is designed to cover all testamentary dispositions. To avoid this problem, one approach has been to reclassify the secret trust as inter vivos ("between the living") but this creates other problems. There have also been attempts to conclude that <b>half-secret</b> <b>trusts</b> rest on a different basis to fully secret trusts, although this has been disapproved by the House of Lords, primarily on practical grounds.|$|R
500|$|The {{result of}} the {{emergence}} of the [...] "outside the will" [...] theory has been seen with respect to witnesses to the will. Section 15 of the Wills Act states that any person [...] " [...] the execution of any will to whom or to whose wife or husband any beneficial ... shall be thereby given or made, such ... shall, so far only as concerns such person attesting the execution of such will, or the wife or husband of such person, or any person claiming under such person or wife or husband, be utterly null and void". In Re Young, an attesting witness was the beneficiary of a secret trust. The court decided that [...] "the Wills Act 1837 {{had nothing to do with}} it" [...] and the secret trust valid. The effect of the Wills Act 1968 has been to allow the trustee of a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust</b> to attest the will and this may also apply to the fully secret trust.|$|E
500|$|Where a {{beneficiary}} under {{a secret}} trust predeceases the testator, {{his or her}} personal representative will inherit instead, as in Re Gardner. If the gift had been made directly as part of testator's will it would have lapsed and formed part {{of his or her}} residuary estate by the beneficiary's death, but since he or she inherits {{as a result of a}} separate secret trust that rule does not apply. Where the trustee of a secret trust predeceases the testator, or renounces his trusteeship before the death of the testator, the position of the secret trust in unclear. In the case of a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust,</b> the trust ought to be good on the basis that [...] "equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee". Of a fully secret trust, it was indicated by Lord Buckmaster in Blackwell v Blackwell that such a trust might not fail: [...] "the legatee might defeat the whole purpose by renouncing the legacy... I entertain no doubt that the Court, having once admitted the evidence of the trust, would interfere to prevent its defeat." [...] Against this, it has been argued that the arrangement is the result of a personal obligation as thus fails if renounced or if the trustee predeceases the testator.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} distinction between half-secret and fully secret trusts concerns the communication {{of the terms}} of the trust. Communication must be either at or before the execution of the will, in contrast to fully secret trusts, when it may postdate the will so long as it predates the death of the testator. In Blackwell, Viscount Sumner said that: [...] " [...] testator cannot reserve to himself a power of making future unwitnessed dispositions by merely naming a trustee and leaving the purposes of the trust to be supplied afterwards", a passage given its traditional interpretation in cases such as Re Keen, becoming a [...] "cornerstone" [...] of what has become known as the 'prior acceptance rule'. Although that interpretation has been confirmed as the law in further cases, Professor John Mee said that Viscount Sumner suggested that acceptance by the trustee (whether of a half-secret or fully secret trust) must take place within the testator's lifetime before the execution of the will. Mee hoped High Court would make clarification on whether prior acceptance exists and therefore the law regarding acceptance should be different between half-secret and fully secret trusts. Acceptance of the <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust</b> is not entirely different to fully secret trusts but there are subtle and decisive variations; it can be communicated either directly, or tacitly.|$|E
500|$|Two further {{problems}} are apparent {{when considering the}} fraud theory {{in the context of}} half-secret trusts. Since the will mentions the trust, it is impossible for the trustee to deny the existence of the trust. Whether or not the intended beneficiaries can be ascertained, in case of inter vivo transaction, the trust-beneficiary cannot benefit personally and any meaning of fraud seems apparent because fraud requires an intention to act dishonestly. It appears to create an alternative route: the trustee may bring false oral testimony in favour of a third party who was not the intended beneficiary, a party that cannot benefit if the law did not uphold half-secret trusts in conclusion but it could operate without court's interference. Secondly, a <b>half-secret</b> <b>trust</b> ought to fail for uncertainty, being a trust with no terms, with a resulting trust to the residuary legatee. Under the rule of three uncertainties in private trust, half or fully secretly trust ought to fail because of lack of intentional element. Those in favour of its enforcement must therefore observe the imposition of resulting trust as required under three certainties rule, and the [...] "fraud" [...] theory seems insufficient to do so, since there is no sublet and significant impact for dishonest act and if otherwise fraud can be upheld; and therefore no conduct {{on the part of the}} trustee to warrant it. The deceased's intended disposition remains imperfectly constituted and the intended beneficiary's claim is thus weaker than the residuary legatee's. Whilst one response has been to suggest that whether a resulting trust or enforcement of the secret trust is most appropriate remedy is a question for the courts, subsequent cases have typically defined the automatic resulting trust, as in this case, as operating as a matter of law and not a question for the courts, and this should be settled by parliament legislation.|$|E

The testator intends his absolute gift to be employed as he and not as the donee desires; he tells the proposed donee of this intention and, either by express promise or by the tacit promise, which is satisfied by acquiescence, the proposed donee encourages him to bequeath the money on the faith that his intention will be carried out.|$|E
