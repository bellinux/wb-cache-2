Since a direct numerical deconvolution technique with staircase approximation seemed to meet the requisites of the 'ideal method' rather well, this method was chosen {{as a starting point for}} the development and validation of an appropriate method for the determination of drug input. In Chapter I the theoretical basis of the application of linear time-invariant systems is presented.

Correspondingly, if BN is stimulated by a highly coherent set of <b>input</b> <b>impulses,</b> it fires and emits an output impulse. In the BN terminology we say that BN binds the elementary events (<b>input</b> <b>impulses)</b> into a single event (output impulse). The binding happens if the <b>input</b> <b>impulses</b> are enough coherent in time, and does not happen if those impulses do not have required degree of coherence.|$|R

40|$|Acoustic pulse {{reflectometry}} is {{a useful}} non-invasive technique for measuring the <b>input</b> <b>impulse</b> response, <b>input</b> impedance and internal dimensions of ducts. A sound pulse is injected into the duct under investigation and the resultant reflections are recorded. Suitable analysis of the reflections then yields the <b>input</b> <b>impulse</b> response, from which both the input impedance of the duct and its cross-sectional area {{as a function of}} distance can be calculated. However, an <b>input</b> <b>impulse</b> response measurement made using acoustic pulse reflectometry generally contains an offset. Unless this offset is removed, the application of a bore reconstruction algorithm results in a calculated duct profile which expands or contracts spuriously. In this paper, the offset introduced into reflectometry measurements is shown to consist of both constant and time-varying components. The origins of these DC and time-varying offsets are examined and methods of preventing or removing them are investigated. Finally, improved accuracy bore reconstructions, calculated from <b>input</b> <b>impulse</b> response measurements where any offset has been eliminated, are presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical and experimental {{study on the}} spectrogram image analysis of error signals for minimizing the <b>impulse</b> <b>input</b> noises in the active suppression of noise. Impulse inputs of some specific wave patterns as primary noises to a one-dimensional duct with the length of 1800 [*]mm are shown. The convergence speed of the adaptive feedforward algorithm based on the least mean square approach was controlled by a normalized step size which was incorporated into the algorithm. The variations of the step size govern the stability {{as well as the}} convergence speed. Because of this reason, a normalized step size is introduced as a new method for the control of impulse noise. The spectrogram images which indicate the degree of the attenuation of the <b>impulse</b> <b>input</b> noises are considered to represent the attenuation with the new method. The algorithm is extensively investigated in both simulation and real-time control experiment. It is demonstrated that the suggested algorithm worked with a nice stability and performance against impulse noises.

40|$|Acoustic pulse {{reflectometry}} {{has become}} {{established as a}} useful non-invasive method of measuring the <b>input</b> <b>impulse</b> response, <b>input</b> impedance and internal dimensions of ducts. The technique involves injecting a sound pulse via a source tube into the duct under test. The reflections returning from the duct are recorded by a microphone embedded in the source tube wall and then analysed. The source tube is necessary to separate the forward and backward travelling waves. Although this provides {{an effective means of}} isolating the input pulse and the duct reflections, the attenuation of the signal while travelling in the source tube can be large, resulting in poor bandwidth <b>input</b> <b>impulse</b> response measurements.
