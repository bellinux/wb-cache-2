40|$|Due to the {{complicated}} tooth geometry of worm gears, their design to achieve high capacity and favourable performance is a tedious task, and the optimum design is hardly to obtain. In order {{to overcome this}} problem, the authors developed an integrated approach which consists of three modules: numerical analysis, three-dimensional simulation and finite element analysis. It provides {{a powerful tool for}} optimum design of worm gears and is a general approach applicable for various types of worm gears. As case studies, two designs using the approach have been conducted, one for cylindrical <b>involute</b> <b>worm</b> gearing and the other for double enveloping worm gearing...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} has been developed by the authors to estimate the load share of worm gear drives, and to calculate the instantaneous tooth meshing stiffness and loaded transmission errors. In the approach, the finite element (FE) modelling {{is based on the}} modified tooth geometry, which ensures that the worm gear teeth are in localized contact. The geometric modelling method for <b>involute</b> <b>worm</b> gears allows the tooth elastic deformation and tooth root stresses of worm gear drives under different load conditions to be investigated. On the basis of finite element analysis, the instantaneous meshing stiffness and loaded transmission errors are obtained and the load share is predicted. In comparison with existing methods, this approach applies loaded tooth contact analysis and provides more accurate load capacity rating of worm gear drives...|$|E

Based on {{the theory}} of gear mesh, the contact line {{equation}} of <b>involute</b> offset cylindrical <b>worm</b> gearing, which is consisted of an involute helical gear with few teeth and a face gear in substance, is obtained. Furthermore, in order to investigate the influence of design parameters {{on the performance of}} contact line, numerical simulation of which is carried out. Analysis results indicate that an appropriate increase in helix angle and modulus as well as the teeth number of worm, reduction in the teeth number of worm gear can make the contact line performance better...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} many types of {{reducers}} based on work of gear trains, which transfer torque. The most popular reducers are with such type of gearing as an <b>involute</b> gear, a <b>worm</b> drive and an eccentrically cycloid gear. A new type of the reducer will be represented in this work. It is a wave reducer with the modified profile of the tooth close to {{the profile of the}} tooth of Novikov gearing. So such reducers can be widely used in drives of difficult technical mechanisms, for example, in mechatronics, robotics and in drives of exact positioning. In addition, the distribution of loading in gearing of teeth of a reducer was analyzed in this paper. It proves that the modified profile of the tooth allows distributing loading to several teeth in gearing. As a result, an admissible loading ability of a reducer becomes higher. The aim of the research is to define a possibility to reduce overall dimensions of a reducer without changing the gear ratio or to increase the gear ratio without changing overall dimensions. So, the result of this work will be used in further research...|$|R
