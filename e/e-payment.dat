40|$|Abstract. Conditional e-cash or {{conditional}} <b>e-payments</b> {{have been}} introduced by Shi et al. as the means for enabling electronic payments {{to be based on}} the outcome of a certain condition not known in advance. In this framework, a payer obtains an electronic coin and can transfer it to a payee under a certain condition. Once the outcome of the condition is known, if it was favorable to the payee, the payee can deposit the coin; otherwise, the payer keeps the money. In this work, we formalize conditional payments and give a scheme to achieve conditional <b>e-payments</b> that outperforms the original solution in several respects. ...|$|R
5000|$|However, the Indian {{banking system}} suffers from some defects due to certain {{socio-cultural}} factors which hampers {{the spread of}} the <b>e-payments</b> culture even though there are many effective electronic payment channels and systems in place.

A relatively small percentage of the population pays their bills electronically and most of that population is from urban India-the metropolitans. Also in some cases the transaction is done partially online and partially [...] "offline". The main reason for this apathy to switch to <b>e-payments</b> comes from lack of awareness of the customer despite various efforts by the Government.|$|R
