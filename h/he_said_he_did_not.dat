5|$|In a new {{affidavit}} (his second affidavit {{and third}} statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He {{said he had}} met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila {{did not know how to}} use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E

5|$|As Shaw grew older, his {{reputation}} as a dramatic actor grew stronger, and he became known for a sharp intelligence and dignified style. Although his good looks diminished, reviewers felt that he used his florid and weatherbeaten face well in evoking grandeur and self-assuredness in such roles as generals, priests and his familiar Shakespearean parts. In 1956, his wife Margaret Delamere died; she was survived by their daughter Drusilla. Shaw began a romantic relationship in the mid-1950s with Joan Ingpen, the well-known classical music and opera talent agent who had previously represented him. The two were romantically involved, to the point that she took his surname, until Shaw's death. During the 1980s, however, Shaw also had a brief relationship with Harriet Ravenscroft, the mother of the disc jockey John Peel, whom he met while performing at Ludlow Castle at Ludlow. He split his time between Ingpen and Ravenscroft on a four-day rotating basis to which both women consented. Although Peel got along with Shaw and said he made his mother happy, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel comfortable with the arrangement. He felt it disrupted his mother's friendships and prospects for a more stable relationship.|$|E
5|$|The Adelaide leak was {{the revelation}} {{to the press}} of a dressing-room {{incident}} during the third Test, a cricket match played during the 1932–33 Ashes series between Australia and England, more {{commonly known as the}} Bodyline series. During the course of play on 14 January 1933, the Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart by a ball delivered by Harold Larwood. Although not badly hurt, Woodfull was shaken and dismissed shortly afterwards. On his return to the Australian dressing room, Woodfull was visited by the managers of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet. Warner enquired after Woodfull's health, but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to speak to the Englishman owing to the Bodyline tactics England were using, leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken. The matter became public knowledge when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January. Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at the time, and the players were horrified that the confrontation became public knowledge.|$|E

25|$|His {{relationship}} with Straus was often strained. Giroux, more the literary man, was often {{at odds with}} Straus, who was primarily a businessman. Farrar, Straus & Giroux never published his 25th-anniversary anthology, which he also edited, as Straus took offense to his portrayal in Giroux's introduction. Giroux did not complete his memoirs because <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to write negatively about Straus. For his part, Straus counted Giroux's joining his company as the significant event in its history.|$|E

25|$|In October 1935 District Attorney William E. Parke {{requested}} that {{a grand jury}} investigate the fatal shooting of Evelyn Hoey. The prosecutor asked that the shooting be studied {{as well as the}} conduct of members of the coroner's jury, and people with whom they had been in contact. Particularly he wanted to identify their association with certain newspaper men who covered the inquest. Parke believed the jury's verdict indicated they felt a homicide had been committed.

25|$|On 8 May 1985, Reyat {{bought a}} Micronta digital {{automobile}} clock at the Radio Shack store in Duncan. Designed for a 12-volt automobile electrical system, {{it could also}} be powered by a 12-volt lantern battery. The 24-hour alarm activated a buzzer, but he returned a week later for an electrical relay after asking how to get the buzzer signal to power another device. Wiretappers recorded nine telephone calls between Parmar's residence in Vancouver and Reyat from either his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island that month, which got Reyat added to the list of persons being monitored for terrorist activities. The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003 when at first <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know what three clocks he had bought could be used for. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device to blow up a bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device. In that case, the relay could be used to trigger the detonator circuit for a blasting cap which would provide the initial shock needed to detonate larger explosives such as dynamite.|$|E
