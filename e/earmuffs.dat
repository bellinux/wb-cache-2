40|$|Background and Aims. With {{technological}} advances in NICUs the survival rate of preterm infants has been increased. Because NICU environment {{is a potent}} source of stress for infants, its modification is an essential measure to decrease infants’ morbidity. The {{purposes of this study}} were to compare the effects of wearing <b>earmuff</b> and provision silence for infants on their motor responses and gaining weight. Methods. In a randomized clinical trial 96 preterm infants were enrolled. Their motor responses were evaluated for two consecutive days in the morning and afternoon shifts, in the groups of <b>earmuff</b> and silence, and at similar time points in the control group. Also their weight was measured at days 1 and 10. Results. In the two intervention groups, means of motor responses in infants were significantly less than in the control group, and weight gain of infants was more than the control group. However weight gain was more pronounced in the <b>earmuff</b> group. Conclusion. Both interventions led to decreasing number of motor responses and improvement of weight gain pattern, but these effects were more pronounced in <b>earmuff</b> group; thus because implementation of silence in NICUs has many barriers, it is suggested to use <b>earmuff</b> for preterm infants in these units. This trial obtained IRCT registration number IRCT 2012092010812 N 2...|$|R

500|$|Several {{critics have}} commented on Frink's inventions. Patrick Goss of MSN's Tech & Gadgets wrote that [...] "When {{it comes to}} gizmos, Frink is the king", and listed the Death Ray {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} gadgets featured in The Simpsons. Although he added that it [...] "was not one of [...] most successful," [...] since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa. On the same list, Goss also featured Frink's automatic phone dialer, intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the four stomachs to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger <b>earmuffs.</b> In a profile about Frink, the publication UGO Networks wrote: [...] "Where would the town be without your Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics?

[...] Howard Waldrop and Lawrence Person of Locus listed the scene in The Simpsons Movie that features Frink's drilling machine invention as one of the highlights of the film.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of sound reduction on physiological variables in premature infants in neonatal intensive care. Ten premature infants born between 27 and 36 weeks gestation wore a specially designed <b>earmuff</b> cap for a 45 -minute rest period. Heart rate, respiration rate, oxygen saturation level and behavioral state were measured and compared to a similar 45 -minute control period without the <b>earmuff</b> cap. Subjects showed a significant decrease (p =. 050) in mean respiration rate, and a significant increase (p 3 ̆c. 02) in mean oxygen saturation level with the <b>earmuff</b> cap on. No {{significant differences were found}} in heart rate between the experimental condition and the control condition. Behavioral state was documented only as a potentially confounding variable, however a significant decrease (p 3 ̆c. 05) in the time spent awake and a significant increase (p 3 ̆c. 05) in the time spent in quiet sleep rather than active sleep occurred with the <b>earmuff</b> cap on.

50|$|The {{amount of}} noise {{reduction}} from dual hearing protection is NOT a {{sum of the}} noise reductions ratings from the two devices. For example, if wearing an earplug with a NRR of 25 dB and an <b>earmuff</b> with an NRR of 20 dB, the combined protection would not be 45 dB. Instead, 5 dB should {{be added to the}} higher of the two NRRs. In the preceding example, the combined <b>earmuff</b> and earplug NRR would be estimated at 30 dB (25 dB plus 5).|$|R
5000|$|Workers {{may want}} to wear their hearing aids under an <b>earmuff.</b> According to OSHA, hearing aids {{should not be used}} in areas with {{dangerous}} noise levels.

40|$|The vacuolar protein sorting 75 (Vps 75) histone {{chaperone}} {{participates in}} chromatin assembly and disassembly at both active and inactive genes through the preferential binding to histone H 3 –H 4. Vps 75 {{is also one}} of two histone chaperones, along with antisilencing factor 1, that promotes histone H 3 -Lys- 56 acetylation by the regulation of Ty 1 transposition protein 109 (Rtt 109) histone acetyltransferase. Here, we report the x-ray crystal structure of Vps 75 and carry out biochemical studies to characterize its interaction with Rtt 109. We find that the Vps 75 structure forms a homodimeric “headphone” architecture that includes an extended helical dimerization domain and <b>earmuff</b> domains at opposite ends and sides of the dimerization domain. Despite the similar overall architecture with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein 1 and human SET/TAF- 1 β/INHAT histone chaperones, Vps 75 shows several unique features including the relative disposition of the <b>earmuff</b> domains to the dimerization domain, characteristics of the <b>earmuff</b> domains, and a pronounced cleft {{at the center of the}} Vps 75 dimer. These differences appear to correlate with the unique function of Vps 75 to interact with Rtt 109 for histone acetylation. Our biochemical studies reveal that two surfaces on the <b>earmuff</b> domain of Vps 75 participate in Rtt 109 interaction with a stoichiometry of 2 : 1, thus leaving the pronounced central cleft of the Vps 75 dimer largely accessible for histone binding. Taken together, our data provide a structural framework for understanding how Vps 75 mediates both nucleosome assembly and histone acetylation by Rtt 109...|$|R
500|$|Established in 1917 as {{a private}} corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest straw hats.

40|$|Producing {{intermediate}} progenitors {{is one of}} {{the critical}} strategies for stem cells to amplify their output and generate diversity, allowing stem cells to meet demanding requirement during development, homeostasis and tissue repair. In contrast to stem cells, intermediate progenitors possess restricted developmental potential limiting the number and types of their progeny. Failure to establish or maintain restricted potential can perturb tissue development and homeostasis, and probably contributes to tumor initiation. My thesis work revealed the mechanisms that distinguish intermediate progenitors from stem cells during the neurogenesis in both central brain and optic lobe of fruit fly Drosophila larval brain. By examining neuroepithelial stem cell lineage in larval optic lobe, I showed that the restricted potential of intermediate progenitors is established through highly ordered sequential steps precisely paced by a spatial fluctuation of Notch activity. I identified the intermediate cell types during the differentiation of neuroepithelial stem cells into intermediate progenitors and Notch activities in those cell types indicate that while down-regulation of Notch is required for generating intermediate progenitors, up-regulation of Notch immediately before the transition is critical to prevent premature differentiation. Notch signaling plays two roles in this process: maintains the neuroepithelial stem cell identify via downstream target aop and prevents premature differentiation into intermediate progenitors by raising the threshold of response to pointP 1. Using central brain type II neuroblast lineages as the model system, I showed that the restricted potential of intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) needs to be actively maintained after correct specification and identified a novel transcription factor <b>earmuff</b> as the major factor maintaining restricted potential and preventing dedifferentiation of INPs. <b>earmuff</b> mutant shows ectopic generation of neural stem cells although the asymmetric division of neural stem cells or INPs and the specification of INPs are completely normal. <b>earmuff</b> mutant INPs can dedifferentiate back into a neural stem cell state, functionally indistinguishable from normal neural stem cells. <b>Earmuff</b> uses two independent mechanisms to restrict the potential of intermediate neural progenitors: promoting nuclear localization of Prospero to limit proliferation and antagonizing Notch signaling to prevent dedifferentiation...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{high rates of}} hearing loss, often NIHL, in firefighters, which {{increases}} with age and number of years working as a firefighter. [...] Hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL.

While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. Hearing protection devices have been used by firefighters in the United States. <b>Earmuffs</b> are the most commonly used hearing protection device (HPD) as they are the most easy to put on correctly in a quick manner.

40|$|Histone chaperones {{assemble}} and disassemble nucleosomes in an ATP-independent {{manner and}} thus regulate {{the most fundamental}} step in the alteration of chromatin structure. The molecular mechanisms underlying histone chaperone activity remain unclear. To gain insights into these mechanisms, we solved the crystal structure of the functional domain of SET/TAF-Iβ/INHAT at a resolution of 2. 3 Å. We found that SET/TAF-Iβ/INHAT formed a dimer that assumed a “headphone”-like structure. Each subunit of the SET/TAF-Iβ/INHAT dimer consisted of an N terminus, a backbone helix, and an “earmuff” domain. It resembles {{the structure of the}} related protein NAP- 1. Comparison of the crystal structures of SET/TAF-Iβ/INHAT and NAP- 1 revealed that the two proteins were folded similarly except for an inserted helix. However, their backbone helices were shaped differently, and the relative dispositions of the backbone helix and the <b>earmuff</b> domain between the two proteins differed by ≈ 40 °. Our biochemical analyses of mutants revealed that the region of SET/TAF-Iβ/INHAT that is engaged in histone chaperone activity is the bottom surface of the <b>earmuff</b> domain, because this surface bound both core histones and double-stranded DNA. This overlap or closeness of the activity surface and the binding surfaces suggests that the specific association among SET/TAF-Iβ/INHAT, core histones, and double-stranded DNA is requisite for histone chaperone activity. These findings provide insights into the possible mechanisms by which histone chaperones assemble and disassemble nucleosome structures...|$|R

In addition, skin surface pH was measured at the ear canal entrance {{before and after the}} task. Finally, the subject indicated <b>earmuff</b> comfort {{at the beginning and end}} of the session. <b>Earmuff</b> comfort decreased significantly over the course of the walking task. Ear canal pH became slightly less acidic, but the change was not statistically significant. The two temperature/humidity systems provided comparable results. Heat increased at about 0. 3 °F while humidity built up at about 0. 5 %/min. However, the study found some limitations on the instrumentation. The complexity of the electrical connections and equipment in the Omega probe system led to loss of three subject′s data. The iButton device was more robust, but provided only 256 gradations of temperature and relative humidity. Even with its limitations, the iButton device would be a valuable tool for field studies. The present study showed that the buildup of heat and humidity can be modeled using linear equations. The present study demonstrates that relatively inexpensive tools and a low-exertion task can provide important information about the under-earmuff environment, which can inform assumptions about comfort during use...|$|R
