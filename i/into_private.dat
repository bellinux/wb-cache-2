5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is {{native to}} Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Today it is extinct in Malawi, but has been successfully reintroduced in Namibia.

The blue wildebeest is widespread and is being introduced <b>into</b> <b>private</b> game farms, reserves and conservancies. For this reason, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) rates the blue wildebeest as being of Least Concern. The population has been estimated to be around {{one and a half}} million and the population trend is stable.|$|E
