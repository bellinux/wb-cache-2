5|$|After {{struggling}} {{during the}} 1914 season, Chance criticized the talent brought {{to him by}} Yankees scout Arthur Irwin. After repeatedly seeking to have Irwin fired, he offered his resignation from the team {{late in the season}} on the condition that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> to receive his 1915 salary. After this was accepted by team owner Frank J. Farrell, Chance resigned with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh served as player–manager {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|He {{remained}} as unused substitute, behind Martin Olsson, throughout Sweden's disappointing group stage at Euro 2016. Following Hamréns resignation and Janne Andersson's arrival later that summer, Augustinsson got bigger competition when Oscar Wendt re-joined the squad after {{conflicts with the}} former head coach. With Andersson's experimenting of the two veterans at the left-back position {{in the beginning of}} the World Cup qualification, Augustinsson opened possibilities to join the Sweden U21 squad, for which <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> eligible to play. Andersson however kept him in the senior squad and Augstinsson came to play the final 30 minutes against Bulgaria in the qualifier in October.|$|E
5|$|Weinke's {{favorite}} {{target was}} wide receiver Peter Warrick, who led all Seminole receivers with 71receptions and 931yards in just nine games {{during the regular}} season. Five times, Warrick earned more than 100receiving yards in a game. Warrick's season was shortened by a two-game suspension following his arrest for underpaying for clothes, but <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> named an All-America selection at wide receiver, signifying his status {{as one of the}} best players in the country at the position.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, Alvertis {{was already}} a permanent member of the Greek team and he participated in the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. Even though <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not starting the games, his contribution rose to 8.6 points per game, as Greece finished fifth. It was obvious, however, that the departure from the team of legendary play-maker Panagiotis Giannakis, and the imminent one of Fanis Christodoulou, would increase Alvertis’ responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|Before {{becoming}} an official manga author, Masashi Kishimoto decided he should try creating a Chanbara manga since Weekly Shōnen Jump had not published a title from that genre. However, {{during his years}} of college, Kishimoto started reading Hiroaki Samura's Blade of the Immortal and Rurouni Kenshin which used the said genre. Kishimoto recalls having never been surprised by manga ever since reading Akira and found that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not able to compete against them.|$|E

He later {{withdrew from the}} US Open in New York as well, as he felt <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not healthy enough to compete. On 11 September 2012, Nadal fell to a world No. 4 ranking, his lowest since 2010, as 2012 US Open winner Andy Murray climbed to No. 3. Nadal ended 2012 ranked No. 4 in the world, {{the first time in}} eight years that he has not been ranked 1st or 2nd {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Statements {{described}} Murray {{as someone}} using a non-standard CPR technique on Jackson. During {{the tape of}} the emergency call, released on June 26 one day after Jackson's death, the doctor was described as administering CPR on a bed, not on a hard surface such as a floor, which would be standard practice. The doctor's attorney said that Murray placed one hand underneath Jackson and used the other hand for chest compression, where the standard practice is to use both hands for compression. A Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson said the 911 call came in at 12:21:04p.m. PDT (19:21:04UTC). Paramedics reached Jackson at 12:26p.m. and found that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> not breathing.|$|E
25|$|He entered Komulo Primary School, {{then called}} Komulo School, in 1925. After passing the entry exam in 1927, he was {{admitted}} to Maseno School in 1928. His three years of study there were not a pleasant experience, as he was very far from home. <b>He</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> influenced by Edward Carey Francis, the headmaster, who helped grow his Christian faith. Under his guidance, he taught Sunday school classes at the area and also encouraged planting trees near the village churches. While at Maseno he was confirmed in the Anglican faith. He spoke English fluently by his third year at the school. He was the only Christian at his family {{at this point in}} time.|$|E

500|$|By 1564 Dudley had {{realised}} {{that his}} chances of becoming Elizabeth's consort were small. At {{the same time he}} could not [...] "consider ... without great repugnance", as he said, that she chose another husband. Confronted with other marriage projects, Elizabeth continued to say that she still would very much like to marry him. Dudley was seen as a serious candidate until the mid-1560s and later. To remove this threat to Habsburg and Valois suitors, between 1565 and 1578, four German and French princesses were mooted as brides for Leicester, as a consolation for giving up Elizabeth and his resistance to her foreign marriage projects. These he had and would continue to sabotage. In 1566 Dudley formed the opinion that Elizabeth would never marry, recalling that she had always said so since she was eight years old; but <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> hopeful—she had also assured him he would be her choice in case she changed her mind (and married an Englishman).|$|E
500|$|Progress {{was further}} {{complicated}} in early 1963, {{as a group}} in the US Congress called for the Soviet proposal to be discarded {{in favor of the}} Geneva System. On 27 May 1963, 34 US Senators, led by Humphrey and Thomas J. Dodd, introduced a resolution calling for Kennedy to propose another partial ban to the Soviet Union involving national monitoring and no on-site inspections. Absent Soviet agreement, the resolution called for Kennedy to continue to [...] "pursue it with vigor, seeking the widest possible international support" [...] while suspending all atmospheric and underwater tests. The effect of the resolution was to bolster the general push for a test ban, though Kennedy initially was concerned that it would damage attempts to secure a comprehensive ban, and had administration figures (including the Joint Chiefs of Staff) reiterate a call for a comprehensive ban. That same spring of 1963, however, Kennedy had sent antinuclear activist Norman Cousins to Moscow to meet with Khrushchev, where he explained that the political situation in the US made it very difficult for Kennedy agree to a comprehensive ban with Khrushchev's required terms. Cousins also assured Khrushchev that though Kennedy had rejected Khrushchev's offer of three yearly inspections, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> set on achieving a test ban. In March 1963, Kennedy had also held a press conference in which he re-committed to negotiations with the Soviet Union as a means of preventing rapid nuclear proliferation, which he characterized as [...] "the greatest possible danger and hazard." ...|$|E

[...] As interpreter he stood between his father-in-law Little Turtle, who was the only chief to vigorously resist the terms imposed by General Wayne, Wells's commander in chief. [...] Little Turtle, who was the last to sign the treaty, requested that Wells be sent as an Indian agent to the Miami stronghold of Kekionga, now under American control and renamed Fort Wayne.|$|E
2500|$|Napoleon Bonaparte {{initially}} won allegiance of Jews when in 1797 he emancipated Jews in Ancona, Italy. He officially chose two High Priests of the Jewish Nation {{and seven}} councillors to the High Priests. He allegedly encouraged Jews to reclaim Jerusalem in 1799 {{with the help}} of his army in a letter to a rabbi in Jerusalem, but the letter is suspected by many to be a forgery. He in no way acted against the Jews until the early 19th century, when he passed a series of three decrees, one of which became known as the Infamous Decree. Some, such as author Franz Kobler, attribute Napoleon’s change in attitude to Napoleon’s new attachment to France and his newfound desire to protect the interests of the French people. When he was the hero of the Jews, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> an “ardent patriot” of his home island of Corsica.|$|E
2500|$|Washington {{served as}} a staff officer for brief {{stretches}} during the war, {{under the command of}} John B. Floyd; while on duty he completed a number of sketches of mountain and battle scenes, some of which he would later translate into finished canvases. Ill health kept him in Richmond {{for the duration of the}} war, however, and it was during this time that he created two of his most important paintings, The Burial of Latané and Jackson Entering Winchester. The former, depicting an incident in the war, was based on a popular poem by John Reuben Thompson, which Washington may have heard read by its writer at an informal gathering of the Mosaic Club, where he was living at the time. The painter also worked at a studio on East Leigh Street. During his time in the Confederate capital Washington was described as [...] "reticent" [...] and [...] "of nervous temperament", yet <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>was</b> part of the [...] "best Richmond Society".|$|E
