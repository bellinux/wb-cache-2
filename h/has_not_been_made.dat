5|$|Love, Inc. {{suffered}} from low viewership despite its high ratings among young Hispanic women; it was canceled following UPN's merger with the WB {{to launch the}} CW in 2006. The series' cancellation, along with that of other black sitcoms, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters {{and the amount of}} roles for African American actors on television. Critical response to Love, Inc. was mixed; some critics praised its multi-ethnic cast, while others felt that the storylines and characters were unoriginal and Philipps' portrayal of her character was unsympathetic. It <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> available on Blu-ray or DVD.|$|E
5|$|The parks {{department}} performs in {{the annual}} Pawnee City Government Follies that riffs local politics, including one sketch that skewers Councilman Bill Dexhart (Kevin Symons), who was recently discovered {{to be involved in}} many bizarre sex scandals. Leslie (Amy Poehler) is later asked to meet Dexhart for lunch, where she learns the sketch was accidentally accurate about another bizarre sex scandal that <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> public. After assuring Dexhart that it was merely a coincidence, Leslie discovers that the local tabloid, The Pawnee Sun, has taken pictures of their lunch and is reporting that Leslie is Dexhart's new mistress.|$|E

Modern wet plate photographers may prefer less toxic fixers, often opting for the less toxic Sodium thiosulphate, but KCN is still used. Also used as snake repellent by Koreans.|$|E
25|$|The {{myth that}} {{all members of}} the Andorran Army are ranked as {{officers}} is popularly maintained in many works of reference. In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers, or non-commissioned officers, because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the Sometent to serve, although such a call <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> in modern times.|$|E

Still, the existence of a marketability discount has been recognized by valuation professionals and the Courts, and the restricted stock studies are frequently cited as empirical evidence. Notably, the lowest average discount reported by these studies was 26% and the highest average discount was 40%.|$|E

25|$|When {{work was}} {{stopped on the}} T-100 project, the SU-100Y was transported to Kubinka {{in the summer of}} 1940. In November 1941, at the most {{critical}} moment of battle in the suburbs of Moscow, the SU-100Y, together with the 152mm-gun-armed experimental SU-14 and SU-14-1, was pressed into service in an Independent Artillery Division for Special Duties. Further information of the combat record of the unit <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> known.

25|$|In a 1919 {{review in}} The American Economic Review, Stanley E. Howard stated, that the {{materials}} {{of the volume}} are well organized. The reader is given a bird's eye view of the problems dealt with, and is then shown in detail the development of cost and controlling records from the various business and factory forms. The authors have taken pains to emphasize relationships, presenting frequent summary charts. Fundamentals regarding the forms for orders, reports, and records have been illustrated, and the mistake <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> of confounding multiplicity of illustration with clarity of exposition.|$|E

25|$|In {{a larger}} sense, the theory {{suggests}} that the entire universe {{can be seen as}} two-dimensional information on the cosmological horizon, the event horizon from which information may still be gathered and not lost due to the natural limitations of spacetime supporting a black hole, an observer and a given setting of these specific elements, such that the three dimensions we observe are an effective description only at macroscopic scales and at low energies. Cosmological holography <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> mathematically precise, partly because the particle horizon has a non-zero area and grows with time.|$|E
25|$|This decree was {{repealed}} by a further executive decree {{issued by the}} following Governor, Javier Corral Jurado, in April 2017. Consequently, same-sex couples seeking to marry must receive an amparo in court, as occurs in Mexican states where same-sex marriage <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> legal. However, {{only a few days}} later, the Governor denied ever issuing such a decree and said that same-sex couples are allowed to get married in the state without the need of a court order. He did issue an executive order reverting to the old birth certificate forms.|$|E
25|$|At the 2006 Victoria state election, the Labor Government costed the {{construction}} of the Doncaster rail line at around $1 billion. Other costings have been as high as $3 billion. In 2008, the Australian Greens Victoria released a transport discussion paper, The People Plan, which costed {{the construction}} of the line at $450 million. The Age newspaper quoted a 2012 report by transport experts from various Australian universities that suggested the line could be built for $840 million, being funded by the increase in property prices of the surrounding areas (although the report <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> publicly available for review).|$|E
