5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. <b>Influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E

Nebulized medications may be prescribed in order to loosen secretions or treat underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Immunization against pneumococcal pneumonia and annual <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> is administered due to increased sensitivity to the diseases.

40|$|Improvement in {{the immune}} {{response}} to <b>influenza</b> virus <b>vaccination</b> {{in the elderly}} represents the primary unmet need in <b>influenza</b> virus <b>vaccination.</b> We have shown that topical application of immunostimulating (IS) patches containing heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LT) enhances immune responses to injected vaccines. We extend these findings and show that LT-IS patch application enhances the antibody responses to <b>influenza</b> virus <b>vaccination</b> in both young and aged mice. LT-IS patches markedly increased influenza virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), hemagglutination inhibition antibody, mucosal antibody, and T-cell responses. The magnitude of the immune responses in aged mice receiving an LT-IS patch was equivalent {{to or greater than}} that of the immune responses in young mice given vaccine alone. These results suggest that addition of an LT-IS patch may compensate for the deficient immune function seen in the aged in response to <b>influenza</b> virus <b>vaccination.</b> Therefore, use of an LT-IS patch could be a new, safe, and simple immunization strategy that may significantly improve the outcome of <b>influenza</b> virus <b>vaccination</b> in the elderly...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of Haemophilus influenzae on anaphylactic mediator from ovalbumin-sensitized isolated guinea pig lungs was investigated. Lungs from H. influenzae-vaccinated animals released protaglandins and thromboxanes following a smaller dose of ovalbumin than {{was effective in}} non-vaccinated animals. Histamine release was significantly increased in 4 day-vaccinated animals but not 1 or 10 days after vaccination, while broncho-constriction was potentiated in 1 and 4 day-vaccinated animals. This increased histamine release was achieved following 2 μg ovalbumin. In contrast, doses of 10 μg and 1 mg ovalbumin respectively did not affect and decreased histamine release in the vaccinated group. The inhibition of anaphylactic mediator release by an infusion of 6 × 10 − 9 M isoprenaline was significantly attenuated by H. <b>influenzae</b> <b>vaccination.</b> These results indicate an increased sensitivity to antigenic challenge and suggest that the functioning of β-adrenoceptors was decreased {{as a result of}} H. <b>influenzae</b> <b>vaccination...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of seasonal}} <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{has been widely}} evaluated for different groups and in different settings. In the elderly (aged over 65 years) the majority of published {{studies have found that}} vaccination is cost saving, with the cost savings associated with <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> (e.g. prevented health care visits) outweighing the cost of vaccination. In older adults (aged 50-64 years), several published studies have found that <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> is likely to be cost-effective, however the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations. The uncertainty in influenza cost-effectiveness models can partially be explained by the complexities involved in estimating the disease burden, as well as the seasonal variability in the circulating strains and the match of the vaccine. In healthy working adults (aged 18-49 years), a 2012 review found that vaccination was generally not cost-saving, with the suitability for funding being dependent on the willingness to pay to obtain the associated health benefits. In children, the majority of studies have found that <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> was cost-effective, however many of the studies included (indirect) productivity gains, which may not be given the same weight in all settings. Several studies have attempted to predict the cost-effectiveness of interventions (including prepandemic vaccination) to help protect against a future pandemic, however estimating the cost-effectiveness has been complicated by uncertainty as to the severity of a potential future pandemic and the efficacy of measures against it.|$|E
40|$|Objectives This study {{evaluated}} the uptake of Western Australian (WA) pharmacist vaccination services, the profiles of consumers being vaccinated and the facilitators and challenges experienced by pharmacy {{staff in the}} preparation, implementation and delivery of services. Design Mixed-methods methodology with both quantitative and qualitative data through surveys, pharmacy computer records and immuniser pharmacist interviews. Setting Community pharmacies in WA that provided pharmacist vaccination services between March and October 2015. Participants Immuniser pharmacists from 86 pharmacies completed baseline surveys and 78 completed exit surveys; computer records from 57 pharmacies; 25 immuniser pharmacists were interviewed. Main outcome measures Pharmacy and immuniser pharmacist profiles; pharmacist vaccination services provided and consumer profiles who accessed services. Results 15   621 <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinations</b> were administered by immuniser pharmacists at 76 WA community pharmacies between March and October 2015. There were no major adverse events, and < 1 % of consumers experienced minor events which were appropriately managed. Between 12 % and 17 % of consumers were eligible to receive free <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinations</b> under the National Immunisation Program but chose to have it at a pharmacy. A high percentage of vaccinations was delivered in rural and regional areas indicating that provision of pharmacist vaccination services facilitated access for rural and remote consumers.
