5|$|Coming {{into the}} race from Monaco two weeks earlier, Lucas di Grassi (Audi Sport ABT) was leading the {{championship}} with 93 points, four ahead of his compatriot Nelson Piquet, Jr. (NEXTEV TCR). Another six points adrift, third placed Sébastien Buemi (e.dams Renault) was the only driver who scored two victories {{over the course of}} the season, but less consistent outings prevented him from placing <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> in the standings.

5|$|Contact with Americans and Europeans in {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. <b>Higher</b> <b>up,</b> feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest.

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E
5|$|Little {{can be seen}} of {{the levels}} now for the entrances were {{destroyed}} when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners’ path which zigzags up the hillside, a self-acting incline to lower ore to the dressing floor, and the old winding-drum house.

5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, {{coupled with a}} formidable feeding apparatus, made it an apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is to say it was <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|The Doom Bar is a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes, and it has been shown that there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary. This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> the estuary.|$|E
5|$|The Tomozuru Incident of 12 March 1934, {{in which}} a top-heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather, caused the IJN to {{investigate}} the stability of all their ships, resulting {{in a number of}} design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. Ryūjō, already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the Kure Naval Arsenal for modifications that strengthened her keel and added ballast and shallow torpedo bulges to improve her stability. Her funnels were moved <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> the side of her hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} woodland, {{a former}} Forestry Commission plantation, planted around 1960 in the {{north-eastern}} corner of the park on a small hill, which contains a circular folly tower, of three storeys, in the centre. The tower, built from red sandstone, is believed to date to the late 18th century. The northern side is considerably more eroded by the weather than the southern side. The tower is marginally wider at the base and has no internal floor structure, but contains holes for floor joists and stair treads. There are four windows on the ground floors and narrower windows <b>higher</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{artillery}} guns were deployed, including heavier weapons, such as cannons, culverins and demi-cannons, and smaller pieces such as sakers, minions and falcons. Some older guns, for example slings and bases, were also deployed, but were less effective than newer weapons {{such as the}} culverin. With sites equipped with several tiers of weapons, the heaviest guns would typically be placed <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> in the fortification, with the smaller weapons closer to the ground. It is uncertain how far the guns of the period would have reached; analysis {{carried out in the}} 16th and 17th century on the ranges of artillery suggested that the largest weapons, such as a culverin, could hit a target up to between 1,600 and 2,743 metres (5,200ft and 8,999ft) away.|$|E
5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E

Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that this would have been an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> the chain of command.|$|E
5|$|Gareloi is {{the northernmost}} volcano of the Delarof Group, a {{subgroup}} of the Aleutian Islands. It {{is composed of}} two craters, the older of which is covered by lava flows running to the northwest and southern coasts. The northern crater is small, with a feature suggesting dome collapse in its northwest flank. The southern flank, <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> and considerably larger, contains fumarolic activity. A fissure created by Gareloi's 1929 eruption runs along the southern summit of the volcano. Steep sea cliffs on the southwest {{side of the island}} cut into the older caldera. Three masses offshore of the island were produced by debris flows from the volcano.|$|E
