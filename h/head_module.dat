40|$|Mediator is a large, modular protein complex {{remotely}} conserved from yeast to {{man that}} conveys regulatory signals from DNA-binding transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mediator {{is thought to}} be composed of 24 subunits organized in four sub-complexes, termed the head, middle, tail and Cdk 8 (Srb 8 - 11) modules. In this work, we have used screening and pair-wise two-hybrid approaches to investigate protein–protein contacts between budding yeast Mediator subunits.

40|$|Gene {{transcription}} by RNA polymerase (Pol) II {{requires the}} coactivator complex Mediator. Mediator connects transcriptional regulators and Pol II, and {{is linked to}} human disease 1 – 4. Mediator from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a molecular mass of 1. 4 megadaltons and comprises 25 subunits that form the head, middle, tail and kinase modules 5 – 7. The <b>head</b> <b>module</b> constitutes one-half of the essential Mediator core 8, and comprises the conserved 9 subunits Med 6, Med 8, Med 11, Med 17, Med 18, Med 20 and Med 22. Recent X-ray analysis of the S. cerevisiae <b>head</b> <b>module</b> at 4. 3 A˚ resolution led to a partial architectural model with three submodules called neck, fixed jaw and moveable jaw 10. Here we determine de novo the crystal structure of the <b>head</b> <b>module</b> from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3. 4 A˚ resolution. Structure solution was enabled by new structures of Med 6 and the fixed jaw, and previous structures of the moveable jaw 11 {{and part of the}} neck 12, and required deletion of Med 20.

40|$|The Mediator of {{transcriptional}} {{regulation is}} the central coactivator that enables a response of RNA polymerase II to activators and repressors. It is conserved from yeast to human and consists of 25 subunits in yeast that are organized in four modules called head, middle, tail, and CDK 8 /Cyclin C module. Despite its central role in transcription the functional mechanism remains enigmatic. To overcome the lack of detailed structural data on the Mediator a recombinant expression system was established that allows large-scale purifications of Mediator <b>head</b> <b>module</b> subcomplexes. It {{has been shown that}} via limited proteolysis assays and multicistronic expression the problems of insolubility and low expression rates of Mediator subunits can be overcome, paving the way for structural studies on subcomplexes of the Mediator <b>head</b> <b>module.</b> First data indicated that a reconstitution of the complete <b>head</b> <b>module</b> is within close reach. Large-scale copurification data led to a detailed interaction map of subunits and subcomplexes from within the <b>head</b> <b>module</b> and towards the middle module. The second part of this work describes the structure solution of a subunit in the CDK 8 /Cyclin C module – Cyclin C. Cyclin C binds the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK 8 and CDK 3, which regulate mRNA transcription and the cell cycle, respectively. The crystal structure of Cyclin C reveals two canonical five-helix repeats and a specific N-terminal helix. In contrast to other cyclins, the N-terminal helix is short, mobile, and in an exposed position that allows for interactions with proteins other than the CDKs. A model of the CDK 8 /Cyclin C pair reveals two regions in the interface with apparently distinct roles. A conserved region explains promiscuous binding of cyclin C to CDK 8 and CDK 3, and a non-conserved region may be responsible for discrimination of CDK 8 against other CDKs involved in transcription. A conserved and Cyclin C-specific surface groove may recruit substrates near the CDK 8 active site. Activation of CDKs generally involves phosphorylation of a loop at a threonine residue. In CDK 8, this loop is longer and the threonine is absent suggesting an alternative mechanism of activation is discussed based on a CDK 8 -Cyclin C model...|$|E

40|$|Gene {{transcription}} is {{a fundamental}} process of the living cell. Eukaryotic transcription of messenger RNA requires the regulated recruitment of the conserved transcribing enzyme RNA polymerase (Pol) II to the gene promoter. The most heavily regulated step is transcription initiation that involves the ordered assembly of Pol II, the general transcription factors (TF) -IIA, -IIB, -IID, -IIF, -IIE, -IIH and the co-activator Mediator complex. Mediator communicates between transcription regulators and Pol II, and is associated with human disease. Mediator from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) has a molecular mass of 1. 4 megadaltons and contains 25 -subunits that constitute a head, middle, tail and kinase module. The core of Mediator contains the head and middle modules that are essential for viability in Sc, and directly contact Pol II. Mediator co-operates with TFIIH, to assist assembly and stabilization of the transcription initiation complex and stimulate TFIIH kinase activity. Because of the large size and complexity of Mediator and the initiation machinery, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work we studied the structure and function of Mediator head and middle modules, {{the structure of the}} reconstituted Pol II-core Mediator transcription initiation complex, and reveal mechanisms of transcription regulation. We report the crystal structure of the 6 -subunit Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mediator <b>head</b> <b>module</b> at 3. 4 Å resolution. The structure resembles the head of a crocodile and reveals eight elements that are part of three domains named neck, fixed jaw and movable jaw. The neck contains a spine, shoulder, arm and finger. The arm and essential shoulder elements contact the remainder of Mediator and Pol II. The <b>head</b> <b>module</b> jaws and central joint, important for transcription, also interact with Mediator and Pol II. The Sp <b>head</b> <b>module</b> structure is conserved and revises a 4. 3 Å model of the Sc <b>head</b> <b>module,</b> explains known mutations, and provides an atomic model for one half of core Mediator. We further propose a model of the Mediator middle module based on protein crosslinking and mass spectrometry. To determine how Mediator regulates initiation, we prepared recombinant Sc core Mediator by co-expression of its 15 subunits in bacteria. Core Mediator is active in transcription assays and bound an in vitro reconstituted core initially transcribing complex (cITC) that contains Pol II, the general factors TFIIB, TBP, TFIIF, and promoter DNA. We determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the initially transcribing core initiation complex at 7. 8 Å resolution. The structure reveals the arrangement of DNA, TBP, TFIIB, and TFIIF on the Pol II surface, the path of the complete DNA template strand and three TFIIF elements. The ‘charged helix’ and ‘arm’ of TFIIF subunit Tfg 1, reach into the Pol II cleft and may stabilize open DNA. The linker region of TFIIF subunit Tfg 2 extends between Pol II protrusion and TFIIB, and may stabilize TFIIB. The structure agrees with its human counterpart, and suggests a conserved architecture of the core initiation complex. Finally, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy architecture of the cITC-core Mediator complex at 9. 7 Å resolution. Core Mediator binds Pol II at the Rpb 4 /Rbp 7 stalk close to the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). The Mediator <b>head</b> <b>module</b> contacts the Pol II dock and TFIIB ribbon and stabilizes the initiation complex. The Mediator middle module ‘plank’ domain touches the Pol II foot and may control polymerase conformation allosterically. The Med 14 subunit bridges head and middle modules with a ‘beam’, and connects to the tail module that binds transcription activators located on upstream DNA. The ‘arm’ and ‘hook’ domains of core Mediator form part of a ‘cradle’ that may position CTD and the TFIIH kinase to stimulate Pol II phosphorylation. Taken together, our results provide a structural framework to unravel the role of Mediator in transcription initiation and determine mechanisms of gene regulation...|$|E
