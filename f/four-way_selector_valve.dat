40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} and qualified as flight hardware for the measurement of micturition volumes voided by crewmen during Gemini missions. This Chemical Urine Volume Measurement System (CUVMS) is used for obtaining samples of each micturition for post-flight volume determination and laboratory analysis for chemical constituents of physiological interest. The system is versatile with respect to volumes measured, with a capacity beyond the largest micturition expected to be encountered, and with respect to mission duration of inherently indefinite length. The urine sample {{is used for the}} measurement of total micturition volume by a tracer dilution technique, in which a fixed, predetermined amount of tritiated water is introduced and mixed into the voided urine, and the resulting concentration of the tracer in the sample is determined with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The tracer employed does not interfere with the analysis for the chemical constituents of the urine. The CUVMS hardware consists of a <b>four-way</b> <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> in which an automatically operated tracer metering pump is incorporated, a collection/mixing bag, and tracer storage accumulators. The assembled system interfaces with a urine receiver at the selector valve inlet, sample bags which connect {{to the side of the}} selector valve, and a flexible hose which carries the excess urine to the overboard drain connection. Results of testing have demonstrated system volume measurement accuracy within the specification limits of +/- 5 %, and operating reliability suitable for system use aboard the GT- 7 mission, in which it was first used...|$|E

A miniature <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> is positioned immediately adjacent the pressure transducer. A reference pressure, known pressure, and unknown pressure can be selectively admitted to the active side of the pressure transducer by the <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> to enable calibration of the transducer. A valve admits pressure to the <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> which has a piston and floating piston arrangement which allows proper selection with very small linear movement...|$|R

25|$|Post-accident {{investigation}} by the NTSB showed that {{the leading cause of}} the accident was Denver's inability to switch fuel tanks during flight. The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's transfer to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately prior to the final flight. His newly purchased experimental Rutan had an unusual fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> handle configuration. Intended by the plane's designer to be located between the pilot's legs, the builder instead had placed the fuel selector behind the pilot's left shoulder, with the fuel gauge also behind the pilot's seat and not visible to the person at the controls. An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> handle and its resistance to being turned.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the multi port <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> (MSV) also facilitated the automation {{of the use of}} MPFM's, but this can also be achieved with conventional valving designs for well tests. MSV's are particularly suitable for onshore pad drilling,and where many nearby wells have similar pressures, and allow MPFM's to be shared between groups of wells.|$|R
50|$|Organ tones are {{sounded in}} one of three ways; in 'normal' mode, by {{pressing}} any string onto a fret; in 'percussion' mode, by fretting any string and touching the included brass plectrum (connected to a short wire plugged into a socket on the scratchplate) onto any metal part of the guitar; or by pressing one of the six 'open string' buttons. There is an option to silence the lowest two strings, and the organ section, as a whole, can also be switched off. There is a four-position octave selector, a six-position effect <b>selector,</b> a <b>four-way</b> <b>selector</b> for the percussion and a flute selector.|$|R
25|$|NTSB investigators' post-accident {{investigation}} {{showed that}} because of the positioning of the fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valves,</b> switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to yaw (Nose right) and pitch up.|$|R
50|$|Singer-songwriter John Denver {{died when}} his Long-EZ crashed on October 12, 1997. The NTSB {{believes}} that he inadvertently pushed on his right rudder pedal while twisting to the left in his seat {{as he struggled to}} operate the fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valve,</b> which on his aircraft had been moved by a previous owner to a position where it could more easily be reached from the passenger seat.|$|R
5000|$|In early September {{one of the}} Air <b>Selector</b> <b>Valves</b> in the CDRA {{was removed}} and replaced, but {{problems}} with sticking valves persisted, and Node 3 had to be restarted several times. The ISS at this point had no new ASVs to install, so if more further issues arose, {{it would have to}} rely on reinstalling previously used valves which they retained as [...] "contingency" [...] backups, which are in a degraded state.|$|R
5000|$|The four servovalves in each {{actuator}} {{provided a}} [...] "force-summed majority voting" [...] arrangement {{to position the}} power spool. With four identical commands to the four servovalves, the actuator force-sum action prevented a single erroneous command from affecting power ram motion. If the erroneous command persisted {{for more than a}} predetermined time, differential pressure sensing activated a <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> to isolate and remove the defective servovalve hydraulic pressure, permitting the remaining channels and servovalves to control the actuator ram spool.|$|R
50|$|The ISS has two rack sized CDRAs (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assemblies) for {{redundancy}} {{with the}} Lab CDRA primary and the Node 3 CDRA as a powered off backup because of issues with sticking valves in the Node 3. It can step in {{as a backup}} if necessary but is not the preferred CDRA because {{of the problems with}} the sticking Air <b>Selector</b> <b>Valves</b> (ASVs). The Russian segment has its own carbon dioxide scrubbers but they are not sufficient for the whole of the ISS.|$|R
50|$|Fuel is piped through {{fuel lines}} to a fuel control valve (usually {{known as the}} fuel <b>selector).</b> This <b>valve</b> serves several {{function}}s. The first function is {{to act as a}} fuel shut-off valve. This is required to provide the crew with a means to prevent fuel reaching the engine in case of an engine fire. The second function is to allow the pilot to choose which tank feeds the engine. Many aircraft have the left tank and right tank selections available to the pilot. Some Cessna airplanes feed only from both tanks; and many have the option to feed from left, right, or both tanks. The reason to have left only and right only options is to allow pilots to balance fuel load to reduce the banking moment. In some aircraft, the shut-off function is a different valve located after the fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
40|$|Following {{failure of}} the carbon dioxide removal {{assembly}} (CDRA) on the ISS, a CDRA teardown, test, and evaluation (TT&E) effort found that the sorbent material was not retained as intended by the packed beds and that presence of the sorbent in the check <b>valve</b> and <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> {{was the cause of}} the {{failure of the}}se components.

50|$|Before the flight, Denver and the {{mechanic}} {{had attempted to}} extend {{the reach of the}} handle, using a pair of Vise-Grip pliers. However, this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB investigators' post-accident investigation showed that because of the positioning of the fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valves,</b> switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve.

5000|$|Contributing {{factors in}} the crash were other pilot errors, a design that led to an overly optimistic {{pre-flight}} fuel-check estimate, a known defective (very hard to turn) fuel valve, and non-standard placement of the fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> by the kit plane's builder, at variance with Burt Rutan's specifications.

5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing.

With the cross-feed <b>selector</b> <b>valves</b> closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{aircraft}} ground handling characteristics and airport working efficiency, large handling angle and torque are requested for the nose wheel steering system of large civil aircraft. A following swivel <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> is firstly {{designed to meet the}} demand for the hydraulic pressure commutating as soon as the dual actuator nose wheel steering mechanism passes through its dead center position. Considering the multiple objective functions of nose wheel steering mechanisms, those core design parameters are multiobjective optimized. A nose wheel steering electrohydraulic servo system with handling and antishimmy functions is designed for the steering mechanism. Then the prototypes of the steering mechanism and electrohydraulic servo system are researched to validate the design. Using the swing actuator to provide the load torque and ground excitation, the steering test bench is prepared to test the system working. The steering test and the antishimmy test are conducted to verify the functions of the system.

50|$|The {{governor}} {{is connected to}} the output shaft and regulates the hydraulic pressure depending on the vehicle speed. The engine load is monitored either by a throttle cable or a vacuum modulator. The valve body is the hydraulic control center that receives pressurized fluid from the main pump operated by the fluid coupling/torque converter. The pressure coming from this pump is regulated and used to run a network of spring-loaded valves, check balls and servo pistons. The valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as hydraulic signals from the range <b>selector</b> <b>valves</b> and the throttle valve or modulator) to control which ratio is selected on the gearset; as the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. The hydraulic pressure controlled by these valves drives the various clutch and brake band actuators, thereby controlling the operation of the planetary gearset to select the optimum gear ratio for the current operating conditions. However, in many modern automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by electro-mechanical servos which are controlled by the electronic engine control unit (ECU) or a separate transmission control unit (TCU, also known as transmission control module (TCM).|$|R

This area of research resides at the interface of engineering and life sciences. As such, it entails the design and implementation of diverse elements: a novel hydrogelbased bioink, a 3 D bioprinter, automation software, and mammalian cell culture. Our bioprinter has three components uniquely combined into a comprehensive tool: syringe pumps connected to a <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> that allow precise application of up to five different materials with varying viscosities and chemistries, a high velocity/high-precision x-y-z stage to accommodate the most rapid speeds allowable by the printed materials, and temperature control of the bioink reservoirs, lines, and printing environment.

2500|$|The cockpit {{area of the}} Islander had not {{suffered}} significant damage, {{and there}} was sufficient space for the pilot to survive. The pilot's seat belt and shoulder harness were found undamaged and unbuckled, with all stitching intact and the buckle still functional.

Both fuel tanks contained a significant amount of fuel, which investigators calculated to be approximately 100 US gallons in each of the two wing tanks, and the fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> was in the correct position. Several instruments were damaged by the impact or by the pressure and corrosion from sitting on the seabed for six days. The aircraft's horizontal situation indicator, or HSI (a navigational instrument to direct the pilot to or from ground-based navigation aids, including the MAC VOR), was not set properly for the approach. The instrument's course selector was set to 103°, though the approach called for a setting of 115°.

The heading bug on the HSI was set to 157°. A second instrument situated below the HSI and capable of the same VOR navigation, called the omni bearing indicator (OBI), was also set incorrectly to 309° when it too should have been set to 115°.|$|R

The automatic system was easy to handle, cost-effective and gave good reproducibility. This paper presents an analysis of primary amines to demonstrate the system. The analytical procedure includes pre-column coupling reaction of amines to fluorescent derivatives, followed by HPLC separation and fluorescence detection. For analysis of amino acids and amines there are many reagents of choice for derivatization. Among them are 1 -dimethylaminophthalene- 5 sulphonyl chloride (Dansyl-C 1), phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) or 9 -fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (Fmoc). A long reaction time is needed when using Dansyl-C 1 [3] and excess of reagent will give disturbing peaks [4]. The reaction described here is a modification of one described by Imai and Watanabe [5] using 4 -Fluoro- 7 -nitrobenzofurazane (NBD-F) to form the fluorescent compound. The reagent itself is non-fluorescent and will form a stable fluorescence product with primary and secondary amines in a short time.

The cMFP has a footprint of 175 X 100 X 140 mm^ 3 and can scan an area of 45 X 45 mm^ 2 on a surface with an accuracy of +- 15 um. The cMFP is compatible with standard surfaces used in life science laboratories such as microscope slides and Petri dishes. For ease of use, we developed self-aligned mounted MFP heads with standardized chip-to-world and chip-to-platform interfaces. Switching the processing liquid in the flow confinement is performed within 90 seconds using a <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> with a dead-volume of approximately 5 uL. We further implemented height-compensation that allows a cMFP head to follow non-planar surfaces common in tissue and cellular ensembles. This was shown by patterning different macroscopic copper-coated topographies with height differences up to 750 um. To illustrate the applicability to tissue processing, 5 um thick M 000921 BRAF V 600 E+ melanoma cell blocks were stained with hematoxylin to create contours, lines, spots, gradients of the chemicals, and multiple spots over larger areas. The local staining was performed in an interactive manner using a joystick and a scripting module.
