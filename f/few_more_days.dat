5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} crossed Central America organized and {{developed into a}} tropical depression on June 27. Contrary to forecasts, the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear. By June 29, the depression had become a remnant low, which was observed as a swirl of clouds for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{continued}} a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> with {{testimony from}} a Navy psychiatrist who verified that the immense explosion would generate fear in each man. A black petty officer under Delucchi {{testified that he}} had heard no derogatory remarks or conspiratorial comments and that it had been a surprise to everybody when all of the men suddenly refused to march toward the docks on August 9.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days.</b> Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but was held up by the weather for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days.</b> On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E
5|$|James then flew to Algiers, {{where he}} was {{publicly}} paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex Hamer. Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days,</b> by hinting Montgomery {{was still in the}} region.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian {{artillery}} {{failed to}} breach the walls, so Ibrahim decided to launch two ships with cannons {{and have them}} bombard the Maniot defences from the sea. He also combined this attack with infantry assaults, however these failed as the invaders were driven back from the walls eight times. The attacks lasted for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> before the Egyptians and Ottomans were forced to retreat when news arrived that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 men. The Maniots chased the Egyptians up to Kalamata before withdrawing. Ibrahim lost 2,500 men at Vergas and the Greek losses are unknown.|$|E

5|$|On 1200 UTC September 2, Jimena made {{landfall}} on Isla San Margarita, Baja California del Sur with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) and a pressure of 971 mbar (hPa; 28.67 inHg). An hour later, Jimena made a second landfall (after re-entering the Pacific) {{at the same}} intensity near Cabo San Lázaro. It then moved over land, weakening into a Category 1 later that day, only to move back offshore as a Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane made a third landfall near San Junacio with 85mph (150km/h) winds. After its third landfall, Jimena returned to tropical storm status over land. After emerging into the Gulf of California, steering currents collapsed and increased wind shear continued to weaken Jimena. By late on September 3, Jimena was just a minimal tropical storm. It turned to the west, weakening into a tropical depression the next day. With winds of 30mph (45km/h), the system made a fourth and final landfall near Santa Rosalía, Baja California Sur. Within five hours, the tropical depression had degenerated into a remnant low. Midday on September 5, the remnant low had dissipated, but the remnant circulation of Jimena continued to track westwards into the Pacific for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

25|$|Most {{patients}} do improve with conservative care in 2–5 days. However, on some occasions, {{the cause of}} obstruction may be a cancer and in such cases, surgery is the only treatment. These individuals undergo surgery where the cause of SBO is removed. Individuals who have bowel resection or lysis of adhesions usually {{stay in the hospital}} a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> until they are able to eat and walk.|$|E
25|$|For {{political}} reasons, Pakistan claims {{victory in}} the 1965 war. In my opinion, the war ended {{in a kind of}} stalemate. We were in a position of strength. Had the war continued for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days,</b> we would have gained a decisive victory. I advised then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri not to agree for ceasefire. But I think he was under pressure from the United Nations and some countries.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Albert of Bavaria {{remained}} at Kuinre for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days,</b> but, as Juw Juwinga had predicted, {{he found it}} very difficult to operate in the marshy terrain with an army of knights. Furthermore, it started to rain all day, while the sea got more and more tempestuous. On 6 September he gave up and went home, after a campaign of only ten days and with no gains other than revenge for the defeat of 1345 to show for it.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{ended on}} April 11. Medical teams from Canada, France, and Italy, {{as well as}} UN and ICRC officials, with trucks {{carrying}} supplies and water waited outside the camp for clearance to enter for days, but were denied entry, with Israel citing ongoing military operations. The first independent observers were granted access to the camp on April 16. Israeli troops began withdrawing from the camp itself on April 18. Tanks ringed {{the perimeter of the}} camp for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days,</b> but by April 24, Israeli troops had withdrawn from the autonomous zone of Jenin.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 8 February, the Japanese {{launched}} landings on the sector held by Varley's battalion, and it was forced into a fighting withdrawal. By 12 February, the Japanese were well established on Singapore Island and advancing on all fronts. The commander of 22nd Brigade, Brigadier Harold Burfield Taylor, was extremely fatigued and asked Varley to take over temporary command of the brigade. The following day, the divisional commander, Major General Gordon Bennett, promoted Varley to brigadier and made him the permanent commander of the brigade, a command would last only a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> before the surrender of Singapore on 15 February.|$|E
25|$|Between 1888 and 1890, Narendra visited Vaidyanath in Allahabad. In January 1890 he {{went from}} Allahabad to Ghazipur and met Pavhari Baba, an Advaita Vedanta ascetic who {{spent much of his}} time in meditation. At the time he {{suffered}} from lumbago, and it was becoming impossible for him to move or sit in meditation. After meeting Baba, Narendra wanted to become his disciple and Baba asked him to stay a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> at Ghazipur. However, the night before his initiation Narendra had a dream in which Ramakrishna looked at him with a melancholy face. This dream convinced Narendra that no one other than Ramakrishna could be his teacher, and he abandoned the idea of becoming Baba's disciple.|$|E

50|$|The {{journey to}} Paraguay was {{extremely}} difficult. Their destination, set aside by Paraguayan government decree, was completely undeveloped. Travel was exhausting: a steamboat {{was taken up}} the Paraguay River to Puerto Casado, from where a narrow gauge railway went 150 km west into the Chaco bush. From there it was a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> long <b>days</b> of travel by oxcart to their settlement area. It was not until 1956 that {{the construction of the}} trans-Chaco highway connecting Asunción to Filadelfia was started.|$|R
25|$|At 4:00 PM on Tuesday, October 23, the United Nations Security Council met in New York City to reconfirm the ceasefire {{and send}} {{observers}} {{to the fighting}} front. At 6:00 PM, General Ensio Siilasvuo, head of the UN Emergency Force in Cairo, called the Israeli Defense Minister, Moshe Dayan, and told him of the decision. Dayan suggested that the ceasefire go into effect at 7:00 AM local time, thirty-six hours after the original ceasefire was supposed take effect, and Siilasvuo accepted. The Israeli Chief of Staff, David Elazar, said in the Kirya {{that he was in}} a dilemma. From a military perspective, the IDF needed a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> to make the Egyptian Third Army surrender and cut off the Second Army, which would collapse the entire Egyptian military. On the other hand, Israel had a great debt to the United States {{as a result of the}} massive arms shipments of Operation Nickel Grass. He later said it was the latter consideration that made him accept the ceasefire.|$|E
25|$|Following their costly {{victory at}} Xuan Loc, the North Vietnamese army {{effectively}} controlled two-thirds of South Vietnam's territory. The loss of Xuan Loc dealt a severe {{blow to the}} military strength of South Vietnam, which had lost almost every unit from its general reserve. On April 18, 1975, General Nguyen Van Toan, commander of the ARVN III Corps, informed President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu that the South Vietnamese forces at Xuan Loc had been beaten and South Vietnam's armed forces could only hold out for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> {{as a result of}} their losses on the battlefield. According to Vietnam's official account of the battle, about 2,036 South Vietnamese soldiers were either killed or wounded and another 2,731 were captured. However, the 18th ARVN Division alone suffered over 30 percent casualties of 12,000 soldiers committed to the battle, not to mention other forces. Total casualties on the Communist side are largely unknown, but the 4th Army Corps alone claimed to have suffered 460 killed in action, and another 1,428 wounded. While Le Minh Dao claim that the battle has cost the North Vietnamese over 50,000 KIA and 370 tanks destroyed, American estimates only put North Vietnamese casualties at around 10 percent of those figures with 5,000 troops killed and/or wounded and 37 tanks destroyed.|$|E
