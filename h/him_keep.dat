5|$|During his {{run as a}} variety-show host, Moore {{was tapped}} to host CBS' weekly prime-time TV panel show I've Got a Secret. It premiered on June 19, 1952. On this show, Moore began his friendships with comedian Henry Morgan and game show host and {{panelist}} Bill Cullen, {{with whom he had}} a long working relationship. Morgan later stated that Moore had helped <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> his job as a celebrity panelist on the show.|$|E
5|$|At the mansion, Mona knocks Max to {{the ground}} in an attempt to follow her orders to kill him, but discovers that her {{feelings}} for <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> her from doing so. Lem then shoots Mona, after realizing that she will not kill Max. Woden confronts Lem, who shoots him to death in the ensuing struggle. Max and Lem then fight while the mansion burns around them. Eventually, Lem is killed and Max returns to Mona's side as the police arrive, and she dies in his arms. In an alternate ending unlocked on the highest difficulty, Mona survives her wound, and the two share a kiss.|$|E
5|$|With the Italy {{national}} team, Buffon {{has been}} called up for an international record of five FIFA World Cup tournaments (1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014) since making his debut in 1997, featuring in four of them as Italy's starting goalkeeper (he was an unused substitute in 1998). He was the starting goalkeeper of the Italian team that won the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which saw <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> a record five clean sheets, and concede only two goals, neither of which were in open play. He has also represented Italy at four European Championships, at the 1996 Olympics, and at two FIFA Confederations Cups, winning a bronze medal in the 2013 edition of the tournament.|$|E
50|$|Roxane, {{afraid for}} Christian, urges Cyrano to promise to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> safe, to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> out of {{dangerous}} situations, to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> dry and warm, and to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> faithful. Cyrano {{says that he}} will do what he can but that he cannot promise anything. Roxane begs Cyrano to promise to make Christian write to her every day. Brightening, Cyrano announces confidently that he can promise that.|$|R

5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|Before doing so, Marty travels up to Travers' {{house to}} try to {{convince}} Travers to allow him to keep Shiloh. Judd does not see Marty approaching, and shoots a doe out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate a deal in which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At {{the end of the first}} week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to work for him. They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, relents, and lets <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> Shiloh.|$|E
5|$|George Lucas {{began writing}} the new Star Wars trilogy on November 1, 1994. The {{screenplay}} of Star Wars {{was adapted from}} Lucas' 15-page outline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> track of the characters' backstories and events that occurred before the original trilogy. Anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but Lucas reduced his age to nine because he felt the lower age would better fit the plot point of Anakin being affected by his mother's separation from him. Eventually, Anakin's younger age led Lucas to rewrite his participation in the movie's major scenes. The film's working title was The Beginning; Lucas later revealed that its true title was The Phantom Menace; a reference to Palpatine hiding his true identity as an evil Sith Lord behind the facade of a well-intentioned public servant.|$|E

5|$|Rudd was {{offering}} generous terms that few competitors {{could hope to}} even come close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|Dan {{wakes up}} in the year 2000 with no money to his name and {{no idea how to}} find the people he once knew. What little money Belle let <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> went with the {{collapse}} of Mannix in 1987. He has lost Pete the cat, who fled Miles' house after Dan was drugged, and has no idea how to find a now middle-aged Ricky.|$|E
25|$|Lü Meng's marquis {{title was}} {{inherited}} by his son, Lü Ba (呂霸). Lü Ba received 50 qing of land – one qing was approximately equivalent to 6.67 hectares – and 300 households to help <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> watch over his father's tomb. After Lü Ba died, his elder brother, Lü Cong (呂琮), succeeded him and inherited the marquis title. Lü Cong, in turn, {{passed on the}} marquis title to his younger brother, Lü Mu (呂睦), after his death.|$|E

25|$|Paes Barreto {{gathered}} himself {{troops to}} quell the revolt but was defeated which made <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> his forces in the countryside waiting for reinforcements. On August 2 the Emperor sent a naval division commanded by the Admiral Thomas Cochrane, composed of a ship of the line, a brig, a corvette and two transports and also 1,200 soldiers led by Brigadier General Francisco de Lima e Silva. The troops disembarked in Maceió, capital of Alagoas, from where they travelled by land towards Pernambuco. The legalist forces soon met with Paes Barreto and his 400 men who joined the march. Throughout the way, the army was strengthened by militians that increased their numbers to 3,500 soldiers. Most {{of the population of}} Pernambuco, who lived in the countryside, including partisans of Paes Barreto and the neutral or indifferent to the disputes between both factions, remained faithful to the monarchy.|$|E
25|$|Early in Sonic Adventure 2, Knuckles and Rouge {{argue over}} the Emerald; {{she wants the}} pieces for her {{personal}} collection. Eggman tries to steal it, so Knuckles shatters it aboard Eggman's hovercraft, sending the pieces every which way. He spends the game recollecting the pieces similarly to in Adventure. He later helps Sonic, Tails, and Amy find Eggman's base inside a giant pyramid, {{as well as a}} key to an inner chamber housing a giant space shuttle. He follows them to a giant space station called the ARK with it, where he again scuffles with Rouge over the Emerald. He saves her from falling into a constructed pit of lava; she decides the shards are worthless and dismissively lets <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> them, so he reassembles the Emerald and runs off. The game's antagonist Gerald Robotnik, Eggman's grandfather, initiates a program to send the ARK {{on a collision course with}} Earth as revenge for an attack on the ARK decades earlier, so Knuckles teams up with the other playable characters to reroute it.|$|E
25|$|Sehwag, however, {{was caught}} by Lou Vincent for 75, and that started a flurry of wickets for New Zealand. Rahul Dravid, who had had a poor series with only 64 runs in four innings, {{continued}} on that vein of form as he was deceived by a quick arm ball from Daniel Vettori for a two-ball 0 – Vettori's second wicket of the innings. Astle, Mills and Vettori tied down the batsmen, as no boundaries were given {{up in the next}} eight overs, and Yuvraj felt like he had to attack. He got away with a lofted shot through midwicket for four on the second ball of a Mills over, but shortly afterwards he had a feel at a short ball which landed in Shane Bond's hands – and Yuvraj was gone for a stifled 20. Kaif was still in, but he ran out of partners, as no one could help <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> the run rate up. Jacob Oram got three wickets to redeem his figures, ending with four for 58, although the latter three came in the last ten overs – one of them was Yadav, who gave a simple leading edge to the wicket-keeper McCullum, and the last was a straight drive from Pathan which fell short of the boundary and into Lou Vincent's hands. With Dhoni adjudged lbw to a ball that struck him in the stomach as well, India were all out for 276, Kaif left stranded on 93 not out after taking a single on the first ball of the over.|$|E

500|$|Hacker throws four pitches: a fastball, a slider, a curveball, and a changeup.

500|$|The idea of {{anonymous}} letters {{came from a}} real experience; during his {{senior year in high}} school, Chbosky wrote an anonymous letter to Stewart Stern about how Rebel Without a Cause had influenced him. A year and a half later, Stern found Chbosky and became his mentor. By using a series of letters from Charlie to an anonymous character, Chbosky found [...] "the most intimate way" [...] to talk directly to the reader.

500|$|Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria {{wrote that}} Zenobia did not [...] "hand over churches to the Jews {{to make them}} into synagogues"; {{although}} the queen was not a Christian, she understood the power of bishops in Christian communities. In Antioch—considered representative of political control of the East and containing a large Christian community—Zenobia apparently maintained authority over the church by bringing influential clerics, probably including Paul of Samosata, under her auspices. She may have bestowed on Paul the rank of ducenarius (minor judge); he apparently enjoyed the queen's protection, which helped <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> the diocesan church after he was removed from his office as bishop of Antioch by a synod of bishops in 268.|$|E
500|$|The {{boys are}} {{waiting at the}} bus stop when Cartman notices Stan has a black eye and it turns out his sister Shelley has been beating him up.

At school, Mr. Hat teaches the class about genetic engineering, which prompts Kyle to decide to crossbreed his elephant with Cartman's pot-bellied pig, Fluffy, to make little [...] "pot-bellied elephants", which he could keep in his house. Upon hearing this, Terrance Mephesto bets Kyle that he can clone a whole person before Kyle can create a pot-bellied elephant. Mr. Garrison suggests the boys use their genetic modifications for the upcoming science fair and go to the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch.|$|E
500|$|While Nevin {{was with}} the Toros, the Astros asked Toros manager Rick Sweet to play Nevin as a left fielder, which would allow the Astros to promote Nevin sooner, as he and Caminiti could play {{different}} positions. Veteran first baseman Jim Lindeman served as Nevin's mentor, helping <b>him</b> <b>keep</b> his composure under significant attention and pressure to perform. Nevin started the 1993 season with a [...]247 batting average, but batted [...]309 with baserunners in scoring position and had 49 RBI. By July, he had made ten starts in left field, without committing an error. The Astros, however, were concerned that Nevin did not apply the level of intensity he had in [...] "clutch" [...] situations to cases {{where there were no}} baserunners and the score was not close.|$|E
