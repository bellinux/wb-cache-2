40|$|Well over {{a century}} ago, legal and policy analysts {{realized}} that the days of purely individual action in matters of business and labor were over, and that legal rules must adapt to {{the social and economic}} power of large corporations. Among the rules that changed were archaic limitations on <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> claims and <b>parties</b> in litigation and laissez faire “liberty of contract” doctrines invalidating labor legislation. Recently, lawyers representing large corporate employers have urged a revival of old rules limiting class actions and labor rights. But, as this Article will show, {{it is not at all}} clear that their clients will benefit from the legal regime the lawyers have created. As long as employers have large workforces working under uniform policies, they will face dozens or hundreds of similar claims challenging pay practices, discrimination, and harassment. Group adjudication arose to address efficiently the many similar claims that arise when large institutions adopt uniform policies. Individual arbitration of such claims may result in fewer claims being filed, especially if confidentiality provisions keep co-workers from learning from each other about how to assert successful claims. But unless or until employers figure out a way to shift all the costs of dispute resolution onto the claimaints (and thus far courts have resisted such efforts), and to silence all claimants and their lawyers, employers will face many similar claims, will be paying part or all of the costs of lots of identical arbitrations, and will be paying lawyers to handle them separately rather than on a classwide basis. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects the right of employees to engage in “concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. ” The National Labor Relations Board (“the Board”) has long held that protected activity includes asserting claims in courts, agencies, and in arbitration. In D. R. Horton, the Board found the NLRA to prohibit enforcement of an employer-imposed requirement that employees waive their right to bring a collective action challenging their working conditions. On petition for review, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the Board’s determination, holding that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) requires enforcement of the mandatory arbitration agreement, including its class action waiver. This Article explains why collective action waivers or requirements to arbitrate individually are unenforceable under the National Labor Relations Act and the Norris LaGuardia Act. The Article also explains why arbitration agreements requiring claims to be brought by individuals are not covered by the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Concepcion and Italian Colors to the extent they prohibit <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> fewer <b>parties</b> than would be required to bring a large class action and, therefore, remain protected by labor law. The Article notes the inconsistency in the FAA cases about whether agreements can waive the right to file charges with some agencies and courts rather than others and therefore critiques the Fifth Circuit’s ruling that the FAA trumps the employees’ rights under NLRA sections 7 and 8 (a) (1) to file group actions in court or arbitration but does not trump section 8 (a) (4), which protects the right to file unfair labor practice charges. Finally, the Article raises some questions about the practical wisdom of the courts’ willingness to allow employers to require employees to pursue claims only as individuals. State and federal courts universally allow liberal <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> plaintiffs and defendants because it is more efficient and avoids some truly thorny issues about the preclusive effect of judgments. The Fifth Circuit majority’s assumption, like the Supreme Court majority’s in Concepcion, that individual determination of claims is better suited to arbitration is simply wrong in many cases. Unless employers can opt out of the usual rules for the binding effects of judgments and the usual rules for <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> claims and <b>parties,</b> the notion that individual arbitration is superior for everyone (including employers) is simply wrong...|$|R

40|$|Originally {{prepared}} for the 2007 meetings of the Italian Association of Comparative Law, this paper seeks to excavate the roots of procedural complexity in modern American litigation. Proceeding from the view {{that there is no}} accepted definition of complex litigation in the United States, the paper discusses five related phenomena that the author regards as consequential: (1) the architecture of modern American lawsuits and the procedural philosophy that architecture reflects, (2) the volume of litigation and the public and private policies, attitudes and arrangements that affect it, (3) the dynamic nature of, and dispersed institutional responsibility for, American law, (4) the enormous amounts of money at stake in some litigation, and (5) the search for, and the forms of, relevant evidence in modern American litigation, and the impact of science and technology on both. The paper argues that, having opted for equity’s approach to the <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> claims and <b>parties</b> – in part to ensure effective enforcement of rights but also in part to make such enforcement more efficient [...] Americans have repeatedly turned to the tools of aggregation as a remedy for that success. In doing so, the people responsible for the courts often override the preferences <b>of</b> the <b>parties</b> (and thus the principle <b>of</b> <b>party</b> autonomy), alter {{the balance of power in}} litigation, and render trial effectively impossible. In such instances, they are creating complexity where it is not necessary for effective access to court; the stated goal of efficiency may be a delusion, and in any event aggregation can make little pretense to a goal of accuracy as opposed to dispute resolution simpliciter. Moreover, as the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 suggests, in a federal system the unremitting quest for aggregation may come at a heavy price to individual state autonomy. In sum, taken to the extremes to which Americans appear to be heading, complex litigation appears to be a cure that has become a curse...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{business}} international {{transactions are}} multiparty and complicated. Such contracts are usually composed of several contracts which can contain bilateral dispute resolution arrangements. According {{to the principle}} of parties autonomy dispute arising between two persons bound by an arbitration agreement in connection with a multiparty project will be resolved by arbitration exclusively between these two parties. Other parties cannot participate in the resolution of the dispute through arbitration, even if they have played {{an active role in the}} actual project. Notwithstanding any legitimate interest, they might have the outcome of the dispute; these parties will remain alien both to the arbitration proceedings and an arbitral award. Their interests are not taken into consideration and left unprotected. Arbitration proceedings, unlike litigation, usually do not bear any intervention or <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties,</b> which is explained by the contractual nature of arbitration. Thus, the binding power of an arbitral award extends only over parties of an arbitration agreement. Meanwhile, an arbitral award can affect interests of third parties. How can these parties defend their interests in arbitration proceedings and during recognition and enforcement proceedings in national courts? There are two ways of resolving such problem in state court litigation. The first one is the compulsory participation of any third party with any legitimate interest in litigation through intervention, <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties,</b> and consolidation of cases. A court ex officio has to gather all parties that can have any legitimate interest in resolving the dispute. If judgment affects any interest of a party that was not involved in the proceedings judgment should be reversed in appellate court. The second way is also the solution against parallel proceedings. This way is to harmonize the outcome of parallel proceedings by the principle of lis pendens and res judicata. The paper examines the binding and res judicata effects of the arbitral award towards third parties through the Russian and international experience of defending of interests of third parties in international arbitration and litigation. </p...|$|E

Even under the code the idea was only imperfectly perceived or carried out and it is only now in a few jurisdictions-notably England, New York and New Jersey-that the possibilities of thus somewhat relieving the press of cases upon the courts are being at all adequately realized.

40|$|In what follows, I hope to {{contribute}} to that information {{with a look at}} group litigation devices in Switzerland. To begin with, Switzerland {{is one of the many}} countries that do not currently have an American-style class action. Suggestions to examine the possibility of introducing such a procedural vehicle have met with considerable opposition. Some of the reasons for that opposition are grounded in reactions to litigation in the United States. More broadly, however, there seems to be a general unease with civil litigation involving more than the traditional plaintiff and defendant and an occasional individual joined out of an urgent need, such as to extend res judicata effect to a co-heir or business partner. Below, I intend to explore the most important reasons for that reluctance. I will do so first by analyzing the proposals to introduce an American-style class action and their rejection. I will then take a closer look at the group litigation devices that already exist in Swiss procedure. They include devices to let similarly situated individuals sue together (<b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties),</b> to have an organization sue for its members with similar rights (Verbandsklage and Verbandsbeschwerde), and to allow a court to consolidate claims arising out of the same controversy. Moreover, certain shareholder litigation results in judgments that are binding on all or an extended group of shareholders.

40|$|Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, {{concerning}} the required <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> <b>parties,</b> ensures that all parties {{with an interest}} in an action are joined in the litigation. At any time during the suit, a court may determine that an absent party has a specific interest that requires its presence in the dispute. When the court cannot join the absent party, however, the court must use Rule 19 (b) to determine whether to continue the litigation without the absentee or dismiss the suit entirely. Despite the potentially drastic consequence of dismissal, federal courts of appeals cannot agree on the proper standard of review for Rule 19 (b) decisions. Should the court review the decision de novo as if it were examining the issue for the first time? Or should it review for abuse of discretion with deference to the district court’s analysis?

40|$|Playing off {{the strict}} {{requirements}} of federal diversity jurisdiction, plaintiffs can structure their suits to prevent removal to federal court. A common way to preclude removability is {{to join a}} nondiverse party. Although plaintiffs {{have a great deal}} of flexibility, they may include only those parties that have a stake in the lawsuit. Put another way, a court will not permit a plaintiff to join a party to a lawsuit when that party is being joined solely to prevent removal. The most useful tool federal courts employ to prevent this form of jurisdictional manipulation is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21. Rule 21 permits a federal court to drop a joined party if that party fails the permissive <b>joinder</b> rules <b>of</b> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20. Federal courts have an additional tool to scrutinize joined defendants: the fraudulent joinder doctrine. The doctrine permits a federal court to look beyond the face of the complaint to determine whether the plaintiff has a colorable claim against the nondiverse defendant. If not, the court ignores this diversity-destroying defendant and the suit remains in federal court. Ultimately, federal courts use this robust tool only to scrutinize the <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> defendants, leaving some plaintiff-based manipulation unchecked. This Note argues that federal courts should correct this deficiency and extend the fraudulent joinder doctrine to police sham plaintiffs.
