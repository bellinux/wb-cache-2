5|$|For ten centuries {{after the}} fall of the Roman Empire, {{lesbianism}} disappeared from literature. Foster points to the particularly strict view that Eve—representative of all women—caused the <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> mankind; original sin among women was a particular concern, especially because women were perceived as creating life. During this time, women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man.

However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E

5|$|Significant Minoan remains {{have been}} found above the Late Minoan I era Thera ash layer and tsunami level, and {{it is unclear whether}} the effects were enough to trigger the <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> the Minoan civilization. Some sites were {{abandoned}} or settlement systems significantly interrupted {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the eruption. As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on ships for their livelihood, the Thera eruption likely caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans. Whether the effects were enough to trigger the <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> the civilization is intensely debated. The Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans occurred in Late Minoan II period. The Mycenaeans were a military civilization. Using their functional navy and a well-equipped army, they were capable of an invasion. Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete. That demonstrates Mycenaean military influence not many years after the eruption. Many archaeologists speculate that the eruption caused a crisis in Minoan civilization, making them vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans.|$|E

40|$|Recently, the {{educational}} community has {{become aware of}} Twit-ter and begun {{to use it as}} a pedagogical tool. Yet, using these tools within a course is not enough to ensure positive outcomes. Thus, more research is needed to understand the perceived benefits and <b>downfalls</b> <b>of</b> its integration in the classroom context. To this end, the present study examined (a) how instructors are using Twitter and (2) compares and contrasts instructors and students perceptions of the benefits and <b>downfalls</b> <b>of</b> using Twitter in the classroom. Practical ap-plications and directions for future research are discussed. Whether it sparks a Twitter hoax about Justin Bieber’s death (Serpe, 2012), or a major motion picture about how Face-book came into existence, it would be difficult to argue that computer mediated communication (CMC) does not play a major role in our day-to-day lives.
