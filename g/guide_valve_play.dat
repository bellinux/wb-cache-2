40|$|Abstract—Solenoid {{operated}} electromagnetic control <b>valve</b> (ECV) <b>playing</b> {{an important}} role for car’s air conditioning control system. ECV is used in external variable displacement swash plate type compressor and controls the entire air conditioning system {{by means of a}} pulse width modulation (PWM) input signal supplying from an external source (controller). Complete form of ECV contains number of internal features like valve body, core, <b>valve</b> <b>guide,</b> plunger, guide pin, plunger spring, bellows etc. While designing the ECV; dimensions of different internal items must meet the standard requirements as it is quite challenging. In this research paper, especially the dimensioning of ECV body and its three pressure ports through which the air/refrigerant passes are considered. Here internal leakage test analysis of ECV body is being carried out from its discharge port (Pd) to crankcase port (Pc) when the <b>guide</b> <b>valve</b> is placed inside it. The experiments have made both in ordinary and digital system using different assumptions and thereafter compare the results. Keywords—Electromagnetic control valve (ECV), Leakage...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of Inlet <b>Guide</b> <b>Valve</b> is optimized with designing new efficient mechanism for their actuation. Inlet <b>Guide</b> <b>Valve</b> is an umbrella term which comprises both inlet Guide Vanes and the mechanism to actuate them. Guide vanes not only provide the inlet pressure drop but also impart a whirl motion {{to the gas}} as it enters the compressor impeller. Since this whirl motion is in the rotational direction of the impeller, it reduces {{the amount of work}} the impeller is required to do on the gas. This paper contains the basic concept behind Inlet Guide Vane, their working & importance. Also included is the new designed mechanism. The results of various positions of Inlet Guide Vane on Upstream Fluid Flow are analyzed & include in this paper. ...|$|R

50|$|Ferguson {{designed}} and popularized two unique instruments called the 'Firebird' and the 'Superbone'. The Firebird {{was similar to}} a trumpet, but had the <b>valves</b> <b>played</b> with the left hand (instead of the right) and a trombone-style slide played with the right hand. Indian-American trumpeter Rajesh Mehta bought this trumpet while living in Amsterdam and played the Firebird in his own innovative music contexts from 1998 until 2011 when he had American trumpet maker George Schlub create the Orka-M Naga Phoenix trumpet for him. The Superbone was another hybrid instrument, which was fundamentally a trombone with additional <b>valves</b> <b>played</b> with the left hand. Ferguson regularly incorporated Indian instruments and influences in albums and concerts.|$|R
5000|$|Professional {{models have}} three top-action <b>valves,</b> <b>played</b> {{with the first}} three fingers of the right hand, plus a [...] "compensating" [...] fourth valve, {{generally}} found midway down {{the right side of}} the instrument, played with the left index finger; such an instrument is shown at the top of this page. Beginner models often have only the three top-action valves, while some intermediate [...] "student" [...] models may have a fourth top-action <b>valve,</b> <b>played</b> with the fourth finger of the right hand. Compensating systems are expensive to build, and there is in general a substantial difference in price between compensating and non-compensating models. For a thorough discussion of the valves and the compensation system, see the article on brass instruments.|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{the inner}} {{diameter}} of the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> and the outer {{diameter of the}} valve stem may become worn. In the 1980s, many U.S. production engine remanufacturers began reaming <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> rather than replacing them, {{as part of their}} remanufacturing process. They found that by reaming all the <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> in a head to one standard size (typically 0.008 in. diametrically oversized), and installing remanufactured engine valves having stems that are also oversized, a typical engine head can be remanufactured in much less time. Since the reaming process leaves the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> with a much better surface finish and shape than typical replacement guides, and since the oversize valves often have chrome plated stems, remanufacturers also discovered that valve train warranty issues are virtually eliminated.|$|R
40|$|The first {{check valve}} {{featuring}} dual regulation of in-plane flow and heat-shrink tubing packaging is presented. This modular design is optimized for integration into low-profile fluidic devices requiring flow control, such as drug delivery devices. Theoretical and finite-element-modeling (FEM) {{analyses were performed}} to <b>guide</b> <b>valve</b> design and these results were confirmed experimentally. The valve regulates flow between 150 - 900 mmHg (20 - 120 kPa) and withstands> 500 mmHg (66. 7 kPa) of reverse pressure. The heat-shrink packaging scheme does not require adhesives and is extremely robust (> 2000 mmHg without leakage) ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{aircraft}} piston engines, the <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> {{are typically}} shaped in a tube with a flare at one end, {{so as to}} resemble in section, the letter [...] "T". Their replacement involves removing the worn part by driving {{it out with a}} hammer and specifically-shaped punch. Installation involves heating the cylinder (with its integral head) and freezing the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> so as to ease insertion, and then driving the new guide in quickly with a hammer. Once the parts return to room temperature the new <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> will be solidly in place and ready to be reamed and honed to proper diameter.|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{components}} {{were designed for}} ease of access and maintenance. The <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> and <b>valves</b> could be removed without removing the engine from the motorcycle. [...] The cylinder heads were integral with the engine. The intake and exhaust manifolds were cast as one piece such that the exhaust would heat the fuel mixture to improve fuel atomization. The engine had a large external flywheel {{on the left side}} similar to that on the horizontal single-cylinder Moto Guzzi.|$|R
50|$|Oxygen {{is carried}} by the blood pigment hemocyanin. Both oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse {{in and out of}} blood through the capillaries. A muscular valve regulates the process of opening and closing the {{entrance}} of the lung. When the valve opens, the air can either leave or come into the lung. The <b>valve</b> <b>plays</b> an important role in reducing water loss and preventing drowning.|$|R
5000|$|On September 24, 1977, {{the relief}} valve for the reactor {{pressurizer}} failed to close when the reactor, running at only 9% power, shut down because of a disruption in the feedwater system.

The main object products are <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> <b>valve</b> seat inserts, and exhaust system parts used in engines. Due to higher engine performance, which is one technology for responding to environmental problems in recent years, the service environments of these parts have become more severe, and improved performance in the wear resistance of materials and other properties is increasingly required.

50|$|Introduced in 1997 (1998 model year), all Corollas for the North American market {{were now}} built in Fremont, California (by NUMMI) or Cambridge, Ontario (by TMMC). Unlike the Japanese counterparts, the North American Corolla {{at this time}} was only offered as a four-door compact sedan. A new all-aluminum 1ZZ-FE engine powered all Corollas, making this {{generation}} lighter than its predecessor. This new engine uses a timing chain instead of a timing belt. It also incorporated laser etched <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> directly in the block, rather than the old shrink to fit <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> in the predecessor Corolla motor (4A-FE & 7A-FE). This prevents oil burning and <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> failure in the future.|$|R

50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Speed Six engine suffered from poor valve train durability leading to many warranty claims against TVR. Subsequent third party development work has mitigated this issue by using revised material harnesses for the cam lobes, finger followers and <b>valve</b> <b>guides.</b> Softer <b>valve</b> springs and valves with thicker stems were also utilised. Engines that have had these modifications performed have much improved durability. Another third party development offers a redesigned cylinder head with cam and bucket valve actuation so eliminating the use of finger followers altogether.|$|R

40|$|The {{researches}} {{have been}} carried out, where the object has been the set of two friction couples: valve stem – <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> and <b>valve</b> seat – seat insert. The camless driven valve has been common for each of such cases. The analyzed valve {{has been driven by}} magnetoelectrical drive. The special research stand has been elaborated and its scheme has been presented in the article. It has been measured the valve lift and valve acceleration, the impact force, the friction force, temperature values for <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> and for seat insert, sound level during impacting on the stand. The aim of researches has been to determine the dynamic parameters, the friction force between valve stem and <b>valve</b> <b>guide,</b> the impact force for valve impacting seat insert vs. frequency and valve lift. The analyzed valves have mated with seat inserts and <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> made of cast iron, in oil absence. The valves have been made of TiAl 6 Zr 4 Sn 2 Mo 2 alloy. The researched friction couples have operated in temperature equal 293 K. The increase of frequency has resulted in small changes for values of lift and in greater changes of acceleration, during valve impact into its seat insert. The greatest values of impact force and acceleration have been for the small, middle and high values of valve lift, either. The ratio of impact force and valve acceleration has changed in thin bands. The friction force has decreased slightly with frequency increase and has decreased with valve lift increase. The sound level has increased with the frequency increase, and has not been dependent upon valve lift...|$|R

Normally, the mitral valve is the only bicuspid valve and this is situated between the heart's left atrium and left ventricle. Heart <b>valves</b> <b>play</b> a crucial role in ensuring the unidirectional flow of blood from the atrium to the ventricles, or from the ventricle to the aorta or pulmonary trunk.|$|R

When modeling the hydraulic systems, it is important that both the steady state and dynamic characteristics of the valves are modeled correctly to reproduce the dynamic characteristics of the entire system. In this paper, a proportional valve (Brevini HPV 41) is investigated to identify its dynamic and steady state characteristics. The steady state characteristics are identified by experimental flow curves. The dynamics are determined through frequency response analysis and identified using several transfer functions. The paper also presents a simulation model of the valve describing both steady state and dynamic characteristics. The simulation results are verified through several experiments...|$|R

40|$|There is {{conflicting}} evidence <b>guiding</b> <b>valve</b> prosthesis selection {{in patients with}} end-stage renal disease on dialysis. We sought to determine, after reviewing the relevant literature, the best valve substitute in patients on chronic dialysis. A total of 9 retrospective studies compared the outcomes of two valves, showing similar results and highlighting the safety of implanting bioprostheses in patients on chronic dialysis. Standards of valve selection have changed over time; {{it has long been}} believed that tissue valves undergo premature degeneration due to calcium metabolism derangements in patients with end-stage renal disease. Bleeding was the most common valve-related complication and represented a major drawback of mechanical valves. Two studies demonstrated a survival advantage in favour of mechanical prostheses. It can be concluded that surgeons should not hesitate to implant bioprostheses because singular valve decomposition would be uncommon in this patient population. Prosthesis selection should be based on the same criteria as those used for non-dialysis patients...|$|R

40|$|Transaortic transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAo-TAVI) is a recently developed approach that provides an alternative delivery route for valve replacement {{in patients with}} vascular abnormalities or existing comorbidities. While initial studies have shown the principal efficacy and safety, the real world effectiveness and safety of this approach remains to be fully assessed. In this regard, the Registry Of the Utilization of the TAo-TAVI approach using the Edwards SAPIEN Valve (ROUTE) represents the first multicenter, multinational prospective documentation of the course and outcome of patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAo-TAVI. ROUTE commenced in February 2013 {{with the goal of}} consecutively enrolling 300 patients at up to 22 sites across Europe.
