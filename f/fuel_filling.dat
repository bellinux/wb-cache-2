25|$|The Port of Doraleh {{terminus}} {{as one of}} the {{key elements}} of the railway is effectively non-functional. No trunk line to the three different terminals have been built. The basic infrastructure to store, to move and to handle goods, containers and fuel is missing.

It was – again – a general communication and coordination issue between authorities.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{hood of the}} DeLorean had grooves {{running down}} both sides. It included a gas flap to simplify <b>fuel</b> <b>filling.</b> The gas flap was built so that the trunk could {{be added to the}} total cargo area of the DeLorean. These cars typically had a locking gas cap to prevent siphoning. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases stayed). This style was retained well into 1982. Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking gas caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no gas flap, but with locking gas caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of gas flap hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation—Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the gas flap design.|$|E

2500|$|The SHRIMP was {{at least}} in theory and in many aspects {{identical}} in geometry to the RUNT and RUNT II devices later proof-fired in Castle Romeo and Castle Yankee respectively. On paper it was a scaled-down version of these devices, and its origins {{can be traced back to}} the spring and summer of 1953. The United States Air Force indicated the importance of lighter thermonuclear weapons for delivery by the B-47 Stratojet and B-58 Hustler. Los Alamos National Laboratory responded to this indication with a follow-up enriched version of the RUNT scaled down to a 3/4 scale radiation-implosion system called the SHRIMP. The proposed weight reduction (from TX-17’s [...] to TX-21’s [...] ) would provide the Air Force with a much more versatile deliverable gravity bomb. The final version tested in Castle used partially enriched lithium as its fusion fuel. Natural lithium is a mixture of lithium-6 and lithium-7 isotopes (with 7.5% of the former). The enriched lithium used in Bravo was nominally 40% lithium-6 (the balance was the much more common lithium-7, which was incorrectly assumed to be [...] inert). The fuel slugs varied in enrichment from 37 to 40% in Li, and the slugs with lower enrichment were positioned at the end of the fusion-fuel chamber, away from the primary. The lower levels of lithium enrichment in the fuel slugs, compared with the ALARM CLOCK and many later hydrogen weapons, were due to shortages in enriched lithium at that time, as the first of the Alloy Development Plants (ADP) started production by the fall of 1953. The volume of LiD fuel used was approximately 60% the volume of the fusion <b>fuel</b> <b>filling</b> used in the wet SAUSAGE and dry RUNT I and II devices, or about , corresponding to about 400kg of lithium deuteride (as LiD has a density of 0.78201 g/cm3). The mixture cost about 4.54USD/g at that time. The fusion burn efficiency was ~25.1%, the highest attained efficiency of the first TN weapon generation. This efficiency is well within the figures given in a November 1956 statement, when a DOD official disclosed that thermonuclear devices with efficiencies ranging from 15% to up about 40% had been tested. Hans Bethe reportedly stated independently that those weapons tested during Castle had (fusion) efficiencies varying from as low as 15% to up about 25%.|$|E

We have used the reed switch which works according {{to the principle of}} Hall Effect for sensing the amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>filled</b> in the vehicle and amount of fuel consumed. Then this record is stored in the system memory. This system stores the record for several logs. We have used the MSP 430 F 149 microcontroller for our system. It is a ultra low power, 16 bit RISC architecture controller. It contains inbuilt 12 bit ADC, serial communication interface. Real Time Clock (RTC) is also provided to keep the track of time. Also we have used the GPS technology to track the vehicle. In this paper, the implementation of embedded control system based on the microcontroller is presented. The embedded control system can achieve many tasks of the effective fleet management, such as fuel monitoring, vehicle tracking. Using GPS vehicle tracking technology and viewing interactive maps enable us to see where it was losing money, time and wasting fuel (such as on duplicated journeys) ...|$|R
