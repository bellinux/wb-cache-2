5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the <b>glass</b> <b>transition.</b> When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the <b>glass</b> <b>transition,</b> {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the <b>glass</b> <b>transition,</b> the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E
5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a <b>glass</b> <b>transition,</b> above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the <b>glass</b> <b>transition.</b> Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E
5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the <b>glass</b> <b>transition,</b> turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the <b>glass</b> <b>transition,</b> allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their <b>glass</b> <b>transition,</b> so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E
40|$|We study <b>glass</b> <b>transitions</b> and jamming of {{supercooled}} vectorial spin systems without quenched {{disorder in}} a large dimensional limit. Our theory provides a unified mean-field theoretical framework for <b>glass</b> <b>transitions</b> of rotational degree of freedoms such as color angles in the continuous coloring of graphs, vector spins of geometrically frustrated magnets, directors of Janus particles and ellipsoids. The rotational <b>glass</b> <b>transitions</b> accompany various types of replica symmetry breaking.

40|$|Despite several {{reports in}} the last years on <b>glass</b> <b>transitions</b> in {{different}} biological systems, their existence is still controversial. In this work we use the method of thermally stimulated depolarization currents, which is very sensitive to transitions and has been widely used in the study of <b>glass</b> <b>transitions</b> in synthetic polymeric systems, to investigate this question. The thermograms obtained with different systems (plant tissue, proteins, saccharides) show, at high water contents, transitions in the temperature range 170 to 200 K, which shift to higher temperatures with decreasing water content. Three features of the transitions, namely the dependence of their dynamics on water content, the dependence of their activation energies on temperature and the validity of compensation effects, reveal, in analogy to synthetic polymeric systems, the existence of two <b>glass</b> <b>transitions,</b> probably due to the hydration water and the matrix structure, respectively...|$|R
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the <b>glass</b> <b>transition,</b> in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their <b>glass</b> <b>transition,</b> but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the <b>glass</b> <b>transition,</b> turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
40|$|Although spin <b>glass</b> <b>transitions</b> {{have long}} been {{observed}} in diluted magnetic alloys, e. g. AuFe and CuMn alloys, previous numerical studies are not completely consistent with the experiment results. The abnormal critical exponents of the alloys remain still puzzling. By employing parallel tempering algorithm with finite-size scaling analysis, we investigated the phase transitions in canonical AuFe alloys. Our results strongly support that spin <b>glass</b> <b>transitions</b> occur at finite temperatures in the alloys. The calculated critical exponents agree well with those obtained from experiments. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} “lattice glass models ” {{in which}} each site can be occupied by at most one particle, and any particle may have at most occupied nearest neighbors. Using the cavity method for locally tree-like lattices, we derive the phase diagram, with a particular focus on the vitreous phase and the highest packing limit. We also study the energy landscape via the configurational entropy, and discuss different equilibrium glassy phases. Finally, we show that a kinetic freezing, depending on the particular dynamical rules chosen for the model, can prevent the equilibrium <b>glass</b> <b>transitions.</b> PACS. 64. 70.

40|$|Recent {{numerical}} simulations {{indicate that}} several different equilibrium <b>glass</b> <b>transitions</b> may {{be characterized by}} diverging correlation lengths, and that these divergences are described by a non-mean-field, Ising-like, critical exponent. I argue here that a minimal model of polydisperse, hard-core particles can be reformulated in terms of Ising spins. The two spin states correspond, at high pressure, to two compact, local topologies [...] "solidlike" and "liquidlike" [...] whose average volumes per particle are nearly identical for strongly frustrated, glass forming systems. The critical correlations in this system imply a Vogel-Fulcher-Tamann formula for the structural relaxation time. The theory also predicts, however, that realistic glass-forming systems generally are not exactly critical and, therefore, do not exhibit ideal <b>glass</b> <b>transitions</b> at low temperatures or high pressures.
