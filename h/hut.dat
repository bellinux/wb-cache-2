5|$|In November 2016, Pizza <b>Hut</b> told {{media that}} it had merged with Eagle Boys. In a statement, Pizza <b>Hut</b> said it {{intended}} to convert {{about half of the}} Eagles Boys to the Pizza <b>Hut</b> brand before Christmas 2016; the remainder it hopes to convert by April2017. The first store to switch from Eagle Boys to Pizza <b>Hut</b> was on Sydney's northern beaches.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink was not {{a trained}} scientist, and his {{incompetence}} with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern {{to some of the}} party. However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the <b>hut</b> when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the <b>hut.</b> A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings. During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set fire to the <b>hut</b> and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fire fumes as they slept.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, Eagle Boys {{was named}} in BRW Magazine's Fast Franchise {{list for the}} first time. By March 2011, Eagle Boys had more than 25 stores in Sydney. It had also {{overtaken}} Pizza <b>Hut</b> to become the second largest pizza maker in Australia. However, Pizza <b>Hut</b> regained second position by July 2014.|$|E
50|$|Five of the <b>huts</b> are serviced, i.e. {{firewood}} or coal is provided, and 14 to 20 bunks are available: Cannibal Gorge, Ada Pass, Christopher, Anne and Boyle Flat <b>huts.</b> Christopher Cullers and Rokeby <b>huts</b> {{are basic}} <b>huts</b> with four and three bunks, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Within the Australian Alps {{there are}} about 120 active alpine <b>huts</b> that mostly {{date back to the}} early cattlemen's days, early skiing <b>huts,</b> and early {{research}} and surveying <b>huts.</b> Many of these have remained in use by fly fishers (seasonal), hikers and skiing groups throughout the year. Most of these <b>huts</b> are maintained by volunteers through the Kosciuszko <b>Huts</b> Association and the local National Parks and Wildlife Service.|$|R
50|$|The major {{mountain}} <b>huts</b> on {{the mountain}} are the Nōtori <b>Huts</b> (Nōtori Goya) {{at the base of}} Mount Nishinōtori. Slightly further down the mountain are the Daimonzawa <b>Huts</b> (Daimonzawa Goya).|$|R
5|$|In chapter 157 of Njáls saga, a {{man named}} Dörruð {{witnesses}} 12 people riding together to a stone <b>hut</b> on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the <b>hut</b> and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the <b>hut,</b> and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, {{and that they have}} set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the warp and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called Darraðarljóð, which Dörruð memorizes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Hut</b> Point and Cape Evans huts remain, {{protected}} by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans <b>hut</b> an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing {{the names of those}} lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.|$|E
5|$|The square, {{originally}} called Zion Circus, {{was named}} for the Zion Cinema (also called Zion Hall), a 400-seat silent movie house which occupied a <b>hut</b> on the site from 1912 to 1920. After the <b>hut</b> collapsed under a heavy snowfall, the cinema was reconstructed as a 600-seat theater for film screenings and live opera performances.|$|E
5000|$|New Zealand has {{a network}} of {{approximately}} 950 backcountry <b>huts.</b> [...] The <b>huts</b> are officially maintained by the Department of Conservation (DOC), {{although some of the}} <b>huts</b> have been adopted and maintained by local hiking and hunting clubs by arrangement. There are also unofficial and privately owned <b>huts</b> in some places. They vary from small bivouac shelters made of wood to large modern <b>huts</b> that can sleep up to 40 people, with separate cooking areas, utilities and gas.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the alpine club <b>huts</b> {{there is also a}} large number of alpine accommodation <b>huts</b> run by private individuals. These are listed in the List of mountain <b>huts</b> in the Alps.|$|R
50|$|Soldiers had {{to build}} their own <b>huts</b> {{including}} surrounding trenches for drainage. The <b>huts,</b> made of log, were 14 by 16 ft and 6.5 ft high. Twelve men often shared one of over one thousand simple <b>huts</b> built in Jockey Hollow to house the army. Inside the <b>huts</b> soldiers had a fireplace for warmth and cooking. To create a floor they packed the ground for an earthen floor. Soldiers also had to make their own furniture, including bunks and tables. Their bunks got covered with straw and each soldier was given one blanket. Soldiers <b>huts</b> were about 2 to 3 ft (50-100 cm) apart, with three rows of eight <b>huts</b> for each regiment. By 1780, soldiers had built about 1,200 <b>huts</b> in Jockey Hollow.|$|R
5|$|Those on {{the most}} popular routes, such as the Goûter <b>Hut,</b> now require all climbers to pre-book. Some tiny huts, such as the remote Eccles <b>Hut,</b> can also be {{extremely}} crowded during good mountaineering weather, and some climbers prefer to bivouac outside.|$|E
5|$|A Pizza <b>Hut</b> tie-in {{campaign}} for the fourth anime series started on January 7, 2008. The Rose Mansion from the story was recreated in the Second Life virtual world and opened on February 8, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the <b>hut,</b> and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the <b>hut,</b> he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed {{up the hill to}} meet him.|$|E
50|$|While many beach <b>huts</b> were former fishermen's <b>huts,</b> boatsheds or {{converted}} bathing machines, some of {{the earliest}} purpose built beach <b>huts</b> in the UK were erected at Bournemouth, either side of Bournemouth Pier in 1909. Designed by F. P. Dolamore, Bournemouth's Borough Engineer, they were offered for hire for £12 10s per year. 160 <b>huts,</b> or bungalows as they were styled, were initially built before the World War I. Today, Bournemouth features around 520 <b>huts</b> owned by the Council; there are in addition a further 1200 privately owned <b>huts.</b> They vary in style from the traditional, wooden, shed-like constructions to the ultra modern, concrete terrace style <b>huts</b> such as the 1950s Overstrand beach <b>huts</b> at Boscombe. These were renovated to designs by Wayne and Gerardine Hemingway, founders of the Red or Dead label, as Beach Pods for the Surf Reef opened in Autumn 2009.|$|R
50|$|The track {{has many}} <b>huts,</b> {{enabling}} hikers to stay indoors every night. There is no booking system for <b>huts,</b> {{so it is}} mandatory for hikers to carry a tent in case there is no space available or there is an incident on the track. Commercial groups are not encouraged to use the <b>huts</b> overnight and while one company operates from a set of five private <b>huts,</b> all other operators use the designated group camping areas near each of the main <b>huts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Telecommunication <b>huts</b> {{are fully}} {{assembled}} or modular field-assembled transportable structures capable of housing an electronic communications system. These <b>huts</b> provide a controlled internal {{environment for the}} communications equipment and occasional craftspersons. The <b>huts</b> are designed with locks, security, and alarms to discourage access by unauthorized persons. <b>Huts</b> can be provided with a decorative facade to comply with local building requirements. Telecommunications <b>huts</b> are designed to withstand climate conditions existing throughout the USA including rain, snow, sleet, high winds, ice, sand storms, earthquakes and lightning.|$|R
5|$|Eagle Boys was an Australian {{fast food}} chain specialising in Italian-American cuisine, in {{particular}} pizza. The chain {{was acquired by}} Pizza <b>Hut</b> in November 2016 and was officially closed on the 1st of May 2017.|$|E

50|$|Pennington was {{the site}} of a migrant hostel from 1950 until it closed in 1985. It was known as Finsbury Hostel from 1949 to 1966, then renamed to Pennington. It {{initially}} consisted of Nissen <b>huts,</b> Romney <b>huts</b> and Quonset <b>huts,</b> mostly second hand Army surplus. The <b>huts</b> provided dormitory and family accommodation, with separate dining, recreation and latrine buildings. Despite official closure, accommodation continued for migrants up to the mid-1990s.|$|R
5|$|The {{only other}} {{significant}} human impact {{is a small}} prefabricated <b>hut</b> which is used by researchers while staying on the island. The <b>hut</b> includes a few bunk beds and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics. All visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to this ecosystem. It is believed that some young boys tried to introduce potatoes, which were promptly dug up once discovered. An improperly handled human defecation resulted in a tomato plant taking root which was also destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The second season's {{work was}} planned in three stages. First, all depot stores— in total—were to be {{transferred}} from Cape Evans to <b>Hut</b> Point. These stores would then be transported from <b>Hut</b> Point to a base depot at Minna Bluff. Finally, a journey south would be made, to reinforce the 80° depot and lay new ones at 81°, 82°, 83°, and lastly at Mount Hope, near {{the foot of the}} Beardmore Glacier, at 83°30'.|$|E
5|$|There are American-style {{fast food}} franchises {{that cater to}} the local {{community}} such as McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), and Pizza <b>Hut.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are a few}} Toda <b>huts</b> on {{the hills}} above Botanical Garden, where Todas still dwell. There are other Toda {{settlements}} in the area, notably Kandal Mund near Old Ooty. Although many Toda have abandoned their traditional distinctive <b>huts</b> for concrete houses, a movement is now afoot to build tradition barrel-vaulted <b>huts</b> and {{during the last decade}} forty new <b>huts</b> have been built and many Toda sacred dairies renovated.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 they {{launched}} a campaign - A Thousand <b>Huts</b> - to encourage Scots to build <b>huts</b> in woodland.|$|R
25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, hop-picking was {{becoming}} an increasingly mechanised process. This, plus the improvements in sanitation at home, {{led to a}} decline in the need for Hopper <b>Huts.</b> The vast majority of <b>huts</b> today are no more. A few survive derelict or converted to residential or other use. Hopper <b>Huts</b> can still be seen today at Grange Farm, Tonbridge and Downs Farm, Yalding. A set of Hopper <b>Huts</b> from North Frith Farm, Hadlow, has been re-erected at the Museum of Kent Life, Sandling.These were a row of six <b>huts</b> built of brick under a peg tiled roof, with integral fireplaces.|$|R
5|$|Three natives {{were found}} at Kaiapit who had been tied with rope to the {{uprights}} of a native <b>hut</b> and had then been bayoneted.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter <b>Hut</b> used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses <b>Hut.</b> Each high altitude <b>hut</b> faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|During {{excavation}} of the site, four ceramic sherds {{were found in}} the vicinity which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 ceramic sherds dating from Roman Britain; although most of these were dated to the fourth century, the sherds reflected all four centuries of this period. Dated to the fourth century was a <b>hut</b> that had been erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Evidence of human activity at this <b>hut</b> was found in the form of 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, thus suggesting that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.|$|E
50|$|The <b>huts</b> {{higher on}} the {{mountain}} are more basic. Most have several bunkrooms with beds, and also offer somewhere to rest, cook and eat. Some also have running water. A few <b>huts</b> are very basic bothies and offer only a space to sleep that is sheltered from the weather. Beds in the <b>huts</b> can be reserved at the park gates.Camping is allowed anywhere in the National Park, but it is most encouraged around the <b>huts</b> to limit environmental impact. It is possible for campers to use the communal spaces in the <b>huts</b> for no extra fee.|$|R
50|$|The villages on {{the islands}} consist of {{sporadically}} placed <b>huts</b> strewn about in designated areas. The <b>huts</b> are normally round with dome-shaped roofs. They are typically raised above the ground and have ladders that the residents pull up after they climb into the <b>huts</b> at night.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{the remains}} of a group of squatter's <b>huts</b> in San Pedro, 1936. In the picture, many of the crude wooden <b>huts</b> have fallen into the calm water. At center, there are only broken boards to show that there were any <b>huts</b> there at all. The {{buildings}} in the background are still standing, and several utility poles are visible in the distance. The <b>huts</b> were destroyed when the pier was torn down...|$|R
