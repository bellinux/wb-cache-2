5|$|The second {{elliptical}} {{building was}} built on top foundations of the first, and although the architect must {{have been aware of}} the exact layout of the previous building, the design of the second was slightly modified. Although the <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> similar to the first, it used different diameters of arc to achieve a slightly 'fatter' design. The second 'elliptical' building was not constructed until about AD 220, and this was confirmed by a coin of Emperor Elagabalus under one of the pavement slabs. It is thought that the second building may have survived until the end of Roman rule and influence in Britain.|$|E
500|$|Governor John W. Bricker of Ohio, who {{did become}} the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1944, helped Willis in his race. Upon Willis' victory, Bricker wired {{a friend to}} express jubilation, {{which turned out to}} have been unfounded: [...] "Election showed {{definite}} trend in all areas against New Deal. I was not surprised at the outcome particularly in Kentucky because the thinking {{of the people of the}} Middle West is in line with results down there. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> much like a Republican victory next year." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Dean of Faded Glamour {{believed}} that Strike Back [...] "remains {{pretty good at}} what it does—providing Sky viewers with their weekly Die Hard fix," [...] adding [...] "series two won't win any new converts, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> much like {{it will continue to}} serve up the same pacey, unpretentious and unambiguous action as its predecessor." [...] Jack Foley of IndieLondon rated it 2.5 out of five. Foley felt the death of Porter in the first episode was [...] "striking" [...] since Armitage was the [...] "main reason for watching." [...] The reviewer also {{believed that}} while the first series [...] "offered a keen mix of Spooks and 24 that expertly blended top-drawer action with some emotional complexity and intrigue," [...] the second series [...] "already feels inferior to both by virtue of the fact that its brains appear to lie in its pants, or blown from Porter's head." [...] Keith Watson of Metro stated that Project Dawn was merely [...] "gung-ho nonsense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Janos Prohaska. After {{viewing the}} Patterson–Gimlin film with John Green, costume {{designer}} and ape-suit mime Janos Prohaska (noted {{for his work}} in the late-1960s television programs Star Trek and Lost in Space) concluded the film's subject looked real to him. When asked if he thought the film was faked, Prohaska replied, [...] "I don't think so ... to me <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>very,</b> very real." [...] If the film was hoaxed, Prohaska thought, it was remarkably realistic and sophisticated, and the best costume he had ever seen, and the only plausible explanation was that someone might have glued false hair [...] "directly to the actor's skin".|$|E

60|$|As {{they were}} walking home, James said that the squirrel's back looked wet, where the dye went upon him, {{but he did not}} think <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> blue.|$|R
60|$|With {{care and}} {{elaboration}} they ornamented that tree's lower branches with sugar-topped biscuits, oranges, bits of banana, and marrons glares till <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> ape's path to Paradise.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, indeed, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> nice. But, dear Mrs. Allen, are {{you sure}} there is nobody you know in all this {{multitude}} of people? I think you must know somebody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Festing admitted. [...] "I didn't {{quite know}} what I'd {{undertaken}} when I gave my promise. The thing looks worse in England. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> nearly impossible just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} did love me <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> like <b>it</b> a month ago, unless you have turned coquette, and I can't quite believe that," [...] he {{answered}} bitterly.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Why, it IS difficult, sir, I confess,' {{said the}} tall footman. 'It may {{be done by}} degrees, Sir. Coffee is the best practice. I carried coffee, Sir, for a long time. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> like rappee, sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Cliff, {{grasping}} Burke by the arm, [...] "don't {{you think}} <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> much {{as if that}} Captain Hagar was trying to run away with the treasure which has been entrusted to him?" ...|$|E
60|$|In fact, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> much as if--from {{a purely}} {{commercial}} point of view--the great Lines Supplying Trust {{was going to}} be what is known in theatrical circles as a frost.|$|R

5000|$|... 1935: Timber {{inspector}} C. F. Ross and {{a friend}} saw the creature. On its head was a single horn and its head was small and flat. To them <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> much like a dinosaur.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s {{the owner}} of Castle Craig Farm, {{which is where the}} rock is located, named it Castle Craig Rock because he thought <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> similar to Castlecraig in Black isle in {{northern}} Scotland.|$|R

25|$|I thought <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> teeny-bopperish. But {{we were on}} top of a deadline, so {{of course}} {{there was no way to}} make any radical changes to it. There were some silly bits—little chunks of corn and {{nonsense}} like that.|$|R
60|$|The {{voice was}} a treble voice. This {{surprised}} O'Hara. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> much {{as if he had}} put up the wrong bird. From the dimensions of the arm which he was holding, his prisoner seemed to be of tender years.|$|R
