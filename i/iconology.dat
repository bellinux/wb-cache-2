40|$|The present article {{intends to}} give a new {{approach}} to the reading of textsfrom the period known as Baroque and, for that, it was necessary to create new terms thatcorresponded to this expectation: the iconophotology and photographic poems. In order toenable a reader to read and understand texts of that period, he would have to have access to asignical key to which only readers of that moment had access: the <b>iconologies.</b> However, suchreference has been lost; therefore, we have to replace it by another one, from the imageticphotographiccollection we have, which is called iconophotological. With this premise, it will bepossible to read, under the contemporary point of view (not under the baroque point of view),the so-called photographic poems...|$|R

[...] For instance, in 1946, Jan Gerrit Van Gelder [...] "criticized Panofsky's <b>iconology</b> as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content." [...] Furthermore, <b>iconology</b> is mostly avoided by social historians who do not accept the theoretical dogmaticism in the work of Panofsky.|$|E

40|$|According to P. Francastel, the {{sociology}} of the arts should deal with the comparative analyses of topics and artistic paradigms. This is the main thesis {{of the study of}} the reception of The Rustic Hamlet by Jerzy Duda-Gracz. Of course Polish viewers remember Shakespeare’s Hamlet; moreover they recall Hamlet by Wyspiański, Stańczyk by Matejko, and other Polish representations of the thinking or „hamletized” man. The average observer with no education in the arts, who makes a naive presentday interpretation, places The Rustic Hamlet in the context of nature rather than of culture. In such an interpretation Hamlet may be a Polish farmer or a genuine Polish citizen. However, the incongruous preiconic level of the painting complicates any attempt at interpretation. More erudite and sophisticated <b>iconologies</b> can be used to compare Shakespeare’s character and Duda-Gracz’s representation. Educated viewers recall the famous question „to be or not to be”. Such observers are able to consider hamletizing in more abstract terms and are thus able to reconstruct the metaphor.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} reassesses {{the role}} of Eastern thought in Yeats 2 ̆ 7 s poetry and finds it to be lifelong and central to his world view. ^ Beginning with his earliest poethood (1885) it traces his attractions to both the religious practices of the East and to the conceptual frameworks (<b>iconologies)</b> which complement them. The earliest poetry (1885 - 90) {{is marked by a}} superficial, Romantic exploitation of Eastern materials for their exoticism. At the same time Yeats was adopting a regimen of meditation he called his most important intellectual influence up to his fortieth year. In the 18902 ̆ 7 s and {{at the turn of the}} century he attempted to fulfill his religious impulse (which he singled out as his identifying characteristic) in a pseudo-mystery religion of his own devising. ^ The early years of the new century witnessed two pivotal realizations in Yeats 2 ̆ 7 s life and work: he both came to a profound acceptance of reincarnation and to a deeply felt conviction that meditative practices must be matched by the cultivation of analytical systems (2 ̆ 2 philosophies 2 ̆ 2) which render intelligible to our ordinary waking consciousness the other realms meditation opens. Per Amica and A Vision chronicle the pursuit of such knowledge. ^ In the last two decades of his life, the period of his most profound work, he greatly expanded and particularized his grasp of Eastern thought. The presence of the Tantric schools is especially felt; coming to him both through sacred texts and an intimate friendship with an Tantric adept, he found in them a vision that denied no part of the human totality. Through the Tantra Yeats was able to reconcile the claims of the heart and mind, body and soul. It was as if Yeats 2 ̆ 7 s whole life was a preparation for death and, it was in these Eastern systems he at last found the means of self-transformation whereby he might face the 2 ̆ 2 Great Questioner 2 ̆ 2 with a 2 ̆ 2 fitting confidence. 2 ̆ 2...|$|R

5000|$|In 1952, Creighton Gilbert {{added another}} {{opinion about the}} meaning of the word [...] "iconology". According to his view, <b>iconology</b> was not the actual {{investigation}} of the work of art but rather the result of this investigation. The Austrian art historian Hans Sedlmayr differentiated between [...] "sachliche" [...] and [...] "methodische" [...] <b>iconology.</b> [...] "Sachliche" [...] <b>iconology</b> refers to the [...] "general meaning of an individual painting or of an artistic complex (church, palace, monument) as seen and explained with reference to the ideas which take shape in them." [...] In contrast, [...] "methodische" [...] <b>iconology</b> is the [...] "integral iconography which accounts for the changes and development in the representations". In Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology (1986), W.J.T. Mitchell writes that <b>iconology</b> is a study of [...] "what to say about images", concerned with the description and interpretation of visual art, and also a study of [...] "what images say" [...] - the ways in which they seem to speak for themselves by persuading, telling stories, or describing. He pleads for a postlinguistic, postsemiotic [...] "iconic turn", emphasizing the role of [...] "non-linguistic symbol systems". Instead of just pointing out the difference between the material (pictorial or artistic) images, [...] "he pays attention to the dialectic relationship between material images and mental images". According to Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, the term [...] "iconology" [...] can also be used for characterizing [...] "a movement toward seeing connections across all the language processes" [...] and the idea about [...] "multiple levels and forms used to communicate meaning" [...] in order to get [...] "the total picture” of learning. [...] "Being both literate in the traditional sense and visually literate are the true mark of a well-educated human." ...|$|E

5000|$|For several years, new {{approaches}} to <b>iconology</b> have developed {{in the theory of}} images. This is the case of what Jean-Michel Durafour, French philosopher and theorist of cinema, proposed to call [...] "econology", a biological approach to images as forms of life, crossing <b>iconology,</b> ecology and sciences of nature. In an econological regime, the image (eikon) self-speciates, that is to say, it self-iconicizes with others and eco-iconicizes with them its iconic habitat (oikos). The <b>iconology,</b> mainly Warburghian <b>iconology,</b> is thus merged with a conception of the relations between the beings of the nature inherited, among others (Arne Næss, etc.) from the writings of Kinji Imanishi. For Imanishi, living beings are subjects. Or, more precisely, the environment and the living being are juste one. One of the main consequences is that the [...] "specity", the living individual, [...] "self-eco-speciates its place of life" [...] (Freedom in Evolution). As far as the images are concerned: [...] "If the living species self-specify, the images self-iconicize. This is not a tautology. The images update some of their iconic virtualities. They live in the midst of other images, past or present, but also future (those are only human classifications), which they have relations with. They self-iconicize in an iconic environment which they interact with, and which in particular makes them the images they are. Or more precisely, insofar as images have an active part: the images self-eco-iconicize their iconic environment." ...|$|E

5000|$|Though Panofsky {{strongly}} differentiated between <b>iconology</b> and iconography, {{the distinction}} is not very widely followed, [...] "and {{they have never been}} given definitions accepted by all iconographers and iconologists".

5000|$|Warburg {{used the}} term [...] "iconography" [...] in his early research, {{replacing}} it in 1908 with [...] "iconology" [...] in his particular method of visual interpretation called [...] "critical iconology", which focused on the tracing of motifs through different cultures and visual forms. In 1932, Panofsky published a seminal article, introducing a three-step method of visual interpretation dealing with (1) primary or natural subject matter; (2) secondary or conventional subject matter, i.e. iconography; (3) tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content, i.e. <b>iconology.</b> Whereas iconography analyses the world of images, stories and allegories and requires knowledge of literary sources, {{an understanding of the}} history of types and how themes and concepts were expressed by objects and events under different historical conditions, <b>iconology</b> interprets intrinsic meaning or content and the world of symbolical values by using [...] "synthetic intuition". The interpreter is aware of the essential tendencies of the human mind as conditioned by psychology and world view; he analyses the history of cultural symptoms or symbols, or how tendencies of the human mind were expressed by specific themes due to different historical conditions. Moreover, when understanding the work of art as a document of a specific civilization, or of a certain religious attitude therein, the work of art becomes a symptom of something else, which expresses itself in a variety of other symptoms. Interpreting these symbolical values, which can be unknown to, or different from, the artist's intention, is the object of <b>iconology.</b> Panofsky emphasized that [...] "iconology can be done when there are no originals to look at and nothing but artificial light to work in." ...|$|E
