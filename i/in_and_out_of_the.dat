5|$|After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda {{began working}} on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As she had missed Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she had {{returned}} to the Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while checking <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital. She did not get better, nor did she finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda was locked into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{also worked}} in Bacton, Norfolk, further up the coast, where night-flying was {{conducted}} {{and was later}} involved in supporting anti-submarine patrols. A typical patrol would {{last two or three}} days and would involve the manual labour of hoisting a seaplane <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water by means of a deck-mounted derrick.|$|E

5|$|Although {{commercial}} {{areas are}} growing rapidly, agriculture remains {{a foundation of}} the economy in the rural areas of the southern part of El Hatillo. The business sector remains mostly underdeveloped, causing heavy employee movement <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipality – a problem that has made the transportation infrastructure of El Hatillo very congested.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Channel is {{the main}} {{shipping}} channel <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Port of New York and New Jersey, making it {{the only means of}} accessing an important commercial port. Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to New York City, and bad weather could close the Channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the Harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|As his {{businesses}} grew, {{he added}} to his fleet of ships, big ones to ship salmon to San Francisco and smaller ones for shallow waters and for towing larger ships <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rogue mouth. In 1879 he bought the steamer Varuna and the tug Mary Hume and started a shipyard at Ellensburg. In 1880 he added the steam schooner Mary D. Hume, the tug Pelican in 1883, the schooner Berwick in 1887, the steamer Thistle in 1888, and replacement craft in subsequent years. Returning ships brought goods for Hume's general store.|$|E

Hodgson drew <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line-up throughout the post-season, appearing in 12 of the Canucks' 25-game playoff run, which ended in a Game 7 loss to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the actual}} and outer {{structures}} {{that make up}} and surround the United Nations Headquarters are the inner groups that play a role as well. The Security Council containing 5 permanent and 10 temporary {{for a total of}} 15 members, ensures the stabilization of peace and security whether in terms of threats or simple adjustments. A heavier focus on actual activities like debating in policymaking, and reflecting <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment, is conducted by the Economic and Social Council.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents move <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to {{the high cost of}} maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS {{knew what was going}} on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Croatia {{established}} a company-sized special police unit in Bjelovar on 23 February 1991. Following {{the deterioration of}} the situation in western Slavonia, the 105th Brigade of the ZNG was raised in the city, largely equipped with small arms only, and plans for a blockade of the routes <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city were developed. A crisis headquarters was set up to coordinate the defence {{of the city and the}} manufacture of weapons in industrial plants which had been modified for their production.|$|E
5|$|Engadine was {{purchased}} in February 1915 by the Admiralty {{and she was}} modified by Cunard at Liverpool from 10 February to 23 March 1915 with a permanent, four-aircraft, hangar in the rear superstructure {{and a pair of}} cranes were mounted {{at the rear of the}} hangar to hoist the seaplanes <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. Four quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns, each with 130 rounds, and two Vickers QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns, each with 65 rounds, were fitted for self-defence. She also carried a pigeon loft that housed carrier pigeons to be used by her aircraft if their wireless was broken.|$|E

5|$|Following {{cooperation}} between the local governmental council and the Prison Fellowship Romania Foundation, homeless people, street children and beggars are taken, identified and accommodated within the Christian Centers for Street Children and Homeless People, respectively, and the Ruhama centre. The latter features a marshaling center for beggars and street children, {{as well as a}} flophouse. As a consequence, the fluctuating movement of children, beggars and homeless people <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre has been considerably reduced, with most of the initial beneficiaries successfully integrated into the programme rather than returning to the streets.|$|E

5|$|In Apra Harbor, ten ships or tugs were sunk, as were {{numerous}} smaller vessels. One {{of the ships}} that survived in the harbor was the cutter Basswood of the Coast Guard, which recorded a wind gust of 220km/h (140mph).

5|$|In October 1966, strike force F-105 Thunderchiefs were {{equipped}} with QRC-160 radar jamming pods whose effectiveness virtually ended their losses to surface-to-air missiles. As a result, SAM attacks {{shifted to the}} Phantoms, unprotected because of a shortage of pods. To protect the F-4s, rules of engagement that allowed the MiGCAP to escort the strike force <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target area were revised in December to restrict MiGCAP penetration {{to the edge of}} SAM coverage. MiG interceptions increased as a result, primarily by MiG-21s using high-speed hit-and-run tactics against bomb-laden F-105 formations, and although only two bombers had been lost, the threat to the force was perceived as serious.|$|E
