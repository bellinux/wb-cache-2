The bearing capacity of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures at high temperature impact is lost within several dozens of minutes.

40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of components and damage mechanism of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete,</b> the wave propagation characteristics in <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> are always complicated and difficult to determine. The objective {{of this article is to}} study the failure process of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structure under the damage caused by pencil-broken. A new method on the basis of the acoustic emission technique and the Hilbert-Huang transform theory is proposed in this work. By using acoustic emission technique, the acoustic emission wave signal is generating while the real-time damage information and the strain field of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structure is receiving simultaneously. Based on the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) theory, the peak frequency characteristics of the acoustic emission signals were extracted to identify the damage modes of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structure.

40|$|<b>Reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> is {{a common}} {{structural}} material since it is strong, durable and relatively cheap. Of the various deterioration mechanisms of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures, chloride-induced corrosion of steel reinforcement is of great importance since numerous <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures are exposed to chlo-ride sources [129]. ASCE 2005 Report Card estimates a cost of $ 9. 4 billion a year for 20 years to eliminate deficiencies of 590, 750 bridges in the United States, almost half of which are <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete.</b> A 1998 survey states that 9 % of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> bridges in the United States are structurally deficient, primarily due to corrosion of steel reinforcement [196]. Accurate lifetime pre-dictions are of great use for developing efficient strategies to handle the corro-sion damage. Since chloride ingress is a transport phenomenon, {{it is necessary to}} have an accurate representation of concrete at microscale to obtain adequate lifetime predictions of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures. Diffusion, convection, migration and permeation are transport mechanisms in <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures. Chloride ingress into concrete usually occur...|$|R
