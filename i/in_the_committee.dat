5|$|In 1942, Flanders became {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> for Economic Development (CED), {{an offshoot of}} the Business Advisory Council, whose purpose was to help re-align the nation to a peacetime economy after the war.

5|$|It is {{no longer}} {{possible}} for active parliamentarians to sit on the committee, except for the last half year of parliamentary representation, if they have stated that they will not run for re-election. This allowed Jagland and Valle to sit on the committee in 2009, while they were still elected. The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are to be represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist Left Party, each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are not represented.|$|E
5|$|Opposing the {{decentralisation}} stance {{taken in}} the treaty, Pavlov {{was one of the}} key players in the establishment of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in August 1991. Pavlov's inclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> has been used to demonstrate its unwillingness to revert to pre-Gorbachev policies. The Committee's main goal was to ensure that the Soviet Union continued as a highly centralised union state. The Emergency Committee was led by Gennady Yanayev, Vice President of the Soviet Union, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, Defence Minister Dmitry Yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust Gorbachev.|$|E

5|$|The Committee {{first met}} in London on 9 September 1936 and was {{attended}} by representatives of solely European countries, and did not include Switzerland (whose policy of neutrality prohibited even inter-governmental action). It was chaired by W. S. Morrison, Britain's Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The meeting was concerned mostly with procedure only. Charles Corbin represented the French, Italy by Dino Grandi, and the Soviets were represented by Ivan Maisky. Germany was represented by Ribbentrop (with Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck as deputy) but left the running to Grandi, although they found working with him difficult; Portugal, whose presence had been a Soviet requirement, was not represented. There was little hope <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee,</b> since the British and French would {{have been aware of}} the continued shipment of arms to the Nationalists from Italy and Germany. Britain protested twice to the Italians, once in response to Italian aircraft landing in Majorca, the other pre-emptively over any significant change in the Mediterranean. Stanley Baldwin, British prime minister, and Blum attempted to halt global exports to Spain, believing it in Europe's best interests. Soviet aid to the Republic was threatened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee.</b> It began once it was clear the Non-Intervention Agreement was not preventing Italian and German aid to the Nationalists.|$|E
5|$|The five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee was {{established}} on 5 August 1897, after the Parliament of Norway accepted {{the duty to}} award the Nobel Peace Prize {{as stated in the}} will of Alfred Nobel. The first prize was awarded in 1901. The Committee is assisted by a secretariat {{that is part of the}} Norwegian Nobel Institute. In 1901, the committee was renamed the Nobel Committee of the Parliament of Norway, but this was reverted in 1977. In 1948, the election system was changed to make the committee more proportional to the representation in parliament. From then until 1967, the Labour Party, who held a majority in parliament, had three representatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 11 May, the {{possibility}} of a deal between the Liberal Democrats and Labour was looking unlikely. Talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued, and after concluding {{that he would not be}} able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation that evening. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. He then left Downing Street with his wife and their children, and drove to Buckingham Palace where he tendered his resignation to the Queen and advised her to call for David Cameron. Cameron became Prime Minister one hour after the Queen accepted Brown's resignation, and arrived at Downing Street with his wife, Samantha shortly afterwards. In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. Cameron appointed Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister. Cameron met with his MPs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> Room of the House of Commons at 10.00pm, where he was greeted with cheering that could be heard from the central hall of the Commons.|$|E

In 1874 he was elected as president of the Permanent Commission of the European Arc Measurement. He also presided the General Conference of the European Arc Measurement held in Paris in 1875, when the association decided the creation of an international geodetic standard for the bases' measurement. He represented Spain at the 1875 conference of the Metre Convention, which was ratified the same year in Paris. The Spanish geodesist was elected as the first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. His activities resulted in the distribution of a platinum and iridium prototype of the metre to all States parties to the Metre Convention during the first meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1889. Theses prototypes defined the metre right up until 1960.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{political}} parties have been represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> The first committee consisted exclusively {{of members of the}} Liberal Party. The party was represented on all committees until 1973, after which it has not had a seat. In 1907, Francis Hagerup became the first representative from the Conservative Party, and this party has been represented on the board since. The Labour Party has been represented on the board since 1919, when Halvdan Koht became a member. The Agrarian Party (since named the Centre Party) was first represented on the board by Birger Braadland in 1938. The Christian Democratic Party was first represented by Erling Wikborg in 1965, the Socialist Left Party by Hanna Kvanmo in 1991 and the Progress Party by Inger-Marie Ytterhorn in 2000.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Committee</b> noted from <b>the</b> {{unedited}} {{interview that}} Professor Wunsch had {{referred to the}} greenhouse effect {{on a couple of}} occasions. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee’s</b> opinion Professor Wunsch's comments in this respect had not been primarily to warn of the dangers of warming the ocean (as Professor Wunsch had suggested in his complaint).
