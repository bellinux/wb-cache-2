Although Webern's music changed over time, {{as is often the}} case over a long career, it is typified by very spartan textures, in which every note can be clearly heard; carefully chosen timbres, often resulting in very detailed instructions to the performers and use of extended instrumental techniques (<b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing,</b> col legno, and so on); wide-ranging melodic lines, often with leaps greater than an octave; and brevity: the Six Bagatelles for string quartet (1913), for instance, last about three minutes in total.|$|E

5000|$|Movement five is the finale. It {{begins with}} a {{slightly}} altered version of the [...] "Crocodile Chorus", and recaps the various other movements of the piece. It ends with the soloist <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing</b> a very loud note while spinning around in circles. This creates a sinusoidal sound effect, with a rising and falling volume. The soloist takes one last gasp for air and harmonizes with the orchestra on a final note that fades into silence.|$|E

5000|$|Uvular fluttertonguing is {{a method}} of {{producing}} a <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue</b> effect {{with the back of}} the tongue. The instrumentalist performs an uvular trill, which produces the traditional growl sound from the jazz idiom.|$|R
5000|$|Northern school (Beipai) - The dizi {{used for}} the Northern school, the bangdi, is shorter and higher in pitch, and its sound quality is {{brighter}} and more shrill. In Northern China, it is used in kunqu and bangzi opera, and as well as regional musical genres such as errentai. Dizi music of the Northern school {{is characterized by a}} fast, rhythmic and virtuosic playing, employing techniques such as glissando, tremolo, <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing,</b> and fast tonguing.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} movement, the soloist imitates {{the sound of}} a {{motorcycle}} changing gears. The extended trombone technique of <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing</b> is used in combination with a plunger mute to create this effect. As the trombone section takes over this sound, the soloist shifts into a complicated passage of very high, and very fast notes. This eventually subsides into the cessation of the soloist's playing, as he physically draws out the parts of the globe with his trombone slide.|$|E
5000|$|After 1950, works using E {{clarinet}} are {{too numerous}} to note individually. However, among those where the instrument is featured beyond what would be considered normal in recent music are John Adams's Chamber Symphony, where two players play E and bass clarinet and [...] "double" [...] on soprano and Adriana Hölszky's A due for two E clarinets. The extended techniques of the B clarinet, including multiphonics, <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing,</b> and extreme registers, have all been imported to the E.|$|E
50|$|Flutter-tonguing is {{also common}} in jazz music, {{particularly}} {{that which is}} associated with New Orleans or Vaudeville style. Cootie Williams was a master of combining a plunger mute with the <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue</b> to create a conversational effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} producing a <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue</b> {{effect is to}} roll {{the tip of the}} tongue as rapidly as possible. This is done by performing an isolated alveolar trill while playing the notes desired. Some players find it difficult or even impossible to roll their tongues in this way, possibly due to ankyloglossia.|$|R
5000|$|The piece {{makes use}} of {{extended}} techniques (for the flute), concretely frullato (<b>flutter</b> <b>tongue),</b> tongued pizzicato and [...] "Pauken-Effekt" [...] (tongue ram). The cello, besides the usual techniques (ranging from sul tasto to sul ponticello, flautato and col legno), uses [...] "tap": [...] "martellato mano sinistra" [...] (martellato left hand: tapping the strings with the fingertips of the left hand.|$|R
5000|$|Techniques {{which may}} create or {{be used with}} sound mass include {{extended}} techniques such as muted brass or strings, <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing,</b> wide vibrato, extreme ranges, and glissandos as the continuum for [...] "sound mass" [...] moves from simultaneously sounding notes - clusters etc., towards stochastic cloud textures, and 'mass structure' compositional textures which evolve over time [...] In a sound mass, [...] "the traditional concept of 'chord' or vertical 'event' {{is replaced by a}} shifting, iridescent fabric of sound" [...]|$|E
50|$|Sequenza X {{requires}} the trumpeter {{to employ a}} variety of extended techniques, including <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing,</b> pedal tones, and valve tremolos. Much of the musical material focuses on transmuting the timbre of the instrument, often on a single pitch. Techniques such as double tonguing and doodle tonguing are interchanged rapidly and often paired with valve tremolos and hand stops. Like much of the extended technique for brass, Berio's incorporation of doodle tonguing was inspired by jazz trumpeter Clark Terry. However, he misunderstood the method, which produces a very legato, almost drunken-sounding articulation. He repeatedly asked Stevens in rehearsals for a more staccato sounding doodle tongue, eventually acquiescing when {{he realized it was}} impossible.|$|E
5000|$|In sheet music, the {{technique}} is usually indicated with the standard tremolo markings on a note alongside a text instruction to flutter the note. The German marking [...] "Flatterzunge" [...] is often abbreviated to [...] "Flz." [...] or [...] "Flt.". The Italian [...] "frullato" [...] is sometimes abbreviated to [...] "frull". In English, the most common indication is [...] "f.t." [...] Other markings that composers have used to indicate <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing</b> include: coupe de lange roulé, en roulant la langue, tremolo dental, tremolo avec la langue, tremolo roulé, vibrata linguale, vibrando, and colpo di lingua among others.However, simply writing (3-line) tremolo marks on all rhythmic values without other indication is most generally accepted.|$|E
5000|$|In {{its early}} years, the all-male band would drift off {{to visit with}} the co-eds during the game. Cy Barcus, Mustang Band {{director}} from 1924-32, {{came up with the}} idea of having the remaining trumpets make a buzzing sound to alert the wayward band members to get back to their seats. [...] That buzz—a <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue</b> on a concert F—was incorporated into the start of Peruna, the official SMU fight song.|$|R
50|$|Mosaic (1962) {{is a set}} of variations—without a theme—for flute and piano. The piece {{introduces}} a rich array of new sounds for the flute, including key slaps, tone bending, breath tones, and <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue,</b> while the pianist is required to use knuckles on the keys, play glissandi inside the instrument, and place paper inside of the instrument to create a buzzing sound. Reynolds explains that he paid a new level of attention to “instrumental ‘color’ and the shaping influence of the texture.” In the manuscript, Reynolds even includes “rudimentary linear drawings” among his sketches, trying to evoke particular characters and texture.|$|R
5000|$|Both Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss {{used the}} effect as well. In Don Quixote, Strauss imitates the distant bleating of sheep with flutter-tongued {{notes in the}} horns. Notably, he uses the marking [...] "Zungenschlag" [...] (tongue-beat) in this passage from Variation II. Elsewhere in the score, he used the {{traditional}} German [...] "Flatterzunge". Mahler used this traditional marking as well, but he also deviated from it in the finale of his Second Symphony, where he uses the marking [...] "Zungenstoss" [...] (tongue-thrusts). On sustained whole notes, the tongue thrusts Mahler requires {{have the effect of}} a <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|R

5000|$|It was at Stockhausen’s {{suggestion}} that Stephens {{took up the}} basset horn, in order that she should play a middle-register instrument between the trumpet and trombone, two of the other principal instruments in the opera cycle Licht, begun by Stockhausen in 1977. Stephens was often more of a co-creator than just an interpreter, collaborating in the exploration of all the dimensions of performance, including new playing techniques and special effects (such as <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing,</b> glissandos, singing while playing, microtones, breath and key noises), as well as special choreography and costumes.

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{prominent}} and unique element of Dusapin’s music is its built-in tension, energy, and sense of movement. Indeed, in his article on Dusapin, Julian Anderson cites the [...] "enclosing tensions" [...] and [...] "explosive flight" [...] as the two extremes of Dusapin’s early music and claims that these idioms are what make the composer’s music so highly individual. Stoïnova also emphasizes the energy that is present in Dusapin’s earlier compositions, giving credit to Dusapin’s use of extreme registers, <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue,</b> trills, micro-intervals, glissandi, multiphonics, rapid articulations, drastic dynamics, and continuous breathing. These unique features make Dusapin’s music incredibly intense and demanding on its performers. In fact, the intensity is such that Dusapin consciously makes pieces like Musique captive (1980) have short durations (in this case, three minutes), for by their ends the musicians and listeners alike are completely exhausted.|$|R

40|$|Most digital {{waveguide}} {{models of}} woodwind instruments {{to date have}} provided only basic control parameters such as frequency, breath pressure, and vibrato. It is clear that if these models are to gain popularity as real-time performance synthesizers or as composition tools, more flexibility is necessary. This paper discusses the implementation of expressive controls for <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing,</b> growling, tone-bending, multiphonics, and variation of attack style. These e#ects are implemented on existing clarinet and flute waveguide instruments using the application SynthBuilder on a NeXTStep computer platform. Finally, control of these expressive e#ects using MIDI controllers is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The breath {{pressure}} signal applied to wind music instruments {{is generally considered}} to be a slowly varying function of time. In a context of music control, this assumption implies that a relatively low digital sample rate (100 - 200 Hz) is su#cient to capture and/or reproduce this signal. We tested this assumption by evaluating the frequency content in {{breath pressure}}, particularly during the use of extended performance techniques such as growling, humming, and <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing.</b> Our results indicate frequency content in a breath pressure signal up to about 10 kHz, with especially significant energy within the first 1000 Hz. We further investigated the frequency response of several commercially available pressure sensors to assess their responsiveness to higher frequency breath signals. Though results were mixed, some devices were found capable of sensing frequencies up to at least 1. 5 kHz. Finally, similar measurements were conducted with Yamaha WX 11 and WX 5 wind controllers and results suggest that their breath pressure outputs are sampled at about 320 Hz and 280 Hz, respectively...|$|E
5000|$|The {{musical score}} for The Conjuring was {{composed}} by Joseph Bishara, who previously collaborated with director Wan on Insidious (2011). [...] "James asked me early on about The Conjuring while {{the film was}} still coming together", explained Bishara on his involvement. [...] "The studio and producers were very supportive in allowing him to bring along who he wanted, with many of his longtime crew from Insidious and even earlier returning." [...] Further into the development process, Wan offered Bishara the chance {{to act in the}} film, which he had previously done in Insidious. [...] "We talked about music first and then James had mentioned that he might want me to play one of the entities in this. After reading the script it turned out it was Bathsheba," [...] said Bishara. Because of his early involvement, Bishara was given more time to work out the musical palette of the film. [...] "For whatever reason I was hearing brass clustering as an early response to the material, a quiet shimmering <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue</b> effect, and it grew from there", said Bishara on his creative process.|$|R
50|$|Some tubas have {{a strong}} and useful {{resonance}} {{that is not in}} the well-known harmonic series. For example, most large B tubas {{have a strong}} resonance at low E (E1, 39 Hz), which is between the fundamental and the second harmonic (an octave higher than the fundamental). These alternative resonances are often known as false tones or privileged tones. Adding the six semitones provided by the three valves, these alternative resonances let the instrument play chromatically down to the fundamental of the open bugle (which is a 29 Hz B0). The addition of valves below that note can lower the instrument a further six semitones to a 20 Hz E0. Thus, even three-valved instruments with good alternative resonances can produce very low sounds in the hands of skilled players; instruments with four valves can play even lower. The lowest note in the widely known repertoire is a 16 Hz double-pedal C0 in the William Kraft piece Encounters II, which is often played using a timed <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue</b> rather than by buzzing the lips. The fundamental of this pitch borders on infrasound and its overtones define the pitch in the listener's ear.|$|R
40|$|Composers are {{currently}} utilizing {{a vast number}} of technologies and extended flute techniques as expressive tools in spiritually inspired compositions. With the use of pitch bends, breath and wind tones, multiphonics, <b>flutter</b> <b>tongue,</b> and timbral trills, traditional flutes of different cultures are mimicked on the modern instrument more vividly than ever before. These extended techniques allow composers to combine their styles with religious traditions in an innovative manner and connect with audiences in fresh and original ways. This dissertation explores the different avenues of spiritual musical expression in contemporary flute repertoire through three thematic recital programs. The first program creates a soundscape of the musical traditions of five different faiths: Hinduism, Divination, Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity; the second program consists of chamber works inspired by traditional Western belief systems; and the final program is made up of works written as social commentary on religious or spiritual conflicts, specifically on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, the Yom Kippur War, and the Trail of Tears. The following works are performed and discussed in this dissertation: Robert Dick – Techno Yaman; Michael Daugherty – Crystal and Trail of Tears; Howard J. Buss – Scenes from the Holy Land; Tōru Takemitsu – Air; Daniel Kellogg – Into Utter Forever and Divinum Mysterium; Christopher Rouse – Compline; Richard Toensing – Children of Light; Ruth Schönthal – A Bird Over Jerusalem; Leonard Bernstein – Halil; and Katherine Hoover – Winter Spirits...|$|R
40|$|The major {{international}} music competitions require a large repertoire of technically and musically challenging music, including {{a variety of}} contemporary works and unaccompanied solo pieces. Winning the international competition signifies mastery of one's field in every style of solo repertoire. The purpose of my project is to present balanced programs selected from the elite lists of pieces required by two {{major international}} oboe competitions over the past 10 years, the Gillet International Oboe Competition and the International Oboe Competition of Tokyo. Every year numerous international music competitions are held all over the world. However, most are limited to piano, violin and vocal performances. The prestigious Geneva, Munich, and Prague competitions include the oboe every few years. But, {{there are very few}} international competitions that focus only on the oboe. These include the "Fernand Gillet International Oboe Competition," and "International Oboe Competition of Tokyo. " By familiarizing oneself with the required lists of these competitions, one can ascertain what the leading oboists in the world consider to be the most significant and challenging works, tracking both stable mainstays and contemporary trends. My three related recital programs were designed to present a variety of periods and genres, so each recital includes at least one concerto, one solo piece, one Baroque piece, and one 2 oth century piece. The first recital program includes Sonata in a minor for oboe solo by C. P. E. Bach, Sonatine for oboe andpiano by Maurice Ravel, Piri for oboe solo by Isang Yun, and Concerto by Bohuslav Martinu. The second recital program includes Les Folies dlEspagne by Marin Marais, selections from Six Etudes Pour Hautbois by Gilles Silvestrini, Obsession by Makoto Shinohara, and the Concerto in C major, K. 314 by W. A. Mozart. The third recital program includes Twelve Fantasias, No. 8 in E Minor by G. P. Telemann, Sequenza VII by Luciano Berio, the Concerto for Oboe by Eugene Goosens, nree Romances by Robert Schumann, and Fantaisie Pastorale by Eugene Bozza. This project presents a variety of repertoire ranging from C. P. E. Bach's Sonata in a minor for oboe solo, with the intrinsic challenges of the Baroque style and genre, to contemporary pieces such as Berio's Sequenza VIZ for oboe solo and Yun's Piri which require extended technique such as multiphonics, rolling tone, double trills, double tonguing, <b>flutter</b> <b>tonguing,</b> and glissando...|$|E
