5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some <b>exotic</b> <b>materials</b> it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

25|$|Cahokia, Pre-Columbian North Americas largest {{civic center}} north of Mexico, {{produced}} {{some of the}} finest and most widely spread ceramics. Pottery from the Cahokia site was especially fine, exhibiting smooth surfaces, very thin walls, and distinctive tempering, slips and coloring. Archaeologists have recorded how these qualities changed and evolved through time, and most examples can be pinpointed very accurately within the phases of the sites chronology. Ramey Incised and Powell Plain are two varieties that emerged during the Stirling Phase, and are considered two of the most important local varieties. A distinctive trait of this period is the shell temper. The cores of the sherds are typically a range of greys to buffs and creams. Some have slips of liquid clay and pigment with common colors being red, grey, and black and the surfaces polished to a high sheen. Although their attributes are nearly identical, there are major differences. While the Powell Plain has an unadorned surface, Ramey Incised are burnished and decorated with a series of incised motifs decorating the upper shoulders of the jar most often interpreted as having underworld or water connections. The incised decoration is added when the clay is still wet by tracing a design with a blunt-ended tool. The specific shapes and incised motifs are used to place the artifacts securely into the local chronology. Most have been found in association with high status items fashioned from <b>exotic</b> <b>materials</b> and associated with specialized structures such as mortuaries and temples, and were almost certainly vessels used exclusively by the elites and for ritual purposes. As the influence of the Cahokian religion, lifestyle and trade network expanded outward from its American Bottom origins, examples of its high status pottery went with it. Numerous examples have been found of local imitations of the exotic wares, albeit usually with less technical skill. Examples of Cahokian made or inspired wares have been found as far away as Aztalan in Wisconsin, the Winterville Site in Mississippi. and Fort Ancient sites in Ohio.|$|E

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{importance of}} Wanuskewin Heritage Park {{lies in the}} number and diversity of archaeological sites present in a single area. Wolf Willow and Dog Child are multicomponent occupation sites located in the Opimihaw Valley and both contain McKean components. McKean Complex sites are relatively uncommon on the Northern Plains which makes the cluster at Wanuskewin Heritage Park important. McKean lithic materials are mainly locally produced with very few <b>exotics.</b> <b>Materials</b> from McKean assemblages have a heavy reliance on local lithic materials such as chert and quartzite. McKean levels at the Thundercloud, Cut Arm, and Red Tail sites, all located in Wanuskewin Heritage Park, are consistent with this pattern of lithic resource utilization.

500|$|One of {{the cost}} {{concerns}} for MCF designs like ITER is that the reactor materials {{are subject to the}} intense neutron flux created by the fusion reactions. When high-energy neutrons impact materials they displace the atoms in the structure leading to a problem known as neutron embrittlement that degrades the structural integrity of the material. This is a problem for fission reactors as well, but the neutron flux and energy in a tokamak is greater than most fission designs. In most MFE designs, the reactor is constructed in layers, with a toroidal inner vacuum chamber, or [...] "first wall", then the lithium blanket, and finally the superconducting magnets that produce the field that confines the plasma. Neutrons stopping in the blanket are desirable, but those that stop in the first wall or magnets degrade them. Disassembling a toroidal stack of elements would be a time-consuming process that would lead to poor capacity factor, and reducing this requires the use of <b>exotic</b> <b>materials</b> which have not yet been developed.|$|E
500|$|Emerson's early folding knives {{were of the}} linerlock variety, {{ground by}} the stock removal method, and {{utilized}} rare materials from the aerospace industry, including titanium, carbon fiber, micarta, and meteorite. [...] He incorporated <b>exotic</b> <b>materials</b> common to knifemakers of the time, including mother-of-pearl, abalone shell, paua shell, staghorn, and rare hardwoods. Writer Paul Basch reported in 1990 that Emerson refused to use the parts of any animal or plant which was an endangered species, noting Emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker. The steel used in these blades was typically graded ATS-34, AEB-L, or 440C, and the blades were either highly polished or hand-rubbed. Emerson made knives with Damascus steel blades. Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today, these knives are known as the [...] "Pre-Tac" [...] (Pre-Tactical) models. They can be identified by their bright anodized titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades. The knives were noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms. Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker: Michael Walker, Clint Breshears, Bob Engnath, and Jim Ferguson.|$|E
500|$|The phase {{velocity}} {{is important in}} determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented {{in terms of a}} refractive index. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of c to the {{phase velocity}}vp in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The refractive index of air is approximately 1.0003. Denser media, such as water, glass, and diamond, have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light. In <b>exotic</b> <b>materials</b> like Bose–Einstein condensates near absolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-c speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light [...] "slowing" [...] in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a [...] "complete standstill" [...] by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being [...] "stopped" [...] in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had [...] "stopped," [...] it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which [...] "slow" [...] the speed of light.|$|E
