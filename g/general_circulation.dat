5|$|Commemorative coins with €2 {{face value}} {{have been issued}} with changes {{to the design of}} the {{national}} side of the coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for <b>general</b> <b>circulation,</b> and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.|$|E

The florin, the first decimal coin, was the last coin in <b>general</b> <b>circulation</b> just prior to decimalisation to be withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The {{parasite}} {{is relatively}} protected from {{attack by the}} body's immune system because {{for most of its}} human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P.falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins {{on the surface of the}} infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the <b>general</b> <b>circulation</b> and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.|$|E

5|$|Patagonia, in the south, {{is mostly}} arid or semi–arid {{except in the}} extreme west where {{abundant}} precipitation supports dense forest coverage, glaciers, and permanent snowfields. Its climate is classified as temperate to cool temperate with the surrounding oceans moderating temperatures on the coast. Away from the coast, areas on the plateaus have large daily and annual temperature ranges. The influence of the Andes, in conjunction with <b>general</b> <b>circulation</b> patterns, generates {{one of the strongest}} precipitation gradients (rate of change in mean annual precipitation in relation to a particular location) in the world, decreasing rapidly to the east. In much of Patagonia precipitation is concentrated in winter with snowfall occurring occasionally, particularly in the mountainous west and south; precipitation is more evenly distributed in the east and south. One defining characteristic is the strong winds from the west which blow year-round, lowering the perception of temperature (wind chill), while being a factor in keeping the region arid by favouring evaporation.|$|E
5|$|Spreckels and his {{partners}} William G. Irwin and F. F. Low formed the Spreckels & Company Bank in Hawaii in 1884, for the specific purpose of circulating the silver coins. The first Hawaiian silver coin {{known to have been}} spent, a half dollar, was found among the receipts at the Honolulu Music Hall on January 10, 1884. It was placed in a pendant and given to the leading lady. The new coinage went into <b>general</b> <b>circulation</b> on January 14, with coins available at the Hawaiian Treasury and at Spreckels' new bank in Honolulu. There was considerable demand, and the coins (all of which were received by June 1884) displaced American quarter dollars and half dollars in circulation, something taken (depending on political position) to mean that they were accepted, or that Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good) was in operation. The Hawaiian Treasury had been almost out of cash before receiving the coins, and they entered commerce as the government paid for goods and services, increasing the money supply and risking inflation. Within six months of issue, the coins traded against American currency at a discount of 2 percent.|$|E

40|$|We {{implement}} {{an approach}} for the accurate assimilation of Lagrangian data into regional <b>general</b> ocean <b>circulation</b> models. The forward model {{is expressed in}} Lagrangian coordinates and simulated float data are incorporated into the model via four dimensional variational data assimilation. We show that forward solutions computed in Lagrangian coordinates are reliable for time periods of up to 100 days with phase speeds of 1 m/s and deformation radius of 35 km. The position and depth of simulated floats are assimilated into the viscous, Lagrangian shallow water equations. The weights for the errors in the model and data are varied and the assimilation results react appropriately. We show the effect of different spatial and temporal samplings of float data on all Lagrangian trajectories in the computational domain. At {{the end of the}} assimilation period, results from the Lagrangian shallow water equations could be interpolated and used as initial and boundary conditions in an Eulerian <b>general</b> ocean <b>circulation</b> model...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 15 International audienceThe {{tropical}} oceans play {{important roles}} in the global climate system through ocean transports of heat and freshwater as well as ocean–atmosphere interactions. The developments in observational networks during recent decades have helped us to quantify the strength and variability {{of most of the}} ocean <b>general</b> <b>circulations</b> responsible for the transports. Those are discussed in detail in individual sections covering each tropical basin separately with a special emphasis on recent research results. Shallow overturning cells observed in all three tropical basins as well as the deep Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are such examples that are linked to ocean and climate variations on multiple timescales. In addition, tropical ocean–atmosphere interactions associated with oceanic planetary waves cause large-scale climate variations such as El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole, Atlantic Niño, and ENSO Modoki. Recent advances in numerical modeling augmented by in situ and satellite observations are helping the research community to understand ocean process and to predict associated climate variations on seasonal to longer timescales...|$|R
