500|$|In 1984, Time magazine's pop critic Jay Cocks {{wrote that}} [...] "Jackson {{is the biggest}} thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single {{phenomenon}} since Elvis Presley. He just {{may be the most}} popular black singer ever." [...] In 1990, Vanity Fair cited Jackson as the most popular artist in the history of show business.

On April 26, 2005, Don King Productions {{announced that the}} company had acquired the exclusive rights to promote Santos' fights. At the moment of the announcement Don King stated that: [...] "Daniel is another proud Puerto Rican world champion and I'm excited to have him with me, Junior middleweight is a solid division and there are many fights we can make for this great champion. Viva Puerto Rico!." [...] Santos said that this event held significance in his life because:"I want to fight all the best fighters and by being with the best promoter, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> get those fights and make good money. I look forward to a long and happy relationship with Don King." [...] When interviewed about Santos' signing, Félix Trinidad Sr. said that he was impressed by Santos' performance against Antonio Margarito and said that a fight between him and Félix Trinidad seemed plausible at the moment.

500|$|Brandon Soderberg of Pitchfork {{commented that}} Beyoncé mixes [...] "vulnerability and confidence" [...] while singing the chorus lines, where she {{repeatedly}} pleads her romantic interest, [...] "Make {{love to me}} when my days look low / Pull me in close and don't let me go / Make love to me when the world's at war / That our love will heal us all", while the music stays steady and soft {{with only a few}} piano chords and a baseline plucked guitar riff. As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't know much about guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, but I hope that I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't know much about fighting, but I, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> fight for you / Hey! Just when I ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E

500|$|Director Radha Mohan {{expressed}} a desire to remake the film but decided against it: [...] "If there is one film I want to remake, [...] will be the one, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not, because I believe classics should be left alone." [...] Director and choreographer Prabhu Deva ranked Server Sundaram among his favourite films. A restaurant named [...] "Hotel Server Sundaram" [...] is located in the Thuraipakkam area of Chennai. In December 2014, G. Babu Jayakumar of The New Indian Express included the film in his list of Balachander's noted films. Clips from Server Sundaram were screened along with clips from other films such as Iru Kodugal (1969), Arangetram (1973), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Avargal (1977) and Azhagan (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death. Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film and we felt that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too. It is amazing how well the title suited the concept of our film, which is why we went right ahead with our decision." [...] S. Jegathiswaran, writing for Daily News Sri Lanka, noted, [...] "In [...] Sundaram, [...] showed that after having gained the social status one shouldn't forget one's past." [...] Actor Vikram, who became popularly known by the moniker [...] "Chiyaan" [...] after the release of Sethu in 1999, stated in August 2016, [...] "After Nagesh sir [...] becomes something else, he still holds his server uniform close to his heart as a memento. Chiyaan is something like that to me." ...|$|E
