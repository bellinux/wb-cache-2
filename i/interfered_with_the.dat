Edney, the Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations, <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> investigation by sending suggestions to Milligan on avenues of inquiry and {{pushing for a}} finding that Hartwig or Truitt was responsible. Edney <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> investigation {{in order to prevent}} any findings that the Navy had knowingly operated an unsafe ship in an unsafe manner. Also, Edney feared that if the Iowa class battleships were found to be unsafe, the battleships would be decommissioned and the Navy would lose the associated admiral billets plus the other warships and support ships assigned to the battleship groups.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his term}} in Congress, Wickliffe was thrown from a {{carriage}} and permanently crippled. Despite his injury, he remained politically active.

40|$|The place {{conditioning}} paradigm {{has been}} used to assess the antinausea potential of drugs in non-emetic animal species. The present experiments were designed to determine the potential of A 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to alleviate both conditioned and unconditioned sickness in rats (Rattus norvegiens). The results in the present study suggest that when the place aversion is strong (Experiment 1), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> establishment; however when the aversion is weak (Experiments 2 and 3), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> expression. Also, when administered during acquisition of a strong amphetamine-induced place preference, THC also seems to <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the preference. Therefore it appears that when the place association is strong, THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> associative process itself, but when the place association is weak THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conditioned sickness or the retrieval of the association...|$|R

5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> distribution of boilers and engines. For these reasons, , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Wickliffe {{was again}} {{elected to the}} U.S. House, serving a single term.

In 1863, he again sought the office of governor, but federal military forces <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> election, resulting in a landslide victory for Thomas E. Bramlette. Later in life, Wickliffe was crippled in a carriage accident and also went completely blind. He died on October 31, 1869, while visiting his daughter in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Liquor {{was another}} {{profitable}} private industry nationalized {{by the central}} government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain {{at a lower price}} than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal battle}} that began {{the same year}} <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> band's working on another release. Volcano Entertainment—the {{successor}} of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the {{fighting}} was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E

5|$|On May 1, 1899, Captain Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich assumed {{command of}} Rostislav, {{becoming}} the first Romanov since Peter I to command a combat ship. Another Romanov, Grand Duke Kirill, spent a few uneventful months on board Rostislav in 1900. Alexander's guests, parties and diplomatic visits to Istanbul regularly <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crew's duties, but he personally managed the repairs and alterations of the ship's equipment. Shipyards and contractors treated Rostislav as a priority customer. Alexander, based on his experience with Sissoi Veliky, persuaded the NTC to reinforce Rostislavs rudder frame and supervised installation of a backup control post deep under the conning tower. In 1903 Alexander was promoted to rear admiral {{and returned to his}} ship as a squadron commander. Rostislav served as the junior flagship of the Black Sea Fleet until September 1912.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, the bald eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E
5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ability to measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E

The penalty also had a potential ban for up to three Formula One World Championship events for any driver found to have breached the new ruling. Ralf Schumacher agreed with the penalties. However, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis was more vocal in opposing the new rules as he believed they were arbitrary and were against choosing team tactics. He was also unhappy with the inclusion of Italian lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward because Dennis held the view that any decision would be biased towards Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E
