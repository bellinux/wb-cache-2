40|$|Personal Care Products are {{emerging}} pollutants whose {{distribution in the}} Antarctic and remote environments is still largely unknown. Among PCPs, long-lasting and stable Fragrance Materials were selected to perform a first pilot study on their occurrence in the coastal surface seawater of Terra Nova Bay in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Ambrofix, Amyl Salicylate, Benzyl Salicylate, <b>Hexyl</b> <b>Salicylate,</b> Lemonile and Okoumal were detected {{for the first time}} in Antarctic natural seawater, and reached total concentrations up to 100  ng L−  1. Treated discharges from the Italian research station Mario Zucchelli (MZS) contain FMs, however concentrations in nearby Tethys Bay increase during the seasonal melt of the sea ice and its snow cover: variability in emissions and distribution, as well as a contribution from atmospheric (long or short-range) transport were hypothesized...|$|E
40|$|Rigorous thesis Trčková Kateřina 2005 Theoretical part of {{this work}} {{is focused on the}} polymer {{delivery}} systems with controlled released of the drugs and targeting. In the experimental part was studied the Acyclovir (ACV) release from oligoester carriers branched with 5 % of mannitol (5 M) and plasticized with various concentration of methyl-, ethyl- or <b>hexyl</b> <b>salicylate.</b> The 150, 0 mg matrices composed of carrier, drug of 4 % and plasticizer were put to the static dissolution test using phosphate citrate buffer of pH 6, 0 at 37 řC. The ACV released was determined spectrophotometricaly at 256 nm. The ACV liberation was continuous with different burst effect caused by plasticizer type and concentration. The best release was observed from carriers plasticized using only 10 % of the plasticizer despite of the type of plasticizer. Ethyl salicylate in concentration of 10 % was found to be the most convenient plasticizer of the 5 M carrier...|$|E
40|$|Fragrance Materials (FMs) are omnipresent {{components}} of household and Personal Care Products (PCPs). In {{spite of their}} widespread use, {{little is known about}} their environmental occurrence. We selected 17 among the longest-lasting and most stable fragrance ingredients that are commercially available, namely: Amberketal, Ambrofix, Amyl Salicylate, Benzyl Salicylate, Bourgeonal, Dupical, <b>Hexyl</b> <b>Salicylate,</b> Isobutavan, Lemonile, Mefranal, Myraldene, Okoumal, Oranger Crystals, Pelargene, Peonile, Tridecene- 2 -Nitrile, Ultravanil. A new analytical method was developed to quantify FMs in water samples and it was applied to perform the first study about the distribution of these compounds in the surface waters of the city of Venice and its lagoon. Total FMs concentrations range from about 30 ng L− 1 to more than 10 μg L− 1 in polluted canals during the low tide. Sewage discharges were supposed to be the main sources of the selected FMs in the environment. Salicylates, oestrogenic and allergenic compounds, were in general the most abundant and widespread components. This study reports {{for the first time the}} detection of most of the selected FMs in surface waters and represent the first step to understand their environmental fate...|$|E
40|$|The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is a {{worldwide}} pest of maize (Zea mays L.) and other crops. The semiochemicals released by maize plants and structurally-related compounds {{can be used}} by adult female O. nubilalis for host-plant location and oviposition. Headspace volatile compounds emitted by watered and water-deprived maize plants are collected and identified by their retention indices and mass spectra. The most abundant compounds from watered plants are limonene, linalool, benzoic acid, indole, β-caryophyllene and acetophenone, whereas, in water-deprived plants, limonene, acetophenone, hexanoic acid, benzoic acid and indole are dominant. In addition, (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene, 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, anisole and 1 -carvone are undetected in the water-deprived plants. Some of the identified compounds show electrophysiological activity (electroantennogram) in the antennae of both sexes, with the responses elicited by tridecane, tetradecane, dodecane, nonanal, decanal and 2 -ethylhexanol on males being particularly noteworthy. In a dual-choice olfactometer, adult females show a preference for 2 -hexanol, heptanal, methyl <b>salicylate,</b> <b>hexyl</b> acetate, nonanal, methyl dodecanoate, β-pinene and (E) - 2 -hexenyl acetate over hexane controls. Tetradecane, linalool, methyl hexanoate, methyl nonanoate, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl benzoate, tridecane, 2 -cyclopentylcyclopentanone, 3 -methylbutyl acetate, β-myrcene and (Z) - 3 -hexenyl butanoate result in fewer females in the test arm compared with the control arm. No single compound displays an activity similar to watered maize plants, supporting the hypothesis that blends of volatiles in specific ratios are more effective than single volatile chemicals. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that methyl salicylate, which elicits also one of the highest electrophysiological responses in female antennae, plays a role in host preference by O. nubilalis females.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an easy, reliable, versatile and inexpensive laboratory experiment {{to teach the}} metabolic transformation of hydrolysis to Pharmacy students. The experiment {{does not require the}} sacrifice of any experimental animal, or any work with organs or tissues, and so can be implemented in a typical university chemistry laboratory. We used acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), <b>hexyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> (HS) and two enzymes, a lipase and an esterase. Since both ASS and HS liberate salicylic acid (SA) upon hydrolysis, students can evaluate the different enzymatic transformations by monitoring the amount of SA liberated. The learning outcomes are an enhanced student understanding of: (1) the process of hydrolysis; (2) the application of enzymatic transformations of molecules from food to xenobiotics; (3) the differences between the general specificity of substrate of both enzymes; (4) the concepts of the lipophilic pocket; (5) the catalytic triad and its regioselectivity in relation to the ester bond. A questionnaire was administered to participating students at three points in time: {{at the beginning of the}} module, after enzymatic hydrolysis was taught in class, and after the laboratory experiment. From an analysis of the questionnaire data we conclude that this practical helped Pharmacy students to understand these concepts...|$|E
