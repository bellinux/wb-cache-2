METHODS: EMG activity of external oblique during a lifting and <b>holding</b> <b>task</b> was obtained. Multifidus cross-sectional area and transversus abdominis width were measured using real time ultrasound in six males and five females, with no back pain(mean age of 26. 3 (± 5. 4) years). The participants then performed a six-week muscle-conditioning program for multifidus and transversus abdominis, after which the EMG activity of extern al oblique and dimensions of multifi dus and transversus abdominis were re-measured. RESULTS: Both multifidus and transversus abdomin is significantly increased in size. There was significantly less activity in external oblique during a lifting task after the conditioning program, with no change in external oblique activity during a <b>holding</b> <b>task.</b> CONCLUSIONS: this study may indicate {{a link between the}} dimensional increase of multifidus and transversus abdominis, and the decrease in EMG activity in external oblique during lifting.

40|$|Oscillatory {{synchronization}} in {{the beta}} (approximately 20 Hz) band {{is a common}} feature of human motor control, manifest at cortical and muscular levels during tonic contraction. Here we test {{the hypothesis that the}} influence of visual feedback on performance in a positional <b>hold</b> <b>task</b> is increased during bursts of beta-band synchrony in the corticospinal motor system. Healthy subjects were instructed to extend their forefinger while receiving high-gain visual feedback of finger position on a PC screen. Small step displacements of the feedback signal were triggered either by bursts of beta oscillations in scalp electroencephalogram or randomly with respect to cortical beta activity, and the resulting positional corrections expressed {{as a percentage of the}} step displacement. Corrective responses to beta and randomly triggered step changes in visual feedback were 41. 7 +/- 4. 9 and 31. 5 +/- 6. 8 %, respectively (P< 0. 05). A marked increase in the coherence in the beta band was also found between muscle activity and cortical activity during the beta-triggered condition. The results suggest that phasic elevations of beta activity in the corticospinal motor system are associated with an increase in the gain of the motor response to visual feedback during a tonic <b>hold</b> <b>task.</b> Beta activity may index a motor state in which processing relevant to the control of positional <b>hold</b> <b>tasks</b> is promoted, with behavioural consequences...|$|R

The rather moderate levels of unpleasantness induced by breath holding in our sample may suggest that other processes (physiological, motivational) besides distress tolerance influence BHT. Overall, the current findings do not support the assumption of active inhibitory control in the BHT-task in a healthy sample. Our findings suggest that individual differences (e. g., in interoceptive or anxiety sensitivity) should be taken into account when examining the validity of BHT as a measure of distress tolerance. status: publishe...|$|E

Denervation and subsequent reinnervation lead to significant alterations in peripheral connectivity and reflex organisation. We have tested the hypothesis that 8 – 10 Hz tremor is present in the digits of subjects following a complete nerve lesion. The frequency content of abduction and adduction movements was recorded in 12 index fingers and nine little fingers reinnervated subsequent to a complete ulnar nerve transection. An optical position laser transducer was used to measure digital movements, minimising mechanical interference to the system. Concurrently, surface electromyograms (EMG) were also recorded from first dorsal interosseus muscles (1 DI) and abductor digiti minimi brevis (ADMB) muscles for index and little fingers, respectively.

In the present study we examined the potential of a so-called passive exoskeleton on muscle activity, discomfort and endurance time in prolonged forward-bended working postures. Eighteen subjects performed two tasks: a simulated assembly task with the trunk in a forward-bended position and static holding of the same trunk position without further activity. We measured the electromyography for muscles in the back, abdomen and legs. We also measured the perceived local discomfort. In the static <b>holding</b> <b>task</b> we determined the endurance, defined as the time that people could continue without passing a specified discomfort threshold. In the assembly task we found lower muscle activity (by 35 - 38 %) and lower discomfort in the low back when wearing the exoskeleton. Additionally, the hip extensor activity was reduced. The exoskeleton led to more discomfort in the chest region. In the task of static holding, we observed that exoskeleton use led to an increase in endurance time from 3. 2 to 9. 7 min, on average. The results illustrate the good potential of this passive exoskeleton to reduce the internal muscle forces and (reactive) spinal forces in the lumbar region.

Furthermore, the mixing costs for task 1 do not follow the same pattern for dual-task task costs, indicating that the PRP effect reflects differences in online processing rather than task preparation. Overlap among the stimuli and among the responses does not appear to systematically increase the PRP effect. Instead, the type of task pairings (standard/non-standard) appears to play a major role. In the psychological refractory period (PRP) procedure, stimuli for two tasks are separated by a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA).
