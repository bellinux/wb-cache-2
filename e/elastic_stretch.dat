40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The forest {{products}} industry often uses intermediate-support cable logging systems to transport logs from the harvest site to a staging area. A method {{is presented to}} assist in the analysis and design of these cable systems. The method determines tensions in individual cables, forces on and stresses in the support trees, and the geometry of the system under load. Static equilibrium and cable length compatibility are used to generate a system of simultaneous equations. This system of coupled, non-linear algebraic equations is solved numerically using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. A good, automated initial guess for the unknown quantities, based on the physics of the problem, is provided. A model of an example intermediate support cable logging system is analyzed by the proposed approach and the resulting behavior discussed. The method includes the effects of catenary sag and <b>elastic</b> <b>stretch</b> in the cables, and elastic behavior in the support trees. Friction is ignored in the formulation. The catenary and <b>elastic</b> <b>stretch</b> methodologies for the cables are each demonstrated on a single cable span as well as on a demonstration cable system. The effect of the support tree flexibility and cable mass are found to be significant on the response of the cable logging system.

The powders were compressed using Korsch XP 1, and the correlations between compaction and physical parameters were analyzed by canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Factor analysis (FA) was employed to normalize compaction work, yield pressure measurements (YP) and determine <b>elastic</b> <b>stretch</b> for all our sample; these were scored and ranked accordingly. The canonical variables showed that true density (ρa), compression degree (Cp) and mean particle size (D 50) were associated with plastic coefficient (PL), YP, and fast <b>elastic</b> <b>stretch</b> (FES). When factor scores were used in combination with original data, the plasticity of our samples was sorted and ranked as high, intermediate, or low, which are in accord with plasticity rankings previously reported in literature [10]. Hence, physical and compaction data interval was established that evaluated powder deformation behavior during compaction. Finally, FA was used to further characterize deformation behavior during compaction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} and adhesion properties of myelin basic protein (MBP) {{are important for}} its function, namely the compaction of the myelin sheath. To get more information about these properties we used atomic force microscopy to study tip-sample interaction of mica and mixed dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) (20 %) /egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) (80 %) lipid bilayer surfaces in the absence and presence of bovine MBP. On mica or DOPS/EPC bilayers a short-range repulsive force (decay length 1. 0 – 1. 3 nm) was observed during the approach. The presence of MBP always led to an attractive force between tip and sample. When retracting the tip again, force curves on mica and on lipid layers were different. While attached to the mica surface, the MBP molecules exhibited <b>elastic</b> <b>stretching</b> behavior that agreed with the worm-like chain model, yielding a persistence length of 0. 5 ± 0. 25 nm and an average contour length of 53 ± 19 nm. MBP attached to a lipid bilayer did not show <b>elastic</b> <b>stretching</b> behavior. This shows that the protein adopts a different conformation when in contact with lipids. The lipid bilayer is strongly modified by MBP attachment, indicating formation of MBP-lipid complexes and possibly disruption of the original bilayer structure...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the formulation of}} a crystal elasto-viscoplastic model and the corresponding integration scheme. The model is suitable to represent the isothermal, anisotropic, large deformation of polycrystalline metals. The formulation {{is an extension of}} a rigid viscoplastic model to account for elasticity effects, and incorporates a number of changes with respect to a previous formulation [Marin & Dawson, 1998]. This extension is formally derived using the well-known multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and plastic components, where the elastic part is additionally decomposed into the <b>elastic</b> <b>stretch</b> V{sup e} and the proper orthogonal R{sup e} tensors. The constitutive equations are written in the intermediate, stress-free configuration obtained by unloading the deformed crystal through the <b>elastic</b> <b>stretch</b> V{sup e-}. The model is framed in a thermodynamic setting, and developed initially for large elastic strains. The crystal equations are then specialized to the case of small elastic strains, an assumption typically valid for metals. The developed integration scheme is implicit and proceeds by separating the spherical and deviatoric crystal responses. An ''approximate'' algorithmic material moduli is also derived for applications in implicit numerical codes. The model equations and their integration procedure have been implemented in both a material point simulator and a commercial finite element code. Both implementations are validated by solving a number of examples involving aggregates of either face centered cubic (FCC) or hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystals subjected to different loading paths...|$|E
40|$|Microstructural {{considerations}} {{have led}} to a constitutive format for the modeling of inelastic solids which does not make use of a fixed material reference in the usual sense. A principal motivation for this ‘Eulerian-type ’ theoretical structure stems from a belief that large deformation inelastic flow phenomena (such as that encountered in certain metal forming processes) will one day prove amenable to numerical techniques of the sort common to the field of fluid mechanics. Unfortunately, virtually all established theoretical results of a general nature have been developed in a Lagrangian or referential context, and are not readily adapted to this new format. Here, this difficulty is partially overcome through the introduction of an instantaneous local reference corresponding to a material element’s so called ‘shadow ’ (elastically unstretched) configuration. A related state variable transformation and the definition of a shadow frame time derivative (analogous to the corotational time derivative) are then shown to facilitate a far more tractable theoretical reformulation. Throughout, three equivalent variants of this general theory are presented, one expressed in terms of a gradient type ‘cell placement tensor’, a second involving symmetric <b>elastic</b> <b>stretch</b> and orthogonal cell orientation tensors, and a third in which the aforementioned <b>elastic</b> <b>stretch</b> is replaced by the elastic (natural) log-strain tensor. In each case, the theoretical simplifications appropriate for various types of materials are enumerated.

Condensin depletion decreases the stiffness of centromeric chromatin by 50 % when pulling forces are applied to kinetochores. However, condensin is dispensable for the normal level of compaction (rest length) of centromeres, which probably depends on other factors that control higher-order chromatin folding. Kinetochores also do not require condensin for their structure or motility.

With regards to velocity of contraction, Taylor [15] has observed that it is less costly for muscles to generate force at low velocities, that force is highest and metabolic rate lowest during isometric contraction, and that the energy cost of generating force increases dramatically with great shorting velocity. The proposed mechanism {{for this is that}} muscle contractions are primarily isometric, adjusting the stiffness of the muscle-tendon unit during the eccentric phase to produce simultaneous deceleration and <b>elastic</b> <b>stretch,</b> then producing a nearly isometric impulse that initiates ballistic concentric acceleration.

In order to obtain mathematical restrictions analogous to those found in elastic materials, stability conditions are derived based on the propagation of homogeneous plane waves with real wave speeds, and the generalized acoustic tensor is obtained. Focusing on 2 D motions, and considering a simplified, decoupled transversely isotropic energy function, the restriction on the active acoustic tensor is recast in terms of a generally applicable constitutive law, with specific attention paid to the fiber contribution.
