40|$|The {{handling}} and yaw stability characteristics of passenger vehicles are drastically changed when towing a trailer, {{which can lead}} to unsafe oscillations in the trailer yaw, known as trailer sway. This thesis examines the feasibility of using lateral articulation of the <b>hitch</b> <b>ball</b> to reduce sway behavior in passenger-sized tractor-trailer configurations. An articulating <b>hitch</b> <b>ball</b> design has the advantage of not being dependent on the trailer being towed, providing stability improvements to the wide variety of trailers that a passenger vehicle may tow over its life cycle. Changes in the lateral position of the hitch relative to the tractor create dynamic changes to the heading angle of the trailer relative to the tractor, which act as compensating steering inputs into the system. To examine the effectiveness of this method, a linear handling model was developed to predict the system response with different trailer configurations and feedback methods. This model was simulated with various feedback controllers, and the modeling was validated using a model constructed in MapleSim, a high-fidelity multibody simulation tool. After establishing the required performance characteristics of the active hitch, a prototype was designed, manufactured, and tested in a full scale tractor-trailer combination. The modeling techniques showed good agreement with the physical testing, where the control design of proportional feedback on the trailer articulation angle provided improved yaw stability across many trailer configurations. The simple controller design is adaptable to driving conditions and requires minimal measurements of vehicle states. The performance of the active hitch prototype is best shown in a response to a steering impulse at 65 km/h, where a highly unstable trailer causes steady state oscillation without control, and settles in under 4 seconds with control active...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} forms of tow <b>hitch,</b> {{including}} a <b>ball</b> <b>hitch,</b> tow bar, pintle and lunette ring, three-point, fifth wheel, coupling, and drawbar, among others.|$|R
50|$|Some Toters are hybrids, {{with both}} a fifth wheel and a <b>ball</b> <b>hitch.</b> The <b>ball</b> and <b>hitch</b> is a more fitting design for the height demands of the housing {{industry}} considering that the homes must still be transported down public roads with overhead cables and overpasses.|$|R

50|$|In North America, {{the ball}} {{attaches}} to a ballmount. Receiver-type <b>hitches</b> use removable <b>ball</b> mounts, whereas the fixed drawbar type <b>hitches</b> have integrated <b>ball</b> mounts. The ball mount must match the SAE hitch class. The ballmount for a receiver-type hitch is a square bar that fits into a receiver {{attached to the}} vehicle. Removable ball mounts are offered with varying rise or drop to accommodate variations in {{the height of the}} vehicle and trailer to provide for level towing.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} tow a trailer behind a motorcycle, {{one of the}} {{following}} coupling combinations or mechanisms is needed: a ball and socket, swivel adapter, or pivot <b>ball</b> <b>hitch</b> and coupler.|$|R
50|$|Most {{trailers}} are towed {{by joining}} {{a ball and}} a coupler (socket). The coupler {{is attached to the}} trailer, and the <b>ball</b> <b>hitch</b> is attached to the tow vehicle. The coupler slides over the <b>ball</b> <b>hitch.</b> Then, pressure is applied to a clamp, usually with a toggle or lever, which secures theball in the coupler. To ensure that the appropriate amount of pressure is applied, the coupler is equipped with a locknut that allows the operator to adjust the tension. When properly attached, the coupler will have limited movement, swiveling mainly right and left as well as tilting slightly.|$|R
50|$|The pivot <b>ball</b> <b>hitch</b> is an anti-binding {{motorcycle}} {{trailer hitch}} assembly {{composed of a}} base and a trailer ball. The base is secured to a standard ball mount on the motorcycle. The trailer {{is attached to a}} socket coupler. A space between the ball shank and the assembly mount allow the ball to move left and right in a vertical plane. Thus, the ball remains in a generally upright position when the motorcycle leans left or right into a turn because the base of the pivot <b>ball</b> <b>hitch</b> is able to move in the opposite direction of the motorcycle without causing the coupler to bind.|$|R
40|$|NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has {{developed}} a joint that employs a unique spring-loaded mechanism that automatically secures a <b>ball</b> <b>hitch</b> upon insertion into a coupler. This {{eliminates the need for}} the locking lever found in most conventional ball joints. Connections made using MSFC's quick-connect joint are easier, safer, and more reliable than those made using conventional ball joints...|$|R
5000|$|As {{explained}} {{above in}} [...] "Ball and socket", {{the movement in}} the coupler and ball combination is limited to mostly horizontal movement and tilting slightly. Therefore, this type of coupling is best suited for three-wheeled motorcycles and four-wheeled vehicles. In contrast, as pivot <b>ball</b> <b>hitches</b> and swivel adapters do allow the appreciable lean necessary to keep all the trailer wheels on the ground while turning, these devices are the better option for towing trailers behind a two-wheeled motorcycle.|$|R
2500|$|Bankhead's {{most popular}} and perhaps best remembered {{television}} appearance was the December 3, 1957 The Ford Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show. Bankhead played herself in the classic episode titled [...] "The Celebrity Next Door". The part was originally slated for Bette Davis, but Davis had to bow out after cracking a vertebra. Lucille Ball was reportedly a fan of Bankhead and did a good impression of her. By the time the episode was filmed, however, both Ball and Desi Arnaz were deeply frustrated by Bankhead's behavior during rehearsals. It took her three hours to [...] "wake up" [...] once she arrived on the set and she often seemed drunk. She also refused {{to listen to the}} director and she did not like rehearsing. Ball and Arnaz apparently did not know about Bankhead's antipathy to rehearsals or her ability to memorize a script quickly. After rehearsals, the filming of the episode proceeded without a <b>hitch</b> and <b>Ball</b> congratulated Bankhead on her performance.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a ball connection structure with <b>ball</b> <b>hitch</b> to Huddig AB Backhoe, 1260. As will be used to pull heavy trailers at work. The reason for the project is that people often tend to make their own solutions to this problem, which is often made using modifications of the rear frame, where laws and regulations are unclear on what is legal and what is not. In this report. The laws and regulations will be examined, to see what actually comes to the construction of towing devices for backhoe loaders. These laws will then be the basis for the construction. A prototype construction will be made in SolidWorks and then calculate the strength through finite element analysis to ensure that the construction has good strength. As well as a choice of <b>ball</b> <b>hitch</b> from other manufacturers will be investigated. The construction is made to withstand 15 ton traction and 3 tons vertical load on the towing ball. The structure must use existing anchor points on the machine where normally the train set is mounted on the "rail" models, and where a tow hook is mounted on the standard models. This report addresses only the construction and not the prototype manufacturing process. The idea is that it will later be included a hydraulic design to open and close the ball connector...|$|R
