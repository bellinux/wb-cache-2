50|$|Drawbacks of {{line-of-sight}} systems include obstructions, {{lighting and}} atmospheric conditions, and undesired activations. Obstructions may be buildings on a curving road that block visual {{contact with a}} traffic signal until very close, or perhaps a large <b>freight</b> <b>truck</b> {{in front of a}} police car blocking the traffic signal from receiving the emitter's signal from the police car. Modifying the position of the receiver or even locating it separate from the traffic signal equipment can sometimes correct this problem. Direct sunlight into a receiver may prevent it from detecting an emitter, and severe atmospheric conditions, such as heavy rain or snow, may reduce the distance at which a line-of-sight system will function. Undesired activations may occur if an emitter's signal is picked up by many traffic lights along a stretch of road, all directed to change to red in that direction, prior to the activating vehicle turning off the road, or being parked without its emitter being deactivated.|$|E

On impact, the man was flung from his truck and suffered a serious injury. Some 7,000 gallons of gasoline from his ruptured tanker ignited and surrounded the driver within walls of fire. No one but Kenneth Bishop dared attempt to save the victim and as he approached the inferno, the rescuer was thrown several feet by an explosion. His clothes caught fire but he refused to turn away. Already severely burnt, Mr. Bishop protected his face from the blistering heat and snaked his way to the victim. Taking a firm grip of the man, under the arms, he dragged him safely away from the conflagration. Although aware that his deed might cost him his own life, Kenneth Bishop exhibited the finest example of selfless courage and humanitarian concern to save a complete stranger.|$|E
