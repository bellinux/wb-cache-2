40|$|This report {{discusses}} property measurements {{that were}} made on level first-year sea ice near Nain, from early February to mid May 2004. Ice thickness ranged from 0. 41 to 0. 65 m in February, and 0. 89 to 1. 20 m in mid-May. The highest borehole strengths were measured in March, when the ice was coldest. Results showed that, in general, ice strength decreased more rapidly towards {{the top and bottom}} surfaces than in the ice interior. The strength reduction was due to ice decay, clear evidence of which was provided by the deteriorated state of the extracted cores, and changes in the temperature and salinity of the ice. Measurements are also given for <b>hummocked</b> <b>ice</b> sites that were sampled in a quasi-stable area of landfast ice, in April. The ice surface relief increased, as did the ice and snow thickness, as the hummock field was penetrated. Ice thickness at the first site ranged from 0. 99 to 1. 17 m, whereas ice at the fourth site ranged from 1. 14 to 2. 20 m thick. The <b>hummocked</b> <b>ice</b> was isothermal at near melting temperatures throughout its full thickness. The ice salinity was minimal in the top ice, ranged from 4 to 5 in the ice interior, and was upwards of 8 towards the bottom ice. The highest borehole strength was measured in the interior of the ice. On average, the hummocked was thicker and stronger than the level landfast ice (for the same time of year).

Visible and IR remote sensing systems cannot provide such data and present field methods are inadequate for characterizing ice conditions over long river reaches. Our ongoing analysis of JPL's AIRSAR imagery data and concurrent ground truth of ice conditions on the Tanana River and surrounding lakes near Fairbanks, Alaska, in March 1988, has resulted in several findings: <b>hummocked</b> <b>ice</b> covers and zones of variable ice surface roughness within them can be differentiated; C- and L-band data are more sensitive than P-band to the range of surface roughnesses encountered; smooth, level ice that is clear or contains small bubbles produces little backscatter; snow-covered river ice, whether rough or smooth, is distinguishable from snow-covered river sediments on exposed river beds and unvegetated bars; and open water leads are readily distinguished...|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Mapping of snow cover using ERTS- 1 data {{proved to be}} six times faster than that done from U- 2 photography. However, NOAA- 2 VHRR snow cover mapping was almost as fast as ERTS- 1, and it is available more frequently. Ice conditions in the Great Lakes can be readily determined by ERTS- 1. Ice features characteristic of thawing conditions such as rotten ice, lack of pressure ridges, brash belts, and compacted ice edges can be identified. A great decrease in apparent reflectivity in band 7 as compared to band 4 also indicated melting conditions. Using sidelap from two successive ERTS- 1 images of Lake Erie (February 17 and 18, 1973) a measure of ice movement was made, agreeing closely with the estimate from conventional methods. The same imagery permitted tentative identification of the following features: shuga, light and dark nilas, fast ice, icefoot, ice breccia, brash ice, fracturing, ridging, rafting, sastrugi, thaw holes, rotten ice, ice islands, dried ice puddles, <b>hummocked</b> <b>ice,</b> and leads...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{four-year}} research project, which spans from March 2011 to March 2015, is to document the thickness and strength of <b>hummocked</b> multi-year <b>ice.</b> The {{first two years of}} the project are reported upon here. Year 1 involved designing and manufacturing customized equipment to measure the temperature, salinity and strength of 12 m thick multi-year ice and using the equipment to sample a multiyear <b>ice</b> <b>hummock</b> from crest to keel. The first season of measurements was conducted in the spring 2012, on landfast multi-year ice 120 km northwest of Resolute, Nunavut. Year 2 of the program was taken to plan, prepare and conduct a field program on drifting multi-year ice in the Beaufort Sea in the spring of 2013. Background is given about the three main options for accessing multi-year ice (shipbased access, community-based access and remote camps) in order to more fully appreciate the challenges and data collected during the 2012 and 2013 field seasons. Outcomes from the 2012 field program, conducted from 3 May to 20 May from Resolute, Nunavut, include: (1) field testing equipment by collecting data on the thickness, temperature and borehole strength of 1. 75 m thick first-year ice, (2) measuring the thicknesses at 19 holes on a <b>hummocked</b> multi-year <b>ice</b> floe that had an average thickness of 8. 6 1 1. 0 m, (3) measuring the temperature, salinity and strength through its full thickness of 10. 8 m thick ice on the shoulder of a multi-year <b>ice</b> <b>hummock,</b> (4) measuring the partial temperature and salinity profile of a hummock crest and conducting borehole strength tests through the full thickness of the 12. 4 m thick ice. The 2013 field program, conducted from 18 March to 7 April from Sachs Harbour, NWT, was prematurely terminated due to health and safety concerns. As a result, the program 2 ̆ 019 s primary objective 2 ̆ 013 measuring the strength of <b>hummocked</b> multi-year <b>ice</b> 2 ̆ 013 could not be met. Nevertheless, outcomes from the 2013 field program include (1) equipment being field-tested on 1. 65 m thick cold, first-year ice to collect data on its temperature, salinity and borehole strength, (2) satellite tracking beacons were deployed on four, <b>hummocked</b> multi-year <b>ice</b> floes, (3) the two floes on which at least ten thickness measurements were made had an average thickness of 2. 7 1 2. 2 m (first-year ice) and 5. 6 1 2. 5 m (multiyear ice) and (4) photographic documentation of numerous substantial, deformed multi-year ice floes 150 km west of Sachs Harbour. The drift trajectories of the two, <b>hummocked</b> multi-year <b>ice</b> floes on which drift trajectories are available for a period of five months clearly illustrate that some of the more significant floes encountered during the 2013 field study pose a very real hazard for structures in the southern Beaufort Sea, including the relatively near-shore Amauligak site.

Part of the instrumentation was designed to measure the ice loads. This paper presents an overview discussion of the characteristics and instrumentation of the Molikpaq. It presents detailed information on 188 ice loading events from both first-year and multi-year ice for different ice macrostructures including level <b>ice,</b> ridges, <b>hummock</b> <b>ice</b> and isolated floes. Investigation of the ice loads has shown that the Line Load (global load per unit length of the structure) increases with increasing ice thickness.

60|$|The air was clear, {{with little}} or no wind, which was one comfort. As they went on they had to pass around great ridges of snow and over <b>hummocks</b> of <b>ice,</b> where the water had frozen while {{tumbling}} down the mountain side.

50|$|Year-round {{transportation}} of mail, passengers, and light freight {{has always been}} a problem in remote areas of Siberia and Eastern Europe. Many communities are surrounded by deep snow, <b>hummock</b> <b>ice,</b> marshes that remain unfrozen, and natural waterways choked by weeds. The constantly changing conditions faced by these communities required the development of a vehicle capable of traveling over a widely varied surface at high speeds in order to deliver mail and supplies, as well to transport passengers, and provide emergency medical relief and evacuation to hospitals. To satisfy these requirements, the Tupolev Design Bureau developed an amphibious aerosledge with the appearance of a powered speedboat, powered by a single radial engine mounted behind the cabin in a pusher configuration. Development of the A-3 began in 1961, with the first production A-3 being delivered in 1964. Production of the A-3 continued until the early 1980s. Though early production A-3's were manufactured near Moscow, the majority of A-3 production took place in Ukraine, at the Tyachivski Transcarpathian helicopter plant. By the time production ceased in 1983 over 800 A-3 Aerosledges had been produced. Also Nikolay Kamov developed such like the Aerosled K30.|$|R
60|$|A brisk walk of {{half an hour}} {{over the}} <b>ice</b> and <b>hummocks</b> of the sea carried them {{out of sight of}} their companions, but did not bring them up with the animal of which they were in chase.

50|$|An <b>ice</b> <b>hummock</b> is a boss or rounded knoll of ice {{rising above}} the general level of an ice-field. Hummocky ice is caused by slow and unequal {{pressure}} in {{the main body of}} the packed ice, and by unequal structure and temperature at a later period.|$|R

But fast though he baled, the water rilled in faster, and just as they floated under a long, snow-laden branch of an Ollaconda-tree, the Bobberie began to sink.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Ice types, albedos and {{impurity}} content {{are characterized}} for the ablation {{zone of the}} Greenland ice sheet in Kronprinz Christians Land (808 N, 248 W). Along this ice margin {{the width of the}} ablation zone is only about 8 km. The emergence and melting of old ice in the ablation zone creates a surface layer of dust that was originally deposited with snowfall high on the ice sheet. This debris cover is augmented by locally derived wind-blown sediment. Subsequently, the surface dust particles often aggregate together to form centimetre-scale clumps that melt into the ice, creating cryoconite holes. The debris in the cryoconite holes becomes hidden from sunlight, raising the area-averaged albedo relative to surfaces with uniform debris cover. Spectral and broadband albedos were obtained for snow, <b>ice</b> <b>hummocks,</b> debris-covered <b>ice,</b> cryoconite-studded ice and barren tundra surfaces. Broadband ice albedos varied from 0. 2 (for ice with heavy loading of uniform debris) to 0. 6 (for <b>ice</b> <b>hummocks</b> with cryoconite holes). The cryoconite material itself has albedo 0. 1 when wet. Areal distribution of the major surface types was estimated visually from a transect video as a function of distance from the ice edge (330 ma. s. l.). Ablation rates were measured along a transect from the ice margin to the slush zone 8 km from the margin (550 ma. s. l.), traversing both Pleistocene and Holocene ice. Ablation rates in early August averaged 2 cmd– 1. Impurity concentrations were typically 4. 3 mg L– 1 in the subsurface ice...|$|R
40|$|During {{deglaciation}} {{from the}} Last Glacial Maximum three terrestrial ice streams within the south western {{sector of the}} Laurentide Ice Sheet competed and coalesced in southern Alberta; the High Plains Ice Stream (HPIS), Central Alberta Ice Stream (CAIS) and the east lobe. The ice streams are characterised by smoothed corridors along which lie lineations that identify multiple flow events, transverse ridges of thrust and push origin, esker networks and large sequences of parallel and transverse meltwater channels. The CAIS and HPIS were dynamic and transitory in nature creating a ‘time-transgressive’ imprint. The CAIS terminated within southern Alberta creating a wealth of landforms composed of controlled, hummocky, push and thrust block moraines, along with doughnut <b>hummocks,</b> <b>ice</b> walled lake plains, recessional meltwater, tunnel and large spillway channels. The CAIS margin is interpreted to have been polythermal in nature, creating a continuum of landforms that is dominated by active marginal recession. The methodologies used were placed within an overarching ‘scale approach’, whereby the research initially focused on a small, regional scale and gradually moved to large scale, local investigations. Firstly, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat ETM+) data sets were used to map the regional picture. Then, Aerial Photo Investigation (API), ground truthing and sedimentary analyses were employed to provide a detailed, localised focus into the landform sediment assemblages in southern Alberta. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} year of the 6 -year Japanese Antarctic Research Project Phase Ⅷ, JARE- 53 planned several large {{operations}} such as the reinforcement of the atmospheric radar; PANSY; and the constructions of a 20 -kW wind generator, sewage disposal facilities, and the roof of the Natural Energy Control Building. Sea ice condition in Lutzow Holm Bay were very severe this season, i. e., there was <b>hummock</b> <b>ice</b> in the pack ice area and very thick fast ice with heavy snow above. Icebreaker Shirase struggled with this severe sea ice and finally gave up to proceed at a distance of about 20 km from Syowa Station. We managed to transport the necessities for overwintering observation using a CH- 101 helicopter onboard Shirase, snow motors, and sledge caravans on the sea ice. However, we were only able to transport only a minimal amount of supplies, and therefore had to give up major construction work. On the other hand, field observation teams conducted 80 %- 90 % of their research plan, owing to the high performance of the chartered small helicopter. On the return voyage, the Shirase struggled with the sea ice again, and some of the research operations were canceled because of limited ship time. On the other hand, the geomorphological and geodetic survey team at Sor-Rondane Mountains and oceanographic observation team onboard the training and research ship Umitaka-maru were able toconduct their research works as planned...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} auxiliary sea ice observation is {{the location of}} the ice edge. Its value reflects both the importance of the ice edge location in general and the difficulty of accurately locating the ice edge with remotely sensed data. It is also useful to provide a description of the ice edge in terms of indications of freezing or thawing, wind-driven advance or retreat, and compactness or diffuseness. Other important auxiliary information includes {{the location of the}} icebergs, floebergs, ice islands, old <b>ice,</b> ridging and <b>hummocking.</b> These <b>ice</b> features are poorly monitored by remote sensing techniques but are very important aspects of the ice cover.|$|R
60|$|It was a bright, still, frosty night, {{and the air}} felt {{intensely}} sharp, as if needles were pricking the skin, {{while the}} men's breath issued from their lips in white clouds, and settled in hoar-frost {{on the edges of}} their hoods.

6000|$|Thus they puzzled {{their way}} through, [...] "like {{a blind man}} {{in the streets of}} a strange city;" [...] but more {{difficulties}} awaited them beyond. After advancing many miles they were arrested by broad rents in the ice, and were obliged to diverge frequently far out of their course, or to bridge the chasms over by cutting down the <b>ice</b> <b>hummocks</b> and filling them up with loose ice, until the dogs were able to haul the provision-sledge over.|$|R
50|$|String bogs or aapa fens (Aapamoore or Strangmoore) are {{typically}} {{found on the}} northern fringes of the distribution area for raised bogs, in the sub-polar zone, north of the 66th latitude in the northern hemisphere. Here, raised bogs only occur as islands within wetlands supplied by mineral soil water. On level ground these islands are irregularly distributed; on hillsides they form ridges parallel to the contours and {{at right angles to}} line of slope. The ridges separate boggy hollows of mineral soil known by the Finnish word, rimpis. The main distribution area for string bogs are the Scandinavian hills, central Finland, Karelia and north Sibiria. In North America, Alaska is the main location for string bogs, thanks to its cold continental climate. Frost action {{plays an important role in}} these bogs.

5000|$|By 18 June, {{the entire}} party reached open {{water at the}} edge of the floe near Cape Alexander. The journey had netted them only 81 miles in 31 days, but the {{numerous}} cutbacks and detours, necessitated by the <b>ice</b> <b>hummocks,</b> resulted in an actual trek of over 300 miles. From that point, they took to the boats. During the next phase of the journey, they alternated between runs across open water under sail and marches across frozen <b>ice</b> <b>hummocks</b> when necessary. By 21 July 1855, the men reached Cape York, the point at which they would begin the transit to Upernavik. There, they erected a rock monument in which they left information regarding their planned movements, a list of provisions on hand, and a brief summary of the expedition's findings. That project completed, Kane and his crew started out across Melville Bay. On 6 August, Kane led his exhausted party into Upernavik. They took passage from Upernavik in the Danish brig Marianne to Disko Island where they were met by the relief expedition made up of [...] and [...] under the command of Lt. Hartstene. The two relief ships brought the survivors into New York on 11 October 1855. Presumably, the pack ice eventually crushed and sank the abandoned Advance.|$|R
60|$|Before {{this brief}} {{conversation}} {{came to a}} close, Fred Ellice and Tom Singleton sprang up the companion, {{and stood on the}} deck gazing ahead with feelings of the deepest interest. Both youths were well read in the history of polar seas and regions; they were well acquainted, by name at least, with floes, and bergs, and <b>hummocks</b> of <b>ice,</b> but neither of them had seen such in reality. These objects were associated in their young minds with all that was romantic and wild, hyperborean and polar, brilliant and sparkling, and light and white--emphatically white. To behold ice actually floating on the salt sea was an incident of note in their existence; and certainly the impressions of their first day in the ice remained sharp, vivid and prominent, long after scenes of a much more striking nature had faded from the tablets of their memories.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{scrambled}} {{down to the}} ledge without much difficulty, reaching it, but just in time, for now the razor blade of the ice had cut half through the rope, and very soon the swinging of the senseless weight beneath must complete its work. This ledge, being broad, though sloping, was not a particularly bad place; moreover, on it were little <b>hummocks</b> of <b>ice,</b> resulting from snow that had melted and frozen again, against one of which Godfrey was able to rest his left shoulder, and even to pass his arm round it. But here came the rub. He could not get sufficient grip of the thin rope {{with his right hand}} beyond the point where it was cut, to enable him to support even half the weight that hung below. Should it sever, as it must do very shortly, it would be torn from his grasp.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} the most {{comprehensive}} set of property measurements on multi-year ice to date, {{in the interest of}} addressing {{one of the most significant}} unknowns for Arctic engineering: multi-year ice strength. Borehole strength results are presented from 56 old ice floes in the gray literature and more than 600 tests conducted on 23 multi-year ice floes over the past decade, including the first-published results over the full thickness of a 12. 7. m thick, cold multi-year <b>hummock.</b> The <b>ice</b> borehole strength is obtained by categorizing the pressure vs. time histories for each test into one of four main types of failure behavior. Vertical profiles of the temperature, salinity and borehole strength of multi-year floes in spring and summer demonstrate that the properties of multi-year ice are highly variable in space and time. The mean borehole strength and standard deviation of cold (- 13. 0 C) multi-year ice is 34. 2 1 9. 1 MPa, although strengths as high as 49. 2. MPa do occur, making multi-year ice nearly twice as strong as cold first-year ice. The mean borehole strength and standard deviation of warm multi-year ice is 19. 6 1 7. 2. MPa (at - 5 0 C) and 10. 3 1 5. 3 MPa (at 00 C). Ice temperature is shown to be the single largest factor influencing borehole strength: strength increases with decreasing ice temperature, however complex factors such as the ice failure mode and ice consolidation also bear upon the relation. For example, strengths measured in thick, level multi-year ice can be substantially higher than <b>hummocked</b> multi-year <b>ice</b> sampled at the same temperature, time of year and latitude. Similarly, a thoroughly weathered multi-year <b>ice</b> <b>hummock</b> in late summer can have considerably higher strength than a less weathered multi-year hummock in early spring. The study shows that multi-year ice does not deteriorate in the same manner as first-year ice, strength equations based solely on brine volume are not appropriate for multi-year ice and warm multi-year ice should not be assumed deteriorated. The viability of estimating the ice borehole strength from known ice temperatures is explored by fitting linear regressions to strength-temperature data for the two most common failure processes: well-defined yield failures (Type 2) and poorly-defined yield failures (Type 3). The Type 2 failure equation reproduces the measured strength profiles more closely than the Type 3 failure equation, but results are not ideal. A similar comparison was made for the effective borehole strength, i. e. the strength averaged over all test depths in a particular borehole. For the 64 boreholes examined, the Type 2 failure equation produced an upper bound for the effective borehole strength, but only when ice temperatures had been documented over at least half of the total ice thickness. 9 2013.
