25|$|The New Inn {{situated}} about 100 metres to {{the east}} of the Corinthian Arch. Built in 1717 specifically to provide accommodation for visitors to the gardens, the red brick Inn included a mini brewery where barley was brewed into beer, a farm and dairy. The Inn closed in the 1850s, it then being used as a farm, smithy and kennels for deer hounds. The building was purchased in a ruinous condition by the National Trust in 2005. In 2010 work started on converting it into the new visitor centre, and since 2011 this has been the entrance for visitors to the gardens. They formerly used The Oxford Gates.

5000|$|The {{structure}} of an IGCT {{is very similar}} to a GTO thyristor. In an IGCT, the gate turn-off current is greater than the anode current. This results in a complete elimination of minority carrier injection from the lower PN junction and faster turn-off times. The main differences are a reduction in cell size, and a much more substantial gate connection with much lower inductance in the <b>gate</b> <b>drive</b> circuit and drive circuit connection. The very high gate currents and fast dI/dt rise of the gate current mean that regular wires {{can not be used to}} connect the <b>gate</b> <b>drive</b> to the IGCT. The drive circuit PCB is integrated into the package of the device. The drive circuit surrounds the device and a large circular conductor attaching to the edge of the IGCT is used. The large contact area and short distance reduce both the inductance and resistance of the connection.|$|E

50|$|Another {{method for}} driving MOSFET-bridges {{is the use}} of a {{specialised}} transformer known as a GDT (<b>Gate</b> <b>Drive</b> Transformer), which gives the isolated outputs for driving the upper FETs gates. The transformer core is usually a ferrite toroid, with 1:1 or 4:9 winding ratio. However, this method can only be used with high frequency signals. The design of the transformer is also very important, as the leakage inductance should be minimized, or cross conduction may occur. The outputs of the transformer are usually clamped by Zener diodes, because high voltage spikes could destroy the MOSFET gates.|$|E

50|$|Charge {{pumps are}} often used in H-Bridges in high side drivers for gate driving the high side {{n-channel}} power MOSFETs and IGBTs. These devices are used because of their good performance, but require a <b>gate</b> <b>drive</b> voltage a few volts above the power rail. When the centre of a half bridge goes low the capacitor is charged via a diode, and this charge is used to later drive {{the gate of the}} high side FET gate a few volts above the source or emitter pin's voltage so as to switch it on. This strategy works well provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both high and low switches.|$|E
