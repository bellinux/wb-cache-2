50|$|During {{the pioneer}} years of {{aviation}} {{a number of}} aircraft were flown with both fore and aft auxiliary surfaces. The issue of <b>horizontal</b> <b>stability</b> was poorly understood and typically pitch control {{was on the front}} surface with the rear surface also lifting, leading to instability problems. The Kress Drachenflieger of 1901 and Dufaux triplane of 1908 had insufficient power to take off. More successful types included the Voisin-Farman I (1907) and Curtiss No. 1 (1909). The Wright Brothers too experimented on the basic Flyer design in an effort to obtain both controllability and stability, flying it at various times in first canard, then three surface and finally conventional configurations. By the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the rear surface had become the conventional configuration and few three surface types would be flown for many years. The Fokker V.8 of 1917 and Caproni Ca.60 Noviplano of 1921 were both failures.|$|E
50|$|The total GLA of the Podium {{is about}} 20,000 square metres and {{includes}} retail, multiplex cinema, food court. The structure {{is based on}} framed schemes, made by steel girders and concrete slabs on folded plates, arranged in a composite structural mechanism. The structure is crossed by a major point of the substructure, so that <b>horizontal</b> <b>stability</b> is achieved {{by the use of}} separate systems - combination of concrete cores and steel bracings - for the two halves of the structural body. The columns arrangement has to follow the free-form internal space, and to match with the substructure structural grid. As a result, spans are variable and many areas feature very long spans and cantilevers, which are solved by using truss girders in plane and spatial arrangements. The facade structures must allow free movements of the superstructure and follow the outer skin shape, and are based on vertical frames of variable shape, mostly following hybrid truss and beam schemes.|$|E

In Study 2, 294 college students were evaluated on the same variables with a 1 -year interval. Results from both studies revealed that (a) global self-determined motivation was not more stable than self-deter-mined school motivation over time and (b) a cross-lag model including reciprocal effects between self-determined global and self-determined school motivation offered the best fit indices com-paratively to a model involving only <b>horizontal</b> (or <b>stability)</b> effects.

40|$|ABSTRACT:The <b>horizontal</b> <b>stability</b> of a Single-Point Moored (SPM) Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) {{facility}} is investigated. Both numerical and experimental {{studies have been}} conducted for this SPM FLNG. The numerical simulations feature well the experimental data.

The results show that the longitudinal location of the turret has a significant influence on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stability,</b> which has a strong relationship with the yaw and roll motions. The calculated top tensions on the hawsers also develop a regular change as changing the turret’s location.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{thinning}} {{effects on the}} stability of crowns, {{some changes in the}} stability of crowns after thinning were simulated in sixteen sorts of thinning plans by the canopy dynamic model. Both the height and the eccentricity of the center of gravity of a tree 2 ̆ 7 s foliage were used as indexes of the stability of a crown. The results of simulation were summarized as in the following : 1. The thinning intensity largely effected the stability of crowns. The risings of center of gravity accompanying with the tree-height-growth were reduced in accordance with an increasing in the thinning ratio. This result suggests the possibility of keeping the vertical stability of crowns by the execution of intensive thinning. The relative frequency of occurrence of the trees supplied with changing eccentricity during 5 years after the thinning, increased linearly with the thinning ratio. 2. The upper and the all storied thinning reduced eccentricity more significantly than other thinning systems did. The cutting of the trees which were large enough to suppress the others was deemed to be effective to keep the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stability</b> of crowns. 3. The line thinning showed less effects on the individual foliage weight than other thinning systems did. Consequently, the planning of the thinning ratio by using the stand density control diagram was deemed to be inadaptable to the line thinning system. 4. The line thinning enlarged the eccentricity more than other thinning systems did, showing the tendency to lose the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stability</b> of crowns. ...|$|E

Some authors have reported that the incidence of lesions associated with unstable ACJ injuries can be up to 30 % [44]. In the management of chronic ACJ instability, it is important to guarantee that there is no interposition of the deltotrapezial fascia between the clavicle and the acromion, a situation that can only be accomplished by means of making a mini-approach just above the ACJ. Once anatomical reduction of the ACJ has been reached, the deltotrapezial fascia should be carefully reconstructed in order to ensure adequate vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>stability</b> [7].|$|E

In the proposed method, the visual servoing of the image moments is used to control the vertical motion and rotation around the roll axis. In contrast, an undesired positive feedback arises in visual errors because of the under-actuation of the UAV and this positive feedback {{makes it difficult to}} apply the visual servoing to the horizontal motion.

40|$|Many exo-solar systems {{discovered}} {{in the last decade}} consist of planets orbiting in resonant configurations and consequently, their evolution should show long-term stability. However, due to the mutual planetary interactions a multi-planet system shows complicated dynamics with mostly chaotic trajectories. We can determine possible stable configurations by computing resonant periodic trajectories of the general planar three body problem, which can be used for modeling a two-planet system. In this work, we review our model for both the planar and the spatial case. We present families of symmetric periodic trajectories in various resonances and study their linear <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>stability.</b> We show that around stable periodic orbits there exist regimes in phase space where regular evolution takes place.
