5|$|On 6 April 1917, the United States {{declared}} war on Germany, entering World War I.

During that time he developed extensive contacts at various European courts in Courland, Austria (Vienna), Italy (Turin) and France (Paris). During his three-year stay in the Lubomirskis' Parisian residence, he was in touch with many important men of the Age of Enlightenment. He met—often through another Florentinian, Filippo Mazzei—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, the Marquis de Lafayette, Luigi Landriani, Girolamo Lucchesini, and the Marquis de Condorcet. He also corresponded with <b>J.</b> <b>G.</b> Herder. In Poland, he developed close contacts with Ignacy Potocki and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicza. From 1787 he also tutored Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, later an important politician in the Russian Empire, on whom Piattoli would retain significant influence.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-one brass cannon {{were moved}} to the north-facing crenellated terrace of the fort from nearby Cumberland Lodge in the early 19th century. The cannon were made by Andrew Schalch at the Royal Brass Foundry in Woolwich in 1729–1749. The cannon were fired for King George IV's birthdays and other royal birthdays until 1907, with the cannonfire being {{answered}} by a miniature frigate situated on Virginia Water {{in the early years}} of their operation. The last Bombardier situated at the fort was Master Gunner Turner of the Royal Artillery. The Bombardier was entrusted with the care of the guns and lived in Bombardier's Cottage, connected to the main house by an archway. The cannon would have been melted down as part of the war effort in 1943 had it not been for the intervention of the head of the Tower Armoury, <b>J.</b> <b>G.</b> Mann. Four guns were removed from the terrace in 1930 and placed in two pairs at the entrances to the fort.|$|E
5|$|In 324BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had {{entrusted}} huge treasures, absconded {{and sought}} refuge in Athens. The Assembly had initially {{refused to accept}} him, following Demosthenes's advice, but finally Harpalus entered Athens. He was imprisoned after a proposal of Demosthenes and Phocion, despite the dissent of Hypereides, an anti-Macedonian statesman and former ally of Demosthenes. Additionally, the ecclesia decided {{to take control of}} Harpalus's money, which was entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes. When the committee counted the treasure, they found they only had half the money Harpalus had declared he possessed. Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit. When Harpalus escaped, the Areopagus conducted an inquiry and charged Demosthenes with mishandling twenty talents. During the trial, Hypereides argued that Demosthenes did not disclose the huge deficit, because he was bribed by Harpalus. Demosthenes was fined and imprisoned, but he soon escaped.* I. Apostolidis, notes 1219, 1226 & 1229 in <b>J.</b> <b>G.</b> Droysen, History of Alexander the Great, 717–726; K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 303–309; D. Whitehead, Hypereides, 359–360; I. Worthington, Harpalus Affair, passim. It remains unclear whether the accusations against him were just or not. In any case, the Athenians soon repealed the sentence.* K.
