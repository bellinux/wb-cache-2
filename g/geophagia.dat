50|$|<b>Geophagia</b> {{is nearly}} {{universal}} {{around the world}} in tribal and traditional rural societies (although apparently it has not been documented in Japan and Korea). In the ancient world, several writers noted the use of <b>geophagia.</b> Pliny is said to have noted the use of soil on Lemnos, an island of Greece, {{and the use of the}} soils from this island was noted until the 14thcentury.

5000|$|<b>Geophagia</b> ( [...] ; {{also known}} as {{geophagy}} [...] ) is the practice of eating earth or soil-like substrates such as clay or chalk. It occurs in non-human animals where {{it may be a}} normal or abnormal behaviour, and also in humans, most often in rural or preindustrial societies among children and pregnant women. Human <b>geophagia</b> may be related to pica, an eating disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) characterized by abnormal cravings for non-nutritive items.|$|E
5000|$|In {{more recent}} times, {{according}} to Dixie's Forgotten People: the South's Poor Whites, <b>geophagia</b> was common among poor {{whites in the}} South-eastern United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was often ridiculed in popular literature. The literature also states, [...] "Many men believed that eating clay increased sexual prowess, and some females claimed that eating clay helped pregnant women to have an easy delivery." [...] <b>Geophagia</b> among southerners may {{have been caused by}} the high prevalence of hookworm disease, in which the desire to consume soil is a symptom.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{hypotheses}} {{about the importance}} of <b>geophagia</b> in bats and primates.

5000|$|There is {{debate over}} whether <b>geophagia</b> in bats is {{primarily}} for nutritional supplementation or detoxification. It is known that some species of bats regularly visit mineral or salt licks to increase mineral consumption. However, Voigt et al. demonstrated that both mineral-deficient and healthy bats visit salt licks at the same rate. [...] Therefore, mineral supplementation {{is unlikely to be}} the primary reason for <b>geophagia</b> in bats. Additionally, bat presence at salt licks increases during periods of high energy demand. Voigt et al. concluded that the primary purpose for bat presence at salt licks is for detoxification purposes, compensating for the increased consumption of toxic fruit and seeds. This was shown to be especially evident in lactating and pregnant bats, as their food intake increases to meet higher energy demands.|$|E
50|$|Most {{chemical}} {{elements that are}} ingested by organisms are {{in the form of}} simple compounds. Plants absorb dissolved elements in soils, which are subsequently ingested by the herbivores that eat them, and the elements move up the food chain. Larger organisms may also consume soil (<b>geophagia)</b> or use mineral resources, such as salt licks, to obtain limited minerals unavailable through other dietary sources.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, cooked, baked, and {{processed}} dirt and clay {{are sold in}} health food stores and rural flea markets in the South. In the rural areas of Mississippi and other southern states, the consumption of clay-rich dirt has been a common custom and has been practiced by poor whites and blacks for generations. However, <b>geophagia</b> has become less prevalent as rural Americans assimilate into urban culture.|$|E
50|$|Clay {{minerals}} {{have been}} reported to have beneficial microbiological effects, such as protecting the stomach against toxins, parasites and pathogens. Humans are not able to synthesize vitamin B12 (cobalamin), so <b>geophagia</b> may be a behavioral adaption to obtain it from bacteria in the soil. Mineral content in soils may vary per region, but many contain high levels of calcium, copper, magnesium, iron and zinc that are critical for pregnant women and peasants, as nature typically tends to favor behaviors based on survival.|$|E
50|$|There {{are obvious}} risks in the {{consumption}} of ampo and clay that is contaminated by animal or human feces; in particular, parasite eggs, such as roundworm, that can stay dormant for years, can present a problem. Tetanus poses a further risk. Nevertheless, these risks are generally well understood by most tribal populations that engage in geophagy, hence 'clean' earth from below the surface level is sought out. Children's predilection to engage in geophagy makes them more susceptible to worm infestations. Other dangers associated with <b>geophagia</b> include damage to tooth enamel, the ingestion {{of a variety of}} bacteria, various forms of soil contamination, and intestinal obstruction.|$|E
50|$|When geophagical {{materials}} are consumed {{and come in}} contact with digestive fluids, they have the potential of releasing clinical or sub-clinical toxic effects on an individual.There are several reports regarding the health risks of consuming Calabash chalk including; the alteration of the normal concentration of hemoglobin, red blood cell counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Another possible side effect of eating this <b>geophagia</b> is the alteration of growth rate and de-mineralization in the femur bone. Other reports suggest that Calabash chalk also causes numerous gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, ulcers and gastritis. This stems from histomorphological changes that Calabash chalk causes to the stomach and oesophagus.|$|E
5000|$|Early explorers in the Americas {{noted the}} use of {{geophagy}} amongst Native Americans, including Gabriel Soares de Sousa, who reported in 1587 of a tribe in Brazil using it in suicide, and von Humboldt, who said that a tribe called the Otomacs ate large amounts of soil. In Africa, Livingston wrote about slaves eating soil in Zanzibar, {{and it is also}} thought that large numbers of slaves brought with them soil eating practices when they were shipped as part of the transatlantic slave trade. <b>Geophagia</b> was common among slaves who were nicknamed [...] "clay-eaters" [...] because they had been known to consume clay, as well as spices, ash, chalk, grass, plaster, paint, and starch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} eggs {{excreted}} by a pig can give {{an indication of}} the worm burden because, in continuously exposed pigs, the quantity of eggs that are shed seems to be correlated with the number of adult worms in the intestine. For this, different coprological techniques can be applied [...] which make use of the buoyancy of parasite eggs to separate them from the faecal debris. For the detection of A. suum eggs, the quantitative McMaster test is generally used. The results of this examination are reported as eggs per gram of faeces or EPG.Although coprological examinations are easy to perform and require relatively cheap materials, the performance of the sampling and the tests are time consuming and not cost-effective nor optimal for the screening of large number of samples. In addition, the correct interpretation of the results of coprological examinations can prove to be a rather difficult exercise.Ascaris populations are strongly aggregated within the pig population with few pigs carrying the majority of the worms while most of the pigs carry few or even no adult worms at all. Because of this, a large number of pigs need to be investigated since there is a significant possibility to have false positive and false negative egg counts.False positives are the result of coprophagia and/or <b>geophagia</b> and their prevalence and magnitude depends on different management and housing factors. The number and range of false-positive A.suum egg counts in pigs can be considerable, but in general, EPG levels lower than 200 should be considered false-positives. However, for diagnosis on farm level, these false positive samples are not as important as the false negatives. False negative results are possible when only immature worms are present or when only worms of a single sex are present. Boes and colleagues [...] have shown that as much as 23% of the investigated pigs that harboured worms in their intestine did not excrete any eggs. Consequentially, prevalence studies that reveal many low A. suum egg counts in pigs should be interpreted with care. Furthermore, the number of adult worms, and therefore the EPG is not representative of the amount of migrating larvae the pig has been exposed to. Regardless of the dose regimen, the numbers of worms that end up in the small intestine is generally inconsistent and independent of the intake of infective stages. Moreover, there seems to exist an inverse relationship between the number of adults found in the intestine and the amount of eggs given during a single experimental infection dose.|$|E
40|$|Aim: We {{investigated}} if <b>Geophagia</b> {{is restricted}} to only pregnant and lactating women in Ghana. We also investigated if the key driver of <b>Geophagia</b> is poverty and other socio-cultural factors. Methods: This analysis {{was part of a}} broader national study of resilience among the population of Ghana (N= 2, 000). Regional comparisons were made possible due to the stratified and random selection of representations that were similar in characteristics such as being urban or rural, ethnicity, religion and gender. Results: It was found that <b>Geophagia</b> was present among both females and males and was not restricted to pregnant and lactating women. <b>Geophagia</b> was not driven by poverty or the lack of formal education or the presence of gainful employment. <b>Geophagia</b> was practiced by both urban and rural residents irrespective of religious proclivities and devotion. The assertion that <b>Geophagia</b> was an instinctive primordial response to gastro-intestinal disturbances was not sustained by the data in this study, although the literature review suggested such in calves and lambs. Conclusion: In order to address the potential health threats posed by <b>Geophagia,</b> the key cultural drivers need to be studied and understood. We also need to appreciate the shocks and stresses that create such desires. It is not a case of mental illness and it cannot be concluded that <b>Geophagia</b> is driven by a psychiatric disorder.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{significance}} of pica and <b>geophagia</b> {{as a public}} health problem is well known. The objective radiographic diagnosis of <b>geophagia</b> depends on the abnormal opacification of the bowel as an immediate manifestation of the condition. The chance of detectability of <b>geophagia</b> is highest in the colon and can be improved by using low penetration films, particularly for smaller amounts of ingested clay. Other radiologic changes frequently associated with the prolonged practice of <b>geophagia</b> are an atonic pattern of the colon, secondary radiographic changes due to iron-deficiency anemia and bone-age retardation. The occurrence of intestinal obstruction due to pica in the presence of preexisting bowel stricture is demonstrated. Am. J. Clin. Nuir. 28 : 1095 - 1098, 1975. Pica is a disorder of appetite with an abnormal craving for unusual nonedible sub-stances. The mode of satisfying the abnormal appetite depends on the patient’s environ-ment.

40|$|Background: Soil {{has been}} eaten by humans under various names {{all over the}} world.

40|$|<b>Geophagia,</b> the {{intentional}} and repeated ingestion of soil material, {{is a complex}} eating behaviour with incomprehensible aetiology. It is generally assumed that <b>geophagia</b> may help supplement mineral nutrients and thus should not be dissuaded, particularly in subsistence communities. This is largely {{based on the assumption}} that a large proportion of mineral nutrients in geophagic materials is potentially available for absorption in the body. We tested this hypothesis on five soils collected from geophagia-prevalent communities by using an in vitro soil ingestion simulation test that is broadly similar to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The results show that, despite the soils being rich in mineral nutrients, soil ingestion, inadvertent or through <b>geophagia</b> can potentially reduce the absorption of already bioavailable nutrients, particularly micronutrients such as Fe, Cu and Zn. These in vitro findings, while disagreeing with the commonly held view of <b>geophagia</b> as a source of nutrient supplementation, are consistent with micronutrient deficiency problems observed in clinical nutrition studies conducted amongst geophagic populations. The work also showed that, in some cases, the ingested soils may become a source of Ca, Mg and Mn, although it is not clear why other similar soils should not release any of these mineral nutrients...|$|E
40|$|The {{aetiology}} of <b>geophagia</b> in periurban {{dairy cattle}} in Nigeria was assessed {{in relation to}} the mineral status of the serum, the herbage consumed, and the soil from where the herbage was consumed.

However, the forages were low in Ca and the serum was deficient in Forage, soil and termite hill samples were also deficient in The low levels of P in the soil and termite hill samples showed that the consumption of sand by the cattle did not have any positive impact on their P intake.

40|$|<b>Geophagia</b> or {{geophagy}} is a habit for an uncontrollable urge to eat {{earth that}} commonly is occur in poverty-stricken populations and particularly {{there are in}} children under three {{years of age and}} pregnant women. The custom of involuntary or deliberate eating of soil, especially clayey soil, has a long history and is amazingly widespread. Some researchers have described an anomalous clay layer at a prehistoric site at the Kalambo Falls in Zambia indicating that clay might have been eaten by hominids. Von Humboidt reported from his travels in South America in early 18 th century that clay was eaten to some extent at all times by the tribe in Peru. In the mid 19 century it was customary for certain people in the north of Sweden to mix earth with flour in making bread whether the clay effected an improvement in taste. In Iran, <b>geophagia</b> has seen in some of children and pregnant which that is solved with eating starch daily. For example, some reports are shown that there has been <b>geophagia</b> disease in some parts of Fars province, around Shiraz city which have been made different health as well as environmental complications. Clay with a large cation exchange capacity that is also fairly well saturated can release and supplement some macronutrients and micronutrients such as Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. Deficiency of these elements led to dwarfism, hypogonadism, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly and skin problems. Almost all of these health complication evidences are seen in most of people who has been suffered from geophagy in Iran.

40|$|AbstractNew {{data on the}} {{abundance}} of rare earth elements (REE) and their biological properties, which appeared in recent decades, force the researchers to reconsider the facts previously collected by different researchers related {{to the study of}} the <b>geophagia</b> phenomenon in animals and humans. From the standpoint of the new data it becomes apparent that one of the reasons for instinctively traditional form of <b>geophagia,</b> as well as for drinking water from mineralized sources by animals and a man with lengthy visits to the same places could be an instinctual drive of a specific organism to adjust in their bodies and tissues the concentration and ratio of the rare earth elements which are able to actively influence, either directly or indirectly (through the effects on metabolism of other chemical elements in the body) the biochemical and physiological processes that determine the quality of health. Since REE influence at the level of nerve tissue biochemistry, hormonal regulation of the body and even at the genetic level, it all can point to a higher order which they occupy in the hierarchy of elements in the composition of any organism. It seems that REE have reasons to claim to be the main causes of all instinctive forms of traditional <b>geophagia</b> and related consumption of mineralized water...|$|E

40|$|Members of {{the animal}} kingdom, {{including}} humans, can ingest soil either involuntarily or deliberately, the latter practice being known as geophagy or <b>geophagia.</b> This paper briefly documents the often significant quantities of soil that can be consumed, but discusses in detail {{the importance of this}} ingestion in supplying mineral nutrients and potentially harmful elements (PHEs) to consumers of earth materials. Whilst <b>geophagia</b> is recognised as a multi-causal behaviour, a prevalent explanation is the ?nutritional hypothesis? where the deliberate consumption of soil is attributed to an attempt to regulate a mineral nutrient imbalance such as sodium deficiency. When soils encounter digestive fluids, chemical elements can be solubilised and are potentially available for absorption, sometimes to an extent where toxicity symptoms are evident. In grassland agricultural systems, two main pathways of chemical elements are recognised, the soil?plant?animal flow being complemented by the more direct soil?animal transfer of mineral nutrients and PHEs. In locations where the pasture herbage absorbs very low concentrations of chemical elements relative to the soil content, ingested soil particles can often be observed to be the major source of mineral nutrients/PHEs consumed by livestock. However, further research is required in quantifying the bioaccessibility ? defined as the fraction that is soluble in the gastrointestinal tract and is potentially available for absorption ? of soil-elements to animals. In this respect, regarding human nutrition, {{for more than a decade}} considerable work has been undertaken on the development of in vitro bioaccessibility tests (IVBA) that can rapidly and inexpensively estimate this portion of chemical elements from ingested soils. Work to date has demonstrated that significant amounts of some mineral nutrients, especially iron, can be bioaccessible to humans, as can quantities of PHEs such as lead. Paradoxically, some ingested soils can also result in mineral nutrient deficiency problems in humans and other members {{of the animal}} kingdom attributable, for example, to the adsorptive properties of earth materials that can effectively bind chemical elements.

40|$|Human toxocariasis is a helminthozoonosis {{due to the}} {{migration}} of Toxocara species larvae through human organism. Humans become infected by ingesting either embryonated eggs from soil (<b>geophagia,</b> pica), dirty hands or raw vegetables, or larvae from undercooked giblets. The diagnosis relies upon sensitive immunological methods (ELISA or western-blot) which use Toxocara excretory-secretory antigens. Seroprevalence is high in developed countries, especially in rural areas, and also in some tropical islands. The clinical spectrum of the disease comprises four syndromes, namely visceral larva migrans, ocular larva migrans, and the more recently recognized "common" (in adults) and "covert" (in children) pictures. Therapy of ocular toxocariasis is primarily based upon corticosteroids use, when visceral larva migrans and few cases of common or covert toxocariasis can be treated by anthelmintics whose the most efficient appeared to be diethylcarbamazine.
