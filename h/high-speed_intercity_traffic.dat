However, noise and vibration are key obstacles to further development of the railway networks for <b>high-speed</b> <b>intercity</b> <b>traffic,</b> for freight and for suburban metros and light-rail. All too often noise problems are dealt with inefficiently {{due to lack of}} understanding of the problem. This book brings together coverage of the theory of railway noise and vibration with practical applications of noise control technology at source to solve noise and vibration problems from railways...|$|E

40|$|High-speed {{passenger}} rail {{is seen by}} many in the U. S. transportation policy and planning communities as an ideal solution for fast, safe, and resource-efficient mobility in high-demand intercity corridors. To expand the body of knowledge for <b>high-speed</b> <b>intercity</b> {{passenger rail}} in the U. S., the overall goal of this dissertation was to better understand the demand for <b>high-speed</b> <b>intercity</b> passenger rail services in small- or medium-sized intermediate communities and improve planners' ability to estimate such demand through traveler surveys; specifically, the use of different experimental designs for stated preference questions and the use of images to describe hypothetical travel alternatives in traveler surveys. In pursuit of this goal, an Internet-based survey was distributed to residents of Waco and Temple, two communities located along the federally-designated South Central High-Speed Rail Corridor in Central Texas. A total of 1, 160 surveys were obtained from residents of the two communities. Mixed logit travel mode choice models developed from the survey data revealed valuable findings that can inform demand estimates and the design of traveler surveys for <b>high-speed</b> <b>intercity</b> passenger rail planning activities. Based on the analysis presented in this dissertation, ridership estimates for new <b>high-speed</b> <b>intercity</b> passenger rail lines that are planned to serve intermediate communities should not assume that residents of these communities have similar characteristics and values. The d-efficient stated preference experimental design was found to provide a mode choice model with a better fit and greater significance on key policy variables than the adaptive design and therefore is recommended for use in future surveys. Finally, it is recommended that surveys should consider the use of images of proposed train services to aid respondent decision-making for stated preference questions, but only if the images used in the survey depict equipment that could be realistically deployed in the corridor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Comparing {{to daily}} urban {{commuting}} <b>traffics,</b> <b>intercity</b> <b>traffics</b> are very intermingled with different purposes. Each {{of them may}} have different price elasticity for toll. Therefore, observed traffic flows must be carefully dissolved into several types of traffics, and price elasticity must be captured. In order to grasp the response of urban road traffics to price change, disaggregate behavioral model have been considered as an effective analytical tool. But in case of heterogeneous <b>intercity</b> <b>traffics,</b> survey on sampled individuals {{is very difficult to}} design and consumes much time and money. Fortunately in Japan, automatically detected traffic data have been gathered at many points along expressways and highways. This research is intended to analyze the cross-sectional traffic count of Honshu-Shikoku bridges. Specifically, influence of the fare change (10 % discount in July 2003) is clarified by using the methods such as factor analysis and Vector Auto-Regression...|$|R

40|$|In the {{organization}} of city traffic there is a historical link between the various transport modes, particularly between the road and rail systems (tram, metro and railways). Each particular system operates autonomously and independently of one another, while at locations of mode changing (stops) time integration of various modes into a single integrated system is performed. Rail systems are the backbone of an integrated system because of the capacity and speed they can provide. Railways are particularly interesting because they integrate urban, suburban, regional and <b>intercity</b> <b>traffic.</b> Railways are traditionally monopolistic, but, since 1990, the European Union has implemented legal, organizational, technological and technical measures {{in order to achieve}} full liberalization of railway transport. The liberalization of railway transport is particularly successful in freight, while in passenger traffic the change is slower; particularly interesting are the changes in the regional railway traffic in Germany and in <b>intercity</b> <b>traffic</b> in the Czech Republic.
