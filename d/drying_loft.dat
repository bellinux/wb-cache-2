50|$|In the 1950s and 60s {{the station}} was {{important}} for the military staff working at Hvalsmoen and Eggemoen, both of which lay nearby. In 1973 the station became remote controlled, and the passenger traffic ended on 1 November 1990, after the remote traffic to Bergen started to go through Drammen instead. Today the station is used as crossing tracks, {{but it also has}} separate side tracks. The station building is of the Sirnes-type, it has <b>drying</b> <b>loft</b> and it is protected.|$|E
40|$|On 16 January 1772, a notary, a papermaker, and a {{carpenter}} entered the Prélat paper mill {{to complete their}} inventory of the estate of Claude Chapon, {{the owner of the}} mill, who had died two days earlier. On the ground floors of what were in fact two adjacent buildings they found a worn-out vat, two sets of five stamping mills in dire need of repairs, a leaky retting vat, a partly broken sorting table, and two crumbling masonry storage tanks. Only two screw presses were deemed in fair shape. Upper floors also drew disparaging comments, the notary recording, for instance, the thinness of the <b>drying</b> <b>loft</b> ropes and the worrisome conditions of several beams. However, almost four hundred reams of fresh or ready-to-ship, high-quality paper were found on the premises. The Prélat was an active mill, and work had stopped only that very morning, after all remaining processed rags had been made into paper. It would soon resume. The contrast evident at the Prélat on that January morning between a high level of activity and a derelict work environment will not surprise those familiar with legal or paralegal inventories of early modern worksites. It is the starting point of the present inquiry...|$|E

I have been a-saving up pretty nigh all my wages from the day as you was born, and is quite comfortable off. Write me a letter soon, dearie, to tell me as how things is going on.

50|$|The Irish Tourist Association {{survey of}} 1944 {{confirms}} Clonmoyle House as {{the residence of}} Mrs Young, who also 'owned nearby Clonmoyle Flour Mills'. A separate survey entry is contained for Clonmoyle Flour Mills, giving the company name of 'John Young and Sons Limited, Clonmoyle, Coachford', which company appears to exist to this day. The survey states that numerous mills were erected around the Great Famine (Ireland) period to meet increased demand for the processing of Indian meal and it was thought Clonmoyle Mill was built for this reason as between 1847 and 1854. The exact year of construction was uncertain, but a grinding stone, {{said to be a}} replacement from another mill, bore the date 1856. Clonmoyle Mill was said to have first been operated by 'Charles Colthurst of Ballyvourney' and that methods introduced by him were still followed in 1944, and the mill independently operated, some ninety years later. Wheat was kiln <b>dried</b> in the <b>loft,</b> heated through a perforated floor, and then ground into flour by stone rollers driven from the mill wheel. The older milling method employed was said to be preferred. Oats and barley were also ground for the feeding of cattle, pigs and poultry. Visitors were admitted to the mill, free of charge, but at their own risk.|$|R
40|$|China's air {{pollution}} issue, {{a byproduct of}} recent phenomenal economic growth, has received increasing attention in light of its local and large-scale impacts. I investigated the emissions, transport, and evolution of pollutants from China using measurements near some source regions in northern China in 2005. Surface pollution near Beijing in March was overall heavy but changed dramatically, as passing mid-latitude cyclones led to fast transitions between polluted prefrontal and clean postfrontal conditions. Large differences found between measurements and inventories suggest substantial uncertainties in emission estimates. Small, coal-fired boilers are shown unlikely to be {{the major source of}} inventory error; experiments measuring traffic emissions are called for. Ground-level aerosols absorb light and are from both wind-blown dust and anthropogenic emissions. Their effects on climate are to be further studied. Pollutants at higher altitudes {{are more likely to have}} large-scale impact than pollutants that remain near the surface. The aircraft campaign in April was among the first efforts to measure the vertical distribution of pollutants over inland China. The largest pollutant levels observed in the free troposphere during the campaign were related to <b>dry</b> convective <b>lofting</b> over an industrial region. This differs from earlier experiments over the Pacific, which recognized the warm conveyor belt (WCB) as the main <b>lofting</b> mechanism. <b>Dry</b> convection over the continent may be followed by WCB lifting as the systems move out over the ocean. Their relative roles are yet to be determined. Analyses of meteorological and satellite cloud data reveal the importance of in-cloud processing in oxidizing SO 2 transported behind cold fronts. Through integration of satellite sensors, in-situ measurements, trajectory and chemical transport models, I tracked a pollution plume as it traveled away from source region. The decay of SO 2 in the plume over three days was quantified, suggesting an SO 2 lifetime of 1 - 4 d. Formation of sulfate and loss of dust together changed the aerosol loading of the plume. This analysis showcases the potential for employing satellites to trace transport events and pollutant evolution, and highlights the main uncertainties in quantitative application of satellite data...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms for {{transporting}} and dehydrating air {{across the}} tropical tropopause layer (TTL) are investigated with a conceptual two dimensional (2 -D) model. The 2 -D TTL model combines the Holton and Gettelman cold trap dehydration mechanism (Holton and Gettelman, 2001) {{with the two}} column convection model of Folkins and Martin (2005). We investigate 3 possible transport scenarios through the TTL: 1) slow uniform ascent across the level of zero radiative heating without direct convective mixing, 2) convective mixing of H 2 O vapor at 100 % relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) with no ice retention, and 3) convective mixing of extremely subsaturated air (100 % RHi following the moist adiabatic temperature above the level of neutral buoyancy) with sufficient ice retention such that total H 2 O is 100 %RHi. The three mechanisms produce similar seasonal cycles for H 2 O that are in good quantitative agreement with the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements. We use Aura MLS measurement of CO and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer measurement of HDO to distinguish among the transport mechanisms. Model comparisons with the observations {{support the view that}} H 2 O is predominantly controlled by regions having the lowest cold point tropopause temperature but the trace species CO and HDO support the convective mixing of <b>dry</b> air and <b>lofted</b> ice. The model provides some insight into the processes affecting the long term trends observed in stratospheric H 2 O...|$|R
