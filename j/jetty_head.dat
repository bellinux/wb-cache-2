50|$|In 1994, the South Australian Research and Development Institute {{installed}} an “underwater interpretation trail” {{in order}} to “raise community awareness of temperate reef environments and marine life.” The trail which covers a distance of 800 m consists of 12 concrete plinths installed on the seabed and each fitted with a plaque providing information about the reef’s sub-tidal flora and fauna. The trail which starts at the <b>jetty</b> <b>heads</b> south {{on the east side}} of the reef and passes through a passage in the reef known as The Gap and then heads north on the west side of the reef to a point opposite the end of the jetty.|$|R

50|$|The first {{inhabitants}} {{and traditional}} landowners {{of the area}} were the Budawang indigenous people. European activity in Narrawallee began in 1924 when a 610 mm gauge tramway was constructed to transport silica from deposits near Conjola to a <b>jetty</b> at Bannister <b>Head.</b> This involved {{the construction of a}} bridge across the mouth of Narrawallee inlet using local timbers at a cost of £2600. Silica transported on the tramway was crushed at a facility at Bannister Head, then shipped to steelworks at Newcastle and Port Kembla. The tramline survived until due to a downturn in production during World War II the rails were lifted in 1943 and the bridge dismantled the following year. Remnants of the bridge supports are still visible on the northern side of Narrawallee inlet.|$|R

This jetty {{construction}} is aiming to serve 10, 000 DWT general cargo ship and to maximize distribute goods in the area of Rembang and surroundings. In order to support this jetty is needed planning for a navigation channel, port basin, breakwaters, as well as dimensions and structure of the jetty along with the attributes. Navigation channel of Tanjung Bonang Rembang Port is planned facing towards Northeast with depth that is used at least - 10. 5 m, navigation channel width is taken by 137 m and port basin depth is - 10 m. The type of breakwaters structure is rubblemound breakwaters for the west side and east side. The structure of jetty is used local cast reinforced concrete with strength of concrete f 2 ̆ 7 c = 35 MPa. Foundation structure are using steel piles with quality JIS A 5525, SKK 400, fy 2 ̆ 7 = 2, 350 kg/cm 2. In the planning of this jetty, system structure is analyzed by using the program SAP 2000 with 3 D models. Load and reinforce structures is controlled by SNI regulations and BMS 1992. From the designing plan result is obtained that jetty consists of a <b>jetty</b> <b>head</b> and 2 trestle. The dimension of <b>jetty</b> <b>head</b> is 170 m length and 22 m width, while the dimension of trestle is 26 m length and 10 m width. The jetty beam dimension is 40 cm width and 60 cm height, while the pile dimension is 45 cm diameter, 1. 2 cm thickness, and 20. 65 m length for vertical pile and 20. 75 m length for diagonal piles with slope ratio 10 V: 1 H. Pile cap dimension for single pile on <b>jetty</b> <b>head</b> and trestle is 1 x 1 x 1. 5 m. Pile cap dimensions for double pile on <b>jetty</b> <b>head</b> is 1. 5 x 1 x 1. 5 m, and pile cap dimensions for the edge of <b>jetty</b> <b>head</b> is 1. 6 x 1. 2 x 2. 6 m. On the berthing structure is used Fentek Arch Fender-type AN 600 L = 2, 500 mm and the mooring structure is used Bollard and Bitt with a capacity 50 tons...|$|E
40|$|Chichester derives {{its name}} from the Saxon ‘Cissa’s ceaster’, {{although}} it retains its grid-street plan and city walls from the original Roman fortified settlement of ‘Noviomagus Reginorum’. As a principal market town, many inns and taverns were established here at an early date, including those offering hospitality for pilgrims travelling to the cathedral for worship at the thirteenth-century shine of St Richard. Of nearly all the medieval houses - such as the Tabard, the Star, and the Plough - nothing survives except names in old documents. The surfeit of pubs and beerhouses in late-nineteenth century Chichester was culled in the period up to 1939, beginning with the infamous ‘massacre’ of 1903 when seventeen premises surrendered their licenses. Following a forty-year lull, the number of pub closures has escalated since the 1980 s. Yet Chichester still has at least three pubs continuously trading since the eighteenth century, while several others now closed retain original architectural features worthy of note. The deregulation of the trade has also seen the emergence of contemporary café-bar-pubs, such as the Belle Isle. David Muggleton takes us on a tour of this compact but elegant city, taking in the classical-Georgian Ship Hotel, where General Eisenhower stayed in the lead-up to D-Day; the mid-Victorian Four Chesnuts and the mystery of its missing ‘t’; the gabled and <b>jettied</b> mock-Tudor Nags <b>Head</b> of 1925; and the Duke & Rye, recently established in a Gothic-revival church building...|$|R
60|$|It hadn't; {{but it did}} {{not yield}} a strong gush. The sound of a thin stream, partly {{breaking}} on the gunwale of the boat and partly splashing alongside, became at once audible. It was greeted by a cry of inarticulate and savage joy. Heyst knelt on the string-piece and peered down. The man who had spoken was already holding his open mouth under the bright trickle. Water ran over his eyelids and over his nose, gurgled down his throat, flowed over his chin. Then some obstruction in the pipe gave way, and a sudden thick jet broke on his face. In a moment his shoulders were soaked, the front of his coat inundated; he streamed and dripped; water ran into his pockets, down his legs, into his shoes; but he had clutched the end of the pipe, and, hanging on with both hands, swallowed, spluttered, choked, snorted with the noises of a swimmer. Suddenly a curious dull roar reached Heyst's ears. Something hairy and black flew from under the <b>jetty.</b> A dishevelled <b>head,</b> coming on like a cannonball, took the man at the pipe in flank, with enough force to tear his grip loose and fling him headlong into the stern-sheets. He fell upon the folded legs of the man at the tiller, who, roused by the commotion in the boat, was sitting up, silent, rigid, and very much like a corpse. His eyes were but two black patches, and his teeth glistened with a death's head grin between his retracted lips, no thicker than blackish parchment glued over the gums.|$|R
