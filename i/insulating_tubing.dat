40|$|If water {{stays on}} wood {{surfaces}} or is trapped in gaps, the wood is supplied with {{water for a}} long period of time and high local moisture contents are reached. This can lead to decay by rot fungi, and it is therefore important to avoid such water traps in order to limit the decay rate. This paper presents two methods: one for determination of duration of surface moisture on wood surfaces and one for determination of duration of water trapped in gaps in wood joints. Both these methods are based on electrical conductance measurements that are commonly used to measure moisture content of wood. Both sensor types consist of <b>insulating</b> <b>tubing,</b> electrically conductive adhesive and copper wire. The sensors monitor the presence of moisture on the actual material surface, and because of their small size, they do not influence the amount and duration of moisture that stays on the surface or in the gap...|$|E

Fluid temperature higher than 4 °C can increase the volume of fluid needed, prolong the induction phase of hypothermia and thus contribute to complications. We performed a laboratory experiment with two objectives. The first objective was to analyze the effect of wrapping fluid bags in ice packs on the increase of fluid temperature with time in bags exposed to ambient conditions. The second objective was to quantify the effect of <b>insulating</b> venous <b>tubing</b> and adjusting flow rate on fluid temperature increase from bag to the level of an intravenous cannula during a simulated infusion. The temperature of fluid in bags wrapped in ice packs was significantly lower compared to controls at all time points during the 120 minutes observation. The temperature increase from the bag to the level of intravenous cannula was significantly lower for <b>insulated</b> <b>tubing</b> at all infusion rates (median temperature differences between bag and intravenous cannula were: 8. 9, 4. 8, 4. 0, and 3. 1 °C, for non-insulated and 5. 9, 3. 05, 1. 1, and 0. 3 °C, for <b>insulated</b> <b>tubing,</b> at infusion rates 10, 30, 60, and 100 mL/minute, respectively).

To improve the injection steam enthalpy is the key technology in ultra-heavy oil thermal development. The wellbore heat insulation technology is {{needed to keep the}} process of steam injection hot enthalpy, to reduce heat loss utmost, to prevent the damage of the casings and cement mantle in high- temperature steam. The conventional cased-hole completions require the borehole thermally insulating insulation technology in thermal recovery, and generally adopt <b>insulated</b> <b>tubing</b> steam injection, ordinary tubing transfer pumping, which will cause frequent operations and enlarge the accidental risks caused by a number of down hole tools which are tripped in wellbore. Insulation casing well completion technology can effectively solve the wellbore insulation problems, and improve the casing and cement mantle security, increase the production rate. The field applications in Henan Oilfield have obtained excellent results; two wells were operated with completion technique by heat insulated casings. Compared with the same types of wells in the pilot test ultra-heavy oil block, the production is about twice as much as those of other wells, and the economic effect is obvious...|$|R

Due {{to the high}} {{viscosity}} of crude oil, formation cementation loose, sand production and reservoir water-sensitive, the pre-trial is less effective. The problem is the inefficiency of steam injection, poor oil-steam ratio, sand production serious, the poor pump efficiency and the abnormal productions. It is important to improve the mobility of heavy oil in the formation and wellbore for the development. According to the reservoir characteristics {{and the experience of}} the primary development, the measures which include the high-pressure gravel packing sand control, <b>insulated</b> <b>tubing</b> of steam injection, anti-swelling agent reservoir protection, formation and wellbore viscosity reducer and rod sucker-rod pumping system are carried out in a pilot test of the four wells. After the pilot test, the oil-steam ratio increases from 0. 08 to 0. 55, the average daily oil production increases from 0. 5 tons to 8. 0 tons. The pilot test has achieved great success and promoted the application in medium-deep heavy oil thermal recovery in the entire block, simultaneously provided the basis for the efficient development of other similar blocks...|$|R
40|$|Stores of {{body heat}} change daily, {{increasing}} with activity and meals, decreasing with sleep. They also decrease with strong cold exposure, as {{in cold water}} immersion. Body heat content (H,) change is known from the difference between metabolic heat (M) and heat loss (E a) {{over a period of}} time, as determined from indirect and direct calorimetry. Since direct calorimetry is uncommo ~ most people estimate AHb from change in body temperatures, but the constants for the predictive equations are in dispute. They have not been tested experimentally during intentional body cooling. We measured AH,, rectal temperature (T,) and mean skin temperature (TsJ during strong cooling and subsequent rewarming. METHODS Continuous direct and indirect calorimetry gave values for CQ and M during various cooling procedures. The direct calorimeter was an <b>insulated</b> <b>tubing</b> suit [6], where mass flow of water times temperature change across the suit, plus small terms for respiratory heat loss and heat transfer through the insulation summed to give EQ. The suit was also able to cool and rewarm. In one set of experiments the calori-meter was the bath calorimeter at the Defence Institute of Environmental Medicine [4].

In children, flow rates are greater than 6 L/min [1] and may be up to 20 to 30 L/min [15],[32], thus closer to 1 L/kg/min. FiO 2 is set to achieve target saturation between 92 % and 97 %.

40|$|AbstractThe {{field test}} of CO 2 -ECBM was carried during 2003 to 2007 {{in order to}} {{evaluate}} technical feasibility of injecting CO 2 into the coal seam while producing CH 4 at Yubari City, Hokkaido, Japan. It aims to resolve global warming {{and to develop a}} system for injection and sequestration of CO 2 into coal seams. The targeted coal seam is located about 900  m below the surface. The absolute pressure at the bottom hole is approximately 15. 5  MPa and the CO 2 temperature is about 28  ∘C before the injecting into the coal seam. Thus, CO 2 is injected in liquid phase to the coal seam and supercritical condition of CO 2 has not been satisfied due to heat loss along the deep injection well. Replacements of usual tubing pipes with thermal <b>insulated</b> <b>tubings</b> were applied, however the temperature at the bottom hole was still lower than the CO 2 critical temperature. The project had a problem about decreasing injection rate after starting injection CO 2. It was evaluated by analysing the field test data that the maximu m decreasing ratio of the coal seam permeability was 0. 065 and permeability around injection well was became 6 times larger than the original one. We assumed that its reason is caused with swelling of the coal seam around the injection well by liquid CO 2 injection. Present study has focused on the keeping supercritical CO 2 in the tubing because viscosity of supercritical CO 2 that is 40 % smaller than that of liquid CO 2. The CO 2 temperature has been successfully predicted in order to keep CO 2 in supercritical condition from the surface to the bottom for various CO 2 injection rates and electric heater power. The minimum injection rate has been presented in order to keep CO 2 in the supercritical condition at the bottom hole of the injection tubing. Injected CO 2 is expected to be super critical over 12  ton/day of injection rate without any heating in the tubing...|$|R

40|$|Tissue {{reactions}} to implantable pacemaker leads were investigated {{in an early}} infection model in rabbits. Both standard leads and surface-modified leads were used. The surface modification technique was applied to achieve controlled release of the antibiotic gentamicin. The <b>insulating</b> polyurethane <b>tubing</b> material of the leads was provided with an acrylic acid/acrylamide copolymer surface graft and then loaded with gentamicin. Implantation periods varied from day 4, to week 3 1 / 2, to week 10. We investigated tissue reactions {{in the absence of}} an infectious challenge and also the efficacy of surface-modified leads in preventing infection after challenge with Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. It was demonstrated that the applied surface modification did not induce adverse effects although during early postimplantation an increase in infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages and wound fluid and fibrin deposition were observed. After bacterial challenge, standard leads were heavily infected at each explantation period, denoted by abscesses, cellular debris, and bacterial colonies. Ln contrast, little or no infection was observed, either macroscopically or by bacterial cultures, with the surface-modified leads. Microscopy showed little evidence of the bacterial challenge, and that primarily at day 4. It was concluded that the applied surface modification demonstrated enhanced infection resistance and thus represents a sound approach to the battle against infectious complications with biomaterials.
