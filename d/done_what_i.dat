During his live performances of [...] "Biko", Gabriel frequently concluded asking the audience to engage in political action, saying [...] "I've <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can, the rest is up to you." [...] It was often the last song of a performance, with the band members gradually leaving the stage during the song's concluding drum solo.|$|E
500|$|Laucke took up snooker, {{and became}} {{competent}} enough by age thirteen {{to gain a}} job as a demonstrator for the Brunswick Corporation, a snooker table manufacturer. Laucke learned billiards from George Chenier, a fellow Montrealer and the North American snooker champion. The two faced each again four years later at the North American snooker championships in Montreal, where Laucke won the championship. Laucke recalled: [...] "Then I decided to leave snooker, I had <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do... My love for the guitar was overwhelming. There was a lot more money in snooker, but snooker was just a passion, and music was my love." [...] Laucke used his snooker winnings to finance 110trips from Montreal to New York City to study the classical guitar with Franco-Spaniard Rolando Valdés-Blain.|$|E

500|$|The rather later satirist Juvenal (born, probably, in the 50s CE) also {{provides}} {{evidence for the}} monkey, he even pities the monkey, at one point, as an innocent sufferer. Not so with how Emperor Nero was reviled. In one play, Juvenal suggests that for Nero, being put in merely one sack is not good enough. This might, for example, be a reference both {{to the death of}} Nero's mother Agrippina Minor, widely believed to have been murdered on Nero's orders, and also to how Nero murdered his fatherland. Not only Juvenal thought the sack was the standard by which the appropriate punishment for Nero should be measured; the statues of Nero were despoiled and vandalized, and according to the Roman historian Suetonius, one statue was draped in a sack given a placard that said [...] "I have <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could.

La Follette was outraged by Sawyer's proposal; the experience profoundly affected his nascent political career as, by his own lights: “Nothing else ever came into my life that exerted such a powerful influence upon me as that affair.

2500|$|It was {{an ideal}} subject {{for a young}} painter named Thomas Cole, who visited the Catskills in 1825 and stayed at the new hotel. Struck by its wildness and the many scenic views both from the Escarpment and of it, he took {{sketches}} of the area and returned several times to get more. The Catskills had been a subject of art since the 1730s, but the landscapes Cole eventually painted caused a sensation back in New York, with John Trumbull observing that Cole [...] "has <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have all my life attempted in vain". Other artists like Asher Durand and Frederick Church began following Cole up the Hudson, and their similarly styled Romantic renderings of the region, called the Hudson River school after a critic's derisive remark, became the young nation's first native art movement.|$|E

He was offered a {{contract}} with the club and opted to become a professional cricketer rather than take a sports science choice at university, which was his other option. Onions started in the team as the fourth bowler. Looking back on his early career, he felt that he tried too hard early on. On one occasion he recalled how [...] "I remember being thrown the ball at an important stage of a game at Scarborough, and Phil Jaques hit me for four successive fours. I was thinking 'I'm not sure I can do this.' But Dale Benkenstein was a huge influence as captain, and you have to learn from all those experiences. Otherwise I could not have <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did in my first season of Test cricket. I often went for 15 to 20 runs in my first three overs, but always came back strongly." [...] In 2006, Onions regularly opened the bowling for Durham with Ottis Gibson.|$|E

In an interview with The New Yorker magazine jazz critic Whitney Balliett, Powell said: [...] "I have decided that when I retire I will think through my decision to leave jazz – with the help of Freud and Jung. At the moment, I suspect it was this: I had <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> felt I had to do in jazz. I had decided it did not hold the deepest interest for me musically. And I had decided that it was a young man's music, even a black music. Also, the endless repetition of material in the Goodman band – playing the same tunes day after day and night after night – got to me. That repetition tended to kill spontaneity, which is the heart of jazz and which can give a lifetime's nourishment." ...|$|E
