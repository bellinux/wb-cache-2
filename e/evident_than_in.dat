5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> his financial policy. The {{question of whether}} Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of}} his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E

Such opinions were hardly unexpected though, as the Power were a dismal 6–34 the year prior. Even then {{most of the players}} inherited were good for little more than trade bait as the NPSL required that teams could field no more than four imports. Experienced players were very hard to come by, as not only had there not been any Canadian teams prior to provide a talent base, but there was another Canadian team entering the league that year, the Toronto Shooting Stars, and they had a head start on finding players.|$|E
500|$|As Cutt argues, [...] "the great {{overriding}} {{metaphor of}} all [...] {{work is the}} representation of divine order by the harmonious family relationship (inevitably set in its own pastoral Eden)[...] [...] No writer made it clearer to her readers that the child who is dutiful within his family is blessed {{in the sight of}} God; or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but the earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to the very throne of God." [...] Demers has referred to this [...] "consciously double vision" [...] as the quintessentially Romantic element of Sherwood's writing.

Drawing on Thompson's (1990) schema concerning the typical linguistic modes through which ideology operates, this research suggests that the operation of ideology is apparent within educational accounting texts, with particular strategies being more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> others: <b>in</b> particular, the strategies of universalization, narrativization, rationalization and naturalization. Given the predominantly technical nature of introductory financial accounting textbooks and training manuals, the modes of ideology identified in the texts were often quite subtle; more specifically, the ideological characteristics displayed in each of the six texts analysed were often expressions of implicit or taken-for-granted assumptions...|$|R
500|$|Façades {{of churches}} often came to {{resemble}} wedding cakes rather than {{places of worship}} as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles {{of a wide variety}} of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as [...] "either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque style more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Ragusa and Catania.|$|E

Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing [...] "'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war.... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence. So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war is omitted."

40|$|The {{collective}} entrepreneurship {{has proven}} to be fundamental in the context of sustainable rural tourism, a fact that motivated the development of this study in Paraná State, south region of Brazil, where there is a collective experience around tourism. Specifically, this study aims to: a) understand the process of collective entrepreneurship developed between tourism enterprises and b) analyze the possible contributions of collective entrepreneurship to strengthen the tourism entrepreneurs involved. Therefore, it was developed a qualitative and descriptive study. The data were obtained through interviews with the managers of collective initiative, and also from secondary data. The main results show that the collective experience in Paraná State around sustainable rural tourism reveals a pioneering initiative in the region, and the collective entrepreneurship is proved fundamental for triggering this process.

The building includes a number of modernist art commissions with works by Victor Pasmore. Fry and Drew took on a number of younger partners, and the practice eventually grew to a considerable size. However, in the view of The Timess obituarist, [...] "in these new circumstances his personal talent somehow became submerged, and the work of the firm that bore his name, though of acceptable quality, was not easy to distinguish from the competent modern work done by many other firms.

2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), the {{education}} system in China has been geared toward economic modernization. In 1985, the national government ceded responsibility for basic education to local governments through the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's [...] "Decision on the Reform of the Educational Structure." [...] In unveiling {{the education}} reform plan in May 1985, the authorities called for nine years of compulsory education and the establishment of the State Education Commission (created the following month). Official commitment to improved education was nowhere more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the substantial increase in funds for education in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986–90), which amounted to 72 percent more than funds allotted to education in the previous plan period (1981–85). In 1986 some 16.8 percent of the state budget was earmarked for education, compared with 10.4 percent in 1984. Since 1949, education has been a focus of controversy in China. As a result of continual intraparty realignments, official policy alternated between ideological imperatives and practical efforts to further national development. But ideology and pragmatism often have been incompatible. The Great Leap Forward (1958–60) and the Socialist Education Movement (1962–65) sought to end deeply rooted academic elitism, to narrow social and cultural gaps between workers and peasants and between urban and rural populations, and to eliminate the tendency of scholars and intellectuals to disdain manual labor. During the Cultural Revolution, universal fostering of social equality was an overriding priority.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the bold}} and prudent policy of a {{minister}} who {{felt he had}} {{the confidence of the}} country and was sustained by great parliamentary majorities; and when the summoner of monster meetings was convicted, and the efficient though impartial manner in which the labours of the land commission were simultaneously conducted came to be bruited about, there seemed at last some prospect of the system of political quackery of which Ireland had been so long the victim being at last subverted. But there is nothing in which the power of circumstances is more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> politics. They baffle the forethought of statesmen, and control even the apparently inflexible laws of national development and decay.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{election}} {{was held in}} 1936. It was hotly contested, with all parties converging into three coalitions: the leftist Popular Front, the right-winged [...] and a Centre coalition. In the end, the Popular Front won with a small edge in votes over the runner-up National Front, but achieved a solid majority due to the new electoral system introduced by the CEDA government hoping that they would get the edge in votes. The new Parliament then dismissed Alcalá-Zamora and installed Manuel Azaña in his place. During the third term, the extreme polarisation of the Spanish society was more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> ever <b>in</b> Parliament, with confrontation reaching the level of death threats. The already bad political and social climate created by the long term left-right confrontation worsened, and many right-wing rebellions were started. Then, in 1936, the Army's failed coup degenerated into the Spanish Civil War, {{putting an end to}} the Second Republic.|$|R

6000|$|THE INNER LIFE. A man's life is {{more than}} his work; his dream is ever greater than his achievement; and {{literature}} reflects not so much man's deed as the spirit which animates him; not the poor thing that he does, but rather the splendid thing that he ever hopes to do. In no place is this more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the age we are now studying. Those early sea kings were a marvelous mixture of savagery and sentiment, of rough living and of deep feeling, of splendid courage and the deep melancholy of men who know their limitations and have faced the unanswered problem of death. They were not simply fearless freebooters who harried every coast in their war galleys. If that were all, they would have no more history or literature than the Barbary pirates, of whom the same thing could be said. These strong fathers of ours were men of profound emotions. In all their fighting the love of an untarnished glory was uppermost; and under the warrior's savage exterior was hidden a great love of home and homely virtues, and a reverence for the one woman to whom he would presently return in triumph. So when the wolf hunt was over, or the desperate fight was won, these mighty men would gather in the banquet hall, and lay their weapons aside where the open fire would flash upon them, and there listen to the songs of Scop and Gleeman,--men who could put into adequate words the emotions and aspirations that all men feel but {{that only a few}} can ever express: ...|$|E
60|$|This {{combination}} of the widest kindness and consideration with a consistent ungraciousness of tone runs through all Shaw's ethical utterance, and is nowhere more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> his attitude towards animals. He would waste himself to a white-haired shadow to save a shark in an aquarium from inconvenience or to add any little comforts {{to the life of}} a carrion-crow. He would defy any laws or lose any friends to show mercy to the humblest beast or the most hidden bird. Yet I cannot recall in the whole of his works or in the whole of his conversation a single word of any tenderness or intimacy with any bird or beast. It was under the influence of this high and almost superhuman sense of duty that he became a vegetarian; and I seem to remember that when he was lying sick and near to death {{at the end of his}} Saturday Review career he wrote a fine fantastic article, declaring that his hearse ought to be drawn by all the animals that he had not eaten. Whenever that evil day comes there will be no need to fall back on the ranks of the brute creation; there will be no lack of men and women who owe him so much as to be glad to take the place of the animals; and the present writer for one will be glad to express his gratitude as an elephant. There is no doubt about the essential manhood and decency of Bernard Shaw's instincts in such matters. And quite apart from the vegetarian controversy, I do not doubt that the beasts also owe him much. But when we come to positive things (and passions are the only truly positive things) that obstinate doubt remains which remains after all eulogies of Shaw. That fixed fancy sticks to the mind; that Bernard Shaw is a vegetarian more because he dislikes dead beasts than because he likes live ones.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} youth prolongation in Brazilian and Spanish youngsters and the identity construction processes of these individuals. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 50 {{young men and women}} aged 25 to 29 years, half of them from Madrid/Spain and the other half from Fortaleza/Brazil. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, the speeches were organized with the Atlas-ti program through a semantic content analysis. We assume that the postponement of the thresholds of transition to adulthood leads to new experiences, discourses and meanings of "being young", creating a new ideal-typical model of "prolonged youth" and turning it into a possibility of identification for a significant group of young people. In Spain, the youth prolongation is a much more pronounced and <b>evident</b> phenomenon <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Brazil. However, the movement towards a youth prolongation, especially concerning the "feeling younger for longer" is also a trend among young Brazilians...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effect of {{cognitive}} behavioral therapy (CBT) in combination with systemic family therapy (SFT) on mild to moderate postpartum depression and sleep quality. Methods: 249 primiparous women with mild to moderate postpartum depression were recruited and randomly assigned to a control group (n= 128), which received conventional postpartum care, or to a psychological intervention group (n= 121), which received conventional postpartum care combined with psychological intervention. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were employed to evaluate depression and sleep quality, respectively. Results: 104 patients in the intervention group and 109 {{in the control group}} completed the study. After intervention, the EPDS score, PSQI score, sleep quality score, sleep latency score, sleep duration score, habitual sleep efficiency score, sleep disturbance score, and daytime dysfunction score were significantly lower in the intervention group <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the control group. The EPDS and PSQI scores of each group at different time points after intervention were markedly decreased compared with those before intervention, and the reduction in the intervention group was more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> the control group.
