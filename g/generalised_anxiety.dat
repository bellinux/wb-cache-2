25|$|In severe cases, the {{withdrawal}} reaction or protracted withdrawal may exacerbate or resemble serious psychiatric and medical conditions, such as mania, schizophrenia, agitated depression, panic disorder, <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder, and complex partial seizures and, especially at high doses, seizure disorders.

Pre-existing disorder or other causes typically do not improve, whereas symptoms of protracted withdrawal gradually improve over the ensuing months. For this reason at least six months should have elapsed after benzodiazepines cessation before re-evaluating the symptoms and updating a diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the recognition of facial expressions in patients with a <b>generalised</b> social <b>anxiety</b> disorder. It is well documented that in different psychiatric disorders (e. g., depression, schizophrenia) patients may show an altered processing of emotions. However, in <b>generalised</b> social <b>anxiety,</b> emotion recognition has not been studied. Methods. 24 Patients with <b>generalised</b> social <b>anxiety</b> disorder and 26 healthy controls, matched on age, education, and sex were included. The task entailed the emotional labelling of faces with different facial expressions (happiness, fear, disgust, sadness, surprise, anger) presented in different intensities. Subjects were asked to make a forced-choice response. Results. These revealed that patients with a <b>generalised</b> social <b>anxiety</b> disorder were less sensitive for the negative facial expressions of anger and disgust compared to the control group. Conclusions. This deficit could play a role in the development and/or the maintaining of the social anxiety. Both explanations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is {{to examine the relationship between}} generalised and relationship-specific attachment anxiety and avoidance and anger arousal, anger cognition and overt and covert aggression in males, females, and in young male violent offenders. Methods: Five studies are presented. One hundred and nine males, 123 females, and twenty-nine violent male offenders participated in {{this research}}. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess attachment style, anger, and aggression. Data were analysed by using correlation, multiple regression, and quantitative case studies. Results: The studies presented in this thesis are the first to explore attachment from a generalised paradigm in the context of anger and aggression and also in the context of anger mediation. Results indicate that <b>generalised</b> attachment <b>anxiety</b> is a significant correlate of anger and aggression in both male and female non-offenders. Results also indicate that <b>generalised</b> attachment <b>anxiety</b> is more related to anger and aggression in male and female non-offenders than generalised attachment avoidance. These findings also provide evidence for the role of anger as a mediator between generalise...|$|R
40|$|Impairments in {{emotional}} intelligence (EI) {{have been found}} in individuals with high general and social anxiety; however, no studies have examined this relationship in a clinically depressed population. Thirty-one patients (11 male, 20 female) with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of a major affective disorder and 28 non-clinical controls (5 male, 23 female) completed self-report instruments assessing EI, depression and social anxiety. Compared to a control group, the clinical group scored lower on the EI dimensions of Emotional Recognition and Expression, Understanding Emotions, Emotional Management, and Emotional Control. Regression analyses revealed Emotional Control {{was a significant predictor of}} interaction, performance, and <b>generalised</b> social <b>anxiety.</b> Self-report measures of EI may have predictive value in terms of early identification of those at risk of developing social anxiety and depression.

2500|$|Dysthymia has {{a number}} of typical characteristics: low energy and drive, low self-esteem, and a low {{capacity}} for pleasure in everyday life. [...] Mild degrees of dysthymia may result in people withdrawing from stress and avoiding opportunities for failure. [...] In more severe cases of dysthymia, people may even withdraw from daily activities. [...] They will usually find little pleasure in usual activities and pastimes. Diagnosis of dysthymia can be difficult because of the subtle nature of the symptoms and patients can often hide them in social situations, making it challenging for others to detect symptoms. [...] Additionally, dysthymia often occurs {{at the same time as}} other psychological disorders, which adds a level of complexity in determining the presence of dysthymia, particularly because there is often an overlap in the symptoms of disorders. [...] There is a high incidence of comorbid illness in those with dysthymia. Suicidal behavior is also a particular problem with persons with dysthymia. It is vital to look for signs of major depression, panic disorder, <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder, alcohol and substance misuse and personality disorder.|$|E
40|$|<b>Generalised</b> social <b>anxiety</b> {{disorder}} (GSAD) is {{an anxiety}} disorder characterised by intense fear {{in social situations}} causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function {{in at least some}} parts of daily life. Individuals with GSAD exhibit heightened brain activation in response to social emotional cues conveying threat (e. g., fearful/angry faces) in brain areas critical for emotion processing including the amygdala. Very little is known about brain response to negative, but not ‘threatening’, cues which may involve a wider brain network including the cortex. Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide synthesised in the hypothalamus and exerts its physiological effects by binding to oxytocin receptors (OXT-R) found to limbic and cortical areas. In humans, OXT decreases anxiety and stress, facilitates social encounters, and attenuates brain reactivity (i. e., including the amygdala) to threatening cues in healthy controls. This thesis examined the effects of OXT on fear-related amygdala and non-threat related cortical reactivity to social cues in patients with GSAD and matched healthy control (CON) participants in two experimental studies. Eighteen GSAD and 18 CON individuals participated in the study. The study utilised a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design, with two acute treatment conditions including intranasal OXT and placebo administrations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine brain activation in response to processing social facial cues using an emotional face matching task (study 1) and emotional face recognition task (study 2) following OXT or placebo administration. In study 1, both the CON and GSAD groups activated bilateral amygdala to all emotional faces during placebo, with the GSAD group exhibiting hyperactivity specifically to fearful faces in bilateral amygdala compared with the CON group. OXT had no effect on amygdala activity to emotional faces in the CON group, but attenuated the heightened amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in the GSAD group, such that the hyperactivity observed during the placebo session was no longer evident following OXT (i. e., normalisation). In study 2, the GSAD group relative to the CON group, exhibited heightened activity to sad faces in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), i. e., brodmann area (BA) 10, extending into anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), i. e., BA 32, during placebo. Oxytocin suppressed the heightened activation in the MPFC/ACC regions in the GSAD group to levels {{similar to that of the}} CON group. The findings of this thesis suggest that OXT has specific effect on fear-related amygdala activity, and non-threat (i. e., sad) related cortical activity, particularly when these areas are hyperactive as observed in individuals with GSAD. The modulation by OXT was specific to negative threat and non-threat related social cues as no effects were observed on brain response to processing happy social cues. These findings provide a brain-based mechanism of the impact of OXT in modulating the exaggerated processing of negative social signals in individuals with pathological anxiety, thereby justifying future long-term treatment studies to investigate the effects of OXT on clinical symptoms of social anxiety...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundIn four {{previous}} studies, we have delineated {{the role}} of positive circuit coupling between the dorsal medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex and the amygdala during aversive processing in healthy people under stress. This translational circuit—the aversive amplification circuit—is thought to drive adaptive, harm-avoidant behaviour in threatening environments. We assess {{the role of}} this circuit in the pathological manifestation of anxiety disorders. MethodsFor this single-site study, 45 unmedicated participants (22 with <b>generalised</b> and/or social <b>anxiety</b> disorder and 23 healthy controls) were recruited via advertisements from the metropolitan area of Washington, DC (USA). People who applied {{to participate in the}} study had to pass an initial telephone screen and comprehensive screening by a clinician at the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA). People with a contraindicated medical disorder, past or current psychiatric disorders other than anxiety disorders, and those using psychoactive medications or illicit drugs were excluded. Eligible individuals could participate as either a healthy control or a patient, depending on diagnosis. They were asked to use a button box to complete a simple emotion identification task (fearful vs happy faces; 44 trials of each) during functional MRI at the NIH. Functional imaging analysis consisted of event-related activation analysis and psychophysiological interaction connectivity analysis of regions coupled with the amygdala during task performance. FindingsA diagnosis-by-valence interaction was recorded in whole-brain amygdala connectivity within the dorsal medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex clusters identified in our previous study, driven by significantly increased circuit coupling during processing of fearful faces versus happy faces in anxious, but not healthy, participants. Importantly, and in accordance with contemporary theoretical approaches to psychiatry, circuit coupling correlated positively with self-reported anxious symptoms, which provides evidence of a continuous association between the circuit and subjective symptoms. InterpretationIn this study and our previous work, we track the functional role of one neural circuit from its involvement in adaptive threat biases under stress, to its chronic engagement in anxiety disorders in the absence of experimentally induced stress. Thus, we uniquely map a mood and anxiety-related circuit across its adaptive and maladaptive stages. Clinically, this study could provide a step towards a more mechanistic continuum-based approach to anxiety disorder diagnosis and might ultimately lead to more targeted treatments for patients with anxiety disorders.

He analysed {{the results of his}} survey according to multiple characteristics including sex, age and occupation, and concluded with a chapter outlining a plan for better modern writing using a form of italic script. Writing in the New Scientist, Gail Vines placed Piggott's research and the public's enthusiasm for the project in the context of rapid social and technological change in the 1950s that resulted in a moral panic about declining standards of penmanship that reflected a <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> about threats to standards in a changing world.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{possibly}} {{because of its}} action on melatonin receptors, agomelatine appears to improve sleep quality, with no reported daytime drowsiness. Agomelatine has demonstrated anxiolytic properties in rodents. It has been found significantly more effective than placebo {{in the treatment of}} <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder. There is tentative evidence to suggest the efficacy of agomelatine as either a monotherapy or adjunct in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A case report documenting the efficacy of agomelatine in the treatment of social anxiety disorder has been published. An open-label study has found agomelatine to be efficacious in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder. Open-label studies have suggested efficacy of adjunctive agomelatine in bipolar depression. A study in mice found that it protected against pentylenetetrazole- and pilocarpine-induced seizures. A small placebo-controlled trial found some benefit of agomelatine in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A 2015 review suggested no recommendations of Agomelatine in support of, or against, its use to treat individuals with seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
5000|$|Metacognitive therapy (MCT) is a {{psychological}} [...] "talking therapy" [...] {{for the treatment}} of mental illness. It was created by Adrian Wells based on an information processing model by Wells and Matthews. It is supported by scientific evidence from a large number of studies. The goals of MCT are to first discover what patients believe about their own thoughts and how their mind works (called metacognitive beliefs), then show the patient how these beliefs lead to unhelpful responses to thoughts that serve to unintentionally prolong or worsen symptoms, and finally to provide alternative ways of responding to thoughts in order to allow a reduction of symptoms. In clinical practice, MCT is most commonly used for treating anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder, <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder (GAD), health anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as depression - though the model was designed to be transdiagnostic (meaning it focuses on common psychological factors thought to maintain all psychological disorders).|$|E
5000|$|Dysthymia has {{a number}} of typical characteristics: low energy and drive, low self-esteem, and a low {{capacity}} for pleasure in everyday life. Mild degrees of dysthymia may result in people withdrawing from stress and avoiding opportunities for failure. In more severe cases of dysthymia, people may even withdraw from daily activities. [...] They will usually find little pleasure in usual activities and pastimes. Diagnosis of dysthymia can be difficult because of the subtle nature of the symptoms and patients can often hide them in social situations, making it challenging for others to detect symptoms. Additionally, dysthymia often occurs {{at the same time as}} other psychological disorders, which adds a level of complexity in determining the presence of dysthymia, particularly because there is often an overlap in the symptoms of disorders. [...] There is a high incidence of comorbid illness in those with dysthymia. Suicidal behavior is also a particular problem with persons with dysthymia. It is vital to look for signs of major depression, panic disorder, <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder, alcohol and substance misuse and personality disorder.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{studies have}} {{addressed}} the relationship between <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder and cardiovascular prognosis using a diagnostic interview. AIMS: To assess the association between <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder and adverse outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction. METHOD: Patients with acute myocardial infarction (n = 438) were recruited between 1997 and 2000 and were followed up until 2007. Current <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder and post-myocardial infarction depression were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The end-point consisted of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related readmissions. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 198 patients had an adverse event. <b>Generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder was {{associated with an increased}} rate of adverse events after adjustment for age and gender (hazard ratio: 1. 94; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 14 - 3. 30; P = 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{there is}} {{substantial}} concern about negative attitudes to mental illness, {{little is known about}} the stigma associated with <b>Generalised</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Disorder (GAD) or its measurement. The aim of this study was to develop a multi-item measure of <b>Generalised</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Disorder stigma (the GASS). Methods Stigma items were developed from a thematic analysis of web-based text about the stigma associated with GAD. Six hundred and seventeen members of the public completed a survey comprising the resulting 20 stigma items and measures designed to evaluate construct validity. Follow-up data were collected for a subset of the participants (n = 212). Results The factor structure comprised two components: Personal Stigma (views about <b>Generalised</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Disorder); and Perceived Stigma (views about the beliefs of most others in the community). There was evidence of good construct validity and reliability for each of the <b>Generalised</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Stigma Scale (GASS) subscales. Conclusions The GASS is a promising brief measure of the stigma associated with <b>Generalised</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Disorder. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests that individuals who experience a <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder present a limited {{quality of life and}} diminished occupational performance levels, a term embedded within occupational therapy theory. As <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder {{is considered one of the}} more common mental health conditions within the UK, one would expect a vast amount of research to be available on the topic. However, this is not the case. The {{literature suggests}} that cognitive behavioural therapy is widely associated with the treatment of <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder and many occupational therapists do implement this approach, although, there is limited research identified. The literature also identifies that the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy and the principles of occupational therapy resonate each other. This paper therefore seeks to explore the benefits of occupational therapists using cognitive behavioural therapy with patients who experience a <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder. Attention will be paid to the relationship between occupational therapy and <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder, the effectiveness of occupational therapy intervention, the relationship between cognitive behavioural therapy and occupational therapy and the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy with patients who experience a <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder. Due to the lack of quantitative research available in relation to the topic, a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design is proposed to address the research topic. This involves dividing the participants into an intervention group (were participants will receive cognitive behavioural therapy) and a control group (were participants will not receive cognitive behavioural therapy). The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale will be used to measure the occupational performance levels and anxiety levels post cognitive behavioral therapy intervention. This will therefore enable the author to assess the benefits of occupational therapists using cognitive behavioural therapy with patients who experience a <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder...|$|E
40|$|Background A {{prognosis}} serves important {{functions for}} the management of common mental disorders in primary care. Aims To establish the accuracy of the general practitioner's (GP) prognosis. Method The agreement between GP prognosis and observed course was determined for 138 cases of ICD- 10 depression and 65 of <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder, identified among consecutive attenders of 18 GPs. Results Modest agreement between GP prognosis and course was found, both for depression (kappa = 0. 21) and <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> (kappa = 0. 11). Better agreement (kappa = 0. 45 for depression, and kappa = 0. 33 for <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety)</b> was observed between the course and predictions from a statistical model based on information potentially available to the GP at the time the prognosis was made. This model assesses attainable performance for GPs. Conclusions General practitioners do a fair job in predicting the 1 -year course of depression and <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Even so, their performance falls significantly short of attainable performance.

40|$|Search {{strategy}} and selection criteria <b>Generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder is a persistent and common disorder, {{in which the}} patient has unfocused worry and anxiety that is not connected to recent stressful events, although it can be aggravated by certain situations. This disorder is twice as common in women {{than it is in}} men. <b>Generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder is characterised by feelings of threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, and tension, and symptoms such as palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. These symptoms are recognised as part of the anxiety syndrome rather than independent complaints. The symptoms overlap greatly with those of other common mental disorders and we could regard the disorder as part of a spectrum of mood and related disorders rather than an independent disorder. <b>Generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder has a relapsing course, and intervention rarely results in complete resolution of symptoms, but in the short term and medium term, effective treatments include psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy; self-help approaches based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles; and pharmacological treatments, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
