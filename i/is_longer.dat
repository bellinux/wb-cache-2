30|$|However, trips {{need to be}} {{analysed}} in connection, in trip chains. The single {{trips are}} not isolated entities.

Looking at daily car trip chains, only 8  % <b>are</b> <b>longer</b> than 80  km and only 4  % of them <b>are</b> <b>longer</b> than 120  km.

5|$|The {{heads of}} the workers and queens are as long as broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with {{thirteen}} known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> than it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is {{as long as it}} is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological differences that separate the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and thorax, M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle <b>is</b> <b>longer.</b> The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown.|$|E
5|$|The ride is {{considered}} to be a terrain roller coaster, meaning the ride experiences various elevation changes. Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> than the first. It drops through Thunderbolt's structure, which is located at the bottom of a hill in a ravine.|$|E
5|$|The tail, {{according}} to Schwartz, <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> {{than in the}} potto. He does not provide measurements of the tail of AMZ 6698 and notes {{that at least one}} vertebra is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 caudal vertebrae in an illustration of AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of caudal vertebrae ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the potto, though {{according to}} Stump the tail of Pseudopotto <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> than any seen in pottos. The false potto allegedly has shorter spines on its cervical (neck) and first and second thoracic (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false potto differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a bifid (two-tipped) spine on the second cervical vertebra, but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 potto specimens he examined.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E

5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It is a light buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> than in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Artemis Fowl: The Graphic Novel is {{a graphic}} novel {{based on the}} book. Written by Colfer and adapted by Andrew Donkin, the graphic novel was {{released}} on 2 October 2007. The plot remains {{the same as the}} book's except some minor details. Some characters' appearances differed from their description in the book; Holly Short's hair <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> than described in the book and a darker brown, as opposed to the reddish brown described in the book. Haven City's roof is stalactites and rock as opposed to the computer-generated sky described by the book. The graphic novel does not contain many word balloons, showing each character's story in first-person. Graphic novels for subsequent books in the series were released in 2009, 2013, and 2014.|$|E
5|$|For {{patients}} who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts {{with an initial}} fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> (two weeks) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet {{for at least three}} months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.|$|E

Its rostrum <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> than that of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is smooth, as are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E
5|$|Phantom's Revenge (formerly {{known as}} Steel Phantom) is a steel roller coaster at Kennywood. When {{it opened in}} 1991, it was the fastest roller coaster and had the longest drop of any roller coaster in the world. The ride was {{originally}} manufactured by Arrow Dynamics. After the 2000 season, D.H. Morgan Manufacturing {{was brought in to}} renovate the ride, most notably to remove the four inversions. Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop through Thunderbolt's structure <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> than its first drop.|$|E
5|$|State-run junior lyceums {{and area}} {{secondary}} schools are single-sex. Junior lyceums {{are divided into}} two grade stages. The first stage is an introductory stage, and runs {{for the first two}} years of secondary schooling. Students study essentially the same subjects with very limited curriculum options in order to provide a good grounding for future studies. Following the two-year introductory cycle, a three-year specialist stage occurs during which students study a common core curriculum as well as a number of elective subjects. This orientation is similar at area secondary schools, although the introductory period <b>is</b> <b>longer,</b> at three years in duration, and the final specialist period is shorter, at two years. The staff-student ratio is set at 1:11, and the school leaving age is 16.|$|E
