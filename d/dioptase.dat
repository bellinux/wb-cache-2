50|$|<b>Dioptase</b> is an {{uncommon}} mineral found mostly in desert regions where it forms as a secondary mineral in the oxidized zone of copper sulfide mineral deposits. However, {{the process of}} its formation is not simple, the oxidation of copper sulfides should be insufficient to crystallize <b>dioptase</b> as silica is normally minutely soluble in water except at highly alkaline pH. The oxidation of sulfides will generate highly acidic fluids rich in sulfuric acid that should suppress silica solubility. However, in dry climates and with enough time, especially in areas of a mineral deposit where acids are buffered by carbonate, minute quantities of silica may react with dissolved copper forming <b>dioptase</b> and chrysocolla.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dioptase</b> is {{an intense}} emerald-green to bluish-green copper cyclosilicate mineral. It is {{transparent}} to translucent. Its luster is vitreous to sub-adamantine. Its formula is CuSiO3·H2O (also reported as CuSiO2(OH)2). It has a hardness of 5, {{the same as}} tooth enamel. Its specific gravity is 3.28-3.35, and it has two perfect and one very good cleavage directions. Additionally, <b>dioptase</b> is very fragile and specimens must be handled with great care. It is a trigonal mineral, forming 6-sided crystals that are terminated by rhombohedra.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs in}} the {{oxidized}} zone of ore deposits and is associated with <b>dioptase,</b> wulfenite, hemihedrite, phoenicochroite, duftite, mimetite, shattuckite, chrysocolla, hemimorphite, willemite and fluorite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dioptase</b> {{was used}} to {{highlight}} {{the edges of the}} eyes on the three Pre-Pottery Neolithic B lime plaster statues discovered at 'Ain Ghazal known as Micah, Heifa and Noah. These sculptures date back to about 7200 BC.|$|E
5000|$|It {{occurs as}} an {{oxidation}} product of hydrothermal lead-bearing veins. Associated minerals include <b>dioptase,</b> fornacite, wulfenite, mimetite, cerussite and diaboleite. [...] It was first described in 1970 for an occurrence in the Sebarz Mine, northeast of Anarak, Iran.|$|E

Associated minerals are descloizite, duftite, mimetite, wulfenite, cerussite, azurite and <b>dioptase.</b>|$|E
50|$|Paramelaconite is a {{very rare}} mineral; many {{specimens}} purported as such are in fact mixtures of cuprite and tenorite. Paramelaconite forms as a secondary mineral in hydrothermal deposits of copper. It occurs in association with atacamite, chrysocolla, connellite, cuprite, <b>dioptase,</b> goethite, malachite, plancheite, and tenorite.

5000|$|... `Ain Ghazal {{is renowned}} for a [...] set of {{anthropomorphic}} statues found buried in pits {{in the vicinity}} of some special buildings that may have had ritual functions. These statues are half-size human figures modeled in white plaster around a core of bundled twigs. The figures have painted clothes, hair, and in some cases, ornamental tattoos or body paint. The eyes are created using cowrie shells with a bitumen pupil and <b>dioptase</b> highlighting.In all, 32 of those plaster figures were found in two caches, 15 of them full figures, 15 busts, and 2 fragmentary heads.

5000|$|Late in the 18th century, copper miners at the Altyn-Tyube (Altyn-Tube) mine, Karagandy Province, Kazakhstan {{thought they}} found the emerald deposit of their dreams. They found fantastic {{cavities}} in quartz veins in a limestone, filled with thousands of lustrous emerald-green transparent crystals. The crystals were dispatched to Moscow, Russia for analysis. However the mineral's inferior hardness of 5 compared with emerald's greater hardness of 8 easily distinguished it. Later Fr. René Just Haüy (the famed French mineralogist) in 1797 determined that the enigmatic Altyn-Tyube mineral was new to science and named it <b>dioptase</b> (Greek, dia, [...] "through" [...] and optos, [...] "visible"), alluding to the mineral's two cleavage directions that are visible inside unbroken crystals.|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} a few studies on the thermal {{decomposition}} of <b>dioptase</b> Cu 6 [Si 6 O 18]· 6 H 2 O. The results of these analyses are somewhat conflicting and the conclusions vary among these thermo-analytical studies. The objective of this research is to report the thermal analysis of <b>dioptase</b> from different origins and to show the mechanism of decomposition. Thermal decomposition occurs over a very wide temperature range from around 400 °C to 730 °C with the loss of water. Two additional mass loss steps are observed at around 793 and 835 °C with loss of oxygen. The infrared spectra of <b>dioptase</b> in the hydroxyl stretching region enables the hydrogen bond distances of water molecules in the <b>dioptase</b> structure to be calculated. The large variation in the hydrogen bond distances offers an explanation as to why the decomposition of <b>dioptase</b> with loss of water occurs over such a wide temperature range...|$|E
30|$|Various specializations of {{the remote}} {{connector}} may be envisioned, notably for interfacing the <b>Dioptase</b> middleware with other data stream management systems, sensor networks (e.g., a CoAP connector) [15] or existing services (e.g., a meteorological database).

30|$|In this paper, we {{presented}} <b>Dioptase,</b> a middleware that aims at simplifying building complex mashups {{based on the}} multiple data sources of the WoT. <b>Dioptase</b> {{makes it possible to}} integrate Things, even averagely powerful ones, with the Web and enables them to produce, process and store data streams dynamically. Each Thing, and by extension the entire network, is then seen as a consistent entity, dedicated to the (complex) processing of sensed data, and able to dynamically run tasks written in a DSL called DiSPL. This language aims to be simple, but flexible enough to describe such advanced operations and, for interoperability concerns, we plan to write converters from state-of-the-art stream processing languages like SPL [54] or C-SPARQL [60]. We demonstrated that the <b>Dioptase</b> middleware can avoid the systematic use of centralized or partially centralized infrastructures, which are commonly used in WSAN-based DSMSs. In addition, we have shown that <b>Dioptase</b> is efficient enough to be deployed on average Things w.r.t. the IoT/WoT needs and use cases, and enables these Things to be integrated in the Web despite the additional complexity of data streaming communication.|$|E
30|$|As {{detailed}} in the following, <b>Dioptase</b> makes it possible: (i) {{to integrate the}} Things with today’s Web by exposing sensors and actuators as Web services, (ii) to manage physical data as streams, and (iii) to use any Thing as a generic pool of resources that can process streams by running tasks that are provided by developers over time. The rest {{of this paper is}} organized as follows: Section 1 first discusses the role of proxies in WSANs and reviews related work in the area of streaming solutions for WSANs and IoT/WoT, highlighting required capabilities for data streaming middleware in the future IoT/WoT context. Section 1 then presents the <b>Dioptase</b> application model for the WoT, which allows the design of mashupsa that compose the streams flowing in the WoT. Following, Section 1 describes the architectural design of the <b>Dioptase</b> middleware together with its implementation, while Section 1 provides an evaluation of <b>Dioptase</b> for both average and smart Things. Finally, Section 1 draws some conclusions and sketches our perspectives for future work.|$|E

3000|$|According to the {{literature}} [5],[32],[46], a stream is a sequence of discrete items that are linked by some properties (e.g., same source, same type, time coupling, etc.). The size of this sequence is theoretically infinite {{and it is not}} possible to know its end a priori. In <b>Dioptase,</b> each stream item is a tuple associated with a timestamp that can be explicit, if generated with the tuple, or implicit, if defined when the tuple is received [5],[32],[46]. Then, as for relations in relational databases, a <b>Dioptase</b> stream adheres to a schema that defines the attributes of each tuple. In addition, the <b>Dioptase</b> schema is intended to take into account semantic aspects of the sensed data and the characteristics of the data source. In practice, the schema is composed of: [...]...|$|E
30|$|<b>Dioptase</b> {{features}} a customizable middleware architecture that is versatile {{enough to be}} deployed on a large class of Things that vary significantly in terms of resource availability (e.g., sensors, smartphones or plug computers), provided these Things are able to communicate directly through the Internet infrastructure (typically the average Things that use 6 LoWPAN) [15]. Unlike WSAN-based DSMSs that target specific sensor networks, <b>Dioptase</b> enable developers {{to use the same}} middleware on moderately powerful sensors (e.g. Sun SPOT), smartphones, personal computers, servers and the cloud.|$|E
40|$|The green mineral <b>dioptase</b> Cu 6 Si 6 O 18 (H 2 O) 6 {{has been}} known since centuries and plays an {{important}} role in esoteric doctrines. In particular, the green <b>dioptase</b> is supposed to grant the skill to speak with trees and to understand the language of birds. Armed with natural samples of <b>dioptase,</b> we were able to unravel the magnetic nature of the mineral (presumably with hidden support from birds and trees) and show that strong quantum fluctuations can be realized in an essentially framework-type spin lattice of coupled chains, thus neither frustration nor low-dimensionality are prerequisites. We present a microscopic magnetic model for the green <b>dioptase.</b> Based on full-potential DFT calculations, we find two relevant couplings in this system: an antiferromagnetic coupling J_c, forming spiral chains along the hexagonal c axis, and an inter-chain ferromagnetic coupling J_d within structural Cu 2 O 6 dimers. To refine the J_c and J_d values and to confirm the proposed spin model, we perform quantum Monte-Carlo simulations for the <b>dioptase</b> spin lattice. The derived magnetic susceptibility, the magnetic ground state, and the sublattice magnetization are in remarkably good agreement with the experimental data. The refined model parameters are J_c = 78 K and J_d = - 37 K with J_d/J_c ~ - 0. 5. Despite the apparent three-dimensional features of the spin lattice and the lack of frustration, strong quantum fluctuations in the system are evidenced by a broad maximum in the magnetic susceptibility, a reduced value of the Neel temperature T_N ~ 15 K >> J_c, and a low value of the sublattice magnetization m = 0. 55 Bohr magneton. All these features should be ascribed to the low coordination number of 3 that outbalances the three-dimensional nature of the spin lattice.

30|$|Consequently, in our opinion, {{centralized}} intermediaries (proxies, surrogates, cloudlets and the cloud) {{should be}} leveraged primarily for heavy computation, while in-network processing should be favored for common and simple tasks (filtering, merging, etc.) {{as well as}} for complex tasks when powerful/specialized enough Things are available. To this end, <b>Dioptase</b> is intended to avoid reliance on those intermediaries whenever possible, by running on devices that support 6 LoWPAN or IPv 6 and communicate directly with the Internet. Nevertheless, in cases where intermediaries are needed, <b>Dioptase</b> can be deployed on them and run as a middleware layer for deploying tasks dynamically and managing data streams.|$|E
30|$|From a {{technical}} perspective, {{the flexibility of}} <b>Dioptase</b> {{is based on a}} lightweight domain-specific language (DSL) designed to express continuous processing tasks. The DSL syntax is specifically optimized to be interpreted on the huge number of average Things that are more powerful than small sensors but very limited compared to smart Things. This mechanism enables the dynamic deployment of tasks in isolated sandboxes which are naturally safer than arbitrary binary-code deployment [16],[17]. As a benefit, developers can build applications composed of tasks deployed in the network at any time, using standard Web services. To achieve this, <b>Dioptase</b> features relevant optimizations of Web technologies (small Web server, subset of protocols, compression, etc.) and leverages advanced stream management techniques (in-network processing, approximation and dynamic reconfiguration).|$|E
