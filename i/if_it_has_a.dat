5|$|In Manitoba, a {{city is a}} type {{of urban}} municipality. The Municipal Act {{stipulates}} that an urban municipality can only be named a city <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> minimum population of 7,500 residents.|$|E
5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is {{of the opinion that}} the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|A town can {{be created}} from a village or resort village by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 52 of The Municipalities Act <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{population}} of 500 or more. Upon reaching a population of 5,000, a town's council may request the minister to change its status to a city in accordance with section 39 of The Cities Act. Should a town's population decline to less than 500, its council may request its status be reverted to village or resort village status.|$|E

5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported {{that only a small}} number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time of the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> role.|$|E
5|$|In Manitoba, {{an urban}} {{municipality}} may be named a town upon formation. Other than the requirements to incorporate as an urban municipality (1,000 residents and 400 people/km2), the Municipal Act has no minimum population threshold {{to limit the}} naming of them as towns. A town can alternately be named a village or urban municipality under the Municipal Act or a city <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> minimum population of 7,500.|$|E
5|$|Many factors {{affect the}} write {{amplification}} of an SSD. The table below lists the primary factors {{and how they}} affect the write amplification. For factors that are variable, the table notes <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> direct relationship or an inverse relationship. For example, {{as the amount of}} over-provisioning increases, the write amplification decreases (inverse relationship). If the factor is a toggle (enabled or disabled) function then it has either a positive or negative relationship.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the {{organisation}} responsible for assessing the conservation status of species. A species is assessed as subject to varying levels of threat <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> small, fragmented or declining range, or if the total population is less than 10,000 mature individuals, or if numbers have dropped rapidly (by more than 10% in ten years or three generations). None of the three Delichon species meets these criteria, and three genus house martins are therefore considered of least concern.|$|E

Every finitely generated abelian group or nilpotent group is polycyclic.|$|E

25|$|A {{subspace}} W of V that is invariant {{under the}} group action {{is called a}} subrepresentation. If V has exactly two subrepresentations, namely the zero-dimensional subspace and V itself, then the representation {{is said to be}} irreducible; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> proper subrepresentation of nonzero dimension, the representation is said to be reducible. The representation of dimension zero is considered to be neither reducible nor irreducible, just like the number 1 is considered to be neither composite nor prime.|$|E
25|$|A {{symmetric}} operator A {{is always}} closable; that is, {{the closure of}} the graph of A is the graph of an operator. A symmetric operator is said to be essentially self-adjoint if the closure of A is self-adjoint. Equivalently, A is essentially self-adjoint <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> unique self-adjoint extension. In practical terms, having an essentially self-adjoint operator is almost as good as having a self-adjoint operator, since we merely need to take the closure to obtain self-adjoint operator.|$|E
