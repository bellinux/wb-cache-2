500|$|... "Mr. Monk <b>Gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Shrink" [...] {{was written}} by Hy Conrad and {{directed}} by Andrei Belgrader. The idea of hiding the crucial piece of evidence in a vacuum bag {{had been on the}} writing table for years at the time that this episode was written. The writers' problem was that they could not get a realistic idea on how to use it. One idea had actually been to have a killer hack up his victim, place the dismembered limbs into a self-cleaning oven, then vacuum out the remains and have the bag filled with the victim. The writers saw this possibility as too gruesome for the show. Other ideas had included hiding something valuable in the bag and having the killer stalk Monk while trying to recover it.|$|E

500|$|The episode's plotline {{revolves}} around homosexuality—the third time for The Simpsons. The first was season eight's [...] "Homer's Phobia", {{and the second}} was [...] "Three Gays of the Condo" [...] from season fourteen, both of which won Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program. This time it centered on the right for homosexuals {{to get married and}} the coming-out of a character. In the episode, Homer is shown as being tolerant with homosexuality, whereas in [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] he is portrayed as being strongly homophobic. In that episode, the Simpson family <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> friend that Homer dissociates himself from after finding out that he is gay. He also fears that the friend will have a negative influence on Bart and decides to ensure Bart's heterosexuality by taking him to do manly things such as hunting. As James Delingpole of The Daily Telegraph writes, it was first after [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] that Homer began to be portrayed as enlightened about homosexuality. Marge, on the other hand, who had previously been portrayed as supportive of gay people on the show, is seen as disapproving of her sister's sexual orientation.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Hilson {{lounging}} in her bed. Upset by her partner, she {{walks over to}} the closet and rips down all of his clothes.

The women then march down Auburn Avenue before they head home to throw their men's clothes off the balcony. The video received mixed to positive reviews. Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy was positive and called it a [...] "beautifully shot portrait of a woman {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown", and The Fader writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd regarded it as an accurate representation of how women act when they are [...] "wronged by dudes". On the other hand, Robbie Daw of Idolator deemed it tiresome, calling it a [...] "visual snoozefest".

500|$|In {{the script}} for the pilot, [...] "Mr. Monk and the Candidate", Monk is {{described}} as being [...] "a modern day Sherlock Holmes", only [...] "nuts". In the introductory scene of the episode, he is examining the scene of Nicole Vasques' murder, and picks up several important clues, but frequently interrupts himself to wonder aloud whether he left his stove on {{when he left the}} house that morning.

The strongest of these phobias are: germs, dentists, sharp or pointed objects, milk, vomiting, death and dead things, snakes, crowds, heights, fear, mushrooms, and small spaces, as Monk also mentions in the season 2 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Very Very Old Man". In addition, new phobias develop at seemingly random intervals, such as a temporary fear of blankets {{at the end of the}} season 5 episode [...] "Mr. Monk <b>Gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Shrink". Though it is impossible to determine his strongest phobia, there does appear to be some form of hierarchy between them: in the series finale [...] "Mr. Monk and the End", it is made clear that his fear of vomiting is greater than his fear of death. He has also stated, [...] "Snakes trump heights!".|$|E
