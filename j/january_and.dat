30|$|During {{the lava}} {{accumulation}} stage, 42, 600 and 11, 000 ton/day were observed respectively on <b>January</b> 28 <b>and</b> 30. For flux variation during the lava accumulation stage, OMI data {{were used to}} support the estimation. A large SO 2 plume related to Shinmoedake volcano was visible on OMI images of <b>January</b> 28 <b>and</b> 29. In contrast, the SO 2 plumes in the OMI images on <b>January</b> 30 <b>and</b> 31 were weak. Therefore, we inferred that the fluxes on <b>January</b> 29 <b>and</b> 31 {{were the same as}} those observed on Jan. 28 and 30, respectively, and estimated the flux of <b>January</b> 28 <b>and</b> 29 as 40, 000 ton/day <b>and</b> of <b>January</b> 30 <b>and</b> 31 as 11, 000 ton/day (Fig. 2 (b)).|$|R
