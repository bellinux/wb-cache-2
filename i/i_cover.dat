The song was included in the score of the 1933 film <b>I</b> <b>Cover</b> the Waterfront. Louis Armstrong, Joe Haymes, Eddy Duchin and composer Green all made recordings of the song in 1933, and Haymes's and Duchin's versions made the pop charts. Billie Holiday recorded the song many times during her career. Art Tatum recorded it as a solo piano piece in 1949 and returned to it several times.|$|E
2500|$|As it was, Twain {{was glad}} to welcome Kipling and had a two-hour {{conversation}} with him on trends in Anglo-American literature and about what Twain was going to write in a sequel to Tom Sawyer, with Twain assuring Kipling that a sequel was coming; {{but he had not}} decided upon the ending: either Sawyer would be elected to Congress or would be hanged. Twain also passed along the literary advice that an author should: [...] "Get your facts first and then you can distort 'em as much as you please." [...] Twain, who rather liked Kipling, later wrote about their meeting: [...] "Between us, we cover all knowledge; he covers all that can be known and <b>I</b> <b>cover</b> the rest". Kipling then crossed the Atlantic and reached Liverpool in October 1889. He soon made his début in the London literary world—to great acclaim.|$|E

Now if <b>I</b> <b>cover</b> the person, <b>I</b> <b>cover</b> scabs and sores, and ulcers, and all blemishes. Hence God, by putting this righteousness upon us, is said to hide and cover our sins. 'Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin' (Rom 4:7,8). For since this righteousness is Christ's, and counted or {{reckoned}} ours by the grace of God, it is therefore bestowed upon us, not because we are, but to make us righteous before the face of God. Hence, as I said, it is said to make us righteous, even as gay clothes do make a naked body fine. 'He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.' ...|$|E
