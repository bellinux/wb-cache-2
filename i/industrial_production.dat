5|$|According to {{historian}} Zbyněk Zeman, broadcasting {{became the}} most important medium for propaganda throughout the war. Posters were also used domestically and leaflets were dropped behind enemy lines by air-ship. In regions conquered by Germany, citizens could be punished by death for listening to foreign broadcasts. Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and <b>industrial</b> <b>production.</b> Soviet posters also focused on <b>industrial</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{small amount}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> {{involves}} wet chemical processes, which start with aqueous solutions of zinc salts, from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated. The solid precipitate is then calcined at temperatures around 800°C.|$|E

5|$|The Allied naval bombardments {{disrupted}} <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> in {{the cities}} targeted, and convinced many Japanese civilians {{that the war was}} lost. Up to 1,739 Japanese were killed in the attacks, and as many as 1,497 were wounded. The only Allied casualties were 32 prisoners of war, who were killed in the bombardments of Kamaishi.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union, despite {{enormous}} {{human and}} material losses, also experienced {{rapid increase in}} production in the immediate post-war era. Japan experienced incredibly rapid economic growth, {{becoming one of the}} most powerful economies in the world by the 1980s.

50|$|<b>Industrial</b> {{livestock}} <b>production</b> or intensive animal farming employs large-scale, principally landless systems. The {{animals are}} separated from the land where their feed is produced, and their environment is highly controlled by management interventions. Since {{a vast majority of}} consumers demand low-cost products, <b>industrial</b> livestock <b>production</b> has become common. However, there are several issues with <b>industrial</b> livestock <b>production</b> systems including disease, antibiotic use and ethical animal treatment. Living in densely packed cages or small spaces makes animals more prone to disease transmission from one animal to another.|$|R

5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would be {{expected}} that chlorine {{should be able to}} oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> of chlorine.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the famine, an increase in <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared {{in the latter part of}} this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.|$|E
5|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>production</b> {{is mainly}} from steam {{reforming}} natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>production</b> of {{selenium}} {{usually involves}} {{the extraction of}} selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide, which is mixed with water and acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.|$|E

5|$|The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was an {{organisation}} of 6 European countries set {{up after}} World War II to regulate their <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> under a centralised authority.

5|$|The General Government {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} a German general who was {{accountable}} to the Army. After a brief tenure by Colmar von der Goltz in 1914, command was held by Moritz von Bissing and later, from April 1917, by Ludwig von Falkenhausen. The German authorities aimed to use the occupation to benefit the German economy and <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> but hoped to keep the Belgian state and economy functioning if it did not impede their main objectives.|$|E

5|$|As a governor, Rodríguez Saá {{attracted}} huge {{investments to}} the province, {{which led to}} the growth of local industries, public works, social services and tourism. Levels of employment and <b>industrial</b> <b>production,</b> as well as measures of scholastic achievement and crime-fighting success were higher than those of the country at large. He was a populist and authoritarian governor who was accused of nepotism, corruption and restricting freedom of the press.

5|$|As {{part of the}} Soviet Union, the Armenian SSR {{transformed}} from a largely agricultural hinterland to an important <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian Genocide survivors and their descendants. On August 23, 1990, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in the Soviet Union until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991. Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. After {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, the state of the post-Union Republic of Armenia existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995.|$|E
