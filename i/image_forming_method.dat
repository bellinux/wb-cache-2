40|$|Computed {{laminography}} (CL) is an <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> <b>method</b> of X-ray {{testing that}} yields images of object slices {{by a simple}} linear translation of the object relative to the tube-detector system. No relative movement of the X-ray tube to the detector is needed and in contrast to classical laminography all object layers {{can be obtained by}} one scan. Moreover CL turns out to be equivalent to a computed tomography (CT) with a limited angular region, which allows the reconstruction of object slices using slightly modified CT algorithms, resulting in higher resolution compared with simple tomosynthesis in the case of classical laminography...|$|E

In this study, the factors affecting the quality of digital prints are analyzed, {{and a set of}} digital prints noise detection system, test charts and evaluation methods are established by decoding the formation mechanism of the noise. Experiments showed that the noise had been affected by the type of paper, the <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> <b>method</b> of digital printing, the toner particles closely related in particular. As a result, this study can be used to select and optimize the printing’s outputting resolution to ensure printing quality based on subjective and objective evaluation of digital prints’ noise...|$|E
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe drop-picture method {{according}} to Th. Schwenk is an <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> <b>method</b> that pictures differentiated proportions in {{flow in the}} water. Every water sample results in a characteristic series of drop- pictures, expressing its quality. This quality is determined both by {{physical and chemical properties}} as by immaterial properties. The method aims to increase insight in those quality aspects that cannot be measured with conventional analysing methods. The method is very sensitive: physical and chemical disturbances easily change the pictures. Therefore experiments should be done carefully under precisely defined circumstances. Also planet-constellations have {{to be taken into account}} when fixing timings for experiments. Of great importance is the observation of the morphology of the drop-pictures, for example the diversity in form-differentiation of the pictures or of form-development in a series of pictures. The form-development of destillated water is used as standard or reference. For characterization and interpretation of the pictures it is essential to have any sense for the organic nature of water. This organic nature cannot be explained with the conventional mechanical, physical or chemical laws. It is expressed by forms of movement in water, which appear to correspond in appearance, origin and development with forms of organs and organisms. An appropriate method which helps in an organic approach of phenomenons is the goetheanic phenomenology. With this method drop-pictures can be characterized and related to a life- transferring capacity of water...|$|E

Using of image approach to foreign territory management practice is already producing positive effects, {{but there are some}} difficulties in Russia, particularly in the Far East. Authors explore scientific publications in a foreign press, describing various marketing techniques used to territorial <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> in foreign countries. The territorial image is its image {{from the point of view}} of different public groups. Favorable territorial image is a powerful way of working with mass consciousness. Territorial <b>image</b> can be <b>formed</b> by various marketing techniques. This article presents the results of a preliminary study of scientific publications of materials in the past three years, selected for content analysis in foreign databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. This study was conducted by a traditional analysis of documents. Its aim was the selection of publications describing the use different marketing techniques of territorial <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> in foreign countries and their grouping according to the technology used and the time period. The analysis has revealed the relationship between using individual technologies of territorial <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> and territorial life cycle stages. Based on these results authors suggested the following algorithm for successful image formation of Russian Far East regions: 1) diagnosis of region life cycle stage; 2) assessment of the current image of region; 3) assessment of image parameters corresponding to region life cycle stage and consumers’ needs; 4) using of <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> marketing technologies. Directions for further research of the author of this work are: modeling of interrelation between the territorial life cycle stage and <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> factors; diagnosis of Russian Far East regions life cycle stages; assessment of the current images of Russian Far East regions; development of <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> strategies for Russian Far East regions...|$|R

40|$|We show that, {{when the}} <b>images</b> <b>formed,</b> the frontal {{part of the}} Shroud of Turin laid on a body in the same {{position}} as when the blood stains formed by contact. In other words, after the Shroud was laid on top of a body, no forceful flattening occurred before the <b>images</b> <b>formed.</b> Moreover, the argument that {{the top half of the}} Shroud could not have been draping a real body when the <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> – to avoid prominent image distortions – is shown to be incorrect. If a cloth is appropriately laid on the front part of a body, and a body <b>image</b> <b>forms</b> by a vertical projection on the cloth, no major image distortions occur. Small image distortions are to be expected, and indeed we can observe some on the Shroud. These two aspects – the Shroud was not forcefully flattened before the <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> and no major image distortions occur due to the way the Shroud was laid on the body – give the simplest scenario for the formation of the images. There is no need to claim a special event that would have flattened the Shroud before the <b>images</b> <b>formed.</b> Our analysis is based on precise length measurements on digital images, the blood stain locations, and geometry.

40|$|We {{present an}} unusual <b>image</b> <b>form</b> of the GaAs(110) surface {{observed}} in cross-sectional {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} in UHV. It clearly shows the zig-zag row formed between the cations and anions in the top row of the GaAs(110) surface, as well as traces of the bottom row that lies between the top rows. It thereby closely resembles the true atomic lattice usually depicted by ball-and-stick models. We interpret the occurrence of this <b>image</b> <b>form</b> {{in terms of a}} chemical bond that forms between the apex of the tip and the nearest Ga atom in the top row of the sample surface. The formation of such a bond has recently been predicted theoretically.

40|$|If an {{optically}} active (chiral) {{sample is}} placed in a microscope and illuminated with circularly polarized light, an <b>image</b> can be <b>formed</b> that {{is related to the}} circular dichroism of each feature of the sample.

The sign and magnitude of each feature in a circular differential image strongly depend on the structure of the sample.

Applications of circular differential imaging may include clinical fingerprinting of normal and transformed cells and structural analysis of individual cellular components...|$|R
