40|$|Three-dimensional {{modelling}} is {{an attempt}} to represent the world in three dimensions, simplifying through deliberate assumptions. In archaeology, this has developed {{as an extension of the}} traditional use of three-dimensional drawings to help present and record data. The debate in the archaeological literature over whether surface or <b>solid</b> <b>modellers</b> should be used is one based on the premise that the purpose of three-dimensional modelling is data visualisation. This concentration on perception modelling has been at the expense of research on the modelling of structure. Surface and <b>Solid</b> <b>Modellers</b> are introduced and defined. I argue that developments in modelling software mean that there is no longer a clear distinction between the two types of software along application lines. We should think of models in terms of their applications rather than the software which generates them. Although data visualisation (including virtual reality) is an important part of three-dimensional modelling, I argue that it should be explicitly divorced from the related field of photo-realism at a research level. Perception modelling can be performed by surface or <b>solid</b> <b>modellers.</b> Modelling structure is better performed with a <b>solid</b> <b>modeller,</b> if we wish to be as explicit as possible in our modelling. A structural model can be used as a spatial database. If we wish to ask questions about the physical properties of a structure, then we must use <b>solid</b> <b>modellers.</b> In addition to the engineering properties of structures, <b>solid</b> <b>modellers</b> can also be used to answer questions about the economics of construction. For historical reasons, the construction industry has preferred to use surface modellers, but I argue for the advantages of solid modelling in the archaeological study of construction. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a hybrid system which endeavours to recognize machining features automatically from a boundary representation (b-rep) -based <b>solid</b> <b>modeller.</b> The graph-based approach and the volume approach are adopted in consecutive stages in a prototype feature recognition system {{to combine the}} positive aspects of both strategies. The graph-based approach is based on feature edge sequence (FES) graph, a new graph structure introduced in this system. The FES graph approach is used to extract primitive features from the three-dimensional solid model; and the volume decomposition approach is incorporated to generate multiple interpretations of the feature sets. In addition, a neural network (NN) -based technique is used to tackle the problem of nonorthogonal and arbitrary features. Using the hybrid system, a workpiece designed in b-rep <b>solid</b> <b>modeller</b> will be interpreted and represented by a set of primitive features attached with significant manufacturing parameters, including multiple interpretations, tool directions and machining sequences, etc. The overall hybrid system is able to transform a pure geometric model into a machining feature-based model which is directly applicable for downstream manufacturing applications. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{range of}} {{operations}} on solids supported by current geometric modelling systems is very limited. Typically, solids represented in a modeller {{can be transformed}} by rigid motions and combined by Boolean operations. This paper introduces another family of transformations, called solid offsetting, which map solids into solids. Offset solids are expanded or contracted versions of an original object. Offsetting operations are potentially useful for tolerance analysis, clearance testing, design-rule checking in VLSI, modelling of etching and coating processes, cutter path generation for numerically-controlled machine tools, collision free path planning for robot motions, and for constant-radius rounding and filleting ('blending') of solids.
