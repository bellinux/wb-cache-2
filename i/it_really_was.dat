5|$|After Morta's {{death in}} 1262, Mindaugas took her sister (name unknown) {{as his wife}} despite her being married to Daumantas. This cruel act {{motivated}} Daumantas to become an ally of Treniota and assassinate Mindaugas {{with two of his}} sons. Treniota was Mindaugas' nephew. It is believed that he was son of Duke of Samogitia, either Vykintas or Erdvilas. If <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> Vykintas, then there was a double marriage: Vykintas' sister married Dausprungas and Dausprungas' (and Mindaugas') sister married Vykintas. Erdvilas is mentioned only once in the 1219 treaty. The other nephew, Lengvenis, played a role in Lithuanian state in 1242–1260.|$|E
5|$|After the Fountain is {{destroyed}} and the Circle defeated, Sahin returns to Turkey, and Lizzie, {{with all her}} Spanish gold sunk {{to the bottom of}} the lake, leaves for the Caribbean: however, it is ambiguously stated that she and Morgan reunited several years later and a romance eventually blossomed between them, implying that she was the mother of Morgan's children, making her also an ancestor of all future Blacks featured in the campaign. Morgan is last seen wondering about the significance of the Fountain and whether <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> the Fountain of Youth, and is seen refilling his empty canteen from the water of the lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> a goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 9, 1981, and ended on January 29, 1982. The Wrath of Khan was more action-oriented than its predecessor, but less costly to make. The project was supervised by Paramount's television unit {{rather than its}} theatrical division. Bennett, a respected television veteran, made The Wrath of Khan on a budget of $11million—far less than The Motion Pictures $46million. The budget was initially lower at $8.5 million, but it rose when the producers were impressed by {{the first two weeks}} of footage. Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy, a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> To present the illusion that the Enterprises elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed. Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned phaser and communicator, were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{was still}} {{in the midst of the}} War of the Austrian Succession and most of the British army was in Flanders and Germany, leaving an inexperienced army of about 4,000 in Scotland under Sir John Cope. His force marched north into the Highlands but, believing the rebel force to be {{stronger}} than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was,</b> avoided an engagement with the Jacobites at the Pass of Corryairack and withdrew northwards to Inverness.|$|E
25|$|During {{the war and}} {{for many}} years afterward, the FBI {{maintained}} a fictionalized {{version of the story}} in which it had preempted and caught the saboteurs solely by its own investigations and had even infiltrated the German government. This story was useful during the war to discourage the Germans by making the FBI seem more invincible than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> and perhaps afterward to similarly mislead the Soviets; but it also served Hoover in his efforts to maintain a superhero-style image for the FBI in American minds.|$|E

25|$|A long tram line, about 17 versts (18 kilometres) long, {{was laid}} from the Poshtova Square in the Podil neighbourhood, over the Dnieper on the Nicholas Bridge, through the Peredmostna and Nikolska Slobodka neighbourhoods, {{and to the}} {{neighbouring}} town of Brovary. The line was used until the mid-1930s, and was a one-way line with side-skirts for oncoming trams to drive into. This had made the trip even longer than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> The cost was 35 kopecks, {{a fair amount of}} money at the time. Nevertheless, the trams were always packed with passengers.|$|E
25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And then my mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> an extraordinary time.|$|E
25|$|The {{forensics}} reinforced this theory. On {{a record}} player atop the stack was a thumb-shaped bloodstain. It had no print, suggesting whoever left it was wearing gloves to avoid leaving identification. But {{the blood was}} Rasmussen's, suggesting the equipment had been stacked after the struggle and shooting. They had been left behind, the detectives realized, to make the crime look like something other than what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> From the four bound volumes of the case file they developed a list of five women who might be suspects. Nuttall was taken aback when Ruetten told him over the phone that Lazarus was a police officer. By then, Lazarus had been promoted {{to a higher level}} of detective, and was working art theft cases as part of the elite Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD).|$|E

25|$|On March 4, 2007, Hansbrough had 26 {{points and}} 17 rebounds before {{suffering}} an injury that looked worse than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> {{in the closing}} seconds of the Tar Heels' 86–72 win over Duke, clinching the top seed in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. With 14.5 {{seconds left in the}} game, Hansbrough leaped for a layup. After the ball left his hand, he was struck in the face by Gerald Henderson's right elbow. The errant elbow broke Hansbrough's nose. Henderson was ejected from the game and received an automatic one-game suspension from the NCAA. Hansbrough went on to play with a nose-guard/face mask through the postseason, before taking it off {{in the second half of}} a game against Michigan State, in the second round of the 2007 NCAA tournament.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prolific}} fish such as herrings and sardines are abundant in given waters {{only in their}} season so keeping them for use out of season required salting or smoking them. This permitted their sale in inland markets too but fresh fish tasted better so long as <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> fresh. There was therefore a premium on fresh fish in this top end of the market. The medieval chasse-marée merchants catered to this originally by carrying fish in pairs of baskets on pack ponies, as far as possible, overnight. They rushed la marée (the batch from a particular landing) to market but the distance coverable before the fish deteriorated was limited. Another problem was that every lord through whose manor the road led wanted his toll so that if the road was too long, the enterprise became less economic.|$|E
25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

500|$|Raymond Benson {{considered}} the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil. This crystallised in Goldfinger with the Saint George motif, which is stated explicitly in the book: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> St George and the dragon. And St George had better {{get a move on}} and do something"; Black notes that the image of St. George is an English, rather than British personification.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the war, the garrisoned {{army was}} {{supported}} by the women of the town; they aided in the building of the earthen fortifications, and then later disguised themselves as men during the siege to make it appear that the town was held by more troops than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> They also ran ammunition around the town and helped to reload the weapons. Their efforts drew comparisons to Joan of Arc, and an essay was written by James Strong detailing their achievements, entitled [...] "Joanereidos, or Feminine Valour eminently discovered in West County Women, at the Siege of Lyme, 1644." ...|$|E
500|$|As with Ladenson's {{observation}} that Bond was being depicted as [...] "the worthy knight", Raymond Benson also identifies the Saint George theme in Goldfinger, {{which he says}} has run in all the novels, but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond's thoughts after Goldfinger reveals he will use an atomic device to open the vault: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> St George and the dragon. And St. George had better {{get a move on}} and do something". Jeremy Black notes that the image of the [...] "latter-day St. George [...] again an English, rather than British image." ...|$|E

500|$|According to The Irish Times, [...] "Flame & Citron {{has sparked}} an emotive public debate in Denmark that has drawn {{all sorts of}} pseudo-experts out of the {{woodwork}} to debate the portrayal of the period and the two true-life figures". Madsen defended himself saying it was an interpretation that [...] "though it may not correspond absolutely to reality, is somehow more true". Mikkelsen stressed that they were the first [...] "to do the original research, yet we suddenly had a lot of so-called experts telling us how <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> and how we were wrong". The actor affirmed not too much is known about the period and they hope it sparks the debate so [...] "people will research and think some more about it".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{helped to}} {{elaborate}} the backstory of The Smoking Man, the series' chief antagonist. William B. Davis, {{the actor who}} played the character, later noted, [...] "As the story developed, we developed a relationship between Cigarette-Smoking Man and Mulder's apparent father, and Cigarette-Smoking Man and Mulder's mother; then we started backfilling with an historical connection." [...] Carter explained that the episode {{was the start of}} the series' greater conspiracy: [...] "It's an interesting development because <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> the development of the conspiracy. The elements of the conspiracy were part of his development. But [...] back story, of course, intertwined with Mulder's." [...] Actor Chris Owens reprised his role as The Smoking Man; he had previously played him in the season's earlier episode [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man".|$|E
500|$|Mistakenly {{assuming}} {{their ground}} speed to be faster than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was,</b> the crew may have deduced {{that they had}} already safely crossed the Andes, and so commenced their descent to Santiago, whereas in fact they were still a considerable distance to the east-north-east and were approaching the cloud-shrouded Tupungato Glacier at high speed. Some BSAA pilots, however, have expressed scepticism at this theory; convinced that Cook would not have started his descent without a positive indication that he had crossed the mountains, they have suggested that strong winds may have brought down the craft in some other way. One of the pilots recalled that [...] "we had all been warned not to enter cloud over the mountains as the turbulence and icing posed too great a threat." ...|$|E
