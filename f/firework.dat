50|$|Liuyang <b>fireworks</b> have {{a history}} of more than 1,400 years. During the Northern Song Dynasty, Liuyang <b>fireworks</b> prospered greatly. During the Qing Dynasty (in 1723), Liuyang <b>fireworks</b> served as tribute. Since 1875, Liuyang <b>fireworks</b> have been {{exported}} to Japan, Korea, India, Iran, the UK, United States, Russia, etc. In the 1990s, Liuyang's <b>fireworks</b> were the area's biggest export. However, in 1998, Liuyang <b>fireworks</b> went through a bottleneck period because of technological deficiencies. Since 1998, Liuyang has been reforming its industry. It is currently undergoing industrial consolidation and the upgrading of technology. Liuyang sets a ban on more than 10 thousand illegal factories, and Liuyang sets a standard {{to ensure the safety of}} <b>fireworks</b> production. Liuyang cooperates with some institutions of higher education and research institutes to invent <b>fireworks</b> with better technology and safety. On 8 August 2001, Liuyang <b>fireworks</b> went public in Shanghai. In 2003, Liuyang succeeded in getting a <b>fireworks</b> display project in Brazil. Liuyang has invested more than 1 million dollars to buy lands in Brazil to build <b>fireworks</b> factories. There are more than 30 <b>fireworks</b> companies in Liuyang.|$|R

30|$|The <b>fireworks</b> {{algorithm}} is a parallel explosive optimization algorithm proposed by Tan Ying, {{inspired by the}} natural <b>fireworks</b> exploding behavior [20]. In the <b>fireworks</b> algorithm, the sparks generated by <b>fireworks</b> and their explosions and mutations resemble feasible solutions, and the explosion process simulates the process of optimizing in the current feasible solution domain [25, 26]. In nature, high-quality <b>fireworks</b> explosions produce more and more sparks, while the inferior <b>fireworks</b> explosions produce much fewer sparks. The <b>fireworks</b> algorithm follows the natural rules: the fitness value is good, the <b>fireworks</b> quality is excellent, the explosion range is small, and the sparks generated are in large quantity. On the other hand, when the fitness value is not good, the <b>fireworks</b> quality is inferior, the explosion range is large, and the sparks generated are limited [1, 20, 21, 27]. The <b>fireworks</b> algorithm includes explosive sparks, mutation sparks, mapping rules, selection strategies, and other elements [20].|$|R

5|$|For many years, revellers {{celebrating the}} New Year have {{gathered}} in the square {{despite a lack of}} celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a <b>firework</b> display centred on the London Eye and South Bank of the Thames has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity Unicef, who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to large public displays, people often buy {{small amounts of}} <b>fireworks</b> for their own celebrations. <b>Fireworks</b> on general sale are usually less powerful than professional <b>fireworks.</b> Types include firecrackers, rockets, cakes (multishot aerial <b>fireworks)</b> and smoke balls.|$|R

The long-promised restoration of the Scenic Railway had not happened and the Water Chute had closed. In August 1980, Wadbrooke was given notice to close down the park by 26October 1980 and to have all his equipment removed by February 1981.|$|E

50|$|It {{is illegal}} in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for {{residents}} {{of the state to}} have <b>fireworks</b> and it is illegal to sell <b>fireworks</b> in Pennsylvania to a resident, however, it is legal to sell <b>fireworks</b> to non-residents of Pennsylvania who are buying them to take them out of the state, thus a number of <b>fireworks</b> stores in Pennsylvania operate to sell <b>fireworks</b> only to non-residents, who must show an out-of-state license.|$|R
50|$|In the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland {{there are}} many <b>fireworks</b> displays, during the Halloween season. The largest are in the cities of Belfast, Derry, and Dublin.

50|$|Consumer <b>fireworks</b> can be {{used with}} a variety of tools. One set of tools has to do with basic ignition, such as lighters, matches, and punks also known as a 'port fire'. By using a rack, one can ignite a series of {{different}} <b>fireworks</b> to create a scene. These sometimes allow for the finales seen at professional <b>fireworks</b> displays to be created using consumer <b>fireworks.</b> Racks {{can be used}} with multiple types of <b>fireworks,</b> such as aerial shells, fountains, Roman candles, and the newest class of <b>fireworks,</b> 500 gram repeaters. Other tools are involved with the setup of <b>fireworks</b> for later display, such as shovels, various hand tools, and spare visco fuses. The true scope of tools used with consumer <b>fireworks</b> is limited only by the displayer's imagination.|$|R
