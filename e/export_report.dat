50|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} barrier to resolving debates over gun {{policy is the}} lack of comprehensive data. Although the UN Arms Register tries to keep track of major weapons holdings, there is no global reporting system for small arms. Gathering data for Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) can be difficult, considering the transparency of some countries and lack of an organized system within countries. However, as pointed out by the Small Arms Survey, in the past ten years twenty-nine countries have made available a national arms <b>export</b> <b>report.</b> Twenty-five of these countries being European, while only four countries being non-European which include Australia, Canada, South Africa and the United States. While some countries make information available about the small arms of their armed forces and law enforcement agencies; others release estimated data on public ownership. Most refuse to release anything, release rough estimates or simply do not know. Fortunately, to address these issues, the Small Arms Survey's contributors have devised a transparency barometer allowing them to consider each country's cooperation and credibility on shared information.|$|E

40|$|Millions {{of people}} are killed or wounded by small arms each year. The {{aim of this study}} is to enhance our {{understanding}} of “missing” arms trade across countries. We proceed in two steps. First, we measure the extent of missing arms trade on the basis of official trade statistics. We construct a measure of the gap in arms trade based on the discrepancy between the value of arms <b>exports</b> <b>reported</b> by the <b>exporting</b> country and the value of arms imports recorded by the importing country. Second, we uncover the link between refugee movements and missing arms trade. Refugee flows, by reducing the ability of the receiving country to patrol its borders and its customs, are found to be correlated with arms smuggling across the border into the importing country. A series of robustness checks confirm the above findings. international trade, refugees, arms, customs. ...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the format}} {{established}} in Small Arms Survey 2004, this chapter provides an annual update of the authorized trade in small arms and light weapons. It looks in detail {{at the major}} reported exporters and importers, their trading partners, {{and the types of}} small arms exchanged. As in previous years, our understanding of the trade remains partial, for several reasons. Data on exports and imports is still limited for certain countries and certain types of small arms; it is at times difficult to interpret, so that many contradictions remain; and there is a time lag in reporting (for many of the calculations in this chapter, we have had to rely on data covering 2002). The Small Arms Trade Transparency Barometer, introduced in Small Arms Survey 2004, is therefore an important tool for assessing and promoting transparency. This chapter contains an update of the Barometer, taking into account the evolution of national small arms <b>export</b> <b>reporting</b> in 2004. peer-reviewe...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the Dominican economy is the Free Trade Zone industry (FTZ), which made up U.S. $4.55 billion in Dominican exports for 2006 (70% of total <b>exports).</b> <b>Reports</b> show, however, that the FTZs lost approximately 60,000 between 2005 and 2007 and suffered a 4% decrease in total exports in 2006. The textiles sector experienced an approximate 17% drop in exports {{due in part to the}} appreciation of the Dominican peso against the dollar, Asian competition following expiration of the quotas of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, and a government-mandated increase in salaries, which should have occurred in 2005 but was postponed to January 2006. Lost Dominican business was captured by firms in Central America and Asia. The tobacco, jewelry, medical, and pharmaceutical sectors in the FTZs all reported increases for 2006, which somewhat offset textile and garment losses. Industry experts from the FTZs expected that entry into force of the CAFTA-DR agreement will promote substantial growth in the FTZ sector for 2007.|$|R
