5000|$|Szilard Kato {{was born}} and raised in Pecs, the {{daughter}} of a prominent local physician, where she went to the University to earn her degrees. She moved to Budapest after age 21 where she met and married to Laub (later the family changed the name to Lomb) Frigyes an engineer from a prominent family of electrical engineers. She became interested in other languages as a young adult, while in the family's bomb shelter, as the Russian troops were advancing on Budapest. She was quoted by the family, having said the following: [...] "Kids, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Russian now...". She managed to acquire a Russian typewriter and started learning the language. This single step started her on the road for a long and illustrious career in languages. As the Russian occupation unfolded, she served for a period of time as the translator for the Russian Commander for Budapest. In later years she became a professional interpreter, she acquired high levels of proficiency in 17 languages, without extended stays in the country where the languages were spoken. I interviewed Dr. Lomb (her PhD was in Chemistry) in depth ten years ago in Budapest. She attributed her success to massive amounts of comprehensible input, mostly through recreational reading. She was personally very interested in grammar and linguistics, but felt it played a small role in language acquisition, loved dictionaries but looked up words when she read only if the word re-appeared several times and she still did not understand it, and hated to be corrected: [...] "Error correction makes you sick to your stomach." ...|$|E
5000|$|... ‘You’re {{not very}} good at it, are you?’ said Gust, ‘they ought to have sent heavies in.’ He thought the man very likely could have got a job playing Hess in this new TV series they were doing on the war, and he would have had a word with a few {{directors}} he knew in Soho if he had been a mate of his. But, as he wasn’t, Gust kicked him in the stomach as he tried to drag himself up on one leg {{with the help of the}} bar-rail, then turned back to the other man. ‘You all right?’ he said. ‘How are you feeling now? Chipper?’ He took one of the man’s ears in his thumb and forefinger; the ear was tiny, considering the size of his head, and it had little hairs inside it. Gust picked up a cocktail stick out of a dirty glass on the bar and jabbed it down into the eardrum as far as he could; when he pulled it out the stick was half-way red, and there was some grey stuff in it as well. He shouted down his ear: ‘I think I just broke your foot!’ but the man wasn’t making sense any more; he was wailing with his hand clapped to the side of his head, swaying up and down from the waist like a bereaved widow, or else perhaps he just didn’t hear, or maybe the music was too loud. Gust realised then that he had pushed the stick in too far and that the man would probably die. Dirty cocktail-stick in the brain? What a bleeding way to go! Now the man with the broken leg tried another naughty stroke; although he only had one hand free because he was using the other one to hold onto the rail, he still managed to smash a glass and try putting it in Gust’s face. ‘This is just self-defence after all,’ Gust said to himself. He stamped on the man’s feet again; this time he definitely felt bones go and the man screamed, dropped the glass and let go of the rail; but instead of letting him fall Gust took him round the waist, ripped his fly open and searched inside his pants until he found his testicles, which he yanked right out into his hand. Their owner can’t have been much into baths because they smelled like something tepid from a canteen counter. Gust wrung them like the devil having a go at a set of wedding bells with all the grip he had, until the man was shrieking on the same D minor as the music. ‘It’s nothing personal,’ said Gust, ‘but I’m afraid you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to fuck all over again.’ He wiped the blood off the man’s prick down his face, then pulled the face towards him and drove his nose into his brain with his head. The music boosted into E major on a key change, and the man doubled up under a bar-stool, leaving a lot of blood behind him while Gust receded into the half darkness towards the black drapes on the walls. —Brand New Dead, pp. 86-87 ...|$|E

40|$|I {{am going}} to make several {{unrelated}} points, and then I {{am going to}} discuss how we got into this financial crisis and some needed changes {{to reduce the risk}} of future crises. Some Observations First, we should close down as promptly as possible Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There never was a reason for those two institu-tions, other than to avoid the congressional budget process. The ben-efit that people got from Fannie and Freddie came from the subsidy to the mortgage interest rate. Congress could have passed that sub-sidy over and over again. They avoided passing it by taking the pro-gram off budget. That led to a benefit to members of Congress who participated in the profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It is an example of bad government policy. Second, looking ahead, the debt of the United States as a share of GDP is going to go from 40 percent to at least 60 percent. If you look at Japan, Italy, or Belgium, that doesn’t seem like a startling number. The difference is that much of that debt is owed to foreigners. Looking ahead, get used to the idea that we’re going to have to export more and probably see consumption grow at a slower rate. After years of rising expenditure on consumption in the United States, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to tighten our belts a bit. That’s not going to be an easy thing to do politically; woe to the president who presides over that period...|$|E
40|$|The aim of Bachelor’s thesis “Public Relations within Web 2. 0 Environment” was {{to analyze}} how is public {{relations}} is done Web 2. 0 in environment. The {{first part of}} this thesis focused on the theoretical literature concerning Web 2. 0. It gave an overview of how different theorists define Web 2. 0 and how public relations is related to it. In the empirical part of this thesis the author analyzed 10 interviews, that were conducted with Estonian PR Specialists concerning the use of Web 2. 0 applications in PR. Keywords: Web 2. 0, public relations, PR 2. 0, Web 2. 0 applications, participation web The theoretical part of this thesis gave an overview of the term Web 2. 0, brought out some examples of websites most commonly judged to be Web 2. 0 and brought out the main principles of Web 2. 0. It also stressed that Web 2. 0 is rather a way of thinking than some certain applications. In general Web 2. 0 is more people-oriented – in the center are people with their needs and wishes. In a broader sense Web 2. 0 has brought a progression in the way people are able to communicate, share information and participate. The spread of Web 2. 0 will also have an impact on PR and how it is done. In the empirical part of this thesis 10 interviews were conducted with 11 Estonian PR specialist. Most of the interviewees defined Web 2. 0 similarly to the theorist – Web 2. 0 relies mainly on its principles. Most of them have to do with people-oriented approach. Most of the interviewees’ were convinced, that Web 2. 0 is also having an effect on public relations. Most of them were also convinced, that public relations has to be done differently in Web 2. 0 environment. Many of the old ways and forms, that were used while doing PR using traditional media channels, {{are not going to have}} the desired effect in Web 2. 0 environment any more. Using Web 2. 0 applications the communicator has to rely more on what people want and need, rather than what the communicator wants to say to the public. In order to remain relevant to the people and have an affect, the communicator has to keep in mind what the public needs, how they would like to be reached and with what content. According to the interviewees this change is going to have an impact on how PR is being done. With the use of Web 2. 0 applications PR Specialist are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> new skills and redefine their role. Some of the interviewees brought out, that the PR Specialist who will not adapt to the changes, could soon find themselves in a situation, where their services are no longer needed. Although among the interviewees at present moment most of the public relations is still being done using traditional media channels, Web 2. 0 applications are being used many times less. The main reason for choosing traditional media channels over Web 2. 0 ones are the clients’ preferments and low awareness of Web 2. 0 applications and therefore high skepticism toward them. Some of the interviewees predict, that it is only a matter of time when it changes. The author of this thesis is convinced, that the semi-structured informant interview method worked well in this case of empirical research. All the main questions, that were set out, were answered with this method and it allowed to explore even some more areas. The interviewees were 11 estonian PR Specialists, who found themselves competent to talk about Web 2. 0 and had previously been/are related to PR. The author finds, that this thesis could be useful to PR Specialist, because in addition to giving information about developments in PR, it also gives practical tips about how PR Specialists should use Web 2. 0 applications: what to do, what to avoid and it brings out main principles, that need to be kept in mind while doing PR in Web 2. 0 environment...|$|E
