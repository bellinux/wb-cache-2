Eventually, Jack and Kenneth come down to the final <b>hand.</b> <b>Jack</b> has more chips and goes all-in. He offers to make the hand winner-take-all if Kenneth bets his page jacket. Kenneth agrees, and Jack's pair of twos beats Kenneth's king high. Liz asks why Kenneth would bet on a hand like that, and he responds that he enjoys living on the edge and was also confused about the rules. Jack stops Kenneth from leaving, explains that he only made Kenneth bet his job to prove his power over him, and returns the jacket to Kenneth with the expectation that he come in early on Monday.|$|E

Angela Keslar and Vincent Libretti were originally eliminated in Episodes 8 and 9, respectively, of Season 3, but were brought back due to that season's twist. Justin LeBlanc would have originally been eliminated in Episode 6 of Season 12, but was given a second chance due to the newly instituted [...] "Tim Gunn Save".

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 17, 1910. It states: [...] "Sue Jennings and Tom Egan have been sweethearts, Sue decides to marry another man, and holds a secret meeting with Tom, in which she returns his love letters and demands her own. On the same night, Jack Deming, a friend of Tom's who has lost heavily in speculation on Tom's advice, calls at the latter's rooms, very much intoxicated, brandishing a revolver and vowing vengeance. Tom calms his excited visitor, who falls asleep on the couch, after which Tom writes {{a letter to his}} former sweetheart and dispatches it by his servant. When the servant returns, he discovers his master dead on the floor of his apartment and Jack just leaving the room revolver in <b>hand.</b> <b>Jack</b> is arrested on suspicion, and young Miss Marsh , a bright young woman in the detective department, is detailed from headquarters to investigate the case. She does some clever work in the case, and proves Jack's innocence in a novel way, incidentally falling in love with the man whose life she is working to save. On the strength of her evidence, Jack is set free; and with love to live for, he starts out to make a new record in life for himself." ...|$|E

[...] Bob Dylan became close friends with Allen Ginsberg, and Ginsberg became close friends with Timothy Leary.

6000|$|They started {{next morning}} cheerfully enough, and {{for three hours}} or more paddled easily up the glassy and windless reaches, between two green flower-bespangled walls of forest, gay with innumerable birds and insects; while down from the {{branches}} which overhung the stream long trailers hung to the water's edge, and seemed admiring in the clear mirror the images of their own gorgeous flowers. River, trees, flowers, birds, insects,--it was all a fairy-land: {{but it was a}} colossal one; and yet the voyagers took little note of it. It was now to them an everyday occurrence, to see trees full two hundred feet high one mass of yellow or purple blossom to the highest twigs, and every branch and stem one hanging garden of crimson and orange orchids or vanillas. Common to them were all the fantastic and enormous shapes with which Nature bedecks her robes beneath the fierce suns and fattening rains of the tropic forest. Common were forms and colors of bird, and fish, and butterfly, more strange and bright than ever opium-eater dreamed. The long processions of monkeys, who kept pace with them along the tree-tops, and proclaimed their wonder in every imaginable whistle, and grunt, and howl, had ceased to move their laughter, as much as the roar of the jaguar and the rustle of the boa had ceased to move their fear; and when a brilliant green and rose-colored fish, flat-bodied like a bream, flab-finned like a salmon, and saw-toothed like a shark, leapt clean on board of the canoe to escape the rush of the huge alligator (whose loathsome snout, ere he could stop, actually rattled against the canoe within a foot of Jack Brimblecombe's <b>hand),</b> <b>Jack,</b> instead of turning pale, as he had done at the sharks upon a certain memorable occasion, coolly picked up the fish, and said, [...] "He's four pound weight!
