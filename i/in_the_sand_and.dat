5|$|Convinced {{they would}} be killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed their messages in bottles and dropped them into the onshore current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now onshore, could be used: one was buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> the other {{was in need of}} repair. The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the fires were lit on 7March. One of the messages is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E

25|$|From West Bay to Cliff End {{the beach}} is piled up against the cliff. At Cliff End a hollow forms behind the beach and at Abbotsbury a stretch of saline (or brackish) water called the Fleet Lagoon begins. The Fleet is home to many wading birds and Abbotsbury Swannery, and fossils can be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> mud. The Fleet connects to Portland Harbour at Ferry Bridge. Initially a ferry boat was used to connect Portland to the mainland, until the first bridge was {{constructed}} in 1839. An iron bridge replaced this in 1896, and this was in turn replaced with a concrete bridge in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Soon a {{coach at}} the school, Gennadiy Korshunov, noticed her. She had drawn a balance beam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> was practising moves on it like a real gymnast. He invited her into the school. He asked his wife, Ina, also a {{gymnastics}} {{coach at the}} school, to train Davydova in her group. Yuri Shtukman, the administrator at the school, did not like this initiative by his new training staff and reprimanded the Korshunovs; however he allowed Davydova {{to stay in the}} school. It soon became apparent that she was a talented gymnast and Gennadiy took over her coaching himself. By 1972 Davydova was the best in her age group at the school.|$|E

25|$|In unconsolidated aquifers, {{groundwater}} {{is produced}} from pore spaces between particles of gravel, sand, and silt. If the aquifer is confined by low-permeability layers, the reduced water pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> gravel causes slow drainage {{of water from}} the adjoining confining layers. If these confining layers are composed of compressible silt or clay, the loss of water to the aquifer reduces the water pressure in the confining layer, causing it to compress from the weight of overlying geologic materials. In severe cases, this compression can be observed on the ground surface as subsidence. Unfortunately, much of the subsidence from groundwater extraction is permanent (elastic rebound is small). Thus, the subsidence is not only permanent, but the compressed aquifer has a permanently reduced capacity to hold water.|$|E
25|$|The color {{variations}} in the mimicked substrate and animal skin are similar. Depending on the species, the skin of cuttlefish responds to substrate changes in distinctive ways. By changing naturalistic backgrounds, the camouflage responses of different species can be measured. Sepia officinalis changes color to match the substrate by disruptive patterning (contrast {{to break up the}} outline), where as S. pharanonis matches the substrate by blending in. Although camouflage is achieved in different ways, and in an absence of color vision, both species change their skin colors to match the substrate. Cuttlefish adapt their own camouflage pattern in ways that are specific for a particular habitat. An animal could settle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> appear one way, with another animal a few feet away in a slightly different microhabitat, settled in algae for example, will be camouflaged quite differently.|$|E

500|$|N. ensifer is a {{xerophilous}} {{species that}} can thrive in dry climates. In Colima, colonies are frequent among the basins, but rarely are {{they found in}} the mountainous regions. N. ensifer ants prefer to nest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> under large stones, as certain areas in Manzanillo had no stones buried in the soil and no colonies were found alongside hills with plain soil. Most colonies are found under stones with no noticeable craters surrounding the nest entrance, although one colony was found under an Acacia plant. These nest holes are usually [...] in diameter. A single path connects {{the entrance to the}} main nest site, followed by a passage that descends straight into the dirt several inches deep. This passage widens under a stone which forms a gallery for the larvae and pupae. Wherever stones are formed, passageways may descend further into the ground and form more chambers. Although it is unknown how deep these passages go, excavated nests are as deep as [...]|$|E
