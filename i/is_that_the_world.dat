25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode’s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate may be used. A 2008 review {{found that the}} efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate (200mg) be administered three times daily {{at the same time}} as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.|$|E

500|$|The {{action of}} the 1960s Century 21 mini-album Introducing Captain Scarlet (MA 131), written by Angus P. Allan, takes place shortly before the final scene of [...] "The Mysterons". Comprised partly of a re-telling of the TV episode (provided by {{excerpts}} from the soundtrack), and partly of an original story, {{the premise of the}} 21-minute audio drama <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Security Council (WSC) is holding an inquiry into the events following the disastrous conclusion to the Zero-X mission to Mars. The episode closes with the discovery that the Captain Scarlet duplicate has mysteriously recovered from its mortal injuries, and Cloudbase chief medical officer Dr Fawn's expressed belief that Scarlet's allegiance to Earth can be restored by interfacing his Mysteron body with an advanced computer (a plot device that was ultimately not used in {{the final version of the}} TV episode's shooting script).|$|E

50|$|Essentially, the Tattwabodhinī Sabhā's humanism is {{displayed}} in a profound focus on society and its interrelation. Their view, at least in <b>the</b> early years, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> created by God, and all things within it are pathways to knowledge of Brahman, the Ultimate Self, and the ultimate goal. Similarly, they saw that material wealth, if made and possessed with the correct intention - that of helping society and others - was in fact not only ethically sound, but an utter necessity for harmonious society. Once again, their rationality is evident.|$|R
500|$|The book {{opens with}} the {{statement}} that [...] "war no longer exists"; that is, war as [...] "battle in a field between men and machinery" [...] or [...] "a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs" [...] is unlikely to happen again. The premise of the book <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is experiencing a new paradigm of war in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, which Smith dubs [...] "war amongst the people", in which nebulous, open-ended conflicts have become the norm. Smith believes that Western, industrialised armies struggle to win in [...] "wars amongst the people" [...] because their opponents are not uniformed armies. He uses the term [...] "rhizomatic" [...] to describe terrorist and guerrilla movements; he states his belief that such fighters can adapt much more easily than state institutions, and that they exhibit a greater understanding of the utility of force. Rather than being part of a recognisable army, the fighters are part of the civilian population, and their objectives are more political than military—they seek to [...] "win hearts and minds" [...] rather than take or hold territory. As a consequence, wars are no longer confined to a battlefield, but the theatre of operations is fluid, and commanders now operate inside the theatre.|$|E
500|$|Other nationalists {{had high}} hopes for the German {{unification}} movement, and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back. Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress. As Giuseppe Garibaldi wrote to German revolutionary Karl Blind on 10 April 1865, [...] "The progress of humanity seems to {{have come to a}} halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> lacks a nation [...] possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed." [...] Garibaldi looked to Germany for the [...] "kind of leadership , in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith's thesis, and {{the central}} theme of The Utility of Force, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> entered a new {{paradigm}} of conflict {{at the end of}} the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries, which he calls [...] "war amongst the people", and that Western, industrialised armies are ill-suited to the new style of warfare. The defining characteristics of [...] "war amongst the people" [...] are that conflicts tend to be timeless, more political in nature, and fought between parties that are part of, and in amongst, the civilian population rather than between uniformed armies on a battlefield. To prove his theory, Smith provides a detailed history starting with Napoleon, who invented what Smith calls [...] "industrial warfare"—the paradigm in which the entire resources of the nation were mustered and which culminated in the two world wars. In the second half of the book, Smith states that the advent of nuclear weapons rendered industrial warfare obsolete, but that Western governments and generals refused to acknowledge the new paradigm, which led to several significant defeats in the second half of the 20th century. He provides six themes which characterise modern conflicts and proceeds to analyse each in detail, before dedicating his final chapter to his reflections on his command in Bosnia. He concedes that he did not foresee the Srebenica massacre, but criticises UNPROFOR, believing that it was not in a position to act even had the massacre been foreseen and that it had no strategy for effectively intervening in the war. In his conclusion, Smith argues that military force is only part of the solution in modern conflicts, and that it must be combined with political initiatives which together will subdue but not necessarily end the conflict.|$|E

500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{it fails to}} explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals <b>that</b> <b>are</b> inherent in <b>the</b> external <b>world.</b> But how <b>is</b> it possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up <b>the</b> <b>world</b> into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? <b>The</b> answer must <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> does not come pre-structured but <b>that</b> structure must <b>be</b> imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S.

2500|$|Schiller {{argued that}} the flaw in Hegel's system, as with all systems of {{abstract}} metaphysics, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> it constructs always proves to be unhelpful in guiding our imperfect, changing, particular, and physical lives to {{the achievement of the}} [...] "higher" [...] universal Ideals and Ends. For example, Schiller argues that the reality of time and change is intrinsically opposed to the very modus operandi of all systems of abstract metaphysics. He says that the possibility to change is a precondition of any moral action (or action generally), and so any system of abstract metaphysics is bound to lead us into a moral scepticism.|$|E

2500|$|According to Kant, the {{categorical}} imperative {{is possible}} because whilst {{we can be}} thought of as members of both of these worlds (understanding and appearance), it is the world of understanding that “contains the ground of the world of sense [...] and so too of its laws.” What this means <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of understanding is more fundamental than or ‘grounds’ the world of sense. Because of this, the moral law, which clearly applies to the world of understanding, also applies to the world of sense as well, because the world of understanding has priority. To put the point slightly differently: Because the world of understanding is more fundamental and primary, its laws hold for the world of sense too. So the moral law binds us even in the world of appearances.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps Russell's most systematic, metaphysical {{treatment}} of philosophical analysis and his empiricist-centric logicism {{is evident in}} what he called logical atomism, which is explicated {{in a set of}} lectures, [...] "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism", which he gave in 1918. In these lectures, Russell sets forth his concept of an ideal, isomorphic language, one that would mirror the world, whereby our knowledge can be reduced to terms of atomic propositions and their truth-functional compounds. Logical atomism is a form of radical empiricism, for Russell believed the most important requirement for such an ideal language is that every meaningful proposition must consist of terms referring directly to the objects with which we are acquainted, or that they are defined by other terms referring to objects with which we are acquainted. Russell excluded some formal, logical terms such as all, the, is, and so forth, from his isomorphic requirement, but he was never entirely satisfied with our understanding of such terms. One of the central themes of Russell's atomism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> consists of logically independent facts, a plurality of facts, and that our knowledge depends on the data of our direct experience of them. In his later life, Russell came to doubt aspects of logical atomism, especially his principle of isomorphism, though he continued to believe that the process of philosophy ought to consist of breaking things down into their simplest components, even though we might not ever fully arrive at an ultimate atomic fact.|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{great deal}} of civic unrest on college campuses {{throughout}} the 1960s as students became increasingly involved in the Civil Rights Movement, Second Wave Feminism, and anti-war movement. Doug McAdam explains the success of the mass mobilization of volunteers for Freedom Summer in terms of [...] "Biographical Availability", where individuals must have a certain degree of social, economic, and psychological freedom to be able to participate in large scale social movements. [...] This explanation can also be applied to the Anti-War Movement because it occurred around the same time and the same biographical factors applied to the college-aged anti-war protesters. David Meyers (2007) also explains how the concept of personal efficacy affects mass movement mobilization. For example, according to Meyers' thesis, consider that American wealth increased drastically after World War II. At this time, America was a [...] superpower and enjoyed great affluence after thirty years of depression, war, and sacrifice. Benjamin T. Harrison (2000) argues that the post World War II affluence set the stage for the protest generation in the 1960s. His central thesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Wars and Great Depression spawned a 'beat generation' refusing to conform to mainstream American values which lead to the emergence of the Hippies and the counterculture. The Anti-war movement became part of a larger protest movement against the traditional American Values and attitudes. Meyers (2007) builds off this claim in his argument that the [...] "relatively privileged enjoy the education and affirmation that afford them the belief that they might make a difference." [...] As a result of the present factors in terms of affluence, biographical availability (defined in the sociological areas of activism as the lack of restrictions on social relationships of which most likely increases the consequences of participating in a social movement), and increasing political atmosphere across the county, political activity increased drastically on college campuses.|$|E
