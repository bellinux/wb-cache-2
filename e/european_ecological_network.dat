Secondly, <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> can bridge the paradox between reserve conservation (fixing nature in space and time) and development, which implies change.

40|$|AbstractSuccessful {{conservation}} {{needs to}} be informed by social science because it is closely linked to socio-economic processes and human behaviour. Limited knowledge about ecosystems' interactions with these processes currently undermines conservation efforts. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of social science concerning the world's largest multinationally-coordinated conservation infrastructure: the <b>European</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Network</b> - ‘Natura 2000 ’. Based on a review of 149 publications, we analyse and discuss the main findings and outline key social-science research gaps {{with regard to the}} Natura 2000 network. The review shows that human dimension of the Natura 2000 network is complex and varies among EU Member States. In general, low level and quality of public participation in implementation of the Natura 2000 network and its management, negative public perceptions of the network, lack of flexibility of responsible authorities and insufficient consideration of the local context pose the greatest challenges to the network's functioning. Important but hitherto little studied research topics include: evaluation of participation; effects of education on potential to raise public awareness; effects of potential financing mechanisms for compensating private land-owners; economic studies on cost-effectiveness; and benefits from conservation and ecosystem services. These knowledge gaps will need to be filled for the Natura 2000 network to reach its goals...|$|E

Consequently, a coherent <b>European</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> (Natura 2000) for conservation of natural habitats and the wild fauna and flora (Council Directive 92 / 43 /EEC) was created. Even so, there is currently no standardized methodology for surveillance and assessment of habitats, a lack that it is particularly problematic for those habitats occupying large areas (heathlands, forests, dunes, wetlands) and which require a great deal of effort to be monitored. In this paper we evaluate the changes affecting the European dry heaths (Nat- 2000 4030) from the SCI Os Ancares–O Courel (Galicia, NW Spain) during the past decade. High-resolution aerial imagery analyses and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used. Losses of more than 7, 000 ha (20. 3 %) of European dry heaths were computed during the 2003 – 2011 period in the SCI Os Ancares–O Courel, and also an increase of the degree of fragmentation was demonstrated for this habitat. Paradoxically, major impacts (afforestations, pasturelands) were financed by agri-environmental funds from the EU.

A key element of PEBLDS has been the development of the Pan <b>European</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Network</b> (PEEN) as a guiding vision for coherence in biodiversity conservation. PEEN has been developed in three subprojects: Central and Eastern Europe, completed in 2002; South-eastern Europe, completed in 2006; and Western Europe, also completed in 2006. The methodology of the development of the three maps has been broadly comparable but data availability, differences in national databases, technical developments and geographical differences caused variations in the detailed approach. One of the challenges was to find common denominators for the habitat data in Europe; this was solved differently for the subprojects. The project has resulted in three maps that together constitute the PEEN. They differ in terms of ecological coherence and the need for ecological corridors; for example, in Central and Western Europe corridors are essential to provide connectivity, while in Northern, Eastern and South-eastern Europe larger, coherent natural areas still exist. The future steps in developing PEEN should include the implementation of national ecological networks and, in particular, the pursuit of international coherence through the development of trans-European ecological corridors.

Constructing an effective and harmonious urban <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> and maintaining a sustainable living environment in response to rapid urbanization are the key issues required to be resolved by landscape planners. In this paper, Nanchang City, China was selected as a study area. Based on a series of landscape metrics, the landscape pattern analysis of the current (in 2005) and planned (in 2020) green space system were, respectively, conducted by using FRAGSTATS 3. 3 software. Considering the actual situation of the Nanchang urban area, a “one river and two banks, north and south twin cities” <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> was constructed by using network analysis. Moreover, the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> was assessed by using corridor structure analysis, and the improvement of an <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> on the urban landscape was quantitatively assessed through a comparison between the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> and green space system planning. The results indicated that: (1) compared to the green space system in 2005, the planned green space system in 2020 of the Nanchang urban area will decline in both districts (Changnan and Changbei districts). Meanwhile, an increase in patch density and a decrease in mean patch size of green space patches at the landscape level implies the fragmentation of the urban green space landscape.
