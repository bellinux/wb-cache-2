5000|$|The {{intake air}} mass is {{measured}} with a [...] "hot-wire" [...] mass airflow sensor: drawn in by <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> air moves past an electrically-heated wire filament, {{and the degree to}} which the filament is cooled indicates the mass of the airstream.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{downward}} {{movement of the}} pistons and the restriction caused by the throttle valve, in a reciprocating spark ignition piston engine, a partial vacuum (lower than atmospheric pressure) exists in the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> This <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> can be substantial, {{and can be used}} as a source of automobile ancillary power to drive auxiliary systems: power assisted brakes, emission control devices, cruise control, ignition advance, windshield wipers, power windows, ventilation system valves, etc.|$|R
50|$|The 1993 - 1998 4-valve engines {{featured}} {{cylinder heads}} with two intake ports per cylinder (split-port) and variable runner length <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds</b> with either <b>vacuum</b> or electrically activated <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> runner controls (IMRC) depending on application. The engine was revised for 1999 with new cylinder heads featuring tumble-style intake ports (one intake port feeding two intake valves), new camshaft profiles, and fixed runner-length <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds.</b> These changes {{resulted in more}} power, torque and a broader power-band {{when compared to the}} earlier 4-valve engines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> or engine {{vacuum in}} an {{internal}} combustion engine is the difference in air pressure between the engine's <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> and Earth's atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|Mono-Jetronic is {{different}} from all other known single-point systems, in that it only relies on a throttle position sensor for judging the engine load. There are no sensors for air flow, or <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Mono-Jetronic always had adaptive closed-loop lambda control, and due to the simple engine load sensing, it is heavily dependent on the lambda sensor for correct functioning.|$|E
5000|$|Diesel engines inject {{the fuel}} {{directly}} into the combustion chamber, have no intake air restrictions apart from air filters and intake plumbing and have no <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> to add parasitic load and pumping losses resulting from the pistons being pulled downward against intake system vacuum. Cylinder filling with atmospheric air is aided and volumetric efficiency is increased for the same reason.|$|E

50|$|When a {{throttle}} is wide open, the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> {{is usually}} at ambient atmospheric pressure. When the throttle is partially closed, a <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> develops as the intake drops below ambient pressure.|$|R
5000|$|A {{commonly}} available {{source of}} power from an internal combustion engine is the partial vacuum available at the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The piston engine is fundamentally an air pump, and it produces suction and partial <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is {{an effect}} of a piston's {{movement}} on the induction stroke and the choked flow through a throttle in the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> of an engine. It {{is a measure of}} the amount of restriction of airflow through the engine, and hence of the unused power capacity in the engine. In some engines, the <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is also used as an auxiliary power source to drive engine accessories and for the crankcase ventilation system.|$|R
50|$|The {{power output}} of a diesel engine is {{controlled}} by regulating the quantity of fuel that is injected into the cylinder. Because the engines {{do not need to}} control air volumes, they lack a butterfly valve in the intake tract. An exception to this generalization is newer diesel engines meeting stricter emissions standards, where a throttle is used to generate <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> thereby allowing the introduction of exhaust gas (see EGR) to lower combustion temperatures and thereby minimize NOx production.|$|E
50|$|Carbureted engines' {{exhaust raw}} fuel content tends to spike {{when the driver}} {{suddenly}} releases the throttle. To prevent the startling and potentially damaging effects of the explosive combustion of this raw fuel, a diverter valve is used. This valve senses the sharp increase in <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> resulting from the sudden closure of the throttle, and diverts the air pump's outlet to atmosphere. Usually this diverted air is routed to the engine air cleaner or to a separate silencer to muffle objectionable pump noise.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{is applied}} to the {{crankcase}} via the PCV valve, drawing fresh air into the crankcase via the breather. The airflow through the crankcase and engine interior sweeps away combustion byproduct gases, including a large amount of water vapour which includes dissolved chemical combustion byproducts. This mixture of air and crankcase gases then exits, often via another simple baffle, screen, or mesh to exclude oil droplets, through the PCV valve and into the intake manifold. On some PCV systems, this oil baffling takes place in a discrete replaceable part called the 'oil separator'.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> varies {{depending}} on engine load and throttle position, and automobiles use vacuum reservoirs or [...] "vacuum canisters" [...] to provide a usable source under varying conditions. Turbo charged and super charged engines do not always produce vacuum; the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is actually pressurized when the turbo is spinning above a certain speed.|$|R
5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the crankcase breather, flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|R
5000|$|Analog fuel injection, 'D' is from [...] "Druck" [...] meaning pressure. Inlet <b>manifold</b> {{depression}} (<b>vacuum)</b> {{is measured}} using a pressure sensor located in, or {{connected to the}} <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> in order to calculate the duration of fuel injection pulses. Originally, this system was called Jetronic, but the name D-Jetronic was later created as a retronym to distinguish it from newer versions.|$|R
5000|$|..... The {{experience}} {{obtained by}} skilled drivers in the Mobil Economy run indicates that for best fuel economy, a car should be operated at nearly constant speed {{in the range}} of 30 to 50 mph. Rapid accelerations or decelerations and operation at (or near) full throttle should be avoided. To practice for economy runs, skilled drivers used special instrumentation to determine the operating conditions for best fuel economy. This instrumentation usually included a vacuum gauge to indicate <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> a special odometer to measure distance traveled to hundredths of a mile, and a burette to measure gasoline usage. However, instrumentation of this type is extremely complex for the normal driver and is additionally quite expensive. ..." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Ford Prefect was {{introduced}} in October 1938 and built by the Ford plant in Dagenham, Essex. The original Ford Prefect was a slight reworking of the previous year's 7Y, the first Ford car designed outside of Detroit, Michigan. It was designed specifically for the British market. It had a [...] side-valve engine with thermocirculation radiator (no pump) {{and the ability to}} be started by a crank handle, should the battery not have sufficient power to turn the starter motor, running from the six-Volt charging system. The windscreen wipers were powered by the vacuum ported from the engine intake manifold — as the car laboured uphill the wipers would slow to a standstill due to the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> dropping to near nil, only to start working again as the top was reached and the intake vacuum increased. The windscreen opened forward pivoting on hinges on the top edge; two flaps either side of the scuttle also let air into the car. The car has a durable four-cylinder motor.|$|E
50|$|One {{source for}} vacuum advance {{is a small}} opening located in {{the wall of the}} {{throttle}} body or carburetor adjacent to but slightly upstream of the edge of the throttle plate. This is called a ported vacuum. The effect of having the opening here is that {{there is little or no}} vacuum at idle, hence little or no advance. Other vehicles use vacuum directly from the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> This provides full engine vacuum (and hence, full vacuum advance) at idle. Some vacuum advance units have two vacuum connections, one at each side of the actuator membrane, connected to both <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> and ported vacuum. These units will both advance and retard the ignition timing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is {{a crucial}} part in an engine {{that acts as a}} medium for air flow to mix with the fuel before {{entering}} the combustion chamber. For years, cast iron and aluminium were the primary materials chosen for fabrication of an <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> before plastic based material was introduced to the field. However, there is lack of research involving the usage of plastic as the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> material. In this paper, the effects of internal surface roughness variations (Cast iron, aluminium and plastic) inside the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> were studied. Three dimensional, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> model was developed to simulate the airflow. The study emphasized on the airflow velocity inside the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The study showed that the surface roughness influenced the air flow velocity near the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> outlet. The plastic based <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> exhibited the highest air stream velocity (near the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> outlet) at 477. 770 m/s. This value is 0. 60 % and 0. 40 % higher than those produced by the cast iron and aluminium <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> respectively...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} to study about the {{development}} of variable <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> for sparkignition engine. Variable <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is one of the methods in optimizing the performance of an engine. Some of manufacture have great interest on this system such as Volkswagen and Volvo companies. Further research was held by those companies. Each of them has different in design in order to race in technology of engine optimizing. This experiment was conducted by using flow bench that test on the flow rate of the new design <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> that has been fabricated. The test is on the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> that is used by the 1600 cc engine. Two <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds</b> were tested in this experiment, the Proton Waja <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> and the custom <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> that has been fabricated. The result found that the length of runner does affect the flow rate that produced by the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The long runner will give better flow rate on the earlier phase of engine speed while the shorter runner will give better flow rate on the top end of engine speed. That is the reason why the variable <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is better <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> compared to the standard <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> because it can be switch for the suitable length of runner depends on the engine speed condition...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, the 3 D {{model of}} the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is reconstructed using the inverse method and CATIA software. The {{applicability}} and authenticity of the model is ensured due to the actual shape of the engine <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The internal flow field of the manifold is analyzed by combining CAD, CATIA, and CFD software with FLUENT; in addition, the equation is established on the air flow in the manifold and used in the SIMPLE algorithm. The calculation speed is accelerated through combining GAMBIT and FLUENT software, dividing the internal flow field of the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> and setting the boundary conditions. The {{results show that the}} optimized flow field is reasonable, the air flow is higher, and the pressure is reduced to varying degrees in the manifold, which effectively reduces the intake resistance and helps to increase the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> especially in the main optimization position by comparing the internal flow field of the engine <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> and the optimized <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b>|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{structure}} of the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> it can be modified and optimized according to the experience, {{and the performance of}} the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is only evaluated through the steady flow test in the automobile design. Therefore, it is not helpful to improve the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> design because the test method is limited, uncertain, high cost, and long period, and the flow condition can be neither truly reflected nor the internal flow field can be analyzed in detail in the manifold. So the reverse engineering will be used to improve the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> structure.|$|R

30|$|It is {{difficult}} to design the engine <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> in normal method because of the complex structure, and the real situation of fluid movement in the manifold cannot be obtained through the steady flow test, so the optimized design is proposed about the engine <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> based on reverse engineering. A 3 D model of the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is build according to the CATIA software; fluid mathematical is set up by computational fluid dynamics method. The 3 D geometry model of the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is grid with the Gambit software and the divided grid data is imported into the Fluent. These are performed about the simulation of the fluid pressure field, velocity field, flow field, and local flow field in the manifold. Key parameters design of the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> relies on the results. It proves that the reverse technology is reasonable for the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> design through the theory and simulation analysis; it can ensure sufficient air intake and reduce the intake resistance and energy loss of the air, and can improve the air intake uniformity.|$|R
