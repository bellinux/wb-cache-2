Fully aware of this situation, Tessa stays with MacLeod, demonstrating <b>her</b> <b>courage,</b> understanding, generosity and compassion.|$|E
5|$|After a lahar {{demolished}} her home, Sánchez became pinned {{beneath the}} debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. <b>Her</b> <b>courage</b> and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E

5|$|After the Cultural Revolution, Xin Fengxia was {{politically}} rehabilitated in 1979, {{but was unable}} to return to the stage because of her disability. Her performance in Flowers as Matchmakers in 1964 proved to be her last. She devoted her energy to writing, painting, and training the younger generation of pingju performers. In 1997, she published her two-million-word memoir, which has been translated into English and Urdu. Ye Shengtao, the renowned writer and publisher, greatly encouraged her to write. He composed two poems praising <b>her</b> <b>courage</b> and talent. Her paintings, which were decorated with her husband's calligraphy, were also popular, and an exhibition of them was held at the China Military Museum in 1994. She was elected {{as a member of the}} Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.|$|E
5|$|Rollason was {{diagnosed}} with colon cancer in 1997, and fought a two-year battle with the disease. A 1998 documentary, Hope for Helen, followed her treatment, and won her much public support for <b>her</b> <b>courage.</b> She continued to work throughout her illness, and shortly before her death was awarded an MBE in the 1999 Birthday Honours. Later that year, the BBC established an award in her memory which is {{presented at the annual}} Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony. A cancer charity was also founded in her name. Rollason's television career also helped to open up the way for other women to enter the world of sports broadcasting, with presenters such as Sue Barker and Gabby Yorath following in her footsteps.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} her friends Bolo and Sky and her {{acquaintance}} Rottytops, she gains access to three dungeons where she retrieves {{three of the}} stones. At the fourth dungeon, Shantae finds the fourth stone, but is ambushed at the exit by Risky, who leaves with the stones. Shantae subsequently discovers the location of Risky's hideout with a magical flying telescope called the sky scope, and teleports there. Shantae reaches and destroys Risky's weapon, the Tinker Tank. Risky tries to kill Shantae but is defeated; and as Risky's hideout collapses, Shantae escapes. After, she is magically abducted to {{a place called the}} Genie Realm where the genies offer her a chance to remain with them as a reward for <b>her</b> <b>courage,</b> but at the price of never seeing her friends again. She refuses and is sent back to Scuttle Town where she announces to Mimic that she had to destroy the steam engine, but is relieved to hear from him that it was probably for the better.|$|E

5|$|Tito came to Drvar {{at the end}} of January 1943, {{during a}} major Axis {{offensive}} against the Partisans (code-named Fall Weiss in German). After consulting with Đuro Pucar, the head of the KPJ regional committee for Bosanska Krajina, Tito decided to form a Partisan brigade around a battalion of experienced fighters from Drvar. Additional manpower would consist of recovered Partisans who had been wounded or ill, older men not previously in combat units and young male and female volunteers. The four-battalion 10th Krajina Brigade, intended to play a primarily-defensive role at this stage, was established on 4February 1943; its 800 members included about 120 women. Bursać, one of the volunteers, was assigned to the 2nd Battalion and was transferred to the 3rd Battalion's 3rd Company the following month. Until September 1943, she fought the Ustaše, Germans, Italians, and anti-communist Chetniks around Grahovo, Knin, Vrlika, Livno and Mount Dinara, was commended for <b>her</b> <b>courage</b> and skill in combat, and served as a nurse. In February and March 1943, during the Axis offensive, the brigade experienced constant enemy attacks, food shortages, cold, deep snow and outbreaks of typhus. Emaciated, Bursać was transferred to the military kitchen at brigade headquarters at the beginning of spring; after a month, she was returned to her company at her insistence. When she became ill some time later, Bursać was sent home to recover.|$|E
25|$|Nothing about a {{personal}} connection between Gertrude Lawrence and Daphne du Maurier was published during Lawrence's lifetime. Two years after Lawrence's death, her widower Richard Aldrich {{had this to}} say in a best-selling biography of his late wife, Gertrude Lawrence as Mrs. A.:All her ingenuous traits, which could be annoying as well as endearing, would be swept away by <b>her</b> <b>courage,</b> her clear perception of truth, and the divine compassion which could flood her heart and lift her to the heights of nobility.|$|E
25|$|Long {{after her}} death, Marie Antoinette remains a major {{historical}} figure linked with conservatism, the Catholic Church, wealth, and fashion. She {{has been the}} subject of a number of books, films and other media. Politically engaged authors have deemed her the quintessential representative of class conflict, western aristocracy and absolutism. Some of her contemporaries, such as Jefferson, attributed to her the start of the French Revolution. For others, Marie Antoinette was a victim of her family's ambition and the general situation in France. Even her critics have recognized her qualities as a mother and <b>her</b> <b>courage</b> in dying.|$|E

25|$|Rita Hayworth {{was one of}} our country's {{most beloved}} stars. Glamorous and talented, she gave us many {{wonderful}} moments on stage and screen and delighted audiences {{from the time she was}} a young girl. In her later years, Rita became known for her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. <b>Her</b> <b>courage</b> and candor, and that of her family, were a great public service in bringing worldwide attention to a disease which we all hope will soon be cured. Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend who we will miss. We extend our deep sympathy to her family.|$|E
25|$|During the campaign, {{she wrote}} a letter to her family {{explaining}} her disappearance. They used their connections {{in a desperate attempt to}} locate her. The rumor of an amazon in the army reached Tsar Alexander I, who took a personal interest. Durova's chain of command reported that <b>her</b> <b>courage</b> was peerless. Summoned to the palace at St. Petersburg, she impressed the Tsar so much that he awarded her the Cross of St. George and promoted her to lieutenant in a hussar unit (Mariupol Hussar Regiment). The story that there was the heroine in the army with the name Alexander Sokolov had become well known by that time. So the Tsar awarded her a new pseudonym, Alexandrov, based on his own name.|$|E
25|$|Sauvé did, however, find {{success in}} {{implementing}} reforms that professionalised the speaker's tasks of managing expenses and staff for the House of Commons, {{cutting back on}} the excess bureaucracy, personnel, overtime waste, and costs she discovered upon her installation. Once the changes were made, Sauvé had reduced the commons' support personnel by 300 and saved $18million out of the annual expenses, all of which, to some, actually improved overall service. Sauvé was lauded, by MPs and the media alike, for <b>her</b> <b>courage</b> in challenging the establishment. Other MPs, though, stated that she {{had gone too far}} and balked at the resulting inconveniences, such as having to clear their own plates in the commons cafeteria. At the same time, Sauvé also established the first daycare for Parliament Hill staff, MPs, and senators.|$|E

60|$|She knew, of course, {{that the}} visit was {{directed}} against Armand--some one had betrayed him, that odious de Batz mayhap--and she {{was fighting for}} Armand's safety, for his life.

500|$|I {{began to}} see an {{attractive}} ensemble—sailors, whalers, girls {{who worked in the}} mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds, people who were strong and alive and lusty, people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans—a libel I was anxious to refute... as for the two leading characters, Julie with <b>her</b> <b>courage</b> and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest. [...] Liliom is, of course, an international character, indigenous to nowhere.|$|E
500|$|After {{the king}} withdrew, the exultant crowd {{would not be}} denied the same accord from the queen, and her {{presence}} was demanded loudly. Lafayette {{brought her to the}} same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted for the children to be taken away, and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood with her hands crossed over her chest, the crowd – some of whom had muskets leveled in her direction – warmed to <b>her</b> <b>courage.</b> Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury drain away until, with dramatic timing and flair, he knelt reverently and kissed her hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: [...] "Vive la Reine!" ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1999, Time {{magazine}} {{published a}} special edition titled [...] "". Anne Frank was selected {{as one of the}} [...] "Heroes & Icons", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, [...] "The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world—the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question and hope for the future of human beings." [...] He notes that while <b>her</b> <b>courage</b> and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, [...] "The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't," [...] he replied, {{staring at}} her. It seemed that every moment {{he spent in}} her {{presence}} increased her effect upon him. Lenore felt this, and that buoyed up <b>her</b> failing <b>courage.</b>|$|R
