The events in Portugal inspired the Goans to seek greater political liberty. The Portuguese Viceroy of Goa, the Count of Rio Pardo, {{did not hold}} elections immediately, preferring, instead to wait for instructions from the Government Council in Rio de Janeiro. Peres led a popular insurrection in Goa that overthrew and imprisoned the Viceroy. Peres was offered {{a position in the}} provisional government but he refused.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of drinking-horns, lyre, sword and shield, bronze and glass vessels {{is typical of}} high-status chamber-graves in England. The similar selection and arrangement of the goods in these graves indicates a conformity of household possessions and funeral customs between people of this status, with the Sutton Hoo ship-burial being a uniquely elaborated version, of exceptional quality. Unusually, Sutton Hoo included regalia and instruments of power and had direct Scandinavian connections. A possible explanation for such connections lies in the well-attested northern custom by which the children of leading men were often raised away from home by a distinguished <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>relative.</b> A future East Anglian king, whilst being fostered in Sweden, could have acquired high quality objects and made contact with armourers, before returning to East Anglia to rule.|$|E

2500|$|Common law {{adoption}}: this is {{an adoption}} {{which has not been}} recognized beforehand by the courts, but where a parent, without resorting to any formal legal process, leaves his or her children with a <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>relative</b> {{for an extended period of}} time. [...] At the end of a designated term of (voluntary) co-habitation, as witnessed by the public, the adoption is then considered binding, in some courts of law, even though not initially sanctioned by the court. The particular terms of a common-law adoption are defined by each legal jurisdiction. For example, the US state of California recognizes common law relationships after co-habitation of 2 years. The practice is called [...] "private fostering" [...] in Britain.|$|E

He was buried in Kentucky, but no member of the Court attended his funeral though one employee of the Court traveled to Kentucky for the services." [...] In contrast, as the clerk noted, when McReynolds's aged African-American messenger, Harry Parker, died in 1953, his funeral was attended by five or six Justices, including the Chief Justice. McReynolds' brother, Robert, had visited {{him in the hospital}} shortly before his death. In his will, McReynolds requested [...] "let there be no service in Washington"; however the U.S. Marshal for the Supreme Court traveled to Elkton for the funeral.

2500|$|If Dioscurides, or cutters {{following}} his example, made it, the gemma was probably {{made in the}} court of Caesar Augustus. [...] At some time in antiquity it moved to Byzantium, perhaps after Constantine I had officially moved the capital of the empire there. [...] Augustus, though fully accepting and encouraging cult worship of the emperor outside Rome and Italy, especially in more distant provinces with traditions of deified rulers, did not allow himself to be worshipped as a god inside Rome. If this gem was made during his lifetime (he died in AD 14), it would perhaps have been made as a gift to a respected family in a Roman province or client kingdom. [...] Alternatively, if the gem was made after Augustus’ death, the identity of {{one or more of the}} portraits may be different from the usual identification. [...] Another viewpoint is that the gem does portray Augustus as a god in his lifetime, but was cut specifically for a close <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>relative</b> in the inner court circle. [...] Similar issues arise with other Imperial cameos such as the Blacas Cameo in the British Museum.|$|E
