In their model, {{the usage of}} relief jobs has both a direct effect on unemployment (i. e., the placement effect) {{as well as an}} <b>indirect</b> <b>wage</b> effect on unemployment. The former relationship is negative. The latter effect refers to the change in wage setting which is in response to changes in how relief jobs are used. Holmlund & Lindin argue that the only usage of relief jobs which unequivocally reduces unemployment is the policy of directing relief jobs at the flow out of regular employment. They show that by using relief jobs in this way, the negative direct effect on unemployment is reinforced by a negative <b>indirect</b> <b>wage</b> effect on unemployment. In this paper, we argue that Holmlund & Lindin's concept of workers' fall-back position is mis-specified since it fails to take account of the wage bargaining undertaken by those in relief employment. And it is this mis-specification which drives their result. Once due consideration is made for those in relief employment, their result no longer holds. ...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{decline of}} German {{emigration}} before World War I constitutes a puzzle that traditional explanations (decrease {{in the international}} wage gap, growing industrialization, fall in the fertility or international competition with other migrants) can only partly solve. It therefore seems necessary to go more deeply into the question, in particular by looking into the social legislation implemented by Bismarck during the 1880 s. Actually, the German insurance system {{was one of the}} most developed in the pre- 1914 world and it probably contributed to deterring labor outflows. The main explanation is that candidates for migration consider not only the gap between direct wages in sending and receiving countries, but also the differential in “indirect wages”, that is, social benefits. As a matter of fact, the existence of such benefits constitutes a form of social remuneration that partly offsets low levels of wage rates in sending countries. In that perspective, the econometric tests run in the paper show that the increase in German <b>indirect</b> <b>wages</b> after 1885 was accompanied by a significant decrease in emigration rates...|$|R

We circumvent these problems by using an 11 -year panel of data on 11, 441 German municipalities' tax rates, 8 percent of which change each year, linked to administrative matched employer-employee data. Consistent with our theoretical model, we find a negative effect of corporate taxation on wages: a 1 euro increase in tax liabilities yields a 77 cent decrease in the wage bill. The direct wage effect, arising in a collective bargaining context, dominates, while the conventional <b>indirect</b> <b>wage</b> effect through reduced investment is empirically small due to regional labor mobility.

The estimates imply that in the absence of workers' compensation, fatality rates would increase by over 20 %. Premium levels substantially overstate the cost of workers' compensation, due primarily to a direct wage offset from higher benefits. An <b>indirect</b> <b>wage</b> offset resulting from the decrease in risk caused by workers' compensation augments the direct wage effects.

Using data with detailed information about job content and structure, evidence of a natural positive correlation between size and structure is found.

40|$|Cette étude vise à fournir un cadre conceptuel pour comprendre la {{participation}} aux décisions dans l'entreprise. On y trouve: la signification du concept de participation; les formes quelle peut prendre; les conditions quelle présuppose; les questions qui peuvent en faire l'objet; le genre de responsabilité qui l'accompagne. Although in fashion, {{the idea}} of participation is a confused idea. Such confusion results from the great variety of intentions motivating those who refer to it, from the often contradictory nature of the objectives which the latter pursue, and from the diversity of concrete experiments with which it is associated. The aim {{of this paper is}} to attempt to clarify the meaning of this concept and to specify the forms it can have in the decision-making process. We shall not try therefore to give answers to questions as much of present interest as the followings : what is the present state of participation in enterprise ? It is possible and desirable to extend participation ? If so, what form will participation take and at what level will it be applied?Before discussing these questions, it is necessary for us to use the same words in the same sense and to have a frame of reference. Although we recognize the limitations of such an approach, we think that the present paper shall be usefull to those planning more advanced studies on the subject. The analysis of the situation existing in Canada is, in fact, hardly begun with. The twenty third annual industrial Relations Conference of Laval 1 had a first try but only under a descriptive form. There is no doubt in our minds that these preliminary reflections shall be completed by series of more systematic analytical studies that, after having focused on the present situation in our country, would lead to prospective thoughts presenting the problem of participation not in a theoretical manner but by bearing in mind the characteristics of our society, its groups and organizations. It would be very important to note at the beginning that participation can be at the service of heterogeneous ideologies susceptible to be the basis for different demands and plan of actions. Robert Cox insisted on this point in an article on the participation of the workers to the management of enterprises 2. « The idea that the workers should participate to the management of the enterprise employing them has been existing for a long time under different forms: it has been an idea which has seduced many theorists and social groups for all sorts of reasons. Under its most militant form, it has been the expression of different ideologies based on the conception that society is the expression of group interests. This idea is an integral part of the programs aiming not only the transformation of the industrial organization but of the society itself.  »ATTEMPT TO DEFINE PARTICIPATIONParticipation as a situation, as a value, as an actionA first step, strictly intellectual in nature, permits the regrouping of the multiple meanings of that idea around three essential themes : participation as a situation, as a value, as an action. As a situation, participation is the index of the existence of a common state, of a community of views or of interests. It translates the existence of a common way of being or of an effective consensus. In that perspective, we may mention participation in the results of an enterprise or participation in a common ideology; in the first case, participation is the index of relative equality in the distribution of assets and services offered ; in the second case, the index of adherence to values, to ideas. As a value, participation is a norm for the action in which it involves both the general finalities and conditions :The finalities : since participation, like any other value, is an end in itself under its three aspects as a situation, a norm and an action. The conditions : participation presupposes free partners, responsible for their choices. They are not necessarily prompted by motivations and objectives which, in the long run and in their essential finalities, would be identical, but they never-the less agree, even if temporarily, in order to achieve limited objectives. This leads to a distinction in practice of various degrees, levels and purposes of participation ; this we shall do in a moment without overlooking, however, that the strategy and stakes of long-term participation confer on any experiment in participation its true scope and meaning. This leads back to a self-questioning on the nature of short, average and long term intentions. As an action, lastly, participation is a practice or behaviour leading individuals and groups to concerted action. Here again, the extension and nature of the stakes of participation, like its practical conditions, vary. However, as an action, participation still implies an open attitude towards the other and when it involves the action, it implies the will to act jointly rather than alone ; in the end, participation in decisions implies an actual sharing of responsibilities and of the power of decision. Participation and DemocracyThese three dimensions of {{the idea of}} participation — situation, value and action — come together and in the end, blend into the concept of democracy. A society, an organization, a group lean towards democracy when, in respect of pluralism, they endeavour to attain objectives and ends expressing a large consensus ; when the parties concerned can and actually do participate in the drawing up of options and decisions involving their collective future whether directly or indirectly through representatives ; and when they mutually give up the idea of monopolizing power and they exercise it according to procedures and within the framework of freely accepted rules. This excludes « forced » participation which does not respect the freedom and responsibility of the partners, whether it be based on the rousing of the masses through propaganda or through hidden persuasion. The abstract and theoretical nature of this step is obvious but unavoidable insofar as participation as a value transcends historical situations and existing practices. Like any value, participation is more a should-be than a fact ; it is a permanent conquest, never completed and always threatened. A FEW ESSENTIAL DIMENSIONSDegrees of ParticipationThe notion of degrees of participation can be clarified by referring to the various steps of a decision-making process. To simplify, it seems that a decision-making process may be broken down into five major steps : 1. gathering of information ; 2. drawing up and formulating possible options ; 3. the decision proper ; 4. implementing the decision ; 5. controlling the implementation of the decision. To the various steps of the decision correspond various « degrees » of participation. The latter concept in turn should be clarified. Firstly, it assumes a quantitative meaning ; participation may be more or less intensive. It then seems that as relationship between the various degrees of participation and the forms of participation can be established grosso modo. Lastly, a general correlation can be established between the degree of participation and the degree of « engagement and responsibility » that it implies. 1. To the first step of decision —the gathering of information — corresponds only a minimum degree of participation which nevertheless is necessary in order to be able to speak of participation. In that case, participation is expressed formally in the communication or exchange of information but in no way involves the responsibility of the partners present. 2. To the second step of the decision —the drawing up and formulation of possible options — corresponds an intermediate degree of participation. Formally, here, participation is expressed in consultation ; this means that it involves, in addition to communication and exchange of information, the formulation of advice and recommendations by the concurring participants. In that case, each participant should on one hand express his own point of view or that of the persons whom he represents, and on the other hand, consider those expressed by the other participants in an attempt to reconcile both in relations to the objectives which the consultative agency itself is pursuing. The particularisms should not be repudiated but exceeded, reconciled in a common perspective, fulfilling the role, the mission of the consultative agency. In other words, each participant should firstly make sure that his opinion — which may perhaps be the same opinion as held by the people whom they represent — will be taken into consideration by the other participants. This first dimension of the role of each participant is one of information but this role is not limited to that because one should speak of participation in the form of exchange of information and not of participation in the form of consultation. Hence the second dimension of the role of the representatives of a group in a consultative agency. As members of that agency the participants are called upon to express a collective opinion ; therein lies their specific role. That opinion will not be established solely from the special criteria of each representative but should consider those which answer to the duties of the agency itself. In that perspective, the responsibility of each participant is twofold ; he is responsible to himself or to his representatives and responsible to the agency itself. However, the consultative nature, by definition, of that agency limits the responsibility of the participants. They remain free to contest the recommendations issued and obviously the decisions which such recommendations might entail. 3. To the third step of the decision —the decision proper — corresponds the fullest and most exacting degree of participation. In that case, the participants are not only associated with the previous steps of the decision — gathering of information and drawing up of possible options —whether directly or not, but decide jointly. The decision becomes a joint decision ; the power to decide is then shared and exercised collectively. The « joint-decision makers » are also jointly responsible for the decision taken and thereby lose their right to contest it ; it would be a contradiction in terms to contest a decision for which one would be fully responsible. This would be possible only subject to withdrawal from the deciding agency ; this would imply the elimination of any participation at this level. 4. To the fourth step of a decision — implementing the decision — corresponds a more complex situation. a) The joint decision obviously binds the participants at the implementation level ; each should cooperate in the implementation of a decision for which he is jointly responsible — or run the risk of contradicting himself. If such is the case, it does not seem that a new degree of participation corresponds to the implementation of the decision. At the most, it is necessary to speak of the permanence at the time of an earlier obligation. b) However, participation can be limited to the implementation of a decision without having previously put emphasis on codecision and consultation ; such is, moreover, the situation encountered most often. It is possible to contest or approve an outside decision, participate or not in its implementation depending on whether one accepts it or rejects it. It does not seem that an individual or a group can be held responsible for the implementation of a decision in which they presumably did not participate unless, implicitly or not, they previously engaged themselves to implement it. 5. To the fifth step of the decision —control of its implementation — corresponds a situation analogous to the one which we have just described. a) The joint decision, the joint responsibility prompts participants to jointly control the implementation of the decision. b) However, there may be participation in the control of the implementation of a decision without there being prior participation in its drawing up and in taking the decision. Such participation may assume two forms depending on whether it is a question of collecting information or opinions on the implementation of the decision considered 3. Modes of ParticipationThe notion of mode of participation refers to the practical conditions of participation as an action,or if one prefers, to the manner of participating. On that point, we shall restrict ourselves to making two comments, essential in our opinion where participation in decisions is concerned. The first to distinguish between direct participation and indirect participation, the second to underline the importance of the moment at which participation is situated in a decision-making process. 1. Participation is direct when it is effected without a middleman, indirect when it is effected through delegates, representatives, agents. In practice, this distinction assumes great importance ; direct participation is impractical as soon as a certain number of participants is attained. Indirect or delegated participation implies that the representatives of the group are truly « representative », that is, they are not only the faithful spokesmen of those whom they represent but also that they can actually « involve » them and act on their behalf. This is of great importance as soon as the degree of participation reaches an intermediate level, that is, in case of consultation and a fortiori of joint decision and joint implementation. From that time onward, the representation of the participants constitutes the sole guarantee of the effectiveness of such agencies. This appears clearly in the case of joint decision ; implementation of the decision then depends on the behaviour of each participating organization, therefore on the representation of their agents ; it is only insofar as the members of such organizations will feel themselves bound, obligated through the choice of their representative that the decision will be implemented. 32. The notion of modes of participation also brings into play the « time dimension » especially where participation in decisions is concerned. Numerous cases can be cited ; we shall pick out only the most significant ones ;— Participation in the information may be simultaneous or subsequent to the collecting of information ; this has only relative importance. — Participation in consultation may come before or after the decision but the consequences will not be identical. If participation in consultation comes before the decision proper, the possibility remains, at least theoretically, of influencing a recommendation with some chance of success or, on the other hand, of actually participating in the decision taking itself. But, if participation in consultation comes after the decision proper, it loses some of its value and interest ; it has scarcely any practical bearing and becomes related to an « opinion poil ». It is rather a consultation-alibi or a dupery. Here we consult to avoid listening and even in order to compromise. However, it may be that consultation constitutes in that case one of the preliminary steps of a new decision-making process. — Participation in a decision may be simultaneous or subsequent to the decision as an action. In the first case, the participants will actually be associated with the decision as such ; in the second case, participation has meaning only if it is associated with the possibility of exercising a right of veto which would in fact postpone the implementation of the decision. — Participation in the implementation and in the control of the implementation of a decision does not raise any special problems. Participation will be all the more intensive and effective when the participants are associated with the various steps of the decision successively and according to the « forms of participation » which we have previously mentioned. Levels and ObjectsThere is a close relationship between decision and level of organization ; this relationship appears clearly when the various levels of organization are defined in terms of power, that is, ability to decide and implement the decisions taken. The nature, the field and the scope of decisions corresponding to the various levels establish the bounds and define the eventual object of participation. This is applied at the establishment, enterprise, regional, industrial branch or national economic level. According to the nature of the objectives pursued, « participation » should come at any one of those levels and at each level, it may take, at least theoretically, any one of the forms which we previously mentioned. One of the major questions encountered in any debate on participation is first to discover and determine at what level and then according to which procedure (form) might the questions be approached, according to whether they concern for example :— organization of labour ;— technical of technological problems ;— personnel training ;— labor relations including direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>wage</b> payment ;— economic and social questions (investment, price, etc.)  ;— economic and social policies of the governments. One shall not expect everything out of participation. The enterprise is one decision taking place among others. The scope of both its actions and decisions is limited. Participation's « Stake »If the object of participation refers to its immediate content, the notion of « stake » has a wider meaning since it concerns the average and long term strategy, objectives and aims which the groups and organizations present are pursuing. At that level, it is scarcely possible to draw up a series of general comments ; only an examination of the special situations permits an all-round and specific statement of participation's stake. On the other hand, a general statement seems necessary ; the increasing socialization which characterized our industrial societies calls for increasing participation whose most obvious index lies in the multiplication of committees, commissions, board which most often are consultative. Such new situation is less a consequence of a sudden change-over to the requirements of democracy than the sign of an increasing interdependence among groups and organizations resulting from the complementary nature of their functions which makes them indispensable to one another. Contradictions may here oppose the short and long term. Participation can be only a strategy at the service of contestation : participation is sought in order to contest from within. From that time onwards, participation is only an immediate objective, a tactic subordinated to a strategy which, in the longer run, aims at contesting. On the other hand, contestation, conflict may tend to obtain recognition which constitutes the first step towards participation. Furthermore, in the end, a situation of a predominantly conflicting nature does not exclude the existence of areas of participation of limited scope. Conditions of ParticipationA distinction must still be made between the general conditions of participation. Perhaps it would be preferable to speak of the state of mind of the partners and of the special specific conditions of each case which concern the structures and means to be used. Listing them would be an endless task which would be identical to the description of the multitude of situations encountered. Therefore, we shall set forth only the general conditions of participation. A first condition lies in the existence of a minimum of consensus among the partners on a common plan or action to be realized jointly. This is indispensable so that participation will prevail over contestation so that it will not be a mere tactical moment for a strategy of predominantly conflicting nature. The existence of such minimum consensus is largely subordinated to the existence of common interests. A second condition is the recognition of the other as a responsible partner in its own role and not only of the strength and power which he represents. This recognition of the other, who in fact is a « valid speaker » is largely fostered by taking into consideration the complementary nature of the economic, social and political functions of the groups and organizations present. « Recognition of the other » is a major point where promoting indirect participation is involved. It involves the respect of the various levels of an organization, the refusal to disassociate the bottom from the top, the will to foster internal democracy. A third condition is to aim for equality among the means. Equality among the means is firstly equality in access to information, in knowledge of the problems to be tackled ; then equality in competency, that is, in the ability to overcome the questions and problems in abeyance. Lastly, a fourth condition applicable only when participation in decisions is involved is to aim for a distribution of power. It would be useless to speak of participation in decisions even if the three foregoing conditions were met but if power of decision remained the exclusive prerogative of a minority group or organization. PARTICIPATION AND INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY : A FEW BASIC QUESTIONSIf in our society, the validity of this outline is scarcely contested when applied to political realities, it is contested when the organization and functioning of the economy are concerned.

Thus, changes in ULC are often discussed in the context of wage increases and labor productivity. However, a higher wage induces firms to substitute labor with capital, which affects labor productivity. However, the conventional decomposition of changes in ULC dismisses this <b>indirect</b> impact of <b>wage</b> on ULC through labor productivity. We propose an alternative decomposition of the change in ULC with a measure of a comprehensive wage effect, which fully captures its direct as well as indirect impact. It allows us to understand more accurately the role of wage changes in enhancing cost competitiveness. Furthermore, we compare measures of the wage effect under two decompositions, using data from 18 OECD countries over the 1995 – 2005 period. We find the wage effect to be significantly overestimated under the conventional decomposition. This study looks at ULC for the whole country as well as for two sectors—manufacturing sector and electricity, gas, and water supply sector.|$|R
40|$|Indirect {{costs or}} {{productive}} labour time lost {{are the largest}} share of household economic burden of illness. However, the estimate of household indirect cost can {{vary depending on the}} valuation methods used. We therefore estimated household indirect cost in a subsistence farming society in Burkina Faso based on daily production value. These results were validated by using willingness-to-pay method and current wage rate. Among the three methods, the value of a day lost for adults assessed by willingness-to-pay method was considerably higher than other methods. There {{were no significant differences in}} indirect costs estimated by daily production value and wage rate. There were significantly higher indirect costs for households which were of higher economic status when daily production value was used. It might raise a question of equity. The willingness-to-pay method can capture the various aspects of indirect cost such as differences among age groups and gender, important individual characteristics and seasons. Thus, it is an appropriate approach for rural subsistence fanner communities. Estimation of <b>indirect</b> cost by <b>wage</b> rate can also be used as a rapid estimation of indirect cost in a rural area in developing countries as an alternative for daily production value.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} labor market {{outcomes}} such as {{employment and wages}} have mostly been limited to investigating the impact of formal schooling only and, as a consequence, have seldom considered skills or alternative routes to acquiring skills, such as adult literacy programs, or other types of education. This paper examines these issues for Ghana, by estimating the joint effects of formal schooling, literacy and numeracy skills, and adult literacy programs on employment and wage outcomes. Wage and employment status equations are estimated jointly, allowing employment status to be endogenous. Substantial returns to basic cognitive skills are established, while the education system – especially {{the lower levels of}} formal education – is found to be relatively successful in creating these skills. At the same time the results hint at there being substantial returns to skills other than basic literacy and numeracy. These skills appear to be produced mostly from technical and vocational education and training and at higher levels of formal education. Adult literacy participants {{are less likely to be}} economically inactive and more likely to be self-employed, hinting at the income-generating activities component of these programs having <b>indirect</b> effects on <b>wages</b> through its effect on labor market participation, especially for females, individuals with no formal education, and in urban areas. wage equations, employment status, human capital, literacy and numeracy, cognitive and non-cognitive skills, formal education, adult literacy programs, Ghana...|$|R

40|$|Background: Patients with solitary {{cysticercus}} granuloma (SCG) develop acute symptomatic seizures {{because of}} the inflammatory response {{of the brain and}} the seizures are self-limiting. Thus seizure disorder associated with SCG provides a good model to study the total cost of illness (COI). Materials and Methods: COI of new-onset seizures associated with SCG was studied in 59 consecutive patients registered at the epilepsy clinic. Direct treatment-related costs and indirect costs, man-days lost and wages lost were evaluated. The relative cost was calculated as the percentage of per capita gross national product (GNP) at current prices for the year 1997 - 1998. Results: The total COI, for treating seizure disorder associated with SCG per the period of CT resolution of the lesion per patient was INR 7273. 7 (US$ 174. 66, I$ 943. 16) and he/she would be spending 50. 9 &#x 0025; of per capita GNP The direct cost per patient was INR 5916 (US$ 137. 14, 41. 4 &#x 0025; of per capita GNP). If the patient had received only AEDs for the period of resolution of CT lesion, the cost would be INR 5702. 48 (US$ 132. 2, 40 &#x 0025; of per capita GNP). The extra expenditure on albendazole and steroid was INR 213. 72 (US$ 4. 95), 3. 6 &#x 0025; of the total direct cost and 20. 7 &#x 0025; of the medication cost. <b>Indirect</b> cost (average <b>wage</b> loss) per patient was INR 1312. 7 (US$ 30. 42) and it accounted for 9 &#x 0025; of per capita GNP. The one-time expenditure at present costs (adjusted for inflation) to the nation to treat all the prevalence cases is to the tune of INR 1. 184 billion (US$ 2. 605) and 0. 0037 &#x 0025; of GNP. Conclusions: This study suggests that seizure disorder associated with SCG, a potentially preventable disorder, is a good model to study the total COI. The one-time expenditure at present costs to the nation to treat all the prevalence cases of seizure disorder associated with SCG is to the tune of INR 1. 184 billion (US$ 2. 605 million) and 0. 0037 &#x 0025; of GNP...|$|R
40|$|The Advantage Sharing Program, or ASP, is a multi-county {{collaboration}} comprising Greene, Miami and Montgomery Counties. The program’s {{purpose is}} to provide additional dollars to economic and workforce projects {{that have been developed}} by local governments. The projects submitted by local governments address the needs of businesses that are locating, expanding or sustaining operations. ASP provides to local officials a source of additional funding to meet business needs. Local governments apply for funds after their best offer does not secure a development agreement. This funding does not replace incentives typically offered by local governments. Requests for funding are made to a Review Committee comprised of three representatives from each of the counties. Each county determines who will sit on the review Committee from the public sector (two representatives) and the private sector (one representative). Economic and workforce development projects are evaluated using information about: Jobs created or retained Economic growth (direct and <b>indirect</b> multipliers from <b>wages</b> and investments) Average wages and benefits paid to employees Type and dollar amount of company investment Dollar amount of infrastructure improvements needed to support the project Other factors such as relocation, energy efficiency, and coordination with regional development priorities Ultimately, ASP attempts to increase investment that grows businesses and increases the pace of economic transformation in the region. Uniquely, ASP couples workforce with economic development. ASP fills gaps in the existing workforce development programs. The workforce committee identified workforce gaps related to retraining incumbent workers, internship workers or other gaps that may exist or develop within workforce development programs supported by federal, state and local governments. Program Development Two separate committees met to design the Economic and Workforce Development programs. Decisions were made by consensus. The major goals of the Economic Development Program are to 1) fund business development that creates or retains jobs paying the median wage of the region; 2) invest in businesses that will restore prosperity to our region; and 3) unify the region and foster efficiencies through local government collaboration. The Workforce Development Program seeks to 1) meet business workforce needs; 2) retain highly educated residents; 3) fill gaps that exist within current workforce development programs. [URL]...|$|R
60|$|But {{even with}} devotion, you may remind me, even with {{unfaltering}} and delighted industry, many thousand artists spend their lives, if the result be regarded, utterly in vain: a thousand artists, and never one work of art. But the vast mass of mankind {{are incapable of}} doing anything reasonably well, art among the rest. The worthless artist would not improbably have been a quite incompetent baker. And the artist, {{even if he does}} not amuse the public, amuses himself; so that there will always be one man the happier for his vigils. This is the practical side of art: its inexpugnable fortress for the true practitioner. The direct returns - the wages of the trade are small, but the <b>indirect</b> - the <b>wages</b> of the life - are incalculably great. No other business offers a man his daily bread upon such joyful terms. The soldier and the explorer have moments of a worthier excitement, but they are purchased by cruel hardships and periods of tedium that beggar language. In the life of the artist there need be no hour without its pleasure. I take the author, with whose career I am best acquainted; and it is true he works in a rebellious material, and that the act of writing is cramped and trying both to the eyes and the temper; but remark him in his study, when matter crowds upon him and words are not wanting - in what a continual series of small successes time flows by; with what a sense of power as of one moving mountains, he marshals his petty characters; with what pleasures, both of the ear and eye, he sees his airy structure growing on the page; and how he labours in a craft to which the whole material of his life is tributary, and which opens a door to all his tastes, his loves, his hatreds, and his convictions, so that what he writes is only what he longed to utter. He may have enjoyed many things in this big, tragic playground of the world; but what shall he have enjoyed more fully than a morning of successful work? Suppose it ill paid: the wonder is it should be paid at all. Other men pay, and pay dearly, for pleasures less desirable.|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{documented}} {{that along with}} the high growth rates of GDP that have characterized the Indian economy since the 1980 s, {{there has been an}} increase in inequality. 1 However, most of these studies have either focused on consumption expenditure (Sen and Himanshu 2004; Cain et al. 2010; Motiram and Vakulabharanam 2012; Jayaraj and Subramanian 2015; Datt et al. 2016) 2 or on earnings of paid workers in urban India (Kijima 2006; Azam 2012 a). Two notable exceptions are Hnatkovska and Lahiri (2013) and Jacoby and Dasgupta (2015). Hnatkovska and Lahiri (2013) focus on wage comparisons between rural and urban areas between 1983 and 2010. They find that urban agglomeration led to a massive increase in urban labor supply that in turn reduced the rural-urban wage gap. Unlike Hnatkovska and Lahiri (2013), we focus exclusively on rural India to provide a more detailed picture of the changes within this sector. Jacoby and Dasgupta (2015) adopt the supply-demand-institutions (SDI) framework pioneered by Katz and Murphy (1992) and Bound and Johnson (1992), to decompose wage changes between 1993 and 2011 in both rural and urban India. We use a very different approach, namely, the recentered influence function (RIF) decomposition developed by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2009) to study earnings evolution in rural India. 3 Jacoby and Dasgupta (2015) decompose the change in an <b>indirect</b> measure of <b>wage</b> inequality, namely, the relative wages of educated and uneducated workers, into changes in employment shares of different demographic groups and changes in the industrial composition. In this paper, we focus on direct measures of inequality such as the Gini and the 90 / 10 percentile ratio, and decompose changes in these measures into changes in worker characteristics and changes in returns to these characteristics. Our finding that the change in returns to characteristics is driving the decline in earnings inequality in rural India is a novel one. Moreover, we document changes not just at the mean but also at various quantiles. It is important to do so because several studies have found that earnings inequality is mainly concentrated at the upper end. For India, Azam (2012 a) and Kijima (2006) find this for urban wage earners and Banerjee and Piketty (2005) find it for income tax payers. We use unconditional quantile regressions to account for the effects of workers’ characteristics at different quantiles and thereby make inferences about their effects on earnings inequality. Finally, we use the RIF decompositions to divide the overall change in earnings inequality into a composition effect (the component due to changes in the distribution of worker characteristics) and a structure effect (the component due to changes in returns to these characteristics).|$|R
