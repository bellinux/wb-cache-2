Then, {{the different kinds of}} lignocellulosic biomass obtained from these sources were evaluated and classified according to use, such as fuel for electric power generation in the area. The groupings of the average moisture content <b>values</b> and average <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>values</b> (over dry basis) of the samples analyzed were made based on the type of material, and for larger groups (with a significant dispersion of the <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>values),</b> the average values were estimated in subgroups or “characteristic groups. ” A six-cluster scheme allowed us to classify the different groups of materials. The average <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>values</b> of the six different clusters (raw materials) showed significant similarities. It was observed that softwood and related materials typically have values in the region of 20. 0 MJ/kg, and hardwood, such as that from Eucalyptus globulus, yields about 18. 0 MJ/kg, whereas other deciduous plants (and their residues) give lower values.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{properties of}} various biomass and wood materials from various references {{and from our}} laboratory were reanalysed. The net heat of combustion for cellulosic materials {{was found to be}} 13. 23 kJ/g times the ratio of stoichiometric oxygen mass to fuel mass, ro, regardless of the material composition. Bomb calorimeter data for original, charred and volatilized material components provide <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>values,</b> while elemental analysis of the materials for carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and ash provide direct evaluation for ro. We corrected these data as provided in various references by converting <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>values</b> to lower <b>heating</b> <b>values</b> and converting elemental compositions, char fractions and ro to a moisture-free and ash-free basis. Some existing formulae were found to disagree with data from vegetation, charred wood with high ash content, and with volatiles from cellulose treated with the fire retardant NaOH. We also established various functional correlations of ro with elemental compositions, or volatization fractions of untreated and treated materials, or material fractions for cellulose, lignin and extractives, or volatile fractions for tar, combustible gases and inert gases in pure nitrogen carrier gas. An interesting predictive result provides nearly constant heat of combustion while the volatile tar fraction is decreasing and combustible and inert gas fractions are increasing with time during the charring of Douglas-fir wood.

40|$|Definitions {{for heating}} {{value of a}} biomass The heating value of any fuel is the energy {{released}} per unit mass or per unit volume of the fuel when the fuel is completely burned (ANSI/ASABE S 593. 1 2011). The term calorific value is synonymous to the heating value. Typical units for expressing calorific or heating value are MJ/kg in SI units or Btu/lb in English units. The heating value of a fuel depends on the assumption made {{on the condition of}} water molecules in the final combustion products. The higher heating value (HHV) refers to a condition in which the water is condensed out of the combustion products. Because of this condensation all of the heating value of the fuel including sensible heat and latent heat are accounted for. The lower heating value (LHV), on the other hand refers to the condition in which water in the final combustion products remains as vapor (or steam); i. e. the steam is not condensed into liquid water and thus the latent heat is not accounted for. The term net heating value (NHV) refers to LHV (ANSI/ASABE S 593. 1 2011). The term <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> (GHV) refers to HHV. Determination of heating value of a biomass Heating value of a biomass is measured experimentally in terms of the high heating value (HHV). The standard method uses a device called bomb calorimeter. The device burns a small mass of biomass in the presence of oxygen inside a sealed container (or bomb). The heat released from combustion is transferred to a mass of fluid (air or water) that surrounds the container. The heating value is calculated from the product of mass of fluid x specific heat of fluid x net temperature increase. The calculated heating value must be corrected for heat losses to the mass of container, heat conduction through the container wall, and heat losses to the surrounding of the device. In modern calorimeters the corrections are made automatically using sensors and controllers. The resulting measured heating value is considered <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> (high heating value) at constant volume because the biomass combustion in the container has taken place inside the fixed volume of the container. The resulting <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> can be expressed based on dry mass content of the sample biomass...|$|E

Tests were carried out to compare and evaluate the property of bamboo and rice straw pellets, rice straw being the other main source of biomass solid fuel in China. All physical properties of untreated bamboo pellets (UBP), untreated rice straw pellets (URP), carbonized bamboo pellets (CBP), and carbonized rice straw pellets (CRP) met the requirements of Pellet Fuels Institute Standard Specification for Residential/Commercial Densified including dimension, density, and strength.

40|$|Since {{the price}} of fossil fuel has increased, {{petroleum}} resources have been restricted and the environmental effects have been of great concern. Biofuel has been {{considered to be a}} good solution because it is a clean, non-pollutant and a renewable energy. Biodiesel is one alternative energy that {{plays a major role in}} the energy industry. So, the development of biofuel process is more interesting. Jatropha curcas L. is considered as an alternative energy source in order to help solve the energy crisis. The purpose of this research is to investigate the optimum condition of Jatropha seed extraction via a screw press and its by-product utilization by a pyrolysis method for achieving the maximum mass conversion and energy recovery. In this study, Jatropha seeds were first extracted by a screw press with different discharge aperture sizes, namely, number 4 (4. 0 mm), 8 (7. 0 mm), and 10 (10. 5 mm). The by-product obtained from a screw press was then performed pyrolysis runs at the operating temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 degrees C. Results revealed that the optimum condition was achieved when using discharge aperture number 8 (7. 0 mm) for a screw press and performing the pyrolysis of the by- product at 500 degrees C. The mass conversion efficiency of 35. 8 % refined oil, 21. 8 % bio-char, 14. 6 % bio-oil, and 11. 7 % syn-gas were obtained. Therefore, the utilization of by-product using a pyrolysis can enhance the effectiveness of Jatropha oil extraction with only 16 % mass losses occurred.

50|$|The {{specific}} energy {{content of a}} fuel is the heat energy obtained when a certain quantity is burned (such as a gallon, litre, kilogram). It is sometimes called the heat of combustion.

The high value is obtained when, after the combustion, the water in the exhaust is in liquid form. For the low value, the exhaust has all the water in vapor form (steam). Since water vapor gives up heat energy when it changes from vapor to liquid, the liquid water value is larger since it includes the latent heat of vaporization of water. The difference between the high and low values is significant, about 8 or 9%. This accounts for most of the apparent discrepancy in the <b>heat</b> <b>value</b> of gasoline.

These offer {{the potential for a}} diversification of feedstocks to be used, lower greenhouse gas impacts, and lower costs. Gasification is a cardinal constituent of several of the proposed second generation paths, such as catalytic routes to diesel, gasoline, naphtha, methanol, ethanol and other alcohols, and syngas fermentation routes to ethanol. Prodigious technical procession are made that allows substantially augmented usage of biomass as a fuel. An appealing and executable possibility of biomass utilization for energy production is gasification integrated with a combined cycle. In biomass gasification, there is greater experience with gasifiers for heat and power applications than for fuels yield.

In addition, this study compared the <b>heating</b> <b>values</b> in washed and unwashed samples and suggested the optimal conditions for increasing <b>heating</b> <b>value.</b> Results: Torrefaction increased the <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> by 8. 18 ~ 30. 04 %. Comparing <b>heating</b> <b>values</b> of each condition, the optimal temperature for torrefaction was 300 oC and holding time was 1 hour. The washing process increased the <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> by 19 ~ 27 %. The <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> of the sample treated at 300 oC for three hours was 4310. 80 kcal/kg, which was greater than the first class wood pellet of 4300 kcal/kg. Conclusions: This study proved that the torrefaction and washing process increased the <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> of water hyacinth. Therefore, water hyacinth is expected to be an eco-friendly biomass which substitutes for wood pellet...|$|R
40|$|Deregulation {{and open}} access {{in the natural}} gas {{pipeline}} industry has changed the gas business environment towards greater reliance on local energy flow rate measurement. What was once a large, stable, and well-defined source of natural gas is now a composite from many small suppliers with greatly varying gas compositions. Unfortunately, the traditional approach to energy flow measurement [using a gas chromatograph (GC) for composition assay {{in conjunction with a}} flow meter] is only cost effective for large capacity supplies (typically greater than 1 to 30 million scfd). A less costly approach will encourage more widespread use of energy measurement technology. In turn, the US will benefit from tighter gas inventory control, more efficient pipeline and industrial plant operations, and ultimately lower costs to the consumer. An assessment of the state and direction of technology for natural gas energy flow rate measurement is presented. The alternative technologies were ranked according to their potential to dramatically reduce capital and operating and maintenance (O and M) costs, while improving reliability and accuracy. The top-ranked technologies take an unconventional inference approach to the energy measurement problem. Because of that approach, they will not satisfy the fundamental need for composition assay, but have great potential to reduce industry reliance on the GC. Technological feasibility of the inference approach was demonstrated through the successful development of data correlations that relate energy measurement properties (molecular weight, mass-based heating value, standard density, molar ideal <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>value,</b> standard volumetric heating value, density, and volume-based heating value) to three inferential properties: standard sound speed, carbon dioxide concentration, and nitrogen concentration (temperature and pressure are also required for the last two). The key advantage of this approach is that inexpensive on-line sensors may be used to measure the inferential variables, which can then be applied (through the data correlations) to convert existing flow meters (ultrasonic, orifice, turbine, rotary, Coriolis, diaphragm, etc.) for on-line energy measurement. The practical issues for field development were evaluated using two transducers extracted from a $ 100 ultrasonic domestic gas meter, and a $ 400 infrared sensor...|$|E
40|$|The {{scale of}} the energy {{business}} today and a favorable and promising economic environment {{for the production of}} natural gas, requires study of the thermophysical behavior of fluids: sophisticated experimentation yielding accurate, new volumetric data, and development and improvement of thermodynamic models. This work contains theoretical and experimental contributions in the form of 1) the revision and update of a field model to calculate compressibility factors starting from the <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> and the mole fractions of diluents in natural gas mixtures; 2) new reference quality volumetric data, gathered with state of the art techniques such as magnetic suspension densimetry and isochoric phase boundary determinations; 3) a rigorous first-principles uncertainty assessment for density measurements; and 4) a departure technique for the extension of these experimental data for calculating energy functions. These steps provide a complete experimental thermodynamic characterization of fluid samples. A modification of the SGERG model, a standard virial-type model for prediction of compressibility factors of natural gas mixtures, matches predictions from the master GERG- 2008 equation of state, using least squares routines coded at NIST. The modification contains new values for parametric constants, such as molecular weights and the universal gas constant, as well as a new set of coefficients. A state-of-the-art high-pressure, single-sinker magnetic suspension densimeter is used to perform density measurements over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. This work contains data on nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and a typical residual gas mixture (95 % methane, 4 % ethane, and 1 % propane). Experimental uncertainty results from a rigorous, first-principles estimation including composition uncertainty effects. Both low- and high-pressure isochoric apparatus are used to perform phase boundary measurements. Isochoric P-T data can determine the phase boundaries. Combined with density measurements, isochoric data provides isochoric densities. Further mathematical treatment, including noxious volume and thermal expansion corrections, and isothermal integration, leads to energy functions and thus to a full thermodynamic characterization...|$|E
40|$|In this study, oils {{extracted}} from four crops, Jatropha curcas L., Croton megalocarpus Hutch, Calodendrum capense (L. f.) Thunb. (cape chestnut) and Cocos nucifera L. (coconut) were transesterified in methanol using sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. Methyl esters obtained {{were characterized by}} GC-MS and further tested for fuel properties relative to convectional diesel fuels (automotive and kerosene). Methyl esters of commercial oils: sunflower and soybean were also tested for fuel properties for comparison. Some of parameters tested included kinematic viscosity, flash point, distillation temperatures, copper corrosion, cetane number, ash content, and <b>gross</b> <b>heating</b> <b>value.</b> The results showed hexadecanoate and octadecanoate were common fatty acids esters identified in the four analyzed methyl esters. Total unsaturation was highest for Croton ester with 86. 6 %, Jatropha and C. capense esters had unsaturation of 65. 2 % and 61. 2 %, respectively, while coconut ester recorded only 2. 8 %. The ester viscosities at 40 ° C were with range of 4. 16 - 4. 63 mm 2 /s except coconut ester with viscosity 2. 71 mm 2 /s, which is close to that of kerosene 2. 35 mm 2 /s. The esters {{were found to be}} less volatile that diesel fuels with coconut esters registering as most volatile among the esters. Esters of sunflower and soybean have their volatility very close to that of Jatropha ester. The flash points of the esters were typically much higher (> 100 ° C) than petroleum diesels, automotives and kerosene (74 and 45. 5 ° C, respectively). Jatropha, sunflower and soybean esters passed the ASTM standard D 6751 for flash point; 130 ° C minimum, all the esters however were within the European standard EN- 14214 for biodiesel of above 101 ° C. The density of the esters was found to be 2 - 4 % higher than that of petroleum automotive diesel and 10 - 12 % more than that of kerosene. The heating values of the esters were however 12 % lower than diesel fuels on average. In general, coconut esters were found to compare well with kerosene {{while the rest of the}} esters showed properties very close to that of automotive diesel and can thus be used as neat or blended fuels in diesel engines without any modifications...|$|E
