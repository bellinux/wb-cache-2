40|$|Commercial {{testing of}} <b>Intumescent</b> <b>paints</b> can be {{extremely}} expensive. There {{is a need to}} develop lab scale systems that can cost effectively both study and test <b>intumescent</b> <b>paints</b> under conditions that are closer to commercial and real time fire tests. This research aims to present a strong case for using an impinging flame based rig to test intumescent coatings. The main feature of using flame impingement is the heterogeneous absorption of heat along the wall surface. This property is a great advantage because <b>intumescent</b> <b>paints</b> under complex fire conditions can be simulated more realistically. The heating technique is coupled with advance diagnostics methods to highlight behaviour that has not been observed before. Physical aspects of commercial coatings, under the new setup, are compared to the cone calorimeter – traditional testing setup The process of intumescence was observed through the use of diagnostic techniques such as Schlieren, thermal and digital imaging. Cross sectional area and surface textures were captured using digital images of fully intumesced char samples that revealed distinct internal structures and surface textures. Temperature of the substrate, Tb, was recorded using a thermocouple attached to the back surface of the panel under different heating conditions. Schlieren technique, based on the refraction of light phenomenon, has never been use to examine the physical aspects of intumescence. It helped highlight the interaction between the flame and paint surface. The impingement of non-reactive fuel, at low separations was clearly visible and was responsible for influencing mode shape of the resulting char. The expulsions phenomenon observed using this technique has not been visually observed before. It occurred during the pustule appearance phase offering conclusive evidence that invisible gases escape {{from the surface of the}} paint. The measurement of char expansion and its rate of growth whilst engulfed in luminous diffusion flames is a methodology developed using this technique. The results revealed that formulations tested had unique expansion behaviours and growth pattern. Furthermore, an expansion activation temperature (EAT) range with respect to substrate temperature was identified for each formulation, which was found to be consistent under a variety of experimental conditions. The distinctive yellow colour of a diffusion flames engulfs a coating during a test. Due to this, the process of intumescence has not been observed visually. Thermal imaging was used in this study because it allowed the user to bypass the flame and observe intumescence as it occurred. Using thermal imaging, the physical aspects of intumescence were studied in extensive detail and salient characteristics were identified. The appearance of surface pustules followed by majority of the expansion were characterised as the two distinct phases in the intumescence process. Analysis of the surface temperature revealed that the thermal profile of the surface was non-uniform and highly localized in nature. This was attributed to the higher temperature of the pustules relative to the paint surface. Results from thermal imaging combined well with the Schlieren technique to develop a coherent understanding of the expansion process. Diagnostic equipment, particularly thermal and digital imaging, were also used on tests conducted in a cone calorimeter. The results between cone heater and impinging flame-based tests were compared. The degree of intumescence, surface temperature profile and various characteristics were found to be different between both methods. Finally, the use of the techniques was extended to study the process of intumescence and complex char growth patterns on T-shaped panels coated with intumescent formulations. Char growth was observed to be complex and non-linear as compared to flat panel systems. A novel Image processing algorithm using the thermal imaging data from the cone calorimeter was developed marking a further advancement to the use of this technique and gain insight into the growth mechanism when examining a complicated three dimensional system such T-panels...|$|R

To guide the safety management of hybrid hydrogen–gasoline fueling stations, which utilize liquid hydrogen as an energy carrier, the scale of gasoline pool fires was estimated using the hazard assessment tool Toxic Release Analysis of Chemical Emissions (TRACE). Subsequently, the temperature and the stress due to temperature distribution were estimated using ANSYS. Based on the results, the safety of liquid hydrogen storage tanks was discussed. It was inferred that the emissivity of the outer material of the tank and the safety distance between liquid hydrogen storage tanks and gasoline dispensers should be less than 0. 2 and more than 8. 5  m, respectively, to protect the liquid hydrogen storage tank from the gasoline pool fire. To reduce the safety distance, several measures are required, e. g. additional thermal shields such as protective <b>intumescent</b> <b>paint</b> and water sprinkler systems and an increased slope to lead gasoline off to a safe domain away from the liquid hydrogen storage tank...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} {{exerted by}} temperature on the resistant capacity of structural steel is well known. A highly efficient protection system for steel {{consists of the}} application of <b>intumescent</b> <b>paints.</b> In the case of fire, their effectiveness {{is based on the}} property that when they come into contact with flames they react by swelling to form an insulating layer, referred to as "intumescence", which impedes the propagation of heat. These paints do not require continuous maintenance though their service behaviour depends on the exposure conditions to which they are exposed. This paper studies the behaviour of two acrylated rubber type intumescent systems exposed to a galvanising plant for 16 months, evaluating the effect of the environment on the capacity to intumesce of the coating when subjected to heating. Es conocida la influencia que ejerce la temperatura en la capacidad resistente del acero estructural. Un sistema de protección del acero, altamente efectivo, consiste en la utilización de pinturas intumescentes. Su efectividad se basa en el hecho de que, en el caso eventual de un incendio, al entrar en contacto con la llama reaccionan hinchándose y formando una capa aislante que se denomina "intumescencia" y que impide la propagación del calor. Estas pinturas no precisan de un mantenimiento continuo, aunque su comportamiento en servicio depende de las condiciones de exposición.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was an {{inventory}} of fire retardant treated wood, fire-retardanttreatments, properties, and use in different applications, and to analyze the possibilitiesfor the future. The project was funded by TCN – Träcentrum Norr. Expected industrialbenefit was an update of knowledge for wooden buildings. Fire retardant treatments can improve the reaction to fire properties of wood and thehighest fire classifications for combustible products can be reached, for example class Bs 1,d 0. This means that visible wood surfaces {{can be used in}} higher and larger buildings. Fire retardant treatment has no or very limited effect on the fire resistance of structuralelements, as the charring rate is hardly changed. One exception is <b>intumescent</b> fireretardant <b>paints</b> that swell and may postpone charring and thus increase the fireresistance. However, the improved fire behavior of many fire retardant treated woodproducts deteriorates over time, especially at outdoor use due to leaching. A system ofdurability classes has been developed as a complement to fire classes and makes itpossible for potential users to find reliable products for different uses. Fire retardanttreated wood products can maintain their properties after accelerated and/or natural agingif the retention levels are high enough, but many products are losing their firecharacteristics during aging. Paint systems are usually needed at exterior applications tomaintain the fire performance properties. The main use of fire retardant treated wood is asvisible wood surfaces indoors, such as in escape routes, apartments in high-rise buildings,public buildings and sports arenas.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{behaviour}} of four intumescent systems for steel was investigated experimentally. The main {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the behaviour of the systems during different fire scenarios including standardized furnace testing, tests in cone calorimeter and ad hoc tests including ceiling jets and fire plumes. The experimental campaign shows that two of the investigated systems did perform very poorly in the furnace tests compared to what they were designed for, despite being the systems having the best swelling in the cone calorimeter tests. This highlights the importance of adhesion at high temperature for this type of systems. Since adhesion is crucial a more relevant evaluation for this type of systems ought to be a test where the flows around the specimen can be characterized and controlled, i. e. a ceiling jet or a fire plume scenario. This is especially important as steel protected with intumescent systems are often used in large open spaces where local fire plumes and ceiling jets are expected.

Waterborne resins of different types (vinylic, acrylic, and styrene-acrylic) were incorporated in an <b>intumescent</b> <b>paint</b> formulation, and characterized extensively in terms of thermal degradation behavior, intumescence thickness, and thermal insulation. Thermal microscopy images of charred foam development provided further information on the particular performance of each type of coating upon heating. The best foam expansion and heat protection results were obtained with the vinyl binders. Rheological measurements showed a complex evolution of the viscoelastic characteristics of the materials with temperature.

Comparison between the predictions using the correlations and the measured results in fire resistance tests shows good agreement.

The calculation of the structure will be performed in accordance with the national standard CódigoTécnico de la Edificación. The second part of this work will be to evaluate several techniques of passive fire protection and make a study to determine which one is the best solution from the economic point of view.

40|$|In the {{collaborative}} forum Positive footprint housing® Riksbyggen is building the Viva residential quarter, {{which is a}} sustainability project at the very forefront of what is possible with contemporary construction. The idea is that this residential quarter should be fully sustainable in ecological, economic and social terms. Since 2013, a number of pilot studies have been completed {{under the auspices of}} the Viva project framework thanks to financing from the Swedish Energy Agency. The various building frame alternatives that have been evaluated are precast concrete, cast in-situ concrete and solid wood, all proposed by leading commercial suppliers. The report includes a specific requirement for equivalent functions during the use phase of the building, B. An interpretation has been provided that investigates the building engineering aspects in detail, as well as an account of the results based on the social community requirements specified in Viva, durability, fire, noise and energy consumption in the Swedish National Board of Building, Planning and Housing building regulations (BBR), plus Riksbyggen’s own requirements, Sweden Green Building Council’s Environmental Building Gold (Miljöbyggnad Guld) and 100 -year life cycle. Given that the alternatives have different long-term characteristics (and also that our knowledge of these characteristics itself varies), these functional requirements have been addressed by setting up different scenarios in accordance with the EPD standard EN 15978. Because Riksbyggen has specified a requirement for a 100 -year life cycle, we have also opted for an analysis period of 100 years. The results show no significant differences between concrete and timber structures for the same functions during the life cycle, either for climate or for primary energy. The minor differences reported are accordingly less than the degree of uncertainty involved in the study. The available documentation on the composition of the relevant <b>intumescent</b> <b>paint</b> coating on solid wood frames differs from source to source, so it was not possible to fully allow for the significance of this. The LCA has not included functional changes in the building linked to load-bearing characteristics, noise, moisture, health or other problems that may result in increased maintenance and replacement. The concrete houses have been dimensioned for 100 years, for instance, in accordance with tried and tested standards and experience. The solid wood house is not dimensioned in the same way, and this has led to us having to assume various scenarios. The results also show the following:   • The uncertainties involved in comparing different structures and alternative solutions are very significant. The results are affected by factors such as life cycle, the functional requirements taken into consideration, transportation, design and structural details, etc.   • Variations in the built items and a considerable degree of uncertainty in the assumptions make it difficult to obtain significant results on comparisons. Only actual construction projects with known specific data, declared from a life cycle perspective that takes into account actual building developer requirements and involving different scenarios (best, documented and worst-case) for the user stage can currently be compared.   • In the other hand, comparisons restricted to different concrete structures only, or to different timber structures only, ought to involve a lower degree of uncertainty, These would then provide results that are significant as well as improvement requirements that are relevant.   • There is potential for improving concrete by imposing requirements on the material   • There is potential for improving solid wood frames by developing and guaranteeing well-documented long-term characteristics for all functional requirements.   The LCAs were performed as an iterative process where all parties were given the opportunity to submit their viewpoints and suggestions for changes during the course of the work. This helped ensure that all alternatives have been properly thought through. Because, during the project, Riksbyggen opted to procure a concrete frame, in the final stage the researchers involved focused on ensuring the procurement process would result in the concrete frame as built meeting the requirements set out above. As things currently stand, the material requirements for the concrete are limited by the production options open to the suppliers, and this is therefore being investigated in the manufacture of precast concrete frames for the Viva cooperative housing association. ...|$|E
40|$|Concrete filled steel hollow {{structural}} (CFS) sections {{are increasingly}} {{used to support}} large compressive loads in buildings, with the concrete infill and the steel tube working together to yield several benefits both at ambient temperature and during a fire. These members are now widely applied {{in the design of}} highly optimized multi-storey and high rise buildings where fire resistance ratings of two or more hours may be required. Whilst the response and design of these sections at ambient temperatures is reasonably well understood, their response in fire, and thus their fire resistance design, is less well established. Structural fire resistance design guidance is available but has been developed based on tests of predominantly short, concentrically-loaded, small-diameter columns in braced frames using normal strength concrete. The current prescriptive guidance is limited and the design of CFS columns is thus often based on a detailed performance based approach, which can be time consuming and expensive and which is generally not well supported by a deep understanding of CFS columns’ behaviour in real fires. This thesis aims to understand the fundamental thermal and mechanical factors at play within these sections so as to provide guidance on how to improve their design for fire resistance when applied either as unprotected or protected sections. A meta-analysis of available furnace test data is used to demonstrate that current guidance fails to capture the relevant mechanics and thus poorly predicts fire resistance. It is also demonstrated that the predictive abilities of the available design standards vary with physical characteristics of the CFS section such as shape and size. A factor which has been observed in furnace tests on CFS sections but which is not accounted for in available guidance is the formation of an air gap between the steel tube and the concrete core due to differential expansion; this affects their structural response in fire. The insulating effect of air gap formation has not previously been addressed in literature and an experimental program is presented to systematically assess the effects of a gap on the heat transfer through the section; showing that the presence of even a 1 mm gap is important. To explicitly assess the heat transfer response within both unprotected and fire protected (i. e. insulated) CFS sections, 34 large scale standard furnace tests were performed in partnership with an industry sponsor. Fourteen tests on large scale unloaded unprotected CFS sections are presented to assess current capability to predict the thermal response and to assess the effects of different sectional and material parameters on heating. New best practice thermal modelling guidance is suggested based on comparison between the models and observed temperatures from the tests. Twenty CFS specimens of varying size and shape, protected with different types and thicknesses of <b>intumescent</b> <b>paint</b> fire insulation, were also tested unloaded in a furnace to understand the thermal evolution within protected CFS sections and to develop design guidance to support application of intumescent coatings in performance based fire resistance design of CFS sections. These tests demonstrate that the intumescent coatings were far more effective than expected when applied to CFS sections, and that current methods of designing the coatings’ thickness are overly conservative. The reason for this appears to be that the calculation of effective section factor which is used in the prescription of intumescent coating thicknesses is based on the thermal response of unprotected CFS sections which display fundamentally different heating characteristics from protected sections due {{to the development of a}} thermal gradient in the concrete core. It is also demonstrated (by calculation supported by the testing presented herein) that the steel failure temperature (i. e. limiting temperature) of an unprotected CFS column in fire is significantly higher than one which is protected; procedures to determine the limiting temperature of protected sections are suggested. Finally, the residual strength of fire-exposed CFS columns is examined through structural testing of 19 of the 34 fire tested columns along with unheated control specimens. The results provide insights into the residual response of unprotected and protected CFS section exposed to fire, and demonstrate a reasonable ability to calculate their residual structural capacity. The work presented in this thesis has shed light on the ability of available guidance to rationally predict the thermal and structural response to fire of CFS columns, has improved the understanding of the thermal evolution within protected and unprotected CFS sections in fire, has provided best-practice guidance and material input parameters for both thermal and structural modelling of CFS sections, and has improved understanding of the residual capacity of CFS sections after a fire...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Dünyanın en büyük buluşlarından biri olan ateş pek çok yerde hayatımızı kolaylaştırdığı gibi kontrol edilmediğinde sonuçları felaketlere neden olan yangınlara yol açabilmektedir. Zamanla medeniyetin ve teknolojinin gelişmesiyle birlikte artan yangınlar, deprem gibi gerek insan hayatı açısından gerekse maddi açıdan ülkenin gelişimini etkiler duruma gelmiştir. Tarih boyunca meydana gelen yangınlar çok büyük can ve mal kayıplarına sebep olmuştur. Bunun nedeni olarak en başta yangın güvenliği bilincinin yeterince yerleşmemiş olması ve yönetmeliklerin tam anlamıyla uygulanmıyor olması gelmektedir. Yangının oluşumu kesin olarak önlenemese de alınacak önlemler ile vereceği zarar en aza indirilebilir. Yangının vereceği zarardan korunmak amacıyla yapının tasarım, yapım, işletme, kullanım süreci ve bakım süreçleri boyunca yangın güvenliği adına tüm önlemler alınmak zorundadır. Yangın da aynı deprem gibi nerde ve ne zaman olacağı belli olmayan ve sonuçları felaketle sonuçlanan ve genellikle ihmaller zinciriyle oluşan bir olaydır. Fakat ülkemizde yangına deprem kadar önem verilmemekte, tedbirler genellikle üstünkörü alınmaktadır. Başta Soma maden faciası olmak üzere ülkemizde son yıllarda görülen felaketler yangın esnasında yapılması gerekenler hakkında yeterli bilgimiz ve tecrübeli elemanımızın olmayışını ortaya koymaktadır. Yönetmeliklerin yangın için uyarlanması ve daha kapsamlı bir yangın yönetmeliği oluşturulması gerekmektedir. Yapılan bu tez çalışmasında; BYKHY (Binalarının Yangından Korunması Hakkında Yönetmelik) kapsamında öncelikle yanma ve yangın kavramlarından bahsedilmiş temel bilgilerin oluşması sağlanmıştır. Dünyada meydana gelmiş olan büyük metro yangınlarının nedenleri ve sonuçlarına değinilmiştir. Metrolarda meydana gelebilecek olan yangın olaylarına karşı alınması gereken önlemlerden söz edilmiştir. Bu bağlamda İstanbul metrosunda kullanılan yangın senaryoları, nasıl oluşturuldukları, istasyon ve vagonlarda kullanılan malzeme özellikleri ve hangi yönetmeliklerden yararlanıldığı anlatılmıştır. Metrolarda yangın güvenliği bilincinin oluşturulması doğrultusunda hazırlanan tez çalışması, beş ana bölümden oluşmaktadır. Birinci bölümde konuya giriş yapılmış, metrolarda yangın güvenliği konusunda yapılmış olan çalışmalar ve tezler araştırılıp konunun geçmişten bugüne gelişimi ele alınmış ve tezin amacı ortaya konulmuştur. İkinci bölümde yanma ve yangın ile ilgili genel kavramlar detayları ile anlatılmıştır. Ayrıca yangın çeşitleri, söndürme yöntemleri, yangın safhasındaki tehlikeler ve yangının insan vücuduna etkileri bu bölümde ele alınmıştır. Üçüncü bölümde taşıyıcı sistem elemanlarının yangın güvenliği kapsamında betonarme ve çelik taşıyıcı sistemlerde yangın güvenliği anlatılarak yangın yalıtımı yöntemleri ortaya konulmuştur. Dördüncü bölümde metrolar başlığı altında metrolarla ilgili genel bilgi verilmiş ve metroların tarihçesinden bahsedilmiştir.

Finally, so far rarely been the subject of a thesis in the metro are given information about the studies that have been made about fire safety. Unwanted fire is a destructive force that causes many thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of property loss each year. People around the world expect that their homes and workplaces will be safe from the ravages of an unwanted fire. Unfortunately, fires can occur in almost any kind of building. The safety of occupants depends on many factors in the design and construction of buildings, including the expectation that certain buildings and parts of buildings will not collapse in a fire or allow the fire spread. Fire deaths and property losses could be eliminated if all fires were prevented, or if all fires were extinguished at the flame. Fire can be reduce the probability of occurance, but it is impossible to prevent all major fires. Given that some fires will always occur, there are many strategies for reducing their impact, and some combination of these will generally be used. Although tunnel fires are not a common case, "Ground the public transportation systems" to be used by the crowded masses, requires special measures in this regard. Turned into a disaster of the many results of the causes of fires occurring in Metro reveals the lack of fire safety precautions need to be taken first. The use of smoking materials, such as flammable and toxic plastic lights, and deficiency of help devices and lack of fire resistant of electrical cables used in railway cars are caused a fire disaster. As in most of the disastrous fire occurred in metro is not the cause of death from fire, carbon monoxide and cyanide gas in the smoke are known to be toxic poisoning. The first thing to be done is get rid of toxic fumes. The lack of smoke evacuation systems in case of a fire in the subway tunnel is the most important reason that converts the results of the subway fire disaster occurred in the past. Besides, lack of the active safety fire extinguisher tubes, sprinklers and other fighting equipment occured terrible results. These results clearly indicate that the lack of precautions cause fire in the world in the past year. Many studies have been done in the world on fire, regulations and arranged a separate regulation was made especially for the subway. Compared with the developed countries, subway tunnel in fire safety we have a long way to cross in our country. There are no regulation in Turkey except building of Fire Protection (BYKHY) and TSE Regulation. Especially metro transport network of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality which will spread to every place within the working target of 776 km of metro network will arise due to the underground fire safety and smoke evacuation system should give more importance. For the moment in the subway and other underground structures NFPA and BS (British Standard) was used to as well. Not only in the subway but also all businesses operating underground fire and smoke evacuation systems security is of the most importance. May 13, 2014 date as a result of the fire that occurred in the coal mine in Soma 301 people dead because of smoke poisoning is the most concrete examples. In this case show that the country has not enough precision about safety. As a result of the statistics conducted by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, there are about 10, 000 residential building fires every year. When the fire occures unclear like earthquake. Therefore, it is necessary to take lots of measures to fire as the measures taken for the earthquake. Fire disaster occurs much more frequently then earthquake. Therefore, the fire regulation must be regulated or produce new fire regulations. Thesis prepared in accordance with the creation of fire safety awareness in metro consists of five main sections. In the first part made introduction to the topic, studies and dissertations that have been made about fire safety in underground researched the subject deal with in the past development has been demonstrated to date and purpose of the thesis. General concepts related to the second part, burning and fire is described in detail. In addition, types of fire extinguishing methods, the effects of fire hazards in the fire phase and the human body are discussed in this section. Therefore, the growth rate of fire, high temperature, respiratory distress caused by toxic gases, collapse, electrical and chemical hazard are the other hazards in the fire place. The third chapter in the context of fire safety in concrete and steel structure structural elements explaining fire safety fire insulation methods are put forward. In this section is mention about the fire resistance of reinforced concrete system including the effects of high-temperature in steel and concrete. In addition, fire resistance of steel structural systems and measures to be taken are also included in this section. These measures are; spray-applied systems, plate systems, prefabricated systems, painting with <b>intumescent</b> <b>paint,</b> fill with concrete and fill with water. So that, the supporting elements can provide resistance to fire. Fourth section is mentioned about general information about the underground subways and a short history of the subway. In addition, measures should be taken in context of the subway fire safety, ventilation and smoke extraction systems, accounts, scenarios that have been made as a result of the simulation program in the subway and finally the world were mentioned in a large underground fire occurred. Fire safety measures in the metro are analyzed in three categories; wagons, tunnels and stations. Finally, we focused on large underground fire that occurred in the world in this section. Paris(Couroness), Londra (King’s Cross), Baku, Eurochannel (Mans Tunnel) and Korean underground fires are the most important fires in the world. This fire of the reasons given in detail and describe the measures taken afterwards in this part. The fifth and final section is mentioned about measures to be taken for fire safety in our country. Therefore in our country must have been a new regulations about this issue. As mentioned in the previous section, fire occurs too often and time is not clear. Compared with the earthquake, the incidence of the measures taken are very rare earthquake is much more than measures to fire. This contrasts situation must be resolve and make modifications in the regulations about fire. Outside America, Canada and other developed european country, there is no measures about fire. Moreover, we need to rise above world standard about fire safety in subway tunnels. We will expect legal arrengements and lots of developments about fire safety in our country. Yüksek LisansM.
