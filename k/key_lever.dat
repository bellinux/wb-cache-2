5000|$|The Jankó {{keyboard}} is {{a musical}} keyboard layout for a piano designed by Paul von Jankó in 1882. It {{was designed to}} overcome two limitations on the traditional piano keyboard: the large-scale geometry of the keys (stretching beyond a ninth, or even an octave, can be difficult or impossible for pianists with small hands), {{and the fact that}} each scale has to be fingered differently. Instead of a single row, the Jankó keyboard has an array of keys consisting of two interlocking manuals with three touch-points for each <b>key</b> <b>lever.</b> Each vertical column of keys is a semitone away from its neighboring columns, and on each horizontal row of keys the interval from one note to the next is a whole step.|$|E
50|$|Simple telegraph-like keys {{were long}} {{used to control}} the flow of {{electricity}} in laboratory tests of electrical circuits. Often, these were simple ‘strap’ keys in which {{a bend in the}} <b>key</b> <b>lever</b> provided the key's spring action. Telegraph keys were once used in the study of operant conditioning with pigeons. Starting in the 1940s, initiated by B. F. Skinner at Harvard University, the keys were mounted vertically behind a small circular hole about the height of a pigeon's beak in the front wall of an operant conditioning chamber. Electromechanical recording equipment detected the closing of the switch whenever the pigeon pecked the key. Depending on the psychological questions being investigated, keypecks might have resulted in the presentation of food or other stimuli. Modern pigeon response keys are specially made switches but are still called ‘keys’ due to their origins as telegraph keys.|$|E
5000|$|The ophicleide, {{like the}} keyed bugle (the soprano member of its 'family') has a {{fingering}} system {{like no other}} wind instrument. All keys except one are normally closed, opening only when a finger presses the associated <b>key</b> <b>lever.</b> Just below the bell is {{the largest of the}} key-covered tone holes, which is normally open, closing only when the lever is pressed. This normally open tone hole is the acoustic bell, with the bell itself having little effect on sound or pitch. The sound produced with no key levers pressed is the nominal pitch of the instrument. If the player presses the lever for this normally open tone hole, that hole is closed and the now-longer air column extends past this hole up to the bell, lowering the pitch by one half step. In general, the player can obtain all the [...] "partial" [...] pitches available for a given air column length. To play a higher series of partials, he opens one of the normally closed tone holes, effectively making that hole the [...] "bell" [...] of the instrument, with a corresponding shorter air column and higher series of pitches. The left hand controls three such tone holes plus the normally open one below the bell. Pitches in the upper and middle range of the instrument can be obtained by using only the left hand's set of tone holes, and the right hand can hold and stabilize the instrument. At the point where the air column is shortened by opening all of the left hand tone holes, there comes a difficult couple of notes that can best be played by continuing to shorten the air column with two fingers of the right hand, before the series of partials [...] "wraps" [...] and the left hand is used again for another set of notes. In the lowest octave, some pitches cannot be obtained very well using the holes closer to the bell. For these notes, the other fingers of the right hand can open a few more tone holes that are relatively closer to the mouthpiece than to the bell. Some instruments were made with between one and three extra right hand keys to provide better intonation for specific notes in this register. The right hand keys may also be used in the upper registers as alternate fingerings to facilitate faster passages or to improve intonation. With the exception of these special few pitches in the low octave, the combinations of partials on various sets of opened tone holes results in the left hand fingers going through something very similar to what they would be doing to manipulate the valves on a modern brass instrument.|$|E

30|$|In (Shah et al. 2005), {{it is well}} {{explained}} that the key difficulty of evaluating advanced ATM operations is to address emergent behavior, i.e. behavior which emerges from the combined dynamic actions and reactions by individual systems and humans within the overall ATM system. This emergent behavior cannot be foreseen and evaluated by examining the individual behaviors alone. To understand {{the behavior of a}} complex socio-technical system we must understand how the parts act together to form the behavior of the whole (Bar-Yam 2003). It is the goal of this research to study the emergence concept in air transportation, and develop a deeper understanding of system-wide performance issues and/or benefits arising from a change in design. In this paper we aim to identify <b>key</b> <b>lever</b> points through which the safety of runway crossing operations at airports can be significantly affected. Our approach is to embrace Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) because it has been extensively used to: a) analyze complex socio-technical systems and their emergent behavior (Shah et al. 2005; Chen & Cheng 2010; Stroeve et al. 2003; Wolfe et al. 2009); and b) address cases where agents need to collaborate and solve problems in a distributed fashion (Klein et al. 2004). ABMS provides a platform to integrate multiple heterogeneous components at different levels. Models of actors, technological systems, and the operating environment as well as the interactions between them can be naturally covered. Therefore, it is expected that an ABMS approach will help: a) predicting airport system-wide behavior emerging from the interactions between individual components; b) identifying and understanding <b>key</b> <b>lever</b> points; and c) managing dependencies between the activities of multiple actors both at the organizational and operational level.|$|E
