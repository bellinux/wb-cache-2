2500|$|August 4–5 saw {{localised}} flooding {{across the}} UK in Devon, Tyne and Wear, West Yorkshire and Southern Scotland from torrential rains, in places exceeding 30mm over a short time. This storm crossed the North Sea and was designated as <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> [...] "Frida" [...] by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Rainfall totals up to 100mm in 24 hours across southern Norway {{and parts of}} Denmark resulted in flooding and landslips. Towards {{the end of the}} month more flash floods were reported in Cumbria, leading to landslides and a derailed train. High waters on the River Ehen tore down the side of a house in Egremont, Cumbria.|$|E
2500|$|The River is also {{noteworthy}} for {{its natural}} and man-made history. In 1887, the Illinois General Assembly, partly {{in response to}} concerns arising out of an <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> in 1885 that threatened the city's water supply, decided to reverse {{the flow of the}} Chicago River through civil engineering by taking water from Lake Michigan and discharging it into the Mississippi River watershed. In 1889, the Illinois General Assembly created the Chicago Sanitary District (now The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District) to replace the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which had become inadequate to carry the city's increasing sewage and commercial navigation needs, with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, a much larger waterway. The District completed this man-made hydrologic connection between the Great Lakes and Mississippi watershed in 1900 [...] by reversing the flow of the Main Stem and South Branch of the river using a series of canal locks, and increasing the river's flow from Lake Michigan, causing it to empty into the new Canal. In 1999, this system was named a 'Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium' by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{long-term}} effects of climate change, the frequency and severity of <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> have been increasing. Given the risks posed by climate change, particularly the changes in <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events,</b> {{the question of how to}} adapt to these changes and mitigate their negative impacts has received great attention from policy makers. The overall goals of this study are to examine whether farmers adapt to <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> through crop diversification and which factors influence farmers' decisions on crop diversification against <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> in China. To limit the scope of this study, we focus on drought and flood events only. Based on a unique large-scale household survey in nine provinces, this study finds that farmers respond to <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> by increasing crop diversification. Their decision to diversify crops is significantly influenced by their experiences of <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> in the previous year. Such results are understandable because farmers' behaviors are normally based on their expectations. Moreover, household characteristics also affect farmers' decisions on crop diversification strategy, and their effects differ by farmers' age and gender.

The socio-economic impacts of the <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> such as floods, droughts, cyclones, hail storm, thunderstorm, heat and cold waves have been increasing due to large growth of population and its migration towards urban areas which has led to greater vulnerability.

40|$|<b>Extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> are {{expected}} to increase in frequency and magnitude due to climate change. Their effects on vegetation are widely unknown. Here, experimental grassland and heath commu-nities in Central Europe were exposed either to a simulated single drought or to a prolonged heavy rainfall event. The magnitude of manipulations imitated the local 100 -year <b>weather</b> <b>extreme</b> according to extreme value statistics. Overall pro-ductivity of both plant communities remained sta-ble {{in the face of}} drought and heavy rainfall, despite significant effects on tissue die-back. Grassland communities were more resistant against the <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> than heath commu-nities. Furthermore, effects of <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> on community tissue die-back were modi-fied by functional diversity, even though conclu-siveness in this part is limited by the fact that only one species composition was available per diversity level within this case study. More diverse grassland communities exhibited less tissue die-back than less complex grassland communities. On the other side, more diverse heath communities were more vulnerable to <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> compared to less complex heath communities. Furthermore, legumes did not effectively contribute to the buf-fering against <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> in both vegetation types. Tissue die-back proved a strong stress response in plant communities exposed to 100 -year <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events,</b> even though one important ecosystem function, namely pro-ductivity, remained surprisingly stable in this experiment.

40|$|Overview The Australian Psychological Society {{believes}} {{that the threat of}} <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> on Australian communities requires coordinated, evidence-based efforts across 3 levels of government and across sectors to improve communities’ capacity to prepare, respond and recover.
