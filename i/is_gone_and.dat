After she finds it, Hardenberg walks in the door and struggles with Jule when he recognises her. Hearing them, Jan comes downstairs and knocks Hardenberg unconscious with a flashlight. Not knowing what to do, they call Peter and he comes to their aid.|$|E

5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor.

5|$|Lyrically, All Hope Is Gone {{centers on}} themes such as anger, disaffection, obsession, {{and the music}} industry. The album name also {{features}} a more prominent focus on politics than their previous albums. Slipknot promoted All Hope Is Gone on a world tour and at the Mayhem Festival. Generally well received by critics, the album reached the top position on nine record charts worldwide, including the Billboard 200—the first Slipknot album to do so. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on August 10, 2010 for shipments in excess of 1,000,000 albums in the United States. It is the final studio album released by the band to include two longtime members: bassist and founding member Paul Gray, who {{was found dead in}} an Iowa hotel on May 24, 2010, almost two years after the release of All Hope <b>Is</b> <b>Gone,</b> <b>and</b> drummer Joey Jordison, who departed from the group in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, King Stewart {{learns that}} Redbush <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> {{he makes his}} way to Quahog to reclaim his wife and kill Griffin Peterson. King Stewart's army arrives in Quahog where they terrorize the colony (similar to a scene from Blazing Saddles). King Stewart orders Cockney First Lieutenant (Chris) to search every house for them. Upon being {{discovered}} by the First Lieutenant, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush are confronted by King Stewart. Griffin Peterson threatens to kill the officer, while King Stewart threatens to kill Redbush. After exchanging threats without getting anywhere, Griffin and Stewart decide to settle their dispute with a talent show, with the winner winning Lady Redbush's hand in marriage, and ownership of the town of Quahog. For his act, King Stewart steals his jester's mostly unfunny jokes about his Aunt Frieda. However, Griffin, Quagmire, Joe, Cleveland, Mort, and Seamus effectively steal the show with a techno-rock number from Revenge of the Nerds. This was enough to defeat King Stewart in the talent show. After King Stewart and his army leaves, Griffin and Redbush remain in Quahog to live happily ever after.|$|E

5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries {{to act as if}} it does not bother him, but is not able to keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E

Murdoch turns the habitat toward the star it had been turned away from, and the city experiences sunlight for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Next to Ashfield {{is the old}} {{graveyard}} {{containing the}} ruins of a church that was dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. This was a medieval church used for Protestant worship until 1795 when it was found to be too small for the congregation and a new one was erected a short way off. The end walls of the old church still stand, the west gable containing a bell turret and the east pierced by a chancel arch, the chancel itself having disappeared. The north wall <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> all that remains of the south wall is an arched opening.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, after Julie convinces Maggie {{that she}} and Mickey need to spend some alone time together, Maggie books a cruise. Mickey is upstairs packing, and when Maggie goes to check on him, she discovers that he {{had died of a}} heart attack, leaving her a widow.

The grieving Maggie is briefly tempted by a bottle of alcohol she finds in Mickey's office but instead pours it down the sink.|$|E
25|$|The Three Book Dunciad has an {{extensive}} inversion of Virgil's Aeneid, {{but it also}} structures itself heavily around a Christological theme. To some degree, this imagery of unholy consecration had been present in Dryden's MacFlecknoe, but Pope's King of Dunces is much more menacing than Thomas Shadwell could ever have been in Dryden's poem. It is {{not a case of}} an unworthy man getting praised that spurs the poem, but rather a force of degradation and decadence that motivates it. Pope is not targeting one man, but rather a social decline that he feels is all but irrevocable. Nevertheless, the poem is still a satire and not a lamentation. The top of society (the kings) may be dulled by spectacle and freak shows, but Dulness is only one force. She is at war with the men of wit, and she can be opposed. In the Four Book Dunciad (or Dunciad B), any hope of redemption or reversal <b>is</b> <b>gone,</b> <b>and</b> the poem is even more nihilistic.|$|E

25|$|They {{discover}} it {{on a nearby}} moon and destroy it by tricking the platforms to fire on their own power supply. On the station, Dax is visiting the Bajoran Temple to thank the Prophets for her pregnancy. Dukat, possessed by the Pah-wraith, suddenly transports in. Dax goes for her phaser but he hits her with bolts of energy from his hands and she collapses. He opens an orb of the prophets and the energy leaves his body, entering the orb which turns black. Outside the station, the Bajoran wormhole implodes. Dukat, back to his old self, apologises to Dax and departs the station. The crew of the Defiant are informed of the attack and rush back to the station. When they arrive, they are informed that the wormhole <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> all the Bajoran orbs have turned dark. Bashir says {{that he was able}} to save the Dax symbiont but not Jadzia. She survives long enough to say goodbye to Worf. Over Jadzia's coffin, Sisko says that he has to leave the station and announces that he is returning to Earth. He departs with his son, Jake (Cirroc Lofton), leaving Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) in charge of DS9.|$|E

Lynsey hits Silas over the head with a rock and believing him to be dead tells Ethan although when they arrive Silas <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> later denies all knowledge of the attack.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Samhain {{was a time}} to {{take stock}} of the herds and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter {{pastures}} after six months in the higher summer pastures. It was also the time to choose which animals would need to be slaughtered for the winter. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock because it is when meat will keep since the freeze has come and also since summer grass <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> free foraging is no longer possible. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On St. Martin's Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal – usually a rooster, goose or sheep – would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house. It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, and was found in some other parts of Europe. At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township sunwise. A bit of the hide would be burnt and everyone would breathe in the smoke. These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.|$|E
