Their final trick appears to transport one of the audience members to the vault of his bank, the Crédit Républicain in Paris, where stacks of new euro bills are stored. At the magicians' commands, the fans in the vault activate, drawing the bills into the vents and then showering the Las Vegas crowd with them. The euros are shown to be real, and the vault in Paris {{is found to be}} empty of its recent shipment of euros. FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), and Interpol agent Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), are then partnered to investigate the Horsemen. The two question the magicians but have no evidence to hold them. Dylan and Alma turn to Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a former magician who now helps to explain the tricks behind other magic acts. Thaddeus demonstrates how they used a mock vault under the Las Vegas stage, and that the group must have stolen the money in Paris before it arrived at the bank, replacing it with <b>flash</b> <b>paper</b> that left no evidence.|$|E

5000|$|The 1998 card is infamous for {{featuring}} a widely pilloried rematch {{of the main}} event of WrestleMania VI, a 1990 pay-per-view event produced by WCW's rival the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in which The Ultimate Warrior had defeated Hulk Hogan for the WWF Championship. Their 1998 return bout is regarded by critics {{as one of the}} worst matches of all time. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter awarded it a minimum score of minus five stars out of five (the lowest ever for a WCW match), and readers of the publication voted it the worst match of the year. Readers of professional wrestling magazine Power Slam cast the same vote; editor Fin Martin called it [...] "one of the worst matches ever held." [...] Then-WCW announcer Gene Okerlund described the contest as a [...] "disaster". Comparing the WrestleMania VI and Halloween Havoc 1998 bouts, Warrior stated: [...] "It's weird that my best match ever was with Hogan, {{and at the same time}} my worst match ever was with Hogan". Hogan felt the contest was ruined by his botching a spot he himself devised, in which he was supposed throw fire at Warrior: Hogan instead lit the <b>flash</b> <b>paper</b> in his own face and legit burnt his mustache and eyebrows. This led to an improvised ending in which Hogan's nephew, Horace, hit Warrior with what Sports Illustrated writer Luke Winkie called [...] "the most unsatisfying chair shot in history".

In 1992 then-CMLL booker Antonio Peña left CMLL to form his own promotion, Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA); Peña had been the mastermind behind the CMLL Minis division {{and most of the}} Minis in CMLL decided to leave with Peña. Serrano {{and a number of other}} wrestlers were brought in to replenish the division. Working in the Mini division does not necessarily mean that Serrano is a dwarf as several short wrestlers work in the [...] "Mini" [...] division. Serrano was given the ring persona of Mascarita Mágica (Spanish for [...] "Little Magic Mask"), an enmascarado, or masked, miniature version of the original Máscara Mágica. When the original Máscara Mágica left CMLL and the company introduced Máscara Mágica II, Serrano's mask and tights were changed to look like the new version. On February 13, 1995 Mascarita Mágica defeated Ultratumbita to win the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship. In April, 1995 Mágica lost a Lucha de Apuesta, or [...] "bet match" [...] to Ultratumbita as part of their storyline and was forced to unmask. On February 27, 1996 Mascarita Mágica lost the Minis title to Damiancito El Guerrero. In the mid to late-1990s CMLL did not focus much on their Minis division, their rarely made it onto their television shows. Due to various injuries Serrano's wrestling style had to be modified, toning down the high risk flying moves, the change in wrestling style accompanied a change in [...] "attitude" [...] as Serrano was turned from being a Tecnico (the Lucha Libre term for a Face or [...] "good guy" [...] character) to a Rudo (Heel or bad guy character) called [...] "Fire". Working as a Rudo allowed Serrano to control the match more and work a more grounded style than as a Tecnino. As Fire Serrano incorporated actual fire in his entrance, including a trick where it looks like his hands are lit on fire. He also incorporated the use of the fireball as an illegal weapon, achieved by the use of <b>Flash</b> <b>paper,</b> making it look dangerous but not harming anyone. On October 27, 2008 Serrano lost the [...] "Fire" [...] mask, losing a Luchas de Apuesta to Último Dragoncito.
