5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he competed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won {{four of the}} five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump.</b> Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E

5|$|Once {{he began}} to play football, as a junior, he {{achieved}} instant success as a running back, running 65 {{yards for a touchdown}} on his first high school carry. At , he was not especially large, but his speed and strength {{made him one of the}} team's featured players. John J. Jefferson High School was integrated with neighboring Columbia High School that year; Payton and his teammates were upset that their head coach, Charles L. Boston, had become an assistant and Payton boycotted some of the spring practices in protest, but returned during the fall season. He then earned statewide honors as a member of Mississippi's all-state team, leading Columbia to an unexpected 8–2 season. His performance helped ease the local tensions surrounding desegregation. Tommy Davis, Columbia’s football coach, claimed that he could always count on Payton when the team needed to score. Payton’s statistics proved that was no exaggeration: he scored in every game during his junior and senior years. He was named to the all-conference team two years in a row. Payton also led the Little Dixie Conference in scoring his senior year and made the all-state team. In addition to excelling at football, Payton averaged 18 points a game for Columbia’s basketball team, leaped three-quarters of an inch short of 23 feet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> played baseball, and continued to drum in the school band.|$|E
