40|$|Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) is an {{architectural}} technique {{that allows for}} the parallel execution of several threads simultaneously. <b>Fetch</b> performance {{has been identified as}} the most important bottleneck for SMT processors. The commonly adopted solution has been <b>fetching</b> from more than one thread each cycle. Recent studies have proposed a plethora of <b>fetch</b> policies to deal with <b>fetch</b> priority among threads, trying to increase <b>fetch</b> performance. In this paper we demonstrate that the simultaneous sharing of the <b>fetch</b> unit, apart from increasing the complexity of the <b>fetch</b> unit, can be counterproductive in terms of performance. We evaluate the use of high-performance <b>fetch</b> units in the context of SMT. Our new <b>fetch</b> architecture proposal allows us to feed an 8 -way processor <b>fetching</b> from a single thread each cycle, reducing complexity, and increasing the usefulness of proposed <b>fetch</b> policies. Our results show that using new high-performance <b>fetch</b> units, like the FTB or the stream <b>fetch,</b> provides higher performance than <b>fetching</b> from two threads using common SMT <b>fetch</b> architectures. Furthermore, our results show that our design obtains better average performance for any kind of workloads (both ILP and memory bounded benchmarks), in contrast to previously proposed solutions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) is a {{technique}} that permits multiple threads to execute in parallel within a single processor. Usually, an SMT processor uses shared instruction queues to collect instructions from the different threads. Hence, an SMT processor's performance depends on how the instruction <b>fetch</b> unit fills these instruction queues. On each cycle the <b>fetch</b> unit must judiciously decide which threads to <b>fetch</b> instructions from. This paper proposes a new instruction <b>fetch</b> scheme that uses both <b>fetch</b> prioritizing and <b>fetch</b> gating for SMT processors. <b>Fetch</b> prioritizing sets up <b>fetch</b> priority for each thread {{based on the number}} of unresolved low-confidence branches from the thread, while <b>fetch</b> gating prevents <b>fetching</b> from a thread once it has a stipulated number of outstanding low-confidence branches. Based on the <b>fetch</b> priority of each thread, our <b>fetch</b> scheme finds threads that are most likely to be in their correct paths. This improves the overall throughput of an SMT processor by reducing the number of wrong-path instructions in the pipeline. Our experimental evaluation shows that, on the average, our <b>fetch</b> scheme provides 14. 9 % speedup over ICOUNT, which is the best <b>fetch</b> policy reported so far for SMT...|$|R

5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping.

40|$|Scalability is {{important}} in superscalar processors design. A superscalar processor {{is said to be}} linearly scalable if with linear increase in load or demand, performance remains constant relative to linear increase in resources. In this paper, for evaluating the instruction <b>fetching</b> scalability, an analytical model of a superscalar processor is proposed by defining the <b>fetch</b> unit as the “producer ” of instructions and the execution unit as the “consumer. ” The scalability of the <b>fetch</b> unit relative to its branch predictor – the Bi-Mode Predictor – is then evaluated using SPEC 2000 suite of benchmarks. Our simulation results strongly suggest that reducing branch misprediction penalty is a better alternative solution – compared with increasing prediction accuracy – for improving instruction <b>fetch</b> scalability. 1. Summary and future work In this paper, we composed an analytical model for evaluating instruction <b>fetching</b> scalability relative to branch prediction accuracy. For this purpose, we decoupled the <b>fetch</b> and execution engines using the model proposed in [1] and assumed the instruction cache to be totally perfect and based the <b>fetch</b> engine performance only on branch prediction accuracy. We defined the performance of the <b>fetch</b> unit as the number of instructions it produces in each cycle based on the prediction it makes for control instructions. However, this performance is dependent on the execution unit which informs the <b>fetch</b> unit of the resolved outcomes of branch instructions and keeps it on the correct execution path. To assess the scalability of the <b>fetch</b> unit, we proposed an analytical <b>fetching</b> model and developed formulas for measuring the <b>fetch</b> performance. Our formulas dictated two factors are necessary for evaluating the <b>fetch</b> engine performance...|$|R
