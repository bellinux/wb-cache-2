50|$|The final {{aspect of}} the CB {{equation}} is having available CB fire units and appropriate munitions. Typically these are general supporting fire units, but <b>direct</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>fire</b> units are also used if they are available and not fully occupied by their primary role. With conventional HE shells it may require the concentrated fire of 5-10 batteries {{to deal effectively with}} one hostile battery. Hence the attraction multi-rocket launchers such as MLRS able to deliver a heavy and concentrated attack from relatively few launchers.|$|E
50|$|Unlike rockets, guns (or howitzers as some armies {{still call}} them) and mortars are {{suitable}} for delivering close supporting fire. However, they are all suitable for providing deep supporting fire although the limited range of many mortars tends to exclude them from the role. Their control arrangements and limited range also mean that mortars are most suited to <b>direct</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>fire.</b> Guns are used either for this or general supporting fire while rockets are mostly used for the latter. However, lighter rockets {{may be used for}} direct fire support. These rules of thumb apply to NATO armies.|$|E

On that one day and one place, one half of the 10th's {{officers}} and one-fifth of its soldiers became casualties. First Lieutenant John J. Pershing, quartermaster of the 10th, took over command of D Troop. Pershing had helped lead the charge up Kettle Hill with the right flank of the 10th.|$|R
25|$|Ord was {{reportedly}} {{the first officer}} {{to reach the top}} and began <b>directing</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>fire</b> when he was hit in the throat, mortally wounded. He dropped his pistol and sword and sat down grasping his neck. Corporal Walker of D Troop killed his officer's assailant, then tried to help Ord. Walker stated that Ord had made a statement before he bled to death. The essence was that if the 10th had not been separated by the draw between the two hills, they would have taken the heights already. Ord was then buried on the hill.|$|R

This was the first time since 1957 that the unit again found itself a part of the Army's 10th Mountain Division. Since modularization, the battalion has been organized in a [...] "2 x 8" [...] structure, meaning that the battalion has two firing batteries (Alpha and Bravo) of eight M119A2 howitzers each, in addition to a headquarters battery and a forward support company.|$|R

The unit is skilled in both the art of integrating and synchronizing all available <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> assets and in the science of delivering accurate and timely lethal and non-lethal fires. “King of the Herd” Paratroopers in the 173rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Airborne) are able to accomplish both of these tasks and other assigned missions after rapidly deploying via parachute assault.|$|R
25|$|Seeing the 'spontaneous advances' of Ord {{and then}} Roosevelt, General Wheeler (having {{returned}} to the front) gave the order for Kent to advance with his whole division while he {{returned to the}} Cavalry Division. Kent sent forward Ewers' brigade to join Hawkins' men already approaching the hill. Kent's men discovered that the Spanish had placed their trenches in faulty positions and were actually covered from their fire while the attackers climbed the hill. Ord, still in the lead, {{was among the first to}} reach the crest of San Juan Hill. The Spanish fled, as Ord began <b>directing</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>fire</b> into the remaining Spanish when he was shot in the throat and mortally wounded. General Hawkins was wounded shortly after.|$|R

50|$|Major William Auman was {{the first}} {{commanding}} officer {{to reach the top}} of the hill. Lt. Ord {{was among the first to}} reach the crest of San Juan heights. As the Spanish fled, Lt. Ord <b>directed</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>fire</b> into the remaining Spanish until he was mortally wounded by a shot to the throat. General Hawkins was wounded shortly after. At 13:50, Private Arthur Agnew of the 13th Infantry pulled down the Spanish flag atop the San Juan blockhouse. General Wood sent requests for General Kent to send up infantry to strengthen his vulnerable position. When General Wheeler reached the trenches, he ordered breastworks constructed. The Americans' position on San Juan was exposed to artillery fire from within Santiago, and General Shafter feared the American position on Kettle Hill was vulnerable to counter-attack by Spanish forces. A Spanish counter-attack was launched late in the afternoon, but was easily beaten back with the aid of <b>supporting</b> Gatling <b>fire</b> from San Juan Hill. Though General Wheeler assured Shafter that the position could be held, Shafter nevertheless ordered a withdrawal. Before the men on Kettle Hill could withdraw, General Wheeler called aside Generals Kent and Sumner and reassured them that the line could be held. During the night, the Americans worked at strengthening the lines while awaiting reinforcements.|$|R
