60|$|This second day's {{journey was}} in many respects a {{counterpart}} of the first. The road was utterly deserted, and they saw neither Boer, Englishman, nor Kafir upon it; nothing, indeed, except a few herds of <b>game</b> <b>grazing</b> on the ridges. About two o'clock, however, {{just as they had}} started after a short outspan, a little incident occurred. Suddenly the Vilderbeeste's horse put his foot into an ant-bear hole and fell heavily, throwing his rider on to his head. He was up in a minute, but his forehead had struck against the jawbone of a dead buck, and the blood was pouring from it down his hairy face. His companion laughed brutally at the accident, for there are some natures in the world to which the sight of pain is irresistibly comical, but the injured man cursed aloud, trying to staunch the flow with the lappet of his coat.|$|E

50|$|Grazing is {{the act of}} {{positioning}} the character's hitbox {{close to}} the bullets without getting hit. Similar to its older <b>games,</b> <b>grazing</b> {{is one of the}} most effective ways to rake in high scores—if done accurately and effectively. For every 10 bullets grazed, the point item value increases by 10 points. Grazing also works during invincibility periods, such as resurrection or bombing, unless the bullets have been destroyed. While grazing in the short term is minimal, it can boost point item totals by a large scale. Being able to calculate remaining point items in the entire game ahead of time is a rare mathematical feat, but it helps to determine whether or not grazing is worth it in certain situations.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} big <b>game</b> <b>grazing</b> of winter wheat on grain yield were studied during 12 trials in {{northern}} Utah between 1990 - 92. Differences in yield were measured for each trial using 20 sets of 1 -m 2 plots protected and variously grazed by mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) in a randomized block design {{along the edges}} of sampled fields. Plots were hand cut at the beginning of commercial harvest. Grazing impacts were indexed by nighttime counts of game animals, pellet-group counts, and ocular estimates of percent track cover and forage use between protected and grazed plots. Results indicated that ungulate foraging in these trials did not significantly decrease grain yields despite high utilization percentages on wheat leaves in fall and early spring...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. When Europeans {{first began}} {{to move into the}} central portion of the {{interior}} of southern Africa in the late eighteenth century, they encountered Bushmen hunter-gatherers who were already occupying the land. The impact which these Europeans had on one geographical region, the Seacow River valley in the north-east Karoo region, and on the hunter-gatherers living there, form the basic theme of this thesis. The aim is to place the Seacow River valley and the events that transpired in that region between 1770 and 1900 in a documented context, in order to use this context {{to make sense of the}} archaeological data pertaining to this Post-Contact period. The expansion of European farmers into the Seacow River valley was gradual, and through the eighteenth and nineteenth century this gradual expansion affected not only the large herds of <b>game</b> <b>grazing</b> on the Karroid vegetation, but the vegetation itself. A wide spectrum of documentary sources shed light on the nature and timing of the extermination of valley game animals and provided clues to the effect which the European presence had on the environment. Bushmen hunter-gatherers living in the region responded to the Europeans in various ways. Although some Bushmen may have moved ahead of the colonial frontier, or were destroyed by it, many Bushmen survived by adopting different roles in colonial society. The degree in which valley Bushmen retained their identity, subsistence patterns and material culture was largely dependent on their relation to the colonial presence in the form of farms, mission stations and towns. Some Bushmen lived independently from these centres, while others were related to these centres in different ways. The documentation of this differing response to the colonial presence not only provides a context for the accumulation of Post-Contact archaeological deposits, but allows some light to be shed on the context of individual archaeological sites...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{study to}} {{determine}} possible impacts of cattle and big <b>game</b> <b>grazing</b> on streamside erosional responses was initiated in 1975. The objectives {{of the study were}} to: (1) establish the study and collect base line measurements; (2) determine the impact of animal grazing on soil bulk density and erosional potential, (3) determine characteristics of streambanks as influenced by animal trampling, and (4) determine infiltration rates and sediment production as they relate to soil structure. The study was located in northeastern Oregon on the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range. Meadow Creek, with elevations ranging from 1121 to 1371 meters, was selected as the study site. At {{the lower end of the}} study site, Meadow Creek's discharge ranges from 0. 057 to 5. 7 cubic meters per second (2 to 200 cfs). Infiltration rates varied greatly with a range from 1. 1 to 16. 1 cm/hr. No trends in infiltration rates related to grazing influences were observed. Grazing and over-wintering impacts also failed to consistently appear. Sediment production did not show a conclusive impact of grazing or over-wintering. Sediment production ranged from 0. 1 to 1046. 1 kg/ha. None of the treatment units showed any effect of grazing on bank cutting; however, there was a trend toward higher bank cutting over-winter than during summer periods on all units. Stream profiles showed the greatest variability of all parameters which were analyzed. This variability was attributed primarily to a wide range of profile shapes with their accompanying changes in stream flow and energy characteristics. The changes in profile depth were considered small enough not to be important in management of streamside grazing on Meadow Creek. Compaction differences were attributed to seasonal variations and a wet 1976 grazing season with numerous wetting and drying cycles. Very few differences were detectable in the short time of this study. Apparently, on Meadow Creek seasonal variation and natural variability are sufficiently large to mask a single year of grazing management at the seasons and intensities of stocking under study. Firm conclusions as to the total impact of grazing vs. natural erosion cannot be made until the study has continued for several more years...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Livestock grazing {{on public}} lands {{continues}} {{to be a source of}} intense conflict and debate. We analyze this problem using a dynamic resource use <b>game.</b> Low <b>grazing</b> fees let ranchers capture more rent from grazing. This increases the incentive to comply with federally mandated regulations. Optimal grazing contracts therefore include grazing fees that are lower than competitive private rates. The optimal policy also includes random monitoring to prevent strategic learning by cheating ranchers and avoid wasteful efforts to disguise noncompliant behavior. Finally, an optimal policy includes a penalty for cheating beyond terminating the lease. This penalty must be large enough that the rancher who would profit the most from cheating experiences a negative expected net return...|$|R

40|$|Ecosystems provide {{services}} for many stakeholder groups, {{often with a}} conflict of interests that hampers sustainability. Core to these conflicts is the challenge of trading-off monetary and non-monetary measures. Using the boreal forest as a case, we present a socio-ecologically integrated trade-off model for partly competing services (wood, <b>game</b> hunting, livestock <b>grazing).</b> Drawing on multi-criteria analyses (MCA), we found that wood production unequivocally yielded the highest net present value, but led to a substantial reduction {{in the performance of}} hunting and grazing. By imposing multiuse conditions set as minimum performance of the less profitable services, we evaluated the opportunity costs of multiuse without directly pricing non-commodities. We also quantified normalized indices of realized performance potential to evaluate the cost of multiuse with a single, joint metric. Both approaches consistently showed that accepting a rather small loss in one service may secure large gains in other services. By democratically providing a combined monetary and non-monetary evaluation, our approach should facilitate broader acceptance for the decisional metrics among stakeholders. It thereby has the potential to mitigate conflicts, feeding into the larger scheme of adaptive management...|$|R
40|$|In West Africa, {{the most}} extreme {{predicted}} {{effects of climate change}} are expected to occur in desert and grassland areas. It is crucial for local populations in this region to better understand what such projections signify to them to identify sound adaptation policies and interventions. We developed a game, called the "grazing game," and conducted trials with local farmers at multiple study sites as a learning tool to better understand their behavior in response to climate variability under semiarid conditions in West Africa and to facilitate social learning. The <b>grazing</b> <b>game</b> was designed to reveal the processes that lead to overgrazing and desertification based on the players' interactions with environmental conditions and their resulting decisions. We conducted a total of 23 game trials around the Vea catchment of the Upper East Region of Ghana involving 243 individual farmers. From the games, local farmers exhibited a very positive response to how the game replicated rainfall fluctuations that they currently experience and led to the identification of coping strategies, such as selling cows, seeking government assistance, and engaging in alternative livelihood means. Participating farmers tended to avoid uncertain situations and sought to simplify their decisions, and the game provided insight into the rich local ecological knowledge of environmental indicators. Based on the game trial results, we found that the game facilitated instrumental and communicative learning among the players and facilitators. Further, the game served as a platform where players could share their views, knowledge, and perceptions of climate-related issues...|$|R
40|$|Faculty of Science Schoolof Animal,Plant and Enviromental Sciences 0008745 gBarleria argillicola and B. greenii are two rare {{endemics}} {{restricted to}} the midlands of KwaZulu Natal at Estcourt. They were studied for allozyme variation and differentiation, pollination biology, management strategies and red data re-assessment. The population genetic structure of these endemics was compared using allozymes {{with that of a}} related more widespread species (B. saxatilis) in order determine the baseline genetic data for conservation management of the rare species, and to test current theory regarding population genetics of rare species. The endemics are sympatric although ecologically separated in different habitats. Their populations occur in areas with different fire and grazing regimes; a two year burning cycle on privately owned land and four year burning cycle in the Weenen <b>Game</b> Reserve. Livestock <b>grazes</b> on the privately owned land but stocking rates are very low in the Nature Reserve. The proposed Gongolo Reserve will include most populations currently in the privately owned land. Allozyme variation and differentiation was studied using starch gel electrophoresis. The relationship between the observed levels of allozyme diversity and plant mating systems is discussed. The effects of the management regimes B. greenii were studied in eight 15 m by 15 m quadrats from three populations in the four year burning cycle, three populations in the two year burning cycle and one population from the annual burn. In B. argillicola, three populations from eroded areas and two from non-eroded flat areas were studied. Results for B. argillicola showed low allozyme diversity, low reproductive effort, an IUCN rating of Critically Endangered, short flowering season, high within-flower pollen transfer and habitat loss through erosion and road maintenance. Barleria greenii also merits high conservation priority but is not as threatened as B. argillicola. It is locally abundant with an IUCN rating of Vulnerable. Fire is the major disturbance in B. greenii. Both endemics are self-compatible, facultative breeding system and set fruits when pollinators are excluded but B. argillicola has also shown reduced demographic reliance on seeds through vegetative growth of genets (branching of the vegetative body in the sporophyte through clonal growth of roots). The management regime that favours the two species is different: a two year burning cycle with moderate grazing favours B. greenii but a four year burning cycle with light grazing favours B. argillicola. It is recommended that the two endemics be managed differently through block burning. Comparison of population genetic structure using allozyme data between the two endemics and their widespread congener (B. saxatilis) revealed very low genetic diversity in the widespread congener. It is possible that cleistogamy in this species facilitates its widespread distribution. Low levels of allozyme variability could not be associated with the rarity of the endemics but rather with their mating systems that favour inbreeding...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the Norman {{conquest of}} England Fulwood {{was part of}} the massive estate of the Anglo-Saxon Earl Waltheof. After the Earls {{execution}} in 1076 for his part in the Revolt of the Earls, the estate was awarded to the Norman Roger de Busli. Fulwood was mentioned in a document of 1297 when Thomas de Furnival established the Burgery of Sheffield, he stated that the inhabitants of “Folewode” be granted herbage and foliage throughout the whole of Rivelin Chase. Rivelin Chase, included the Forest of Fulwood and was the common name for an area of forests and moorland used by the Lords of the Manor of Sheffield for the hunting of deer and <b>game</b> and the <b>grazing</b> of farm animals. A record of 1181 states that Fulwood Booth farm was used to rear young cattle for the Lords of Hallamshire. To protect the deer in Fulwood and Rivelin, keepers were appointed by the Lord of the Manor, the head keeper was known as “Master of the Game” and each keeper was paid a salary of £2 per year. In another document of that time the Canons of Beauchief Abbey were granted a grange at Fulwood in return for taking services in the Lord of the Manor’s chapel. The monks of the grange were licensed to graze their cattle and goats and also carried out lead mining {{in the area of the}} present day Bole Hill farm. The grange became the property of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the late 1530s.The Fox family built Fulwood Hall on the north side of the Mayfield valley, it was one of the first large houses in the area and is believed to date from the 15th century. Bennett Grange on Harrison Lane was built 400 metres to the west of Fulwood Hall in 1580, over the years it belonged to the Hall, Hind and Bennet families, it has been added to over the years and still stands today overlooking the Mayfield valley. [...] Stumperlowe Hall was constructed in the 1650s by the Mitchell family who been landowners in the area since the 14th century, the hall was completely rebuilt in the 1850s. During the ravages of the Great Plague of 1666, Fulwood Spa became a popular resort for people alarmed by the spread of the disease. The spa was a spring of mineral water situated in the Porter valley near the present day Whitley Lane, it was created by Thomas Eaton who covered the spring with a building, many Sheffield people came to “take the waters”. Industrial use of the rivers in the area started in 1641 when Ulysses Fox of Fulwood Hall built a corn mill on the Mayfield Brook just before its confluence with the Porter Brook. Thomas Boulsover, the inventor of Sheffield plate made further industrial use of the Porter in the Fulwood area in the 1760s when he constructed the Whiteley Wood rolling mill for the manufacture of saws and edge tools, Boulsover lived in the nearby Whiteley Wood Hall on the south bank of the Porter from 1757 till his death in 1788.|$|R
