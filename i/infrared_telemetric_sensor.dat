40|$|The {{endovascular}} {{repair of}} abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) {{was first published}} in 1991 and has gained an increasing acceptance among elective procedures for AAA repair due to the lower peri- and postoperative morbidity. One of the major complications of this therapy is the occurrence of different types of endoleaks. These complication may lead to the necessity of a later reintervention or conversion to a conventional open AAA repair. In the presented study the influence of endoleaks on the intraaneurysmatic pressure was studied by means of a pulsatile in-vitro model of a AAA. Different types and sizes of endoleaks as well as various conditions of lumbar arteries were simulated in multiple systemic pressure ranges. The intraaneurysmatic pressure was measured at different positions within the aneurysm sac by means of wired and <b>telemetric</b> pressure <b>sensors.</b> The aim of this study was also to investigate whether in thrombosed aneurysm sacs compartmentalization leads to pressure differences and whether a preferred localization for pressure measurement exists. The intraaneurysmatic pressure measured at different positions within the aneurysm sac did not indicate any clinically significant differences in pressure increase after opening of an endoleak in all conditions investigated. This was true for the non-thrombosed and thrombosed aneurysm sac. In case of a successful excluded aneurysm the intraaneurysmatic pressure was maximal 18. 2 ± 0. 8 mmHg in the middle intraaortic pressure range and did not further increase after an increase in systemic pressure. The measured intraaneurysmatic pressure oscillated only in a minimal range at the respective mean pressure. After opening of an endoleak the intraaneurysmatic pressure increased to almost 100 % of the systemic pressure, the amplitude of the intraaneurysmatic pressure oscillations increased but did not reach the systemic one. The observed pressure increase was statistically significant (p < 0, 0001) in all conditions investigated and was in the lowest applied systemic pressure range about 75 mmHg. This pressure increase could be detected without any problems and clearly distinguished from other disturbing factors. All three investigated endoleak sizes were detectable but not differentiable. In case of a thrombosed aneurysm sac a suspected compartmentalization could not be observed. The relevant conditions of the systematic wire based pressure measurements were exemplarily repeated to evaluate the operability of a newly developed <b>telemetric</b> pressure <b>sensor.</b> The <b>telemetric</b> pressure <b>sensor</b> was implanted into the aneurysm sac and measured pressure readings were compared to the ones simultaneously obtained with wired pressure sensors. It could be shown that the <b>telemetric</b> pressure <b>sensor</b> was able to observe a significant pressure increase (p < 0, 0001) in all conditions investigated. The observed differences between the telemetric and wired pressure measurements were insignificant in case of a non thrombosed and thrombosed aneurysm sac. Within an endovascular excluded aneurysm sac it is possible by means of wired as well as of <b>telemetric</b> pressure <b>sensors</b> to detect a clinically relevant pressure increase as well as to verify the successful exclusion of the aneurysm sac. The possibility of a permanent telemetric control of intraaneurysmatic pressure may be helpful to detect clinically relevant endoleaks earlier and subsequently perform a possibly necessary reintervention.

In CKD, no data are available on these relationships. The objective {{of the study was to}} characterize the rhythms of melatonin, cortisol and temperature in relation to renal function in patients with CKD. Methods. From 28 patients (mean age 71 years) with various degrees of renal function, over a 24 -h period, blood samples were collected every 2 h.

The agreement between Tintestinal and Toesophageal is suggested to meet our delimitation for an acceptable level of agreement (ie, systematic bias 0. 1 °C, although the 95 % LoA is acceptable. Tintestinal responds less rapidly than Toesophageal at the start or cessation of exercise or to a change in exercise intensity, but more rapidly than Trectal.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{possible}} interactions between exercise capacity and spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) during the oscillation of core body temperature (Tb) that occurs during the light/dark cycle. Wistar rats (n= 11) were kept at an animal facility under a light/dark cycle of 14 / 10 h at an ambient temperature of 23 °C and water and food ad libitum. Initially, in order to characterize the daily oscillation in SLA and Tb of the rats, these parameters were continuously recorded for 24 h using an implantable <b>telemetric</b> <b>sensor</b> (G 2 E-Mitter). The animals were randomly assigned to two progressive exercise test protocols until fatigue during the beginning of light and dark-phases. Fatigue was defined as the moment rats could not keep pace with the treadmill. We assessed the time to fatigue, workload and Tb changes induced by exercise. Each test was separated by 3 days. Our results showed that exercise capacity and heat storage were higher during the light-phase (p< 0. 05). In contrast, we observed that both SLA and Tb were higher during the dark-phase (p< 0. 01). Notably, the correlation analysis between the amount of SLA and the running capacity observed at each phase of the daily cycle revealed that, regardless of the time of the day, both types of locomotor physical activity have an important inherent component (r= 0. 864 and r= 0. 784, respectively, p< 0. 01) without a direct relationship between them. This finding provides further support for the existence of specific control mechanisms for each type of physical activity. In conclusion, our data indicate that the relationship between the body temperature and different types of physical activity might be affected by the light/dark cycle. These results mean that, although exercise performance and spontaneous locomotor activity are not directly associated, both are strongly influenced by daily cycles of light and dark...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} use of pill-sized ingestible capsule <b>telemetric</b> <b>sensors</b> for assessing core body temperature (Tc) as a potential indicator of variability in metabolic efficiency and thrifty metabolic traits. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the feasibility and accuracy of measuring Tc using the CorTemp® system. Methods: Tc was measured over an average of 20 h in 27 human subjects, with measurements of energy expenditure made in the overnight fasted state at rest, during standardized low-intensity physical activity and after a 600 kcal mixed meal. Validation of accuracy of the capsule sensors was made ex vivo against mercury and electronic thermometers across the physiological range (35 – 40 °C) in morning and afternoon of 2 or 3 consecutive days. Comparisons between capsule sensors and thermometers were made using Bland–Altman analysis. Systematic bias, error, and temperature drift over time were assessed. Results: The circadian Tc profile classically reported in free-living humans was confirmed. Significant increases in Tc (+ 0. 2 °C) were found in response to low-power cycling at 40 – 50 W (~ 3 – 4 METs), but no changes in Tc were detectable during low-level isometric leg press exercise (< 2 METs) or during the peak postprandial thermogenesis induced by the 600 kcal meal. Issues of particular interest include fast “turbo” gut transit with expulsion time of < 15 h after capsule ingestion in one out of every five subjects and sudden erratic readings in teletransmission of Tc. Furthermore, ex vivo validation revealed a substantial mean bias (exceeding ± 0. 5 °C) between the Tc capsule readings and mercury or electronic thermometers in half of the capsules. When examined over 2 or 3 days, the initial bias (small or large) drifted in excess of ± 0. 5 °C in one out of every four capsules. Conclusion: Since Tc is regulated within a very narrow range in the healthy homeotherm’s body (within 1 °C), physiological investigations of Tc require great accuracy and precision (better than 0. 1 °C). Although ingestible capsule methodology appears of great interest for non-invasively monitoring the transit gut temperature, new technology requires a reduction in the inherent error of measurement and elimination of temperature drift and warrants more interlaboratory investigation on the above factors...|$|R

In this paper, we report the development and validation of a new telemetric method for quantifying intrauterine pressure (IUP) in freely-moving, late pregnant and parturient rats. We plan to utilize this technique for studies of labor in altered gravity, specifically, to ascertain forces of uterine during birth, which we believe may be changed in micro- and hypergravity. The technique we describe yields precise, reliable measures of the forces experienced by rat fetuses during parturition. A small, surgically-implantable <b>telemetric</b> pressure <b>sensor</b> was fitted within a fluid-filled balloon. The total volume of the sensor-balloon assembly matched that of a full term rat fetus. Real-time videorecordings of sensor-implanted rat dams and non- implanted control dams enabled us to characterize effects of the intrauterine implant on behavioral aspects of parturition. Contraction frequency, duration, pup-to-pup birth intervals and pup-oriented activities of the dams measured during the peri-birth period were unaffected by the sensor implant. These findings establish intrauterine telemetry as a reliable, non-invasive technique for quantifying intrauterine pressures associated with parturition on Earth and in altered gravity environments.

40|$|Glaucoma is an {{eye disease}} that {{gradually}} steals vision. Open angle glaucoma {{is one of}} the most common glaucoma forms, in which eye fluid (aqueous humor) produced by the ciliary body cannot be drained away normally by patients’ eyes. The accumulated eye fluid inside the anterior chamber causes high intraocular pressure (IOP), which is transmitted onto the retina in the back of the eyeball (globe), continuously suppressing and damaging the patient’s optic nerves; this may lead to total blindness if not treated properly. The current most-popular IOP monitoring technique is to use applanation tonometry, which applies applanation force onto the cornea and measures the resulting deformation in order to calculate the IOP. Even though applanation tonometry can provide quite useful information about patients’ IOP, continuous monitoring of IOP is required for ophthalmologists to understand the IOP fluctuation of the patients, something which still cannot be achieved via current applanation approach. In addition, applanation tonometry requires skillful operation performed by well-trained professionals, such as ophthalmologists, making continuous IOP monitoring impractical. In this work, we have developed a <b>telemetric</b> IOP <b>sensor</b> that is capable of monitoring IOP wirelessly and continuously. As the quality factor drops when a <b>telemetric</b> IOP <b>sensor</b> is implanted in the anterior chamber, due to the high loss tangent of the saline-based aqueous humor (0. 2) compared to air (0. 0), a modified IOP sensor is developed to monitor IOP with sensing coil that is left exposed after implantation in order to avoid interruption from the eye fluid. Another approach is also proposed and tested to demonstrate that the quality factor can also be recovered by covering the sensing coil with low loss tangent materials. Currently glaucoma is treated mostly by taking oral medications or applying eye drops. However, some glaucoma patients do not respond to those medications. Therefore, another physical approach, using a glaucoma drainage device (GDD), is necessary in order to drain out excessive eye fluid and serve as a long-term way to manage the increased IOP. Current commercially available glaucoma drainage devices do not have reliable valve systems to stop the drainage when the IOP falls into the normal range. Therefore, we have developed a dual-valved GDD to fulfill the “band-pass” flow regulation which drains out eye fluid only when IOP is higher than 20 mmHg, and stops drainage (closes the valve) when IOP is lower than 20 mmHg to prevent hypotony. The key component of GDD is a normally closed (NC) check-valve, which only opens to drain away the excess fluid when the pressure is higher than 20 mmHg. The proposed paradigm of our NC check-valve is to have a couple of parylene-C pre-stressed slanted tethers to provide the desired cracking pressure. The slanted tethers are achieved in this thesis by: 1) slanted photoresist generated by gray-scale photolithography, 2) pop-up mechanism, and 3) self-stiction bonding mechanism. The built-in residual tensile stress can be controlled by mechanical stretching or thermal annealing. The protecting mechanism preventing the unwanted drainage when the eyes experience sudden unpredicted high IOP is achieved by utilizing a normally open (NO) check-valve. A “minimally invasive implantation” procedure is proposed in the thesis to implant the GDD subconjunctivally. The small size of the device allows its insertion using a # 19 -gauge needle. To accurately design the desired cracking pressure and also predict the lifetime of the NC check-valve, parylene-C’s mechanical, thermal, and polymer properties are investigated. The results show that the properties of parylene-C are highly process-temperature-dependent and therefore can be tailored by adjusting the thermal annealing process. </p...|$|R

An efficient double ring design is developed to lower the influence of external force, acceleration, and ambient light, and to hold the sensor gently and securely on the skin, so that the circulation at the finger may not be obstructed. To better understand the mechanism of motion artifact by external forces, a comprehensive mathematical model describing the finger photoplethysmography was developed and verified by finite element method, numerical simulation and experiments. Total power consumption is analyzed in relation to the characteristics of the individual components, sampling rate, and CPU clock speed. Optimal operating conditions are obtained for minimizing the power budget. A prototype ring sensor is designed and built based on the power budget analysis and the artifact-resistive attachment method. (cont.) It is verified through experiments that the ring sensor is resistant to interfering forces and acceleration acting on the ring body. It is also shown that the device meets diverse and conflicting requirements, including compactness, motion artifact reduction, minimum loading effects, and low battery power consumption. Benchmarking tests with FDA-approved photoplethysmograph and EKG reveal that the ring sensor is comparable to those devices in detecting beat-to-beat pulsation despite disturbances. The long-term monitoring experiment shows that this device can effectively provide a considerable amount of artifact-free vital sign information in everyday life. Finally, guidelines for designing the ring sensor are proposed based on the analyses and the experiment results. by Sokwoo Rhee. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Objective. Current {{generation}} smartphones' {{video camera}} technologies enable photoplethysmographic (PPG) acquisition {{and heart rate}} (HR) measurement. The study objective was to develop an Android application and compare HRs derived from a Motorola Droid to electrocardiograph (ECG) and Nonin 9560 BT pulse oximeter readings during various movement-free tasks. Materials and Methods. HRs were collected simultaneously from 14 subjects, ages 20 to 58, healthy or with clinical conditions, using the 3 devices during 5 -minute periods while at rest, reading aloud under observation, and playing a video game. Correlation between the 3 devices was determined, and Bland-Altman plots for all possible pairs of devices across all conditions assessed agreement. Results. Across conditions, all device pairs showed high correlations. Bland-Altman plots further revealed the Droid as a valid measure for HR acquisition. Across all conditions, the Droid compared to ECG, 95 % of the data points (differences between devices) fell {{within the limits of}} agreement. Conclusion. The Android application provides valid HRs at varying levels of movement free mental/perceptual motor exertion. Lack of electrode patches or wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>telemetric</b> straps make it advantageous for use in mobile-cell-phone-delivered health promotion and wellness programs. Further validation is needed to determine its applicability while engaging in physical movement-related activities...|$|R
40|$|Aims of {{this study}} were to examine our {{hypotheses}} assuming that (a) skin temperature patterns would differ between submaximal exercise (SE) and graded maximal exercise test (GXT) and (b) thermal kinetics of Tskin occurring in SE and GXT might be similar in a homogenous cohort. Core temperature (Tcore) also observed in order to evaluate thermoregulatory responses to SE and GXT. Eleven moderately to well-trained male athletes were volunteered for the study (age: 22. 2 ± 3. 7 years; body mass: 73. 8 ± 6. 9 kg; height: 181 ± 6. 3 cm; body surface area 1. 93 ± 0. 1 m 2; body fat: 12. 6 % ± 4. 2 %; VÌ‡O 2 max: 54 ± 9. 9 mL min- 1 kg- 1). Under stabilized environmental conditions in climatic chamber, GXT to volitional exhaustion and 20 -min SE at 60 % of VO 2 max were performed on cycle ergometer. Thermal analyses were conducted in 2 -min intervals throughout exercise tests. Tskin was monitored by a thermal camera, while Tcore was recorded via an ingestible <b>telemetric</b> temperature <b>sensor.</b> Thermal kinetic analyses showed that Tskin gradually decreased till the 7. 58 ± 1. 03 th minutes, and then initiated to increase till the end of SE (Rsqr = 0. 97), while Tskin gradually decreased throughout the GXT (Rsqr = 0. 89). Decrease in the level of Tskin during the GXT was significantly below from the SE [F (4, 40) = 2. 67, p = 0. 07, ηp 2 = 0. 211]. In the meantime, Tcore continuously increased throughout the SE and GXT (p 0. 05). However, total heat energies were calculated as 261. 5 kJ/m 2 and 416 kJ/m 2 for GXT and SE, respectively (p < 0. 05). Thus, it seems that SE may be more advantageous than GXT in thermoregulation. In conclusion, Tcore gradually increased throughout maximal and submaximal exercises as expected. Tskin curves patterns found to be associated amongst participants at both GXT and SE. Therefore, Tskin kinetics may ensure an important data for monitoring thermoregulation in exercise. Ege University, Scientific Research Projects Fund (EGE. BAP- 10. BESYO. 003...|$|R
40|$|During {{labor and}} birth, fetuses {{are exposed to}} {{considerable}} physical stimulation associated with labor contractions and expulsion from the womb These forces are important for the neonates' adaptation to tile extrauterine environment. To further {{our understanding of the}} relationship between labor and postpartum outcome, we developed a novel method for measuring intrauterine pressure (IUP) in freely-moving, late pregnant and parturient rats that enables us to make precise, reliable measures of the forces experienced by rat fetuses during parturition. A small (1. 25 x 4 cm) <b>telemetric</b> blood pressure <b>sensor</b> was fitted within a fluid-filled balloon, similar in size to a full term rat fetus. On Gestational day (G) 19 of the rats' 22 / 23 day pregnancy, each dam was anesthetized and a balloon/sensor unit surgically implanted within the uterus following removal of two fetuses. Comparisons were made between sensor-implanted dams (IMPL) and a control conditions: 1) LAP-R, laparotomy with two fetuses removed or 2) LAP-NR, laparotomy with no fetuses removed. IUP signals were sampled at 10 s intervals from the IMPL dams during labor and birth. Dams in all three conditions were videorecorded enabling us to analyze the effect of the implant on behavioral expressions of parturition. Contraction frequency, duration, pup-to-pup birth intervals and pup-oriented activities of the dams measured from one hour prior to the first pup birth until the birth of the third pup were unaffected by the sensor implant. Intrauterine telemetry of freely-moving dams offers significant advantages over conventional hardwired IUP measurement techniques. These findings establish and validate intrauterine telemetry as a reliable, non-invasive technique for quantifying pressures associated with parturition...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in continuous noninvasive health monitoring technologies provide clinicians and researchers with a previously unrealistic opportunity for closely tracking the developments and treatments of various pathologies {{both within and}} outside of a clinical setting. At the same time, miniaturized, wireless communication technologies have greatly enhanced the transmission of sensor data while reducing the size requirements for traditional, wearable sensors. The synergism of these innovations has {{led to the development of}} the Ring <b>Sensor,</b> a miniaturized, <b>telemetric,</b> photo plethysmograph <b>sensor</b> for continuous health monitoring. Previous work on the Ring Sensor has led to significant power savings in regards to data acquisition and transmission. Additionally, early long-term monitoring tests have indicated that the Ring Sensor is capable of acquiring a reliable waveform nearly 30 % of the time. However, the utility of the Ring Sensor has remained somewhat limited. This thesis addresses several of the remaining issues associated with the Ring Sensor. The main design consideration associated with the Ring Sensor is achieving minimal power consumption while maintaining high signal quality. To this end, significant effort has been channeled to the development of an appropriate motion artifact model, representing the complex interplay between internal hemodynamics and external influences. Additionally, an artifact resistant, power-efficient, high-speed modulation scheme has been incorporated into the design of the Ring Sensor. It has been shown that this design significantly reduces the amount of data corrupted by motion while also minimizing the power consumed by the LEDs (one of the single largest power consuming elements). (cont.) This thesis also details the refinement of both the analog signal processing circuit and the redesigning of the sensor band for a more secure device interface. In particular, the order and type of filtering utilized by the Ring Sensor have been optimized for signal quality and stability. An improved sensor unit assembly provides a secure, pressurized contact with the patient's skin while protecting the optical components and wires from the external environment, while additional sensors, incorporated into both the sensor band and the ring unit, provide temperature and light feedback for signal quality assurance. In addition to these advancements, preliminary work towards sensor calibration for oxygen saturation measurements is provided. The thesis concludes with promising results obtained from field testing work conducted in the Massachusetts General Hospital's Pulmonary Function Testing Lab. by Phillip Andrew Shaltis. Thesis (S.
