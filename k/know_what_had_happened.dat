5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation. A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, who said that they did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to the original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E
25|$|The Miami Herald {{reports that}} Abul Hashem's family didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to him until 2004, when the Red Crescent {{informed}} {{them he was}} in Guantanamo.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's {{family did}} not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to him until {{several months later}} when they {{received}} a letter from Marshall's cousin F. Lewis Marshall informing them that James K. Marshall died at Gettysburg. The family had heard conflicting reports, and hoped that he was a prisoner of war.|$|E

25|$|Brigadier Dawson {{said that}} the {{military}} would probably never <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to Sarbi while she was missing, but said that her good health indicated somebody had been looking after her. A Queensland based trainer of a similar black Labrador explosive detection dog stated that it was {{probably due to the}} breed's excellent character that Sarbi had most likely been looked after by locals while missing, ensuring her survival. Misha Schubert the political correspondent for The Age jokingly questioned the official account that Sarbi's whereabouts while she was missing would never be known, suggesting she had been undercover on a secret mission, or that she had been captured by the Taliban as a prisoner of war, or had simply preferred to remain Absent Without Leave (AWOL).|$|E
500|$|In Poe's distressed state, he made {{reference}} to a wife in Richmond. He may have been delusional, thinking that his wife, Virginia, was still alive, or {{he may have been}} referring to Sarah Elmira Royster, to whom he had recently proposed. He did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to his trunk of belongings which, it transpired, had been left behind at the Swan Tavern in Richmond. Moran reported that Poe's final words were [...] "Lord, help my poor soul" [...] before dying on October 7, 1849.|$|E
500|$|On 3 July 1985, DCS Topping visited Brady, {{then being}} held at Gartree Prison, Leicestershire, but found him [...] "scornful of any {{suggestion}} that he had confessed to more murders". Police nevertheless decided to resume their search of Saddleworth Moor, once more using the photographs taken by Brady and Hindley to help them identify possible burial sites. Meanwhile, in November 1986 Winnie Johnson, Keith Bennett's mother, {{wrote a letter to}} Hindley begging to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to her son, a letter that Hindley seemed to be [...] "genuinely moved" [...] by. It ended: ...|$|E

500|$|Above the waterline, {{there was}} little {{evidence}} of the collision. The stewards in the first class dining room noticed a shudder, which they thought might {{have been caused by}} the ship shedding a propeller blade. Many of the passengers felt a bump or shudder – [...] "just as though we went over about a thousand marbles", as one survivor put it – but did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Those on the lowest decks, nearest the site of the collision, felt it much more directly. Engine Oiler Walter Hurst recalled being [...] "awakened by a grinding crash along the starboard side. No one was very much alarmed but knew we had struck something". Fireman George Kemish heard a [...] "heavy thud and grinding tearing sound" [...] from the starboard hull.|$|E
2500|$|Years later, teacher Hans Meyer said, [...] "At the time, it {{was less}} {{important}} {{to be a good}} teacher than it was to be an sympathetic human being. It was more important to give them a good-night kiss than [...] excellent German literature." [...] In some cases, there would be letters from parents and then they'd stop coming, particularly once war broke out. Meyer said, [...] "We tried to lead them away from the period of silence. We didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to the parents. We couldn't give them any hope, neither could we take it from them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lord Sugar {{found no}} reason at all to fire David (Sean tried to claim David didn't {{contribute}} to the task, but this misfired) and felt that whilst Maria doomed the task from the beginning in pushing only her ideas through, accusing Andrew of not listening to all of the focus group (when she didn't even <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened)</b> and then insisting she was least at fault for the task failing, describing her being in the boardroom as [...] "unfair", he also felt that Sean was more responsible for the failure of the task for allowing Maria to control his decisions instead of sticking his foot down, though it was implied if Sean had brought Patrick into the final boardroom instead of David, he would not have been fired.|$|E

60|$|Kit doubted. He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to Adam, and, {{in spite}} of Olsen's statement, {{imagined}} Galdar's friends would not let him warn the president.|$|R

2500|$|These events {{known as}} the Haymarket Riots angered many people and gave a bad {{impression}} of the labor unions due to the violence that they had incurred. [...] However, protests such as these helped to make an impression upon the industrial heads. [...] It made them start {{to realize that they}} were going to have to make changes for the workers or suffer the consequences. [...] The Haymarket Riots were one of the things that set the era of worker reform into motion to help millions of people improve their lives. [...] Working to reform the eight-hour day paid off eventually and continues on today. [...] This showed the people in charge that laborers were no longer willing to be treated so inhumanely and that they would do what needed to be done in order to change what they wanted. [...] Because of this push for the eight-hour day, doors were open for reform of other unfair treatments of laborers. [...] It helped to work towards a more just labor system in general. [...] Young Jay Fox had been a part of this at the age of sixteen; he had helped in a cause to make a difference. [...] Not only this but he was able to leave behind writings that let future generations <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> in his account of the event “I Was At Haymarket.” [...] Through this piece of writing he showed what was going on at the time, what people decided to do about the unfair treatment, and the injustice of the authorities handling the situation.|$|E
60|$|At last, having {{gained some}} measure of self-control, Galeotto begged to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> and Cavalcanti related the event.|$|E

6000|$|... "Richard," [...] said Mrs. Ellison, seriously, {{and in a}} tone {{implying}} {{that it was the}} colonel's fault, as usual, [...] "you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> I suppose." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{an instant}} later, by {{the tone of}} Spurstow's voice calling upon them to enter, the men <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> There {{was no need to}} wake him.|$|R
60|$|At {{eight o'clock}} in the evening Minikin called round from the office to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Seeking help from shame, I confessed to him the truth.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} {{he was at a}} loss to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> and then he heard, as if from afar off, Joe calling him by name.|$|E
60|$|The anxiety, the excitement, {{the nervous}} desire to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> {{and what might}} be {{expected}} next, spread that evening to {{every part of the}} Dominion reached by telegraph.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, before I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> I hears him go, smack! I {{rushes to}} the window and looks out: I see him on the pavement, sitting up like.|$|R

6000|$|There was no answer, and Sewell stood up. [...] "We don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> boys. Perhaps {{we never}} shall; {{but it seems}} to me one thing is certain--it wasn't murder." ...|$|R
