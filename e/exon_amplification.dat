At the same time, the human genome initiative and other large-scale sequencing projects provide a large number of novel drug targets. However, the functional analysis of thousands of new genes remains a major challenge for the future. A systematic strategy for genome-wide functional analysis of genes could employ the fact that at least some modules in multi-domain proteins are encoded in individual exons. <b>Exon</b> <b>amplification</b> provides information about coding regions of most genes that is independent of their transcriptional status; <b>exon</b> <b>amplification</b> from entire mammalian genomes has been demonstrated.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{identify}} inactive and active RHD alleles at the molecular level in Congolese cohorts. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from people living in central Congo populated by Teke ethnic group. A total of 110 D- and 40 D+ samples from Congo-Brazzaville and Teke groups, respectively, were selected for RHD genotyping using allele-specific primer polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. RESULTS: In the 110 D- samples, RHD <b>exon</b> <b>amplifications</b> were observed in 7 samples that were subsequently identified by sequencing as weak D type 4 variants. In the remaining 103 D- samples, the frequencies of RHD gene deletion, RHDy pseudogene, and RHD-CE-Ds hybrid gene were 0. 75685, 0. 20560, and 0. 04468, respectively. In the D+ samples, 26 individuals carried at least a regular RHD gene; 9 carried aberrant RHD alleles belonging to the African D clusters, that is, DAU, DIVa, and weak D type 4; 3 carried RHDy in trans with a DAU allele including one novel RHD allele (V 279 M, S 333 N, T 379 M) named DAU- 7; and 2 others were partially determined. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high frequency of weak D type 4 alleles that confirmed the need to use indirect antiglobulin test to improve transfusion safety in the Congo and in countries hosting Congolese people. Findings also indicated that there is a geographic variation in RHD allele distribution and showed that RHD gene deletion is the most prevalent cause of the Dphenotype in the Congolese population...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method, <b>exon</b> <b>amplification,</b> for fast and efficient isolation of coding sequences from complex mammalian genomic DNA. This method {{is based on the}} selection of RNA sequences, exons, which are flanked by functional 5 ' and 3 ' splice sites. Fragments of cloned genomic DNA are inserted into an intron, which is flanked by 5 ' and 3 ' splice sites of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 tat gene contained within the plasmid pSPL 1. COS- 7 cells are transfected with these constructs, and the resulting RNA transcripts are processed in vivo. Splice sites of exons contained within the inserted genomic fragment are paired with splice sites of the flanking tat intron. The resulting mature RNA contains the previously unidentified exons, which can then be amplified via RNA-based PCR and cloned. Using this method, we have isolated exon sequences from cloned genomic fragments of the murine Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 -subunit gene. We have also screened randomly selected genomic clones known to be derived from a segment of human chromosome 19 and have isolated exon sequences of the DNA repair gene ERCC 1.

This has several potential uses, typically as a high-resolution physical mapping technique (e.g. for positional cloning), an example of which was the correct mapping of 200 kb of the CAPN3 gene region, or the mapping of non-overlapping sequences (since the distance between two probes can be accurately measured).

To date only one large deletion of 40 kb in the COL 11 A 1, which was detected by RT-PCR, has been characterized. However, commonly used screening protocols, utilizing genomic amplification and exon sequencing, are unlikely to detect such large deletions. Consequently the frequency {{of this type of}} mutation is unknown. Case presentations: We have used Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) in conjunction with <b>exon</b> <b>amplification</b> and sequencing, to analyze patients with clinical features of Stickler syndrome, and have detected six novel deletions that were not found by exon sequencing alone. Conclusion: Exon deletions appear to represent a significant proportion of type 2 Stickler syndrome. This observation was previously unknown and so diagnostic screening of COL 11 A 1 should include assays capable of detecting both large and small deletions, in addition to exon sequencing...|$|E
40|$|The mnd 2 {{mutation}} on mouse chromosome 6 {{produces a}} progressive neuromuscular disorder. To determine the gene {{content of the}} 400 -kb mnd 2 nonrecombinant region, we sequenced 108 kb of mouse genomic DNA and 92 kb of human genomic sequence from the corresponding region of chromosome 2 p 13. 3. Three genes with the indicated sizes and intergenic distances were identified: D 6 Mm 5 e (⩾ 81 kb) – 787 bp–DOK (2 kb) – 845 bp–LOR 2 (⩾ 6 kb). D 6 Mm 5 e is expressed in many tissues at very low abundance and the predicted 526 -residue protein contains no known functional domains. DOK encodes the p 62 dok rasGAP binding protein involved in signal transduction. LOR 2 encodes a novel lysyl oxidase-related protein of 757 amino acid residues. We describe a simple search protocol for identification of conserved internal exons in genomic sequence. Evolutionary conservation {{proved to be a}} useful criterion for distinguishing between authentic exons and artifactual products obtained by <b>exon</b> <b>amplification,</b> RT–PCR, and 5 ′ RACE. Conserved noncoding sequence elements longer than 80 bp with ⩾ 75 % nucleotide sequence identity comprise ∼ 1 % of the genomic sequence in this region. Comparative analysis of this human and mouse genomic DNA sequence was an efficient method for gene identification and is independent of developmental stage or quantitative level of gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The human CD 44 gene {{contains}} 10 variable exons (v 1 to v 10) {{that can}} be alternatively spliced to generate hundreds of different CD 44 protein isoforms. Human CD 44 variable exon v 3 inclusion in the final mRNA depends on a multisite bipartite splicing enhancer located within the exon itself, which we have recently described, and provides the protein domain responsible for growth factor binding to CD 44. Findings We have analyzed the sequence of CD 44 v 3 in 95 mammalian species to report high conservation levels for both its splicing regulatory elements (the 3 ' splice site and the exonic splicing enhancer), and the functional glycosaminglycan binding site coded by v 3. We also report the functional expression of CD 44 v 3 isoforms in peripheral blood cells of different mammalian taxa with both consensus and variant v 3 sequences. Conclusion CD 44 v 3 mammalian sequences maintain all functional splicing regulatory elements {{as well as the}} GAG binding site with the same relative positions and sequence identity previously described during alternative splicing of human CD 44. The sequence within the GAG attachment site, which in turn contains the Y motif of the exonic splicing enhancer, is more conserved relative to the rest of <b>exon.</b> <b>Amplification</b> of CD 44 v 3 sequence from mammalian species but not from birds, fish or reptiles, may lead to classify CD 44 v 3 as an exclusive mammalian gene trait. </p...|$|E
40|$|Completed genome {{sequences}} provide templates for {{the design}} of genome analysis tools in orphan species lacking sequence information. To demonstrate this principle, we designed 384 PCR primer pairs to conserved exonic regions flanking introns, using Sorghum/Pennisetum expressed sequence tag alignments to the Oryza genome. Conserved-intron scanning primers (CISPs) amplified single-copy loci at 37 % to 80 % success rates in taxa that sample much of the approximately 50 -million years of Poaceae divergence. While the conserved nature of <b>exons</b> fostered cross-taxon <b>amplification,</b> the lesser evolutionary constraints on introns enhanced single-nucleotide polymorphism detection. For example, in eight rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes, polymorphism averaged 12. 1 per kb in introns but only 3. 6 per kb in exons. Curiously, among 124 CISPs evaluated across Oryza, Sorghum, Pennisetum, Cynodon, Eragrostis, Zea, Triticum, and Hordeum, 23 (18. 5 %) seemed to be subject to rigid intron size constraints that were independent of per-nucleotide DNA sequence variation. Furthermore, we identified 487 conserved-noncoding sequence motifs in 129 CISP loci. A large CISP set (6, 062 primer pairs, amplifying introns from 1, 676 genes) designed using an automated pipeline showed generally higher abundance in recombinogenic than in nonrecombinogenic regions of the rice genome, thus providing relatively even distribution along genetic maps. CISPs are an effective means to explore poorly characterized genomes for both DNA polymorphism and noncoding sequence conservation on a genome-wide or candidate gene basis, and also provide anchor points for comparative genomics across a diverse range of species...|$|R
40|$|In {{a family}} expressing euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia, an {{increased}} association of plasma thyroxine (T 4) with transthyretin (TTR) is transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance and is secondary to a mutant TTR molecule with increased affinity for T 4. Eight individuals spanning three generations exhibited the abnormality. Although five of eight individuals had elevated total T 4 concentrations, all affected individuals were clinically euthyroid and all had normal free T 4 levels. Purified TTR from the propositus had {{an affinity for}} 125 I-T 4 three times that of control TTR. Exons 2, 3, and 4 (representing greater than 97 % of the coding sequence) of the TTR gene of DNA prepared from the propositus' peripheral blood leukocytes were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were sequenced after subcloning. Exons 2 and 3 were indistinguishable from normal. In 50 % of clones amplified from exon 4, a substitution of adenine (ACC) for guanine (GCC) in codon 109 resulted in the replacement of threonine-for-alanine, a mutation confirmed by amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides derived from purified plasma TTR. The adenine-for-guanine substitution abolishes one of two Fnu 4 H I restriction sites in <b>exon</b> 4. PCR <b>amplification</b> of <b>exon</b> 4 of TTR and restriction digestion with Fnu 4 H I confirmed that five affected family members with increased binding of 125 I-T 4 to TTR are heterozygous for the threonine 109 substitution that increases the affinity of this abnormal TTR for T 4...|$|R
40|$|We have {{explored}} the molecular pathology in 28 individuals homozygous or heterozygous for liver arginase deficiency (hyperargininemia) {{by a combination}} of Southern analysis, western blotting, DNA sequencing, and PCR. This cohort represents the majority of arginase-deficient individuals worldwide. Only 2 of 15 homozygous patients on whom red blood cells were available had antigenically cross-reacting material as ascertained by western blot analysis using anti–liver arginase antibody. Southern blots of patient genomic DNAs, cut with a variety of restriction enzymes and probed with a near-full-length (1, 450 -bp) human liver arginase cDNA clone, detected no gross gene deletions. Loss of a TaqI cleavage site was identified in three individuals: in a homozygous state in a Saudi Arabian patient at one site, at a different site in homozygosity in a German patient, and in heterozygosity in a patient from Australia. The changes in the latter two were localized to <b>exon</b> 8, through <b>amplification</b> of this region by PCR and electrophoretic analysis of the amplified fragment after treatment with TaqI; the precise base changes (Arg 291 X and Thr 290 Ser) were confirmed by sequencing. It it interesting that the latter nucleotide variant (Thr 290 Ser) was found to lie adjacent to the TaqI site rather than within it, though whether such a conservative amino acid substitution represents a true pathologic mutation remains to be determined. We conclude that arginase deficiency, though rare, is a heterogeneous disorder at the genotypic level, generally encompassing a variety of point mutations rather than substantial structural gene deletions...|$|R
