2500|$|Commodore Josiah Tattnall, Flag Officer {{commanded}} the southern {{region of the}} Confederate States, especially Savannah, Georgia. [...] He was expected to repeat his success commanding the CSS Virginia in crushing the wooden Union ships in the James River. Tattnall was handicapped in bringing this to fruition because of the blockade. In May 1863, Webb replaced Tatnall as commander of the CSS Atlanta ironclad, launched in 1862, and flag officer of the Savannah Squadron, with [...] "the <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> of his appointment being that he should 'do something' with her..." [...] Webb proclaimed that [...] "the whole abolition fleet" [...] had [...] "no terror" [...] for him.|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} given {{anything}} {{to have been able}} to light even a match. A single second of light would, I felt, have made me my own man again. But I knew that this would be against the <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> of my being there at all, and might have had disastrous consequences to her whom I had come to save. It might even frustrate my scheme, and altogether destroy my opportunity. At that moment it was borne upon me more strongly than ever that this was not a mere fight for myself or my own selfish purposes--not merely an adventure or a struggle for only life and death against unknown difficulties and dangers. It was a fight on behalf of her I loved, not merely for her life, but perhaps even for her soul.|$|E
60|$|Any one can {{see this}} well enough, merely by reading the last {{negotiations}} between London and Berlin. The Prussians had made a new discovery in international politics: that it may often be convenient to make a promise; and yet curiously inconvenient to keep it. They were charmed, in their simple way, with this scientific discovery, and desired to communicate it to the world. They therefore promised England a promise, on condition that she broke a promise, and on the <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> that the new promise might be broken as easily as the old one. To the profound astonishment of Prussia, this reasonable offer was refused! I believe that the astonishment of Prussia was quite sincere. That is what I mean when I say that the Barbarian is trying to cut away that cord of honesty and clear record, on which hangs all that men have made.|$|E

60|$|The {{remainder}} of the journey was made {{with a degree of}} speed which showed the little care they had for the health of the unhappy Countess. They paused only at places where all was under their command, and where the tale they were prepared to tell of the insane Lady Varney would have obtained ready credit had she made an attempt to appeal to the compassion of the few persons admitted to see her. But Amy saw no chance of obtaining a hearing from any to whom she had an opportunity of addressing herself; and besides, was too terrified for the presence of Varney to violate the <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> under which she was to travel free from his company. The authority of Varney, often so used during the Earl's private journeys to Cumnor, readily procured relays of horses where wanted, so that they approached Cumnor Place upon the night after they left Kenilworth.|$|E
6000|$|After {{some five}} miles the [...] "Father of Glass" [...] {{changed his name}} to Abú Daumah (of the [...] "one Theban Palm"). Porphyritic trap lay on both sides of us. To the right rose the Jebel Ukbal, whose grey form (El-Ash'hab) we had seen from the heights above Umm el-Haráb: the whole range of four heads, forming the {{south-western}} rim of the Badá saucer, is known as El-Akábil. Below these blocks the Wady-sides were cut into buttresses of yellow clay, powdered white with Sabkh, or [...] "impure salt." [...] Charred circlets in the sand showed where alkali had been burned: the ashes, packed in skins, are shipped at El-Wijh for Syria, where they serve to make soap. The Bedawin call it Aslah (Athlah); the Egyptians Ghassálah ("the washer"), because, when rubbed in the hands, its succulent shoots clean the skin. Camels eat it, whereas mules refuse it, unless half-starved. This plant apparently did not extend all up the Wady. The water, where there is any, swings under the left bank; an ample supply had been promised to us, with the <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> that we should camp at this Mahattat el-Urbán ("Halting place of the Arabs"), after a marching day of two hours! Seeing that we rode on, the Baliyy declared that they had searched for the two principal pools, and that both were dry, or rather had been buried by the Bedawin. But, with characteristic futility, they had allowed me to overhear their conversation; and the word was passed to the soldiers, who at once filled themselves and their water-skins.|$|E

Had Quebec been moving to become an independent country, the transfer of jurisdiction would not have taken place. There was an <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> that the Province of Quebec was going to remain part of Canada. Any attempt to move to independence would constitute a breach of that <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> attached to the transfer.|$|E

50|$|It is true, however, that <b>condition</b> 1 <b>implies</b> <b>condition</b> 2. The {{difficulty}} encountered when {{attempting to}} prove that <b>condition</b> 2 <b>implies</b> <b>condition</b> 1 {{lies in the fact}} that topological spaces are, in general, not first-countable.If the first-countability axiom were imposed on the topological spaces in question, the two above conditions would be equivalent. In particular, the two conditions are equivalent for metric spaces.|$|R

5000|$|The {{conditional}} is {{also called}} the [...] "provisional form" [...] in some grammars, because the <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> is [...] "provided that X happens" [...] (mireba shiru: [...] "provided that you see, you'll know" [...] = [...] "if you see, you'll know").|$|E

5000|$|Darling held in {{the initial}} case {{that there was an}} <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> in the contract, using Taylor v. Caldwell and The Moorcock, and gave {{judgment}} for the defendant on both the claim and the counterclaim. The Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff's appeal.|$|E
50|$|In most of {{the cases}} it is said that there was an <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> in the {{contract}} which operated to release the parties from performing it, and in all of them I think that was at bottom the principle upon which the court proceeded.|$|E
50|$|Judge Williams {{framed the}} legal {{question}} {{in this case}} as whether there was an <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> to the contract: whether or not while the contract was made, the two parties knew that the reason behind the contract was for Henry to watch the coronation procession.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} that an <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> that ceases to exist voids the contract {{stems from the}} case of Taylor v Caldwell, which, in turn, was borrowed from Roman law. The principle was extended, in later cases, to situations in which an underlying condition that was essential {{to the performance of}} the contract, rather than simply being a necessary condition, ceases to exist.|$|E
5000|$|From 1850 to 1871, {{these acts}} {{typically}} allocated rights-of-way to specific named railroads. These rights-of-way were initially construed as an [...] "absolute" [...] grant in [...] "both the fee and possession".

50|$|Blackburn J {{reasoned}} that the rule of absolute liability only applied to positive, definite contracts, not to those {{in which there was}} an express or <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> underlying the contract. Blackburn J further {{reasoned that}} the continued existence of the Music Hall in Surrey Gardens was an <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> essential for the fulfillment of the contract. The destruction of the music hall was the fault of neither party, and rendered the performance of the contract by either party impossible. Blackburn J cited the civil code of France and the Roman law for the proposition that when the existence of a particular thing is essential to a contract, and the thing is destroyed by no fault of the party selling it, the parties are freed from obligation to deliver the thing. He further analogized to a situation in which a contract requiring personal performance is made, and the party to perform dies, the party’s executors are not held liable under English common law. Blackburn J thus held that both parties were excused from their obligations under their contract.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{cases such as}} Paradine v Jane {{show the}} {{historical}} line that the courts took toward a frustration of purpose in contract; here, the courts held that where land under lease to the defendant had been invaded by Royalist forces, he was still under obligation to pay rent to the land owner. It {{was not until the}} case of Taylor v Caldwell that a doctrine of frustration was formally recognised, alleviating the potential harshness of previous decisions. Here, two parties contracted on the hire of a music hall, for the performance of concerts. Subsequent to contracting, but prior to the dates of hire, the music hall burned down. It was held the contract was impossible to perform; Judge Blackburn stated that the absolute liability set forth in Paradine v Jane would not apply in the instant case, as there was an <b>implied</b> <b>condition</b> that the music hall would be in existence at the date of the planned concerts. This had the effect of excusing the parties from the contract. The implied term test was explained by Lord Loreburn: ...|$|E
