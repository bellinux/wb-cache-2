25|$|The Great Depression began a {{few months}} after the {{introduction}} of their 45cubic inch (737cm³) model. Harley-Davidson's sales fell from 21,000 in 1929 to 3,703 in 1933. Despite this, Harley-Davidson unveiled a new lineup for 1934, which included a <b>flathead</b> <b>engine</b> and Art Deco styling.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 Vic Edelbrock {{bought his}} first project car, a 1932 Ford Roadster. In {{his desire to}} {{increase}} the performance, he joined with Tommy Thickstun to design a new intake manifold for the roadster's <b>flathead</b> <b>engine.</b> Unhappy {{with the performance of}} that manifold, Edelbrock designed his own, nicknamed The Slingshot. Most importantly, the new manifold allowed two Stromberg 97 carburetors to be used, eliminating a bottleneck that limited horsepower for the engine. The manifold was tested for quality at the Rosamond dry lakes (occupied today by Edwards Air Force Base), which was a testing ground for Edelbrock and many other car clubs and racing associations. After stripping off the fenders and hubcaps, on November 16, 1941, Edelbrock drove the car in 7.41 seconds at a speed of , achieving a national speed record in the flying quarter mile. Originally, {{he had no intention of}} producing any additional manifolds, but the overwhelming response following his phenomenal speed in a 1932 Ford prompted Edelbrock to make more. This was the first product he sold commercially and marked the beginning of the company as it is known today. Edelbrock ultimately manufactured 100 of the Slingshot manifolds.|$|E

500|$|The {{acquisition}} by Pigozzi {{took place}} in July 1954, just when Ford was poised to launch its new, modern Vedette, with a four-door saloon body of [...] "American" [...] style, much like the contemporary British Fords or Vauxhalls. The car was powered by an unusually small 2351cc sidevalve V8 engine called Aquillon in France, derived from Ford's <b>Flathead</b> <b>engine</b> family, whose displacement positioned the car into the [...] "13CV" [...] French tax class. Equipped with a two-barrel Zenith-Stromberg 32NX carburetor, it produced [...] Power {{was transferred to the}} rear live axle through a three-speed manual transmission with column shift. The Vedette had independent front suspension (by MacPherson struts) and drum brakes on all four wheels.|$|E
500|$|Ford {{used its}} V8 <b>flathead</b> <b>engine</b> {{in most of}} its line up through the {{beginning}} of the decade, even as it introduced the Ford Y-block engine and the similar but larger Lincoln Y-block V8 engine in 1952 for its luxury car lines. [...] These were soon phased out with the Ford Windsor engine in 1962, which still forms the basis for the current engine line. [...] The Lincoln Y-block 317 cubic inch motor was rated at 160hp, only slightly higher than the 336 cubic inch [...] "Invincible 8" [...] flathead design that it replaced. [...] The Lincoln also came in 341 and 368 cubic inch displacement (CID) versions. [...] Like the GM motor, it used an overhead-valve design rather than the inblock-valve design shared by all flathead engines.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the 196 engine, this engine was originally designed by Nash and introduced in the 1941 Nash Ambassador 600 model. It featured only four main bearings, unlike the 7-main-bearing 234 <b>flathead</b> <b>engine</b> it replaced. It was a flathead design displacing [...] It was later enlarged to , and finally to [...] It was redesigned as an OHV engine in 1956. The flathead version was discontinued for 1956–1957, but reemerged in 1958 as the economy engine for the [...] "new" [...] Rambler American. When the engine was changed to an OHV configuration the water pump was moved from {{the left side of the}} engine (driven by a shaft extending from the back of the generator) to the front above the timing chain. When the flathead model was reintroduced it also received the new water pump. Equipped with such high quality parts as forged crankshafts and connecting rods, these engines earned a reputation for remarkable durability. The flathead, however, was prone to the typical flathead problem of overheating under sustained heavy load. This was from the hot exhaust traveling through the cylinder block to the exhaust manifold.|$|E
2500|$|By 1937, all Harley-Davidson's <b>flathead</b> <b>engines</b> were {{equipped}} with dry-sump oil recirculation systems {{similar to the}} one introduced in the [...] "Knucklehead" [...] OHV engine.

25|$|Single-cylinder engines were reintroduced in 1925 as 1926 models. These singles were {{available}} either as <b>flathead</b> <b>engines</b> or as overhead valve engines until 1930, {{after which they}} were only available as flatheads. The flathead single-cylinder motorcycles were designated Model A for engines with magneto systems only and Model B for engines with battery and coil systems, while overhead valve versions were designated Model AA and Model BA respectively, and a magneto-only racing version was designated Model S. This line of single-cylinder motorcycles ended production in 1934.|$|R
2500|$|As {{with other}} iron block {{straight}} configurations {{the engine is}} considerably heavier than an equivalent V configuration, requiring more materials for the crank and crankcase and so increasing overall vehicle weight in even greater proportion. The long crankshaft tends to exhibit torsional vibration modes under high power, while side-valve <b>flathead</b> <b>engines</b> inhibit smooth intake and exhaust gas flow, limiting power. None of these disadvantages were disabling until the [...] "horsepower race" [...] initiated in the early 1950s ensured {{the dominance of the}} overhead valve V8.|$|R
