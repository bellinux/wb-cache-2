50|$|The {{aircraft}} is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a fuselage {{made from}} aluminium alloy tubing with balsa frames {{and covered with}} Melinex. The wing has a single warren-girder main spar of aluminium alloy tubing with balsa ribs and, like the fuselage, covered with Melinex. The landing gear was a non-retractable tricycle arrangement using bicycle wheels. The power is generated by the pilot in an enclosed cockpit using bicycle <b>pedals</b> <b>driving</b> a two-bladed balsa pusher propeller.|$|R
50|$|Motorists {{are almost}} universally {{required}} to take lessons with an approved instructor and to pass a driving test before being granted a license. Almost all countries allow all adults with good vision and health to apply to take a driving test and, if successful, to drive on public roads. Saudi Arabia, however, bans women from <b>driving</b> vehicles (whether <b>pedal</b> or motor powered) on public roads. Saudi women have periodically staged driving protests against these restrictions.|$|R
30|$|Motor {{skills in}} <b>driving,</b> such as <b>pedal</b> control and steel wheel control are {{psychomotor}} skills {{developed as a}} result of constant practice, so individuals need little thought to perform them but require input from both the physical and the mental attributes, and coordinate in order to achieve a certain goal. Age-related motor skill declines can be found as balance and gait deficits, coordination deficits, movement slowing [23], and alterations in cognitive-motor processes [23]. Motor execution of the older adults may require more psychomotor ability and rely on cognitive control [24].|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{prediction}} {{and understanding}} of driver speed control is important to prevent speeding behavior and design vehicle systems. Speed control is a complex behavior of driver longitudinal vehicle control, involving speed perception, decision making (setting a target speed), motor control (foot movement for pedal control), and vehicle mechanics. However, few of existing models is able to cover all of these important aspects together. To address this problem, the current work built a new mathematical driver speed control model with analytical solutions based on rigorous understanding of human cognitive mechanisms in driving, integrated Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP, which already modeled driver lateral control) structure and Rule-Based Decision Field Theory (RDFT), and offered a relatively complete picture of driver speed control in free-flow driving settings. This new model can provide predictions with regard to <b>driving</b> speed, <b>pedal</b> angle and acceleration for average driver. Copyright 2011 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, Inc.

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} is in {{the area}} of user-centered computing and design, which is concerned with the usability of human-computer systems. User-centered computing is computing that takes into account human response and reaction. User-centered design accounts for users' needs in the design process. We focus on these aspects of system design and implementation in this dissertation on the Expression Synthesis Project (ESP).; ESP provides a <b>driving</b> (<b>pedals,</b> wheel and display) interface for generating expressive performances from expressionless music files. We design the system using the Software Architecture for Immersipresence framework, and implement it using the Modular Flow Scheduling Middleware. The ESP system processes multiple data streams in real-time, including graphics data, Music Instrument Digital Interface, music information, and driving control parameters.; In the area of user-centered computing, we design the system to ensure tempo smoothness through road segment boundaries and when hitting road edges. To allow inexperienced users to form smooth tempo trajectories, we employ a virtual radius mapping strategy. Our experiments show that the proposed strategy reduces jerk under aggressive, erratic, and normal driving.; To verify that the road in ESP can influence driving performance in desired ways, we consider performances generated from different roads for the same piece. We study two performances each of Brahms' Hungarian Dance Nos. 2 3, and design two roads each based on the different grouping strategies. We show that performances from the same roads are more similar to each other than those from different roads.; Next, we focus on user-centered interface design by customizing road design for individual users. We first model how users control the wheel and pedals in response to the car dynamics and road conditions using an adaptive network based on a fuzzy inference system and a decision tree respectively. Then, we solve an optimization problem, using genetic algorithms, to design a customized road for the driver. We validate the approach by testing the process on ten participants. The experiment shows that, using the tailor-designed roads, seven out of ten users create performances that are more similar to the target than when they drove on other roads...|$|R

40|$|Sensing the {{position}} and movement of the accelerator pedal in a vehicle is important for acceleration control and safety while <b>driving.</b> The accelerator <b>pedal</b> {{is controlled by the}} foot, but precise adjustment requires much training because the driver must rely on somatosensory cues, which provide limited feedback. In this study, we propose periodic tactile feedback for the accelerator pedal to provide an additional tactile cue. We conducted an experiment using a driving simulator to compare the lap time, the rate of off-track incidents and the subjective evaluation of controllability recorded in questionnaires. The experiment confirmed that the feedback makes the control of acceleration easier and facilitates safer driving...|$|R
40|$|This report {{introduces}} the Software Architecture for Immersipresence (SAI) framework {{to the computer}} music community. SAI is a software architecture model for designing, analyzing and implementing applications that perform distributed, asynchronous parallel processing of generic data streams. The most significant innovation of SAI {{is its ability to}} handle real-time DSP, interactive control, and datacentered representations in a unified model. This generality facilitates the design and implementation of complex interactive systems that combine music analysis, synthesis and on-line control. Two examples illustrate the use of SAI in the design and implementation of interactive music systems: MuSA. RT, a system for real-time analysis and interactive visualization of tonal patterns in music, and ESP, a <b>driving</b> interface (wheel, <b>pedals</b> and display) for creating expressive performances from expressionless music files. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{transmission}} is monitored and regulated by Audi's [...] "Dynamic Regulating Programme" [...] (DRP), which tracks the driver's inputs (from how the driver applies the throttle <b>pedal),</b> <b>driving</b> conditions, and engine load - {{to compute the}} optimal gear ratio for fuel efficiency or maximum performance, as mandated by the user. [...] The transmission can select pre-programmed underdrive to increase performance, or overdrive to improve economy. [...] From 2004, Multitronic transmissions offered manual selection of a 'sport mode' to pre-select the performance mapping. The electronic system also includes sensors to detect whether the vehicle is traveling downhill, and provides additional engine braking in such circumstances. [...] Multitronic also offers a number of driver-selectable fixed ratios, selectable from either the gear-lever in a sequential style, or via (optional) steering wheel-mounted fingertip paddle-shift controls.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the incidence, unit costs, and annual costs of pedestrian and pedalcycle crash {{injuries in the}} United States. It includes medical care costs, household and wage work losses, {{and the value of}} pain, suffering, and lost quality of life. The estimates are broken down by body region and severity. They rely heavily on data from the health care system. Costs of pedestrian and pedalcycle injuries in 2000 will total $ 40 billion over the lifetimes of the injured. Most pedalcyclist injury costs and half of pedestrian injury costs do not involve motor vehicles. Youth ages 5 â€“ 14 face greater annual risks when walking or <b>driving</b> their own <b>pedaled</b> vehicles than when being driven. Children under age 5 experience higher costs than their elders when injured as pedestrians. Our results suggest European and Japanese component tests used to design pedestrian injury countermeasures for motor vehicles are too narrow. Separate lower limb testing is needed for younger children. Testing for torso/vertebral column injury of adults also seems desirable...|$|R

40|$|Regenerative braking of {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) {{is important to}} improve the energy efficiency and increase the vehicle range. However, the additional friction braking during deceleration may {{limit the amount of}} recuperated energy. To improve the energy efficiency and driving comfort of EVs, a one <b>pedal</b> <b>driving</b> algorithm (OPD) has been designed. With the OPD algorithm, the vehicle can be driven using accelerator pedal alone in most cases and the brake pedal is only applied in emergency situations. This paper discusses the energy efficiency gains of an OPD algorithm for EVs. The research uses the TU/e Lupo EL, a battery electric vehicle built by Eindhoven University of Technology. Two regenerative braking algorithms are considered: an OPD algorithm and a parallel regenerative braking algorithm (PR). The accelerator maps of the OPD and PR algorithm are introduced and evaluated. The relationship between the vehicle speed and acceleration and accelerator pedal position is more linear for the OPD algorithm compared to the PR algorithm. Subjective tests confirm that the OPD algorithm can provide a much improved driving experience in comparison to the PR algorithm. A coasting area is included in the OPD accelerator map, which is essential for reducing the energy consumption as proved by a MATLAB optimization code. The comparison of energy consumption between the OPD and PR algorithm is analyzed by driving tests and simulations. Measurement results show that over 93 % of the regenerative braking energy measured at the high voltage battery terminals can be reused to propel the vehicle. Compared to no regenerative braking, the OPD algorithm can save about 22 % energy in city driving and 13 % energy in rural driving, while the energy savings are 14 % and 9 % in city and rural driving respectively for the PR algorithm. Simulation results show that the OPD algorithm can save up to 2 % to 9 % energy in comparison to the PR algorithm based on the same speed profile for city and rural driving respectively...|$|R
