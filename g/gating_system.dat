25|$|The first type is mold erosion, {{which is}} the wearing away of the mold as the liquid metal fills the mold. This type of defect usually only occurs in sand {{castings}} because most other casting processes have more robust molds. The castings produced have rough spots and excess material. The molding sand becomes incorporated into the casting metal and decreases the ductility, fatigue strength, and fracture toughness of the casting. This {{can be caused by}} a sand with too little strength or a pouring velocity that is too fast. The pouring velocity can be reduced by redesigning the <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> to use larger runners or multiple gates. A related source of defects are drops, in which part of the molding sand from the cope drops into the casting while it is still a liquid. This also occurs when the mold is not properly rammed.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to reduce the {{concentration}} of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to the mixture to cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured into the mold. If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. Another option is to install ceramic filters into the <b>gating</b> <b>system.</b> Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. If some of the dross or slag is folded into the molten metal then it becomes an entrainment defect.|$|E

40|$|Context. Due to {{increase}} in demand for RORO shipping services,the RORO terminal <b>gate</b> <b>system</b> need to handle more number of vehicles for every RORO vessel departure. Therefore, various congestion problems can occur; so, to address all possible congestion related problemsat RORO terminal, terminal <b>gate</b> <b>systems</b> are implemented with advanced technologies and updated to full or partial functioning automated <b>gate</b> <b>systems.</b> Objectives. In this research study considering the future increase in demand for wheeled cargo shipping, we attempt to propose a solution for reducing congestion and investigating optimal positions for each automated <b>gate</b> <b>system</b> service at RORO port terminal. Methods. In this Master thesis, as part of qualitative study we conduct a literature review and case study {{to know about the}} existing related work on this research problem and know about the real world system operation and behaviour of a RORO terminal <b>gate</b> <b>system.</b> Later, applying the adequate knowledge acquired from above mentioned qualitative studies, we perform a discrete event simulation experiment using Anylogic® professional 7. 02 simulation software to address defined research objectives. Results. Considering the peak and low periods of present and future estimated demand volumes as different scenarios,various simulation experiment results are generated for different key performance indicators. The result values of these key performance indicators address various research objectives. Conclusions. This research study finally concludes that, the average queue length values at each automated <b>gate</b> <b>system</b> service implicates optimal position for each service and directly address the congestion problem. We also conclude that in every estimated increase in vehicles attending the RORO terminal, assigning optimal arrival time windows for respective vehicle types minimizes the congestion problem at automated <b>gate</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

Perhaps the most critical part of a BMX race {{is that of the}} race start and because of this, it has become necessary for BMX race start gates to become more dependable. This project is aimed at eliminating the risk of injury and inconsistencies in starting cadence timing by designing, prototyping and testing a versatile, cost effective, microprocessor controlled BMX start <b>gate</b> <b>system.</b> The prototype system designed in this project includes three widely used and affiliated start gate starting gate cadences along with various options menus and a wireless timing. In order to provide these functions a PIC microcontroller is used in each of the start <b>gate</b> <b>system</b> embedded systems along with various other hardware systems. Programming of the microcontrollers is carried out using the Oshonsoft BASIC compiler. A single lane pneumatically actuated start gate was constructed to be used in conjunction with the system prototype in order to test the design. Prototype testing and debugging confirms start <b>gate</b> <b>system</b> design integrity and rider trials have provided very positive feedback. It is hoped further design refinement and manufacture will result in a system that is competitive with existing start <b>gate</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

50|$|This {{technique}} is more metal efficient than traditional pouring because less material solidifies in the <b>gating</b> <b>system.</b> Gravity pouring {{only has a}} 15 to 50% metal yield compared to 60 to 95% for counter-gravity pouring. There is also less turbulence, so the <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> can be simplified since {{it does not have}} to control turbulence. The metal is drawn from below the top of the pool, so the metal is free from dross and slag (which are lower density (lighter) and float {{to the top of the}} pool). The pressure differential helps the metal flow into every intricacy of the mold. Finally, lower temperatures can be used, which improves the grain structure.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> may be {{designed}} to minimize turbulence, depending on the material being cast. For example, steel, cast iron, and most copper alloys are turbulent insensitive, but aluminium and magnesium alloys are turbulent sensitive. The turbulent insensitive materials usually have a short and open <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> to fill the mold as quickly as possible. However, for turbulent sensitive materials short sprues are used to minimize the distance the material must fall when entering the mold. Rectangular pouring cups and tapered sprues are used to prevent {{the formation of a}} vortex as the material flows into the mold; these vortices tend to suck gas and oxides into the mold. A large sprue well is used to dissipate the kinetic energy of the liquid material as it falls down the sprue, decreasing turbulence. The choke, which is the smallest cross-sectional area in the <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> used to control flow, can be placed near the sprue well to slow down and smooth out the flow. Note that on some molds the choke is still placed on the gates to make separation of the part easier, but induces extreme turbulence. The gates are usually attached {{to the bottom of the}} casting to minimize turbulence and splashing.|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that the delayed rise of gating currents may result from a dielectric relaxation process within the membrane, not of the <b>gating</b> <b>systems</b> themselves but of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} the <b>gating</b> <b>systems.</b> Such dielectric relaxation may prevent the electric fields at the locations of the gates from rapidly attaining their final, "clamped," values. Calculations based on this concept, using the Hodgkin Huxley m-process as an example, are shown to lead to gating currents whose shapes are similar to those observed experimentally. One possible interpretation in terms of membrane structure is proposed...|$|R

50|$|The <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> serves many purposes, {{the most}} {{important}} being conveying the liquid material to the mold, but also controlling shrinkage, {{the speed of the}} liquid, turbulence, and trapping dross. The gates are usually attached to the thickest part of the casting to assist in controlling shrinkage. In especially large castings multiple gates or runners may be required to introduce metal to more than one point in the mold cavity. The speed of the material is important because if the material is traveling too slowly it can cool before completely filling, leading to misruns and cold shuts. If the material is moving too fast then the liquid material can erode the mold and contaminate the final casting. The shape and length of the <b>gating</b> <b>system</b> can also control how quickly the material cools; short round or square channels minimize heat loss.|$|E
