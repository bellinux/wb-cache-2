Alberto-Culver, the Illinois-based manufacturer of personal care products, filed suit in the Northern District of Illinois after finding that the German trademarks Fritz Scherk had sold them were seriously encumbered. They refused Scherk's demand to arbitrate the claim before the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris per the contract, claiming <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> {{as well as a}} waiver of their American statutory rights. After the district court denied Scherk's motion for a stay to do so the Seventh Circuit heard his interlocutory appeal. Since the transaction had also involved a transfer of stock, Alberto-Culver further argued that Wilko barred them from being forced to arbitrate.|$|E

5000|$|In Boro v. Superior Court, 163 Cal. App. 3d 1224 (1985), the {{defendant}} phoned the victim {{saying he was}} [...] "Dr. Stevens" [...] from the hospital and that the victim had a life-threatening disease. He further presented two options for treatment: option one {{was to have a}} painful surgery costing the victim $9,000; option two was to have sex with an anonymous donor costing the victim only $1,000. The victim had intercourse with {{the defendant}} believing at the time that her life was threatened and that was the only choice she had to cure the disease. The victim, upon learning the truth, brought charges against the defendant for rape. The court held this was <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> and therefore, there was no rape. It was <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> because the deception related not to the thing done - the sexual intercourse - but merely to some collateral matter (cure from a life-threatening disease).|$|E
5000|$|Fraud. There {{are four}} general {{elements}} of fraud: false representations of material facts to the testator; knowledge by the perpetrator that the representations are false; intent that the representations be acted upon and resulting injury. There are two primary types of fraud: {{fraud in the}} execution, (for example, the testator was told the will he signed was {{something other than a}} will), and <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> (for example, the testator is intentionally misled by a material fact that caused the testator to make a different devise from the one he would otherwise have made).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> is an {{equitable}} defense, and occurs when A signs a contract, {{knowing that it}} is a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the contract is about, but the reason A signed the contract was because of some false information that B gave to A. For example, if John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, then John explains that the deed will be kept in a safe deposit box until she dies. If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed prior to Mom's death, Mom can plead [...] "fraud in the inducement." ...|$|E

[...] Two minutes after the buyer drives off with it, the engine seizes, and the car stalls. Unless the buyer can show {{that there was some}} fraud involved, or the seller breached an express warranty, the buyer is not entitled to a refund. This would be a specific example where <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> could outweigh anything in the contract, express or implied: it simply doesn't matter what disclaimer or limitations may be found in the contract, if the contract is void (or voidable) for any reason.|$|E

50|$|Under such facts, Chandler can {{contest the}} will {{as the product}} of <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement,</b> because if the will is invalid, he will inherit Monica's property, as the {{surviving}} spouse. Ross can contest the will {{as the product of}} Chandler's undue influence, as Ross will inherit Monica's property if Chandler's behavior disqualifies Chandler from inheriting (however, that many jurisdictions do not consider a threat of divorce to be undue influence). Rachel has standing to contest the will, as she is named in the document, but she will not be permitted to submit any evidence as to the mistake because it is not an ambiguous term. Instead, she will have to sue Monica's lawyer for legal malpractice to recover the difference. Finally, Joey is neither someone who stands to inherit from Monica nor named in the will and so is barred from contesting the will altogether.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{misrepresentation}}: <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factum and <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>inducement.</b> <b>Fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. <b>Fraud</b> <b>in</b> inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.|$|R
40|$|The {{dividing}} line between contract and tort law {{has always been a}} difficult one to draw. The sale of a product generally involves two broad concerns. One concern is a private one that contracting parties can agree on the terms of a private sale within defined limits. The second concern is a public concern that the product sold not cause any injury or damage. The economic loss doctrine follows this public/private line of demarcation. The doctrine draws the line between contract and tort based on the type of damages suffered when the product does not meet contract specifications. The economic loss doctrine concludes that if a defective product causes solely economic loss, the dispute is essentially a private matter between the contracting parties and their contract should control their dispute. The public interest is not sufficiently involved to merit tort involvement. On the other hand, if a defective product causes personal injury or other property damage, then the public interest is involved and a tort approach, free of contractual limitations, is most apt. Difficulties arise, however, when one is fraudulently induced to enter into a contract for a product, and only economic loss is incurred. There is no personal injury or other property damage. How does the fraud impact where the line is drawn under the economic loss doctrine? Is the public interest sufficiently involved to invoke tort law, or is this still a private matter between private contracting parties that invokes only contract law? The states have taken a number of different positions on this issue. Most states have adopted the broad <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> exception to the economic loss doctrine. The broad exception provides that the fraud is an intentional tort, and as such, the intentional misrepresentation is actionable as a tort, notwithstanding that the contract losses are solely economic. A small minority of states, including recently Wisconsin, has adopted the narrow <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> exception to the economic loss doctrine. The narrow exception provides that if the fraudulent inducement relates to interwoven fraud, then the fraud is not actionable under tort law, only contract law. The only fraud actionable under the narrow <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> exception is fraud considered to be extraneous to the contract. The purpose of this Article is to examine the narrow <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> exception to the economic loss doctrine under Wisconsin case law, statutes, and public policy to determine if it is a sound principle...|$|E
40|$|This thesis puts forward two {{principal}} arguments. First, it argues that commercial letters {{of credit and}} standby letters of credit should not be treated on an equal footing. They are, and should be, treated as two separate undertakings {{with respect to the}} application of the fraud exception. Secondly, the thesis argues {{that there should be a}} 'wider' fraud exception for standby letters of credit; however, the need is to explore how wide that fraud exception should be. To support the arguments of this thesis, the study examines the application of the fraud exception in four major jurisdictions: the US, England, Canada and Australia. Out of these four jurisdictions, two - the US and Canada - have been expressly applying the wider fraud test to standby letters of credit and the other two have traditionally applied the more stringent fraud test to standby credits. The research will compare and critically examine these four jurisdictions' approaches to their different tests of the fraud rule to standby letters of credit, and argue that the fraud rule for standby letters of credit should neither be too narrow ('fraud in documents') nor should it be too wide (<b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inducement</b> or unconscionable conduct or bad faith). It is argued that standby letters of credit are more abstract than commercial letters of credit; therefore, protecting the principle of the autonomy of these independent undertakings is of paramount importance. The study argues that even the wider fraud exception (the 'fraud in the transaction' defence) should be given a narrow meaning: in order to protect the independence of standby credits, it should be confined to cases in which the beneficiary had 'no bona fide belief in the validity of its claim. The thesis clearly shows that the wider 'fraud as no bona fide claim' is an appropriate fraud defence for standby letters of credit whereas for commercial letters of credit the fraud exception should be narrowly confined to 'fraud in documents', which is arguably an appropriate test for these undertakings.
