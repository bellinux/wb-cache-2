In seventeen apparently disconnected scenes, groups of people give mutually contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist, a woman talked of as if she were, variously, a terrorist, the daughter of grieving parents, an artist and a new car.

40|$|A {{potential}} effect of ICTs {{is that they}} alleviate the traditional space-time constraints of paid-work activities and allow for the decomposition of work into multiple segments of sub-tasks, which can be performed at different times and/or locations. Such separation of activities into discrete pieces is commonly termed the fragmentation of activity. Regrettably, only limited empirical evidence {{is available on the}} fragmentation of work activity and the factors that contribute to it. The goal {{of this paper is to}} extend the previous work in the activity fragmentation arena in three ways: (i) to operationalize measures of spatial fragmentation and reformulate some of the temporal fragmentation measures for the specific purpose of investigating the fragmentation of the work activity; (ii) to analyse fragmentation not only in terms of the individual indicators, but also as a multi-dimensional construct including all dimensions of spatial and temporal fragmentation collectively; (iii) to test a detailed set of ICT-related, work-related, and sociodemographic variables to identify the factors that are crucial in the occurrence of the fragmentation of the work activity. The study shows that there is heterogeneity in the fragmentation of work. Three internally homogeneous patterns of fragmentation, which diverge in the degree of fragmentation, are identified: (1) a less temporally and spatially <b>fragmented</b> <b>work</b> pattern; (2) a less spatially and more temporally <b>fragmented</b> <b>work</b> pattern; (3) a more spatially and temporally <b>fragmented</b> <b>work</b> pattern. The multiple discriminant analysis suggests that ICT variables and work-related variables as well as personal-household attributes are associated with the fragmentation of work. However, the degree of association differs considerably among representative patterns of fragmentation...|$|E

Drawing on the qualitative commentaries of lower-level service workers, this study explores the temporal, social and interpersonal consequences of part-time work. While many employees liked part-time work, there was evidence that <b>fragmented</b> <b>work</b> schedules, mandated overtime and difficulties in taking time off work created tensions and problems for women in both the work and family domains.

We problematise the generalised ascription of low skill to jobs in which women are concentrated, unpacking concepts such as routinisation and 'social and aesthetic' competencies. Analysing examples from research in New Zealand, we argue for a wider conceptualisation of 'emotional' and 'aesthetic' labour in terms of its active cognitive, relational and ethical components, and extend the analysis to the 'invisible' skills that link and integrate <b>fragmented</b> <b>work</b> processes. 16 page(s...|$|E

The paper selects men in managerial and professional roles as the foci of study to enable a nuanced examination of the interstices between masculinity, <b>fragmented</b> <b>work</b> and professional employment status. Findings suggest that where men with high occupational status elect to work part-time, they face few barriers to access and their masculinity is hardly questioned, either by themselves or by others, and may even be reconfirmed and/or enhanced...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} Richard Sennett’s (1998) {{claims about}} the ways in which the traits of contemporary capitalism have impacted on personal and professional lives of people. It examines some of the main themes such as reduction of working lives, pressure on personal lives, emphasis on youth, devaluation of experience, demise of authority and teamwork, in the light of data from the film and TV industry. The data resonates with much of Sennett’s concern that when ‘pieces of work’ and ‘lumps of labour’ become the norm, people’s sense of who they are is corroded and (<b>fragmented)</b> <b>work</b> becomes a destabilising factor in one’s life. Considering the wider significance of such trends, questions are raised as to how symptomatic this type of employment is and whether it is indicative of the future of work in the Western societies...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Employees {{working for}} office-cleaning {{companies}} are {{directly affected by}} the growing competition in this sector. They face a heavier workload and heightened psychological pressure. A majority of these workers are less qualified women working part-time, with flexible and inconvenient schedules. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of the study is}} to highlight the workers' strategies to deal with fast work, schedule requirements and the consequent difficulties to reconcile their professional and private life commitments. METHODS: This study is based on in-depth interviews. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and twenty-five male and female workers responsible for cleaning offices. RESULTS: The themes generated from the results highlight a continued deterioration in working conditions in this sector. They also show that even approximate respect of the theoretical workload as calculated by the sub-contractor and the client company mainly depends on the workers' subjective strategies to accommodate increasingly <b>fragmented</b> <b>work</b> hours with their private lives. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, since these individual strategies are not enough {{to make up for the}} deterioration in work conditions, improving them requires sub-contractors and client companies to agree on organisational arrangements that take into account the reality of the employees' lives. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.
