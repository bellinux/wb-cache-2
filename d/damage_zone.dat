5|$|Hurricane King struck Miami {{around midnight}} local {{time with a}} very compact area of strong winds. Its eye was about 5.2miles (8.4km) in diameter; {{the western edge of}} the eye moved across Miami International Airport, which {{reported}} wind gusts of 125mph (202km/h), and the eastern side struck the Miami Weather Bureau office, which recorded sustained winds of 122mph (197km/h). The principal <b>damage</b> <b>zone</b> was sharply-defined in an area 14miles (23km) in diameter; the boundaries of the damage resembled the path of a tornado, although a subsequent analysis indicated the majority of the damage was not tornadic in nature. There was one confirmed report of a damaging tornado in Davie. As it made landfall, Hurricane King produced lightning near its center, which was the first confirmed occurrence in Florida. The Weather Bureau considered King the severest hurricane since the 1926 Great Miami Hurricane to hit the area.|$|E

500|$|The Hiroshima {{firestorm}} {{was roughly}} [...] in diameter, corresponding {{closely to the}} severe blast <b>damage</b> <b>zone.</b> (See the USSBS map, right.) Blast-damaged buildings provided fuel for the fire. Structural lumber and furniture were splintered and scattered about. Debris-choked roads obstructed fire fighters. Broken gas pipes fueled the fire, and broken water pipes rendered hydrants useless. At Nagasaki, the fires failed to merge into a single firestorm, and the fire-damaged area was only one fourth as great as at Hiroshima, {{due in part to}} a southwest wind that pushed the fires away from the city.|$|E
40|$|Well-exposed strike-slip faults in limestones in the {{north-western}} part of Gozo show <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> {{that can}} be grouped into three categories based on their location along faults; tip damage, linking damage and distributed damage. The predominant fracture types within <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> include extension fractures and secondary faults. Tip <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> usually show wedge-shaped patterns formed by antithetic faults and extension fractures, commonly accompanied by block rotation. Several fractures are combined at linking <b>damage</b> <b>zones,</b> typically with the concentration of a high intensity of fractures. Structures in distributed <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> are typically similar to the classical Riedel shear pattern. Evolutionary and 3 D models are proposed {{in terms of the}} geometries of <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> for small displacement strike-slip fault zones. Different evolutionary routes depend on fault tip modes and locations...|$|R
30|$|The <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> {{seen in the}} cores of the Nobeoka Thrust in {{both the}} hanging wall and {{footwall}} are of two types: cohesive, mineral vein filled <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> and brecciated fracture zones. The cohesive structures of the surrounding <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> are characterized by high peaks in resistivity and P/S-wave velocity, representing a densification occurring within the structures, whereas the brecciated zones cause an increase in caliper and porosity {{and a decrease in}} resistivity and P-wave velocity, representing highly fractured intervals.|$|R
40|$|Failure {{observation}} and numerical analysis {{were conducted to}} understand how shear damage develops in brittle solids under biaxial compression. A biaxial compression often induces shear damaged in brittle solids, which is preceded by a formation of huge number of array cracks. Cracks in the array appeared gradually as applied compression increased. They were almost similar in shape; gently curved but were possible to approximate a troop of straight cracks almost {{parallel to each other}} without loss of essential characteristics. Under a uniaxial compression, a brittle material tends to fail exhibiting a crack growth almost parallel to the loading axis. In this situation, the crack propagates rather in a stable fashion since the stress intensity factor at crack tip generally decreases with crack extension. Under a biaxial compression, however, such a stable crack growth is strongly inhibited. Consequently, an array of microcracks often appears as a presage of the macroscopic shear failure. A mechanism of the appearance of <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> with increase of applied compression was discussed using a scattered cracking model. It was found that each crack composing the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> has a possibility to open due to crack-to-crack interaction and a localized tensile stress appeared both in the interior and in the exterior of the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone.</b> The localized tension appeared in the interior of the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> may increase a crack density, while that appeared in the exterior of the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> would bring an enlargement of the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Different {{waveforms}} can be {{used for}} different electrosurgical procedures. [...] For cutting, a continuous single frequency sine wave is often employed. [...] Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of interstitial fluid. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V peak-to-peak) the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive plasma. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting. In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant thermal <b>damage</b> <b>zone</b> {{at the edges of the}} lesion. Open circuit voltage in electrosurgical waveforms is typically in the range of 300–10,000 V peak-to-peak.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{composite}} repair usually starts after {{damage detection}} either by unarmed eye or various other NDT-techniques. After evaluating {{the extent of}} the damage, the <b>damage</b> <b>zone</b> is prepared for reparation. This is done by removing the composite material around the <b>damage</b> <b>zone</b> 1. Three techniques are known to be utilised, being slightly different depending {{on the nature of the}} composite, as shown in Figure 4.|$|E
50|$|Both HSP70 and HSP47 {{were shown}} to be {{expressed}} in dermis and epidermis following laser irradiation, and the spatial and temporal changes in HSP expression patterns define the laser-induced thermal <b>damage</b> <b>zone</b> {{and the process of}} healing in tissues. HSP70 may define biochemically the thermal <b>damage</b> <b>zone</b> in which cells are targeted for destruction, and HSP47 may illustrate the process of recovery from thermally induced damage.|$|E
40|$|Fractures {{can play}} an {{important}} role in the ﬂuid storage –migration properties of fault <b>damage</b> <b>zones.</b> In this present contribution, we document the role exerted by fractures on ﬂuid ﬂow in carbonate <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> of hydrocarbon-bearing, km-long, oblique-slip normal faults with 10 's of m-throw. The carbonate fault <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> were analysed by mean of scan line surveys conducted in both tar-free and tar-rich outcrops. In this way, the relationships among the individ ual fracture characteristics (length, spacing, aperture, orientation, connectivity and distance from slip surfaces pertaining to small faults of the fault <b>damage</b> <b>zones)</b> and hydrocarbons have been established. Data obtained by scan line surveys were also used to compute the amount of fracture porosity, the degree of fracture connectivity and, based upon simple assumptions, the orientation of the local σhmax at times of faulting. Additionally, scan line surveys were also carried out along outcrops exposing unfaulted carbonate host rocks. The results of our computation are consistent with a carbonate host rock made up of a quite isotropic fracture array comprised of isolated and coupled fractures, in which individual fracture sets have negative exponential spacing distributions. In terms of ﬂuid ﬂ ow, the fracture array of the carbonate host rock enhances the ﬂuid storage. Conversely, the fracture array of the fault <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> is characterized by a pronounced anisotropy due to interconnected fractures, which enhance the ﬂuid migration. Fractures in the fault <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> include those inherited from background deformation and others related to the faulting processes. The latter fracture sets are characterized by power law spacing distributions. In conclusion, counter-intuitively, both fracture length and fracture spacing do not have any correlation with hydrocarbons in the fault <b>damage</b> <b>zones.</b> On the contrary, fracture anisotropy, fracture spread and fracture orientation are positively correlated with hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|In {{longwall}} mining, {{the instability}} of roadways can affect the mine safety, production rate and consequently the economic condition of mine. Therefore their stability analysis is one the most important technical problems in underground mining. The stability analysis and the design of support systems have to be investigated from two points of view; 1) the pressure and displacements of <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> around gate roadways due to the construction process and stress redistribution and 2) the working loading due to coal seam extraction and overburden caving that extends the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> size.

40|$|During 2005 and 2006, the USGS {{conducted}} geological {{studies of}} fault zones at surface outcrops at the Nevada Test Site. The objectives {{of these studies}} were to characterize fault geometry, identify the presence of fault splays, and understand the width and internal architecture of fault zones. Geologic investigations were conducted at surface exposures in upland areas adjacent to Yucca Flat, a basin in the northeastern part of the Nevada Test Site; these data serve as control points for {{the interpretation of the}} subsurface data collected at Yucca Flat by other USGS scientists. Fault zones in volcanic rocks near Yucca Flat differ in character and width as a result of differences in the degree of welding and alteration of the protolith, and amount of fault offset. Fault-related <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> tend to scale with fault offset; <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> associated with large-offset faults (> 100 m) are many tens of meters wide, whereas <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> associated with smaller-offset faults are generally a only a meter or two wide.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, we explore the regimes of two {{competing}} crack growth mechanisms in composites: self-similar crack extension {{as a result}} of fiber tensile damage and 90 o kinking {{as a result of}} matrix shear damage. Through finite element calculations it is shown that the two <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> extend and simultaneously shield each other under loading. Such cooperative shielding of the <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> has a synergistic effect on the composite strength and toughness. Although the constitutive properties of the <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> determine their relative extent, it is assumed that the preferred direction of crack extension is governed by the maximum energy release rate. The numerical values of strength and toughness against tensile/shear damage are obtained for a range of relative strength and ductility of the two <b>damage</b> <b>zones.</b> It is shown that a relatively weak and ductile shear zone is capable of increasing the macroscopic toughness by orders of magnitude. Conditions for the existence of such shear bands are stated for a range of orthotropy and a comparison is made on the toughness, strength, and preferred crack growth directions. The numerical model is then applied for an elliptical hole to examine the other extreme form of stress concentration. The extent of the shear damage is enhanced by the severity of orthotropy and initial stress concentration. As a result of this, for sufficiently long shear <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> a panel with a sharp crack is much tougher and stronger than the one with a circular hole...|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} the differences of ground motion characteristics in the heavily and less <b>damaged</b> <b>zones</b> {{as well as}} station KMMH 16, we conducted aftershock and microtremor (ambient noise) observations {{in and around the}} <b>damaged</b> <b>zones</b> of Mashiki (see the observation locations in Fig.  1 b). Figure  1 b also shows the locations of aftershock observation stations deployed by Yamanaka et al.

Our aftershock observation sites were installed in the heavily <b>damaged</b> <b>zones,</b> while the existing temporary aftershock stations were located outside of this zone. In this paper, we show the differences of the ground motion characteristics between the contrasting zones and propose a velocity structure model of the entire area for seismic response analysis.|$|R
30|$|According to the {{spectral}} shapes (histograms) given in Fig.  5 {{and the distribution}} of detectors along the line crossing the fault trace, the width of the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> in this fault location can be estimated to be about 25 – 30  m wide. This result is consistent with a recent model study by Shipton (Shipton and Cowie 2003), who showed that the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> width extends from 0 to about 30  m, which is close to our results. These authors argued that <b>damage</b> <b>zones</b> are formed at the tips of the slipping patches of the fault zones when these are subject to enhanced stress. Based on that study, off-fault deformations will potentially occur in regions of high stress around the tips of each slip patch if the stress exceeds a critical value at the fault surface.|$|R

5000|$|Hurricane Patricia, a Category 5 storm, {{became the}} most {{powerful}} cyclone ever measured in the Western Hemisphere with sustained wind speeds up to 200 mph (320 kph).

The storm changed from a Category 1 to a Category 5 in just 24 hours, thus catching some vacationers off guard and leaving many trapped in the town. The Jalisco state government put together 30 buses to evacuate tourists from the coast to Guadalajara, a 5-hour ride inland.

In this paper, a methodology was examined for computing the creation probability of <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> by Latin hypercube sampling based on a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) optimized by hybrid particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm (HPSOGA). The HPSOGA was carried out to decide the initial weights of the neural network.

30|$|The {{predictive}} {{ability of}} the model to describe the pressure history is remarkable.

Figure  4 compares the distribution of the damage due to the pressurization obtained in the experiments with the one provided by the numerical simulations. As expected, the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> extends widely in the plane normal to the direction of the minimum compressive stress, Fig.  4 a. The extension of the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> in the numerical simulation is visualized in terms of a scalar that describes the extension of the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> on a quarter of the numerical model that allows to see the different extension of damage on the two symmetry planes, Fig.  4 b, and is in agreement with the experimental distribution.|$|R
40|$|The {{drilling}} of galleries induces damage propagation in {{the surrounding}} medium and creates, around them, the excavation <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> (EDZ). The prediction of the extension and fracture structure of this zone remains a major issue, especially {{in the context of}} underground nuclear waste storage. Experimental studies on geomaterials indicate that localised deformation in shear band mode usually appears prior to fractures. Thus, the excavation <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> can be modelled by considering the development of shear strain localisation bands. In the classical finite element framework, strain localisation suffers a mesh-dependency problem. Therefore, an enhanced model with a regularisation method is required to correctly model the strain localisation behaviour. Among the existing methods, we choose the coupled local second gradient model. We extend it to unsaturated conditions and we include the solid grain compressibility. Furthermore, air ventilation inside underground galleries engenders a rock– atmosphere interaction that could influence the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone.</b> This interaction has to be investigated in order to predict the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> behaviour. Finally, a hydromechanical modelling of a gallery excavation in claystone is presented and leads to a fairly good representation of the EDZ. The main objectives of this study are to model the fractures by considering shear strain localisation bands, and to investigate if an isotropic model accurately reproduces the in situ measurements. The numerical results provide information about the <b>damaged</b> <b>zone</b> extension, structure and behaviour that are in very good agreement with in situ measurements and observations. For instance, the strain localisation bands that develop in chevron pattern during the excavation and rock desaturation, due to air ventilation, are observed close to the gallery.
