5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into a favourable attack position; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
25|$|Time. A {{key factor}} in guerrilla {{strategy}} is a drawn-out, protracted conflict that wears down {{the will of the}} opposing counter-insurgent forces. Democracies are especially vulnerable to the factor of time. The counter-insurgent force must allow <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the job done. Impatient demands for victory centered around short-term electoral cycles play {{into the hands of the}} guerrillas, though it is equally important to recognize when a cause is lost and the guerrillas have won.|$|E
25|$|At the 1 July deadline, the Israeli cabinet {{offered to}} {{negotiate}} with the hijackers to extend the deadline to 4 July. Amin also asked them to extend the deadline until that date. This meant he could take a diplomatic trip to Port Louis, Mauritius, to officially hand over chairmanship of the Organisation of African Unity to Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. This extension of the hostage deadline proved crucial to providing Israeli forces <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to Entebbe.|$|E

50|$|Often, the {{uncertainty}} of a measurement is found by repeating the measurement <b>enough</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a good estimate of the standard deviation of the values. Then, any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation. However, if the values are averaged, then the mean measurement value has a much smaller uncertainty, equal to the standard error of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root {{of the number of}} measurements. This procedure neglects systematic errors, however.|$|R

25|$|When {{the battle}} ended, British losses {{included}} Columbia sunk, Barbados damaged. Columbia suffered 16dead, {{with only one}} surviving deckhand being recovered after the action. The Germans lost A2 and A6 along with 13killed (including Schoemann) and 46captured. Controversy erupted after it was discovered from the captured Germans, that the three men taken from the sinking Columbia, had been locked away below decks {{on one of the}} torpedo boats and left to die, when the German vessel started to sink. The Germans reported {{that they did not have}} <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the British prisoners and barely were able to escape the sinking hulk themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Nikita Khrushchev, who {{had been}} a party leader during the war, remembered later on: [...] "In our war against the Finns we could choose the {{location}} of the war and the date of its start. In number we were superior to the enemy, we had <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ready for the operation. But on these most favourable terms we could only win through huge difficulties and incredibly great losses. In fact this victory was a moral defeat. Our people certainly never got knowledge of it because we never told them the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anders Hornslien, {{leader of}} Oslo AUF from 1991 and 1993, {{claimed he had}} nothing to do with the {{accounts}} of the organisation. He stated: [...] "I never approved such activities, and i've never supported the inflation of membership numbers." [...] He also denied that there were made lists of such people, which were used to apply for municipal grants. He admitted that he had paid a pile of 100 giros, he did not believe it to be suspicious however. [...] "We only paid contingents for those who had expressed that they wanted to be members of AUF, or for those whom we had reason to believe wanted to be members". He expressed, when questioned, that there was not <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the money back from the people who had confirmed by telephone, since the organisation was in the middle of organising its annual congress. Those who actually did pay, were signed up as paying members the following year.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the mobile}} game Before Crisis, the first Compilation game title to be released, has {{received}} limited western commentary, writers at AnimeFringe felt that [...] "the chance {{to reverse the}} good and bad guy roles should be welcomed by many." [...] Advent Children received mixed views from critics. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network felt that, due to the film's pace and context, viewers were not given <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to know the characters. These sentiments were echoed by John Eriani of Mania Entertainment, who particularly faulted the lack of character names or explanations of the villains' motives. Chris Carle of IGN was critical {{of the lack of}} motivation for those who were not familiar with the series, but praised both the English and Japanese voice acting. Michael Beckett of RPGamer, while generally less than impressed by the overall story, said that it [...] " [...] some interesting insights into a few of the less-developed characters of the game, though Cloud receives most of the attention and development as the story unfolds".|$|E
2500|$|There are differing {{recommendations}} {{about the}} importance of interviews, with the consensus view that interviews were overall less important than college admissions essays, but should be done if they were offered. One advisor suggested that visits by college admissions personnel to the high schools were a waste of time for colleges, since there was not <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to know specific applicants. In addition, she felt that personal interviews were generally overrated, though she noted that many Ivies have alumni interviews, which can help in borderline situations. One counselor suggested that if an interview was offered by a college admissions program, then it was not really optional but it should be seen as a requirement, that is, not going to such an interview could be detrimental to a student's chances for admission. Another suggested that a student should try to get an interview, even if it was not required, since it might help [...] "exhibit character strengths" [...] that might not show up via grades on high school transcripts. Several reports noted that most Ivy League schools have abandoned the interview requirement, but that if there is an opportunity for an interview, even with an alumnus of the college, then {{it is a good idea}} to do it since not doing it signals a lack of interest in the school. Knowing a college can be helpful during an interview, so that an applicant can say something specific about the school, or a professor who teaches there, or a subject or internship opportunities, since it shows sincere interest. Interviews (if offered) may be more of a factor at small liberal arts colleges: ...|$|E

I have taken the trouble to examine a little into the gentleman's past record--he has been chairman of such committees for years past, and I find no trace that bills inimical to certain great interests have ever been reported back by him. The Pingsquit bill involves the vital principle of competition. I have read it with considerable care and believe it to be, in itself, a good measure, which deserves a fair hearing. I have had no conversation whatever with those who are said to be its promoters. If the bill is to pass, it has little <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the Senate. By the gentleman from Putnam's own statement his committee have given it its share of attention, and I believe this House is entitled to know the verdict, is entitled to accept or reject a report.
