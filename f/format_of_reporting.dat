How are these issues covered and framed by Nigerian newspapers? Content analysis of systematically sampled, 438 issues from 4380 issues of four purposively selected dailies between 2007 and 2009 shows dominance of climate politics/economics issues (61. 2 %), foreign sourcing <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> (63. 4 %), straight news <b>formatting</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> (83. 6 %) and framing in terms of mitigation (55. 2 %).

40|$|Background: Improved {{nutritional}} status is needed throughout {{the life cycle}} including children under five. Of age in formulating suitable policies for nutrition improvement program, decision makers require relevant information about {{nutritional status}} of the community. The implementation of health information system at District of Majene is not yet optimum. There are some problems such as inaccurate data, inconsistent or unreliable data, delay in data reporting, and processing and presentation of data are rarely made, reporting is done as routine disregarding data quality, there is no feedback from the health office and so on. Decentralization has offered {{an opportunity for the}} health center to make its own policy in optimizing nutrition improvement program. However, health centers at District of Majene have never made decisions based on evidence. Objective: The study aimed to get an overview of data and information management of nutritional status of children under five comprising availability, processing, presentation of data, and the decision making of nutrition program at the health centers of District of Majene. Method: This was a descriptive case study with qualitative method. Subjects of the study were nutrition staff of the health centers, head of health centers, and head of nutrition section of district health office with health centers and head of health office as analysis units. Data were obtained through indepth interview, focus group discussion, questionnaire, observation, and documentation. Results: Data and information on nutritional status of children under five years of age were available in all health centers; however <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> was unavailable. Data in LB 3 accurate, in FIII/gizi and SKDN were inaccurate because there was data manipulation and cadres had limited skills. Data were not valid because there was no signature of head of the health center in the report. Data in FIII/gizi and SKDN reliable, in LB 3 not reliable  because there was no coordination among staff. Data in SKDN were completed, in FIII/gizi and LB 3 incomplete because some of the forms were blank. Data were not provided timely due to less commited cadres, geographical factors, and lack of pressure from the health office. Data were accessible because staff were active in maintaining records. Data were processed manually and presented in the form of narratives, tables and graphs. Decisions made were socialization, counseling, growth monitoring and comple- mentary breastfeeding distribution monitoring. However, they were not based on data so that reports were only made as routine activities. Conclusion: Data and information on nutritional status of children under five years of age were available at the health centers with quality data in every <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> of various kinds.

40|$|Seafood {{consumption}} {{is related to}} both favorable health benefits of nutrients and to potential adverse health impacts of chemical contamination. To quantify {{the magnitude of this}} dilemma, probabilistic intake assessments can be performed. One step in such a procedure involves the determination of nutrient and contaminant concentrations in seafood for which data need to be collected. This article describes the process of building up a database containing previously published contaminant concentrations in seafood, and defining input distributions characterizing the variability. During the constitution of the database, several problems influencing the comparability of the data were encountered related to (1) sampling plans of the published data; (2) sample handling prior to analysis; (3) analytical methodologies; (4) the <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> results; and (5) missing data. Different solutions for these methodological problems have been developed. Contaminant concentrations ranges per gram fresh weight of 2. 4 - 4390. 0 ng for mercury, 0. 1 - 5736. 6 ng for the sum of indicator PCB, 0. 002 - 115. 000 pg TEQ for the sum of all PCBs, 0. 002 - 34. 400 pg TEQ for dioxins, and 0. 006 - 126. 000 pg TEQ for total of dioxin-like compounds were found.

40|$|Report of diploma work {{conducted}} at the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) {{as part of the}} bachelors program in Nuclear Engineering at Uppsala University. All nuclear power plants in Sweden are obliged to report any deficiency in their barriers or the defense in depth in obedience to SSM’s regulations concerning safety in nuclear facilities. In addition, there is an international system for reporting such events. The purpose of this thesis is to study the Swedish report system and to analyze the differences between Swedish and international event reporting. In the Swedish system, SSM’s regulations are effectuated by means of event reports classified as category 1 - 3, designed individually at each Swedish facility. Accordingly, the reporting differs somewhat between facilities. The number of reports in the Swedish system is relatively large, with a frequency of about 400 per year. Internationally, a system called the International Reporting System for Operating Experience (IRS) has been developed, through which the participating countries exchange experience to improve the safety of nuclear power plants. The IRS reporting frequency is about 100 per year in total, and Sweden contributes to IRS with 1 - 2 reports per year. This report accounts for a comparison of the two report systems, including some differences and similarities that have been identified. The result shows that the Swedish system covers IRS well but does not have the same comprehensive classification of events and the same standardized <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> as the IRS system. The conclusion is that some improvements may be made to the Swedish system, which would facilitate the international exchange of experience at the Swedish nuclear power plants...|$|E

40|$|Data {{journalism is}} a rather new <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> news stories online, which {{utilizes}} open data {{as the basis of}} stories and illustrates findings visually. The data journalism creation process and the way the information is being presented are very different to that of traditional print journalism. The objectives of this research are to identify current data journalism creation processes, forecast the future process outlook and to discuss journalists' role in the process. There has been very little academic research conducted in the field of data journalism previously. Therefore, the literature review within this thesis has a wide scope and is explorative in nature while the findings {{serve as the basis for}} creating a future model for data journalism creation processes. The viability of the created future model has been tested by interviewing three Finnish data journalism professionals. Suggested streamlined process model for the future of data journalism proposes that in the future the two most work-intensive data journalism creation phases, data manipulation and story visualization, will be outsourced to organizations specialized in these phases. This model is generally accepted as a viable future scenario by the professionals interviewed. However, there is some concern about communication between journalists and the institution to which the data journalism creation process is being outsourced to. This notion of the importance of communication prompted the creation of two more models that take communication more into consideration: (1) data journalism consultancy model and (2) outsourced chain model for data journalism. Together these two models suggest four approaches for producing data journalism in the future, these are: (a) an in-house data journalism team,(b) partner up with an organization specialized in creating data journalism and outsource the whole data journalism creation process except story creation to it, (c) outsource each phase to a separate phase provider and (d) a hybrid model of the first and last mentioned approach. The role that journalists will have in the data journalism creation process of the future will alter according to which model media organization decides to adopt...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. The size of South Africa's banking {{industry}} grew from R 398 billion in 1995 to R 471 billion in 1996 while banking transactions totalled R 58 634 billion during 1996. Like most other service companies, the {{banking industry}} also experiences customer turnover. During the period March 1995 to February 1996 customer switch, which refers to the {{closing of an account}} at one institution and the opening of a new account at another institution, by clients of all banks amounted to 4, 9 percent. Mutual interaction between a service provider and a client is a very important determinant of customer satisfaction with a service. It is therefore important for the company to focus on the retention of customers because it is more profitable to retain a customer rather than recruiting new customers. Customer switching can damage the future stream of income of a company. The loss of a customer therefore, is not only one transaction, the company looses a life long stream of income. Customer satisfaction therefore influences the primary source of future income of most companies directly. Quality service is of utmost importance for the success and survival of companies in today's competitive environment. To be successful it is necessary for each department within the company to operate effectively and to be client orientated. Companies believe that they will be more profitable if a marketing orientation is established within the company. Employees must therefore, understand their role in the total service chain. A client's perception of a service becomes reality when he/she experiences the service during a service encounter where interaction between the customer and the company takes place with the employee as intermediary. Employees of the company are seen as individuals who are in a relationship with the company similar to that between an external customer and the company. A company must therefore concentrate on both his external and internal clients because quality service rendered to internal clients results in quality service to the external client. The rendering of quality service is a very important dimension, in ensuring success and survival of a company. If investment in service quality therefore results in perceived improvement in service, quality is a profit strategy. Although theoretical studies suggest that companies offering a higher degree of service quality generate higher profits, no published studies or model exist where the total series of consequences, from the allocation of resources to customer satisfaction and eventually profitability, is discussed. Researchers believe that customer satisfaction results in profitability, but question the possibility of a positive correlation between market share and customer satisfaction. Against this background it was {{the purpose of this study}} to determine the impact of service quality, customer retention and staff retention on the market share and profitability of a financial institution by constructing a service quality-profitability relationship model to determine the relationship between the different dependent and independent variables. A literature and empirical study was therefore undertaken to on the one hand evince the role and importance of the relationship between the service company and the customer, employee and internal markets in accomplishing a loyal customer base and enduring market share and to on the other hand relate service quality with market share and profitability. The primary finding of this study is that relationships exist between the various dependent and independent variables of the hypothesized model which confirms that service quality do impact on market share which in turn correlates with the profitability of a company. Moreover, customer retention positively correlates with profitability. It was also determined that customer retention positively correlates with market share. It was, however, found that no correlation exists between service quality and customer retention whilst relationships between marketing costs and market share and marketing costs and profitability could also not be determined. In view of the findings of the empirical investigation, it is recommended that the chosen bank attends to the following aspects: the improvement of service excellence; the improvement of aspects accomplishing customer and employee retention; establishing a more Afrosentric rather than a Eurosentric dimension of culture within the organisational culture and managerial practice of the bank; determining the critical psychological state of employees; establishing a positive and constructive psychological state within the bank; revising the <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> management information in order to calculate the impact of service quality on profitability rather than determining relationships between the elements. In taking this approach, the bank should be able to employ the service quality-profitability relationship model to the advantage of the bank to measure the impact of service quality on profitability and optimizing the relationship between service quality and profitability...|$|E
40|$|Development {{and change}} of {{collective}} memory in anniversary journalism: {{the example of}} deportations. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine how anniversary journalism has shaped the collective memory of a historical event and its transformation in time. In order to do so, I have chosen a very important yet painful example of deportations in Estonian cultural history. The reporting of historical events in journalism also affects the society’s sense of past, because remembering allows us to build a bridge between the present and the past. In order to evaluate how the press has formed the self-consciousness of Estonians through deportations remembrance, I have in the empirical part of the paper analysed the deportations related articles published in Postimees and Eesti Päevaleht in the re-independence period, years 1992 - 2011. The analysis of commemoration practice and its alteration also helps to create a presumption on how the collective memory of the event will change in the future. To appraise the above-mentioned process of change, I have analysed the frequency of publications, the distribution of rubric and genres, discussion approach, authors and sources, valuations and judgements, linking the topic to Russia and usage of visual materials in the articles. The main research method used is the content analysis, however in order to expand the evaluations I have also used qualitative method of content descriptions. In order for the collective memory of past events to persevere, it is important that the topic is constantly discussed from year to year. As a result of this paper, it came apparent that there is a clear decline in the quantity of publications on the deportation related articles during the last decade (2001 - 2011). This means that the interest in the topic is decreasing and that the collective memory is weakening. The quantitative downwards trend of evaluation of the articles is also notable. Nevertheless, the public opinion on what happened to the Estonian nation in the 1940 s has generally remained unaffected during all these 20 years. The standpoint that deportations are one of the most tragic events in recent history of Estonia which have negatively affected the development of Estonian society and that it is important to remember these events carries on. On the other hand, it is also clear that besides the decline in the frequency of publications, the evaluations lack emotions. One of the reasons behind this is the distance in time from the actual event and in addition the tendency to use news flash instead of opinion stories and that itself limits the evaluations given to these events. The superficiality of the reflected topics using the news flash articles can also be connected to the increasing role of commemoration events in the deportation anniversary journalism. In the context of the collective memory however, this indicates to the narrowing of the memory, as the descriptions of the events concentrate less on the reasons and aftermaths and more on the reporting of these anniversary events. The recent trend of youth participation in the commemoration events is a sign of transformation of the collective memory discourse. Similarly, the discourse of memory in journalism has also converged to the younger generations, which has a great positive tendency from the aspect of the preservation of public interest and collective memory. The participation of younger generation renovates the collective memory of Estonians as deportation being a distant event fading away with the older generation. Therefore it is fair to conclude that regardless of news flash format decreasing the boundaries of collective memory, the focus on participation of younger generation in the memorial events somewhat balances the contraction process. In conclusion, there are several indicators which confirm the press created narrowing of the collective memory. The decrease in frequency of publications of deportation related articles in the last decade, the decrease in assessment and lack of emotions in them, but also the news flash <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> the memorial events being one of the main reasons. As the current practice of commemorating and the analysis of its transformation help to create a presumption on what would the future hold for the collective memory of Estonians, the tendencies are rather dark-toned. On the other hand, the youth focused memory discourse shows promise that the interest against deportation might increase once again. This in turn could bring along more analytical reporting and restrain the narrowing of the collective memory...|$|E
