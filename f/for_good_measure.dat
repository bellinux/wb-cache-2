The final section of the match had several slow sections where one wrestler set up a table, a ladder or an elaborate chair set up while the other wrestler had to lay on the mat and pretend to be knocked down. At one point Crazy Boy very obviously pushed himself into position so that Extreme Tiger could execute a leap off the top rope onto him. In the final moments of the match saw Extreme Tiger leap out of the ring and splash Crazy Boy through a table.

40|$|Background The {{scope to}} measure the quality and {{performance}} of ambulance service care is limited by poor access to follow up patient information and lack of consensus about what to measure. The Prehospital Outcomes for Evidence Based Evaluation (PhOEBE) research programme aims to address these research gaps by identifying potentially important prehospital quality measures and testing these using a prehospital/linked[*]subsequent health service dataset. Methods We undertook systematic reviews of published and aspirational measures, together with interviews with ambulance service users to identify potential measures. Measures identified from reviews and interviews were prioritised using a multi-stakeholder consensus conference. Measures identified as high priority were further refined and ranked through an expert Delphi method and a service user/patient public involvement workshop. High ranking measures were further assessed against criteria <b>for</b> <b>good</b> outcome <b>measures,</b> including feasibility, importance and relevance, to create a shortlist of measures. Results Eight high-ranking measures were shortlisted following assessment against criteria <b>for</b> <b>good</b> outcome <b>measures.</b> These were: -Mean reduction in pain score -Proportion of serious emergency conditions correctly identified -Average response time (mean/median) -Proportion of non-conveyance decisions which resulted in admission or death within 3 [*]days (hear and treat and see and treat) -Proportion of patients with a low risk of death, who subsequently die within 3 [*]days of an ambulance contact -Proportion of ambulance patients with a serious emergency condition who survive to admission, and to 7 [*]days post-admission -Proportion of unnecessary transports to ED -Proportion of cases with a specific condition treated in accordance with established protocols and guidelines, e. g. stroke, diabetes, falls Conclusion These measures {{can be used to}} assess the impact of care provided by the ambulance service and to support quality improvement through monitoring, audit and service evaluation.

Although the notion of being multicultural is positive, this pressure is problematic, as it hinders the ability of psychologists to measure self-reported racism.

White {{people are more likely to}} show a preference for white individuals over black individuals when taking the implicit association test (IAT).
