40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequence of}} the RNA segment that codes for a major outer capsid protein (VP 5) of bluetongue virus serotype 10 has been determined from overlapping cDNA clones inserted into pBR 322. The segment 5 RNA of the virus (M 5 RNA) is deduced to be 1638 base pairs long (1. 05 × 106 daltons) and has an open reading frame in one strand capable of coding for a protein with a calculated size of 59163 daltons (526 amino acids) and a net charge of- 4. 5 at neutral pH. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the prototype virus of the Orbivirus genus in the family Reoviridae. The ten segment, double-stranded RNA genome of BTV (dsRNA L 1 to L 3, M 4 to M 6, $ 7 to S 10) {{is located in a}} core particle which exhibits icosahedral symmetry (Els & Verwoerd, 1969). The core is composed of two major (VP 3, VP 7) and three minor protein components (VP 1, VP 4, VP 6) and is surrounded by an outer capsid protein layer consisting of two major species, VP 2 and VP 5 (Verwoerd et aL, 1972). The {{sequence of the}} L 3 RNA which codes for the VP 3 protein has been determined (Purdy et al., 1984); its equence is highly conserved among the BTV serotypes, forming the basis for their identification by nucleic acid hybridization (Ghiasi et al., 1985; Roy et al., 1985). Polypeptide VP 2 is coded by RNA segment L 2 (Kahlon et al., 1983; Sangar & Mertens, 1983).

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{transcription}} reaction of bluetongue virus (BTV) {{is characterized by a}} core-mediated, temperature-dependent inhibition at high core concentrations and temperatures (Van Dijk & <b>Huismans,</b> 1980; <b>Huismans,</b> Van D 1 jk & Els, 1987 a). It has been found that this inhibition is reversible and that an inactivated transcriptase reaction mixture can be reactivated by lowering the temperature of the reaction from 37 °C to 28 °C. In the same way it is possible to inactivate a reaction by increasing the incubation temperature from 28 °C to 37 °C. It was also found that the inhibition is counteracted by the addition of sucrose or glycerol. At relatively low core concentrations and in the presence of sucrose it is possible to obtain conditions under which transcription at 37 °C is more efficient than at 28 °C. The latter conditions probably reflect much better the in vivo temperature optimum for the BTV transcriptase than the in vitro conditions at very high core concentrations.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a dsRNA virus that is an economically important pa hogen of sheep and cattle {{in many parts of}} the world. The genome consists of 10 dsRNA segments (Verwoerd et al., 1970), each of which encodes a single protein (Mertens et al., 1984).

This core particle is surrounded by a diffuse outer layer of two further proteins (VP 2 and VP 5). Three non-structural proteins are also synthesized in infected cells but these are not incorporated into the virion (<b>Huismans,</b> 1979).

25|$|Willian Henry Harvey (1811–1866), Keeper of the Herbarium and Professor in Botany at Trinity College, Dublin, {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{distinguished}} algologists of his time (Papenfuss, 1976 p.26). Apart from Ireland he visited South Africa, the Atlantic seaboard of America as far south as the Florida Keys on the east coast of North America and Australia (1854–1856). Between 1853 and 1856 he visited Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand and various parts of the South Pacific (<b>Huisman,</b> 2000 & Papenfuss, 1976). His collection in Australia resulted in one of the most extensive collections of marine plants and it inspired others (<b>Huisman,</b> 2000). He published: Nereis Australis Or Algae of the Southern Ocean in 1847–1849 and in 1846–51 his Phycologia Britannica appeared. His Nereis Boreali-Americana was published in three parts (1852–1858) this was the first, and still is (1976) is the only marine algal flora of North America as it includes taxa from the Pacific coast (Papenfuss, 1976 p.27). His five-volume Phycologia Australica was published in 1858 to 1863. These volumes remain to this day a most important reference to Australian algae (<b>Huisman,</b> 2000). His primary herbarium is in Trinity College, Dublin (TCD). However large collections of Harvey material are to be found in the Ulster Museum (BEL) (Morton, 1977; Morton, 1981); University of St Andrews (STA) and National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Melbourne, Australia (May, 1977). Many of the collectors of this period sent, and exchanged, specimens freely one to another, as a result Harvey's books show a remarkable knowledge of the distribution of algae elsewhere in the world. His Phycologia Britannica lists species recorded and collected from various parts of the British Isles. For example, he notes William Thompson (1805–1852), William McCalla (c.1814–1849), John Templeton (1766–1825) and D. Landsborough (1779–1854) who collected, as he did, from distinct sites in Ireland. The collections of these botanists, and many others, are represented separately by collections in the Ulster Museum (BEL).|$|E

30|$|Our seismic data confirm that, {{unlike the}} {{southern}} Okinawa Trough, the faulting {{style in the}} northern Okinawa Trough is significantly asymmetric (e.g., eastward dipping normal faults shown in Fig.  8). It is generally known that such deformation style and faulting pattern in a rift basin vary depending on several parameters, such as the strength and thermal structure of the plate and the extension rate (e.g., Ruppel 1995). Gungor et al. (2012) argue that the subduction of the thick Amami Plateau at the northern Ryukyu Trench plays a primary role for the diffuse rifting in the northern Okinawa Trough by producing a local disturbance in speed of the trench rollback and the resultant back-arc rifting rate. As another effect, we here {{point out that the}} lithosphere consisting of the northern Ryukyu arc and the northern Okinawa Trough is probably hotter and weaker than typical continental lithospheres due to the active upwelling of magma from the subducting slab (Wang et al. 2008). Within such a hot and weak plate, extensional strain tends to be delocalized and a broad deformation zone is formed more easily (Buck et al. 1999). We also note that the rifting rate decreases as it goes northeastward along the Okinawa Trough and the current extension is thought to occur at a slow rate of 22  mm/year around the study area (Argus et al. 2011). If this slow rate has been persistent over the rifting history, it also contributes to forming a diffuse basin (<b>Huismans</b> and Beaumont 2003).|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} {{bluetongue}} virus (BTV) to previously disease-free regions which prohibit {{the use of}} the current BTV live-attenuated vaccine has highlighted the need {{for a new generation of}} vaccines (Ferrari, De Liberato et al. 2005; Veronesi, Hamblin et al. 2005). Subunit vaccines are one of the attractive alternative strategies. Subunit vaccines against BTV would target the outercapsid protein VP 2, the main neutralization-specific antigen (<b>Huismans,</b> van der Walt et al. 1987; Roy, Urakawa et al. 1990; Roy, French et al. 1992; Roy, Bishop et al. 1994). A subunit vaccine based on the use of BTV-VP 2 may be achieved by either using VP 2 by itself or by means of virus-like particles (VLPs) on which VP 2 proteins are exposed. In VLPs, the VP 2 is co-expressed with other capsid and core proteins to form a particle that resembles the intact BTV. The BTV-VLP vaccine strategy is advantageous since it presents the neutralizing epitopes of more than one viral protein in a more authentic manner as found on the virus itself (<b>Huismans,</b> van der Walt et al. 1987; Roy, Urakawa et al. 1990; Roy, French et al. 1992; Roy, Bishop et al. 1994). However there are difficulties associated with large scale production and a decrease in the stability of the particles over time (Berg, Difatta et al. 2005; Wang, Zhao et al. 2006). Studies have already demonstrated the vaccine potential of BTVVP 2 by itself (<b>Huismans,</b> van der Walt et al. 1987; Roy, Urakawa et al. 1990; Roy, French et al. 1992; Roy, Bishop et al. 1994). However if BTV-VP 2 is to be used by itself as a single subunit vaccine, it is important that the protein is expressed under conditions where it is correctly folded and soluble. Solubility refers to the capacity of the expressed antigen to fold into an ordered tertiary structure that authentically exposes the neutralizing epitopes to the immune system (Dinner, Sali et al. 2000; Dobson 2003). However non-native interactions within and between in vitro synthesized viral proteins such as BTV-VP 2 often leads to protein aggregation or insolubility. The immune response against aggregated or insoluble proteins is generally very poor. This problem of aggregation and insolubility may be alleviated to an extent by generating truncated versions of the protein from which hydrophobic regions that promote aggregation have been deleted leaving only the major neutralizing epitopes of the antigen (Fukumoto, Xuan et al. 2003; Bonafe, Rininger et al. 2009; Liu, Zeng et al. 2009; Seo, Pyo et al. 2009). The focus of the research presented in this dissertation was to evaluate the solubility of full-length BTV(10) -VP 2 and truncated versions thereof after expression in a prokaryotic and baculovirus-Sf 9 expression system. The full-length BTV(10) -VP 2 (956 amino acids) gene and genes encoding truncated versions of BTV(10) -VP 2 i. e. BTV(10) -VP 2 (aa 450) (amino acid 1 to 450) and BTV(10) - VP 2 (aa 650) (amino acid 1 to 650) were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET 160 -DEST and the baculovirus expression vector pDEST™ 8. The C-terminal hydrophobic regions which might contribute to aggregation or insolubility of the protein when expressed in vitro were deleted from these truncated BTV(10) -VP 2 proteins. The truncated proteins however still contained BTV neutralizing epitopes that were predicted from literature. The prokaryotic expression of the full-length BTV(10) -VP 2 and the other truncated recombinant BTV(10) -VP 2 proteins was carried out in E. coli BL 21 Star DE 3 expression strain. The initial pilot expression study confirmed high level expression of the recombinant proteins. The study also revealed that these proteins were insoluble. The optimization of the prokaryotic expression in order to increase the yield of soluble proteins by means of differential inducer concentrations, fermentation temperature and harvesting times did not produce soluble BTV(10) -VP 2 and truncated BTV(10) -VP 2 proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of L-arginine in the recovery of soluble proteins from aggregation by reversing aggregation (Tsumoto, Umetsu et al. 2003). However in the current study, arginine treatment of the inclusion body and bacterial lysate containing the BTV(10) - VP 2 and truncated recombinant proteins did not release soluble proteins. No soluble recombinant BTV(10) -VP 2 proteins were detected when the recombinant proteins were expressed in BL 21 host cells over-expressing heat-shock proteins (hsps) and chemical chaperones. However when the different recombinant proteins were co-expressed with the molecular chaperones dnaK-dnaJ-GrpE, it resulted in a fraction of soluble recombinant BTV(10) -VP 2 proteins. In particular, approximately 50 % of the total expressed BTV(10) -VP 2 (aa 450) protein was soluble while approximately 20 % of the total expressed BTV(10) -VP 2 (aa 650) and full-length BTV(10) -VP 2 were found soluble when coexpressed with dnaK-dnaJ-GrpE chaperones. These recombinant proteins could be eluted from a nickel affinity column further confirming that these proteins are in fact soluble. Interestingly the coexpression of the BTV(10) -VP 2 (aa 450) protein with the above chaperones in combination with chaperones groEL-groES or only groEL-groES did not produce any soluble proteins. Baculovirus-insect expression of the aforementioned BTV(10) -VP 2 recombinant proteins was carried out in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf 9) cells. High level expression of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by an initial pilot expression study conducted at 42 hours post infection (p. i.). The pilot study also revealed that the recombinant proteins were insoluble. Arginine treatment of the lysate released a small fraction of soluble BTV(10) -VP 2 (aa 450) and BTV(10) -VP 2 (ORF) proteins only detectable with immunoblot analysis using the anti-BTV(10) IgY antibodies. The amount of solubilized proteins was however too small to justify the cost associated with this expression system. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Geneticsunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|MSc (Biochemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 African horsesickness (AHS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} deadly {{diseases}} of horses, with a mortality rate of over 90 % in horses that have not been exposed to any African horsesickness virus (AHSV) serotype previously (Howell, 1960; Darpel et al., 2011). The Orbiviruses, African horsesickness virus (AHSV) and Bluetongue virus (BTV), are primarily transmitted to their mammalian hosts through certain haematophagous midge vectors (Culicoides spp.) (Erasmus, 1973). The selective cleavage of BTV and AHSV VP 2 by trypsin-like serine proteases (Marchi et al., 1995) resulted in the generation of subsequent infectious sub-viral particles (ISVP) (Marchi et al., 1995; van Dijk & <b>Huismans,</b> 1982). It is believed that this cleavage affects the ability of the virus to infect cells of the mammalian and vector host (Darpel et al., 2011). Darpel et al (2011) identified a trypsinlike serine protease in the saliva of Culicoides sonorensis (C. sonorensis), which also cleaves the serotype determinant viral protein 2 (VP 2) of BTV. And, a similar cleavage pattern was also observed by van Dijk & <b>Huismans</b> (1982) and Marchi et al (1995) with the use of trypsin and chymotrypsin. Manole et al (2012) recently determined the structure of a naturally occurring African horsesickness virus serotype 7 (AHSV 7) strain with a truncated VP 2. Upon further investigation, this strain was also shown to be more infective than the AHSV 4 HS 32 / 62 strain, since it outgrew AHSV 4 in culture (Manole et al., 2012). Therefore, through proteolytic cleavage of these viral particles, the ability of the adult Culicoides to transmit the virus might be significantly increased (Dimmock, 1982; Darpel et al., 2011). Based on these findings, it is important to investigate the factors that influence the capability of arthropod-borne viruses to infect their insect vectors, mammalian hosts and their known reservoirs. In this study, we postulated that one of the vectors for AHSV, Culicoides imicola (C. imicola), has a protease similar to the 29 kDa C. sonorensis trypsin-like serine protease identified by Darpel et al (2011). Proteins in the total homogenate of C. imicola were separated on SDS-PAGE and yielded several protein bands, one of which also had a molecular mass of around 29 kDa. Furthermore, proteolytic activity was observed on a gelatin-based sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacryamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel. The activity of the protein of interest was also confirmed to be a trypsin-like serine protease with the use of class-specific protease inhibitors. A recombinant trypsin-like serine protease of C. sonorensis was generated using the pColdIII bacterial expression vector. The expressed protein was partially purified with nickel ion affinity chromatography. Zymography also confirmed proteolytic activity. With the use of the protease substrates containing fluorescent tags and class specific protease inhibitors, the expressed protein was classified as a serine protease. It was also proposed that incubation of purified AHSV 4 with the recombinant protease would result in the cleavage of AHSV 4 VP 2, resulting in similar VP 2 digestion patterns as observed in BTV by Darpel et al (2011) or the truncated VP 2 of AHSV 7 by Manole et al (2012). BHK- 21 cell cultured AHSV 4 was partially purified through Caesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation after which the virus was incubated with the recombinant protease. Since not enough virus sample was obtained, the outcome of VP 2 digestion was undetermined. In the last part of this study, it was postulated that C. imicola and C. sonorensis have the same trypsin-like serine protease responsible for the cleavage of VP 2 based on the protease activity visualised in the whole midge homogenate. Since the genome of C. imicola is not yet sequenced, the sequence of this likely protease is still unknown. Therefore, we attempted to identify this C. imicola protease through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Total isolated ribonucleic acid (RNA) of C. imicola was used to synthesize complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA). The cDNA was subjected to PCR using C. sonorensis trypsin-like serine protease-based primers. An 830 bp DNA fragment was amplified. However, sequence alignment and the basic local alignment software tool (BLAST), revealed that DNA did not encode with any other known proteins or proteases. From the literature it seems that there is a correlation between the proteases in the vector and the mammalian species that succumb to AHS (Darpel et al., 2011, Wilson et al., 2009, Marchi et al., 1995). Based on the work performed in the study, a proteolytically active protein similar to the 29 kDa protein of C. sonorensis is present in C. imicola. The 29 kDa protease of C. sonorensis can also be expressed in bacteria which could aid in future investigations on how proteolytic viral modifications affect infectivity between different host species.

40|$|African horsesickness virus (AHSV) is a {{double-stranded}} RNA virus {{belonging to}} the Orbivirus genus in the Reoviridae family (Bremer et al., 1990; Calisher and Mertens, 1998). The virus is highly pathogenic and its mortality rate in horses, the most susceptible species, may {{be as high as}} 95 % (House, 1993). S 10, the smallest genome segment of AHSV, codes for two proteins (NS 3 and NS 3 A) from in-phase overlapping reading frames. The C-terminal sequences of these proteins are identical, but NS 3 A lacks the first 10 amino acids present on the N-terminal of NS 3 (Van Staden and <b>Huismans,</b> 1991). Nonstructural protein NS 3 is a membrane protein, associated with both smooth intracellular membranes and the plasma membrane. NS 3 has pleiotropic roles in the viral life cycle including the transport and release of mature virions and viroporin-like alteration of cell membrane permeability. NS 3 is cytotoxic when expressed in bacterial or insect cells, and is speculated to {{play a vital role in}} viral virulence and disease pathogenesis (Stoltz et al., 1996; Van Staden et al., 1995). A number of different domains that could mediate the membrane interaction or intracellular trafficking of NS 3 have been identified. The relative contributions of these domains in insect and mammalian cells are not known, but could differ, as there are distinct differences in NS 3 expression levels, cytopathic effects and virus release mechanisms in these two cell types. In order to investigate the subcellular localisation of NS 3, a number of full-length, truncated or mutant versions of AHSV- 3 NS 3 were constructed as C-terminal eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) fusion proteins. These proteins were used to generate recombinant baculoviruses for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf 9) insect cells and were compared in terms of their subcellular localisation by conventional fluorescence microscopy. Confocal laser microscopy was used to investigate co-localisation with the nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Subcellular fractionations and membrane flotation analyses were used to confirm membrane interactions and to identify detergent-resistant membrane fractions. NS 3 as well as a C-terminal deletion of NS 3 targeting a putative dileucine motif both localised to cellular/nuclear membrane components. In contrast, site-specific mutations to either of the transmembrane domains abolished membrane association and resulted in cytoplasmic localisation. NS 3 A showed mixed results, displaying both membrane localisation and a cytoplasmic distribution. The 11 amino acid region unique to NS 3 and absent from NS 3 A, which has been shown to bind to cellular exocytosis proteins in bluetongue virus (Beaton et al., 2002), did not display membrane interaction. These results indicate that both of the hydrophobic domains as well as the N 11 region are required to be present for NS 3 to be properly targeted to the plasma/nuclear membrane. In addition, NS 3 was shown to be present in detergent-resistant membrane fractions, indicative of a possible localisation within lipid rafts. The above results indicate that the NS 3 protein contains specific signals involved in membrane targeting, confirming a potential role for NS 3 in viral localisation and release in the AHSV replication cycle.

2500|$|Archibald Menzies (1754–1842) was the {{appointed}} botanist on the expedition led by Captain George Vancouver in the ships Discovery and Chatham of 1791–1795 to the Pacific coast of North America and south-western Australia. The algae collected by Menzies were passed to Dawson Turner (1775–1858) who described and illustrated {{them in a}} four-volumed work published in 1808–1819. However Turner only referred to the taxa referable to Fucus; either Menzies collected very few or he gave only a few to Turner. Three of these species described by Turner later became the types of new genera (Papenfuss, 1976) and (<b>Huisman,</b> 2000) [...] Turner also received plants from Robert Brown (1773–1858) the botanist who accompanied Captain Matthew Flinders on the Investigator (1801–1805). This collection also included many plants from Australia (<b>Huisman,</b> 2000).|$|E
40|$|African horsesickness (AHS), {{caused by}} the African horsesickness virus (AHSV) (Coetzer&Erasmus, 1994), has 10 {{segments}} of double stranded RNA (Verwoerd et al., 1970). These encode seven structural proteins, namely VP 1, VP 2, VP 3, VP 4, VP 5, VP 6 and VP 7 (Verwoerd et al., 1972; Huismans&Van Dijk, 1990) as well as four nonstructural proteins (NS 1, NS 2, NS 3 and NS 3 A) (Van Dijk&Huismans, 1988). NS 3 is cytotoxic when expressed in insect cells causing membrane permeabilisation and cell death (Van Staden et al., 1995). This characteristic was postulated {{to be associated with}} the two hydrophobic domains (Van Staden et al., 1998; Van Niekerk et al., 2001 (a)). Although NS 3 has the same basic structure and function in all orbiviruses it differs greatly on nucleic acid sequence level as well as in the degree of variation that is found within the protein (Sailleau et al., 1997; <b>Huismans</b> et al., 2004). Therefore the main aim of this study was to identify which regions or amino acids remain conserved and might therefore play a role in the structure or function of NS 3. The focus was mainly on the two hydrophobic domains as well as the spacer region between the hydrophobic domains. The sequence variation analyses between AHSV, BTV and EHDV NS 3 revealed that there is a conserved threonine-serine motif in HD 1, a conserved aspartic acid at the beginning of the spacer region as well as a conserved asparagine in HD 2. The conservation of these residues between the different serogroups indicates that they might have some functional or structural role in the NS 3 protein. NS 3 protein sequences in the AHSV ã phylogenetic cluster has three extra amino acids in the spacer region at aa 149 - 151. There is also a significant difference in the spacer region length between EEV NS 3 and AHSV NS 3, which might have an effect on the topology of the respective proteins. In the spacer region of AHSV NS 3, three regions were targeted for mutation analyses: substitution of the conserved isoleucine (aa 141) with a neutral amino acid, deletion of three amino acids (aa 149 - 151), and insertion of 15 additional amino acids. Three mutants were generated and assayed: the IÄS mutant, the KGDdel mutant and the 15 aa insert mutant. The cytotoxicity of the IÄS and KGD deletion mutants was exactly the same as the native NS 3 protein, while the 15 aa insertion resulted in a slightly decreased cytotoxicity. This was the same as the EEV NS 3 cytotoxicity level in insect cells. The fluorescent localisation and subcellular fractionation studies showed that both the IÄS mutation and 15 aa insertion affected the localisation of NS 3 within the cell and also increased the solubility of the protein. This indicated that even though the membrane localisation of NS 3 was disrupted it still had a cytotoxic role in the cell. It could be that wild type NS 3 has both a membrane associated and a soluble fraction within cells, and that the soluble fraction is indeed responsible for the observed cytotoxicity and not the membrane fraction as assumed previously. It is therefore postulated that NS 3 might have different domains that have various roles within the cell. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Geneticsunrestricte...|$|R
