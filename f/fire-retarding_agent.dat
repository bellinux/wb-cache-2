It {{is commonly used}} as a <b>fire-retarding</b> <b>agent</b> and plasticizer for nitrocellulose and cellulose acetate. The present study {{was an attempt to}} evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physicochemical and spectroscopic properties of TPP. The study was carried out in two groups i. e. control and treatment. The treatment group was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. The control and treated samples of TPP were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. XRD study revealed the decrease in crystallite size (6. 13 %) of treated TPP that might be due to presence of strains and increase in atomic displacement from their ideal lattice positions as compared to control sample. DSC thermogram of treated TPP showed the increase in melting temperature (1. 5 %) and latent heat of fusion (66. 34 %) with respect to control. TGA analysis showed the loss in weight by 66. 79 % in control and 47. 96 % in treated sample. This reduction in percent weight loss suggests the increase of thermal stability in treated sample as compared to control. FT-IR and UV spectroscopic results did not show the alteration in the wavenumber and wavelength of FT-IR and UV spectra, respectively in treated TPP with respect to control. Altogether, the XRD and DSC/TGA results suggest that biofield treatment has the impact on physical and thermal properties of treated TPP...|$|E
2500|$|The Be-200 fire-fighter {{suppresses}} fires {{by dropping}} water and/or chemical retardants. Eight ferric aluminium alloy water tanks are located under the cabin {{floor in the}} centre fuselage section. Four retractable water scoops, two forward and two aft of the fuselage step {{can be used to}} scoop a total of 12 tonnes of water in 14 seconds. Alternatively, the tanks can be filled from a hydrant or a water cistern on the ground. The water tanks can be removed quickly for carrying cargo. Water can be dropped in a single salvo, or in up to eight consecutive drops. The aircraft also carries six auxiliary tanks for <b>fire-retarding</b> chemical <b>agents,</b> with a total capacity of 1.2m³. The aircraft can empty its water tanks over the site of a fire in 0.8 to 1.0 seconds when flying above the minimum drop speed of 220km/h (135mph, 120kn) ...|$|R
