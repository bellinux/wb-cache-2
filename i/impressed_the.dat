He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.|$|E
5|$|In a {{draft in}} which they had four first-round selections, the Colorado Avalanche made Tanguay their first pick, 12th overall, at the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. He was invited to Colorado's {{training}} camp that fall, and <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> team such that he made the team as an 18-year-old. Tanguay and the Avalanche, however, were unable to come to terms on a contract and he was instead returned to Halifax for the 1998–99 season.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus. The actor {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him {{what it was like}} to work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> actor.|$|E
5|$|The factory {{recognised}} {{his talent}} {{from a young}} age: Streltsov became the Fraser Factory football team's youngest ever player when he was 13 years old. Three years later in 1953, a friendly match was organised between Fraser and a youth team from Torpedo Moscow. Streltsov <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> Torpedo coach, Vasily Provornov, and after befriending him, left Fraser to play for Torpedo.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer {{republic}} with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and grass and the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.|$|E
5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the annual Scotland v England fixture in 1989, questions were raised as to whether Scottish football required a separate national stadium. Rangers proposed Ibrox as an alternative venue, while Murrayfield {{was about to be}} redeveloped without public funding. None of these arguments <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> National Stadium committee, which consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen's Park. The West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this left two terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA World Cup qualification matches.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} as Inspector-General, {{and in order to}} gain staff experience, Davies was {{attached}} as an observer to a number of units in the United Kingdom in 1909–10. During this time, he also attended the Imperial Defence Conference and represented the New Zealand forces at the funeral of King Edward VII. At the end of the one-year attachment, he had so <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> British Army that they offered him an appointment as commander of 6th Brigade in October 1910, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. As such, he became the first overseas officer to command a regular brigade, only eleven years after taking up a permanent military commission.|$|E

5|$|As Walker was {{dominating}} the local competition, {{he began to}} look for other options. In 2007 his coach Ivan Manco, who came from Slovakia, arranged for Walker to tryout for HC Vítkovice in the Czech Republic, where Manco knew one of the coaches. Walker <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> team enough {{to be given a}} place on their under-18 junior team. In 2009–10 he recorded 42 points in 28 games for the U18 team and earned a chance to play for the U20 team. He also returned to Australia during the Czech offseason and played for the Sydney Ice Dogs of the Australian Ice Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|Born {{in rural}} Russia in 1902, Suslov {{became a member}} of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921 and studied {{economics}} for much of the 1920s. He left his job as a teacher in 1931 to pursue politics full-time, becoming one of the many Soviet politicians who took part in the mass repression begun by Joseph Stalin's regime. Suslov <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> Soviet leadership to such an extent in the pre-Eastern Front Soviet Union that he was made First Secretary of Stavropol Krai administrative area. During the war, Suslov headed the local Stavropol guerrilla movement. He {{became a member of}} the Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee in 1946 and, four years later, was elected to the Presidium (Politburo) of the All-Union Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|Calgary {{ended the}} {{exhibition}} season with several injuries to key players. Centre Daymond Langkow remained sidelined following a neck injury suffered the previous season, while Ryan Stone (knee) was also out. Matt Stajan suffered a shoulder separation, David Moss also suffered {{a shoulder injury}} and Ales Kotalik was lost to a knee injury. As {{a result of the}} injuries, the Flames signed centre Brendan Morrison to a contract; Morrison had been in training camp with the Canucks before being released. Rookie defenceman T. J. Brodie proved the surprise player of training camp. Expected to start the year with the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League (AHL), Brodie <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> Flames' coaching staff and earned a position on the team to begin the NHL season.|$|E

He was also offered a trial with Nottingham Forest, scoring during a friendly match with the club but O'Keefe again moved on after the club stalled over offering him a contract, with Forest only willing to offer him a one-year youth deal.|$|E
5|$|George Frideric Handel {{was born}} on 23 February 1685 in the German city of Halle. It is unclear what initial musical {{education}} he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, {{by the age of}} ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was {{in the service of the}} Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.|$|E
5|$|He <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> brewery's {{managers}} so {{much that}} he was put in charge of the company's main hotel, The Hillside in Huyton, Liverpool in 1939 and the pub later became popular with American officers who were stationed at nearby RAF Burtonwood during the Second World War. In the late 1940s, his health declined and he was unable to continue running such a large hotel and, after running a smaller pub, he was forced into early retirement in the 1950s. After a long illness, he died on 29 August 1958 at the age of 60 in the village of Sychdyn. He was buried in Everton Cemetery in Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> most, and somehow I kept on {{ignoring}} his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|In late 1903, a {{baseball}} column {{suggested that the}} Detroit Tigers were interested in Shay, but he {{was said to be}} happy playing in California. During Shay's tenure in San Francisco, he got married. Shay went to spring training with the St. Louis Cardinals before the 1904 season. He <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> team, prompting speculation that shortstop Dave Brain would move to third base and third baseman Jimmy Burke would serve as a utility infielder. Shay played 99 games for the Cardinals in 1904.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, British {{officials}} depended on native officials for advice {{and to act}} as interpreters. However, {{they had to be}} careful about ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka who had been a police quartermaster, greatly <b>impressed</b> <b>the</b> Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited with keeping the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and he had to be removed from his post.|$|E
