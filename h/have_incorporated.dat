5|$|Atoms {{are small}} enough that {{attempting}} to predict their behavior using classical physics – {{as if they}} were billiard balls, for example – gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects. Through the development of physics, atomic models <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} would <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> {{a liquid}} oxygen factory and a bomb-proof train station to allow missiles and supplies {{to be delivered}} from production facilities in Germany. It was constructed using the labour of thousands of prisoners of war and forcibly conscripted workers used as slave labourers.|$|E
5|$|Immigrants to Israel <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> {{elements}} of the cuisines of the cultures and countries whence they came. During approximately fifty years before 1948, there were successive waves of Jewish immigration, which brought with them {{a whole range of}} foods and cooking styles. Immigrants arriving from central Europe brought foods such as schnitzel and strudels, while Russian Jews brought borsht and herring dishes, such as schmaltz herring and vorschmack (gehakte herring).|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, organ {{builders}} began to incorporate digital components into their key, stop, and combination actions. Besides making these mechanisms simpler and more reliable, this {{also makes it}} possible to record and play back an organist's performance via the MIDI protocol. In addition, some organ builders <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> digital stops into their pipe organs.|$|E
5|$|Nahuatl {{does not}} have {{grammatical}} case but uses what is sometimes called a relational noun to describe spatial (and other) relations. These morphemes cannot appear alone but must occur after a noun or a possessive prefix. They are also often called postpositions or locative suffixes. In some ways these locative constructions resemble and {{can be thought of}} as locative case constructions. Most modern dialects <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> prepositions from Spanish that are competing with or that have completely replaced relational nouns.|$|E
5|$|TgPVR21 mice <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> {{the human}} PVR at {{chromosome}} 13. These mice are {{less susceptible to}} poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR. TgPVR21 mice {{have been shown to}} be susceptible to poliovirus infection through intranasal inoculation, and may be useful as a mucosal infection model.|$|E

5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known {{today as the}} Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have {{purchased}} that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.|$|E
5|$|Although Aries came to {{represent}} specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, {{the stars of}} Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.|$|E
5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but {{it is more likely that}} despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, jazz began {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} rock music, and began using distortion and feedback, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Jimi Hendrix, who had strong links with jazz. The proto-punk band MC5 also used feedback and loudness and was inspired by the avant-garde jazz movement. Jazz musicians who <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> noise elements, feedback and distortion include Bill Frisell, David Krakauer Cecil Taylor, Gábor Szabó, Garnett Brown, Grachan Moncur III, Jackie McLean, John Abercrombie, John McLaughlin, Joseph Bowie, Larry Coryell, McCo Tyner, Ornette Coleman, Pat Metheny, Phil Minton, Roswell Rudd, and Scott Henderson.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} for this period is Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), {{completed}} in about 731. Despite {{its focus on}} the history of the church, this work provides valuable information about the early Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Charters, which recorded royal grants of land to individuals and to religious houses, provide further information on Coenred's reign, as does the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, compiled in Wessex at the end of the 9th century. The Chronicles anonymous scribe appears to <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> much information recorded in earlier periods. Coenred is also mentioned in two 8th-century hagiographies, those of Saint Wilfrid and Saint Guthlac.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Muslims in Nigeria are Sunni belonging to Maliki school of jurisprudence; however, a sizeable minority also belongs to Shafi madhhab. A large number of Sunni Muslims are members of Sufi brotherhoods. Most Sufis follow the Qadiriyya, Tijaniyyah and/or the Mouride movements. A significant Shia minority exists (see Shia in Nigeria). Some northern states <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> Sharia law into their previously secular legal systems, which has brought about some controversy. Kano State has sought to incorporate Sharia law into its constitution. The majority of Quranists follow the Kalo Kato or Quraniyyun movement. There are also Ahmadiyya and Mahdiyya minorities.|$|E

5|$|Zirconium binds urea, a {{property}} {{that has been}} utilized extensively {{to the benefit of}} patients with chronic kidney disease. For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system. Also, developmental versions of a Wearable Artificial Kidney <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> sorbent-based technologies.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> hydraulic fuses {{to isolate}} a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E
5|$|Nier was {{the last}} game that Cavia made; the company was absorbed into its parent company, AQ Interactive, in July 2010. In March 2011, there were plans made between Yoko and Takuya Iwasaki, one of the {{original}} producers for Drakengard, to develop a port of Nier for the PlayStation Vita at Iwasaki's company Orca. The port would <b>have</b> <b>incorporated</b> material from both versions of the game. When Orca was chosen to help develop Dragon Quest X, the project was shelved. A number of key staff from Niers development, including director Yoko and Okabe, would later reunite to work on a new entry (Drakengard 3) in the Drakengard series from which Nier was spun off. A sequel titled , developed by Square Enix and PlatinumGames for the PlayStation 4, was released in Japan on February 23, in North America on March 7 and worldwide on March 10, 2017. The PC version of Nier: Automata was released on March 17, 2017. Yoko, Saito and Okabe returned to their previous roles. Other staff members include producer Atsushi Inaba and artist Akihiko Yoshida.|$|E
