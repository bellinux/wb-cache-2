5|$|Rutherford gave Chadwick a {{part-time}} teaching position at Manchester, {{allowing him to}} continue research. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found {{that this was the}} same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival on 8 August 1942, the new Middle East commander, Harold Alexander, visited Geoffrey Barkas's {{camouflage}} unit at Helwan to assess its ability to implement Bertram. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> everything intently, but seemed most interested in the woodworking shop.|$|E
5|$|During {{the casting}} process, Parker and {{producer}} Alan Marshall began scouting locations in New York City. On January 20, 1986, he travelled to New Orleans, where he continued writing the script. Parker looked at unused buildings located on Royal Street that could {{act as a}} hotel, and an abandoned house on Magazine Street that would serve {{as the home of}} Margaret Krusemark (Rampling). He returned to New York City where <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Staten Island and Coney Island. Parker's script required a total of 78 locations in New York and New Orleans.|$|E

50|$|In the melee, Jack escapes {{and runs}} {{for his life}} {{through the streets of}} Dublin. He runs to Isabelle. He asks for her help, then passes out. Dawn. Isabelle pulls into a lay-by {{overlooking}} the city. Jack gets out, dazed and confused, he doesn’t know where he is, what’s happening. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the city shimmering below him. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Isabelle. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> back <b>at</b> the city. He turns and walks towards Isabelle. He gets back into her car. They drive west, away from the city.|$|R
50|$|Eric Idle {{recorded}} a parody {{in which all}} of the things the soldier is prompted to think of are nonsense. When <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the deuce <b>he</b> thinks of how many suits he'd own if he owned two more than he owns now. When <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the trey, <b>he</b> thinks of how many legs a bridge table would have if one of them was missing.|$|R
5|$|In 1780, in {{his first}} {{discussion}} of purely religious matters, Espejo wrote a theological letter, Carta al Padre la Graña sobre indulgencias (Letter to Father la Graña about indulgences). In this work, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> indulgences in the Catholic Church. The letter showed a profound knowledge of theology and dogma. It analyzed the historical beginnings of indulgences and their development and cited decrees and bulls written about abuses of indulgences. In this work, Espejo staunchly supported {{the authority of the}} Pope.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{retained}} the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. Ian Johnson was retained despite taking match figures of 1/85, as was Bill Brown, the opener who was batting {{out of position}} in the middle-order. Brown had scored 25, 26 and 17 in his three innings in the middle-order during the tour. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that despite Brown's unbeaten double century in his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey had better claims to selection. Following his groin injury at Trent Bridge, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Before the toss, Bradman had spent an unusually long time inspecting the wicket, and after correctly predicting {{the side of the}} coin, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the surface for another period before announcing Australia's decision to bat. The all-rounder Keith Miller played, but was unfit to bowl.|$|E

25|$|Robertson wrote three {{important}} {{papers on the}} mathematics of quantum mechanics. In the first, written in German, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the coordinate system required for the Schrödinger equation to be solvable. The second {{examined the relationship between}} the commutative property and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The third extended the second to the case of m observables. In 1931 he published a translation of Weyl's The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics.|$|E

25|$|In 1947 and in 1948 he {{was awarded}} a Leverhulme Fellowship which allowed him to travel across much of Northern and Central Europe. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the {{technologies}} and techniques of rural and fishing communities in much of Scandinavia, displaying {{his interest in the}} relationship between folk culture and ecology. He expanded the length of the Proceedings in the years following the war, now aided by Piggott and Kenneth Oakley as his editorial assistants.|$|E
25|$|The writer's life allowed Maugham {{to travel}} and to live {{in places such as}} Spain and Capri for the next decade, but his next ten works never came close to rivalling the success of Liza. This changed in 1907 with the success of his play Lady Frederick. By the next year, he had four plays running {{simultaneously}} in London, and Punch published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the billboards.|$|E
25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E

25|$|When Morgan {{returned}} to Bryn Mawr in 1895, {{he was promoted}} to full professor. Morgan's main lines of experimental work involved regeneration and larval development; in each case, his goal was to distinguish internal and external causes to shed light on the Roux-Driesch debate. He wrote his first book, The Development of the Frog's Egg (1897). He began a series of studies on different organisms' ability to regenerate. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> grafting and regeneration in tadpoles, fish and earthworms; in 1901 he published his research as Regeneration.|$|E
25|$|One {{police officer}} then {{drove down the}} road past Seascape and past the {{disabled}} car of Linda White. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{it for a moment}} and continued down to the Fox and Hound. After he informed his partner, they proceeded back to Seascape. At about 2:00p.m., they were back at Seascape and could see the BMW on fire. At some point, they were fired upon, and eventually had to hide in a ditch {{at the side of the}} road. Bryant fired at them whenever they tried to escape, and they were not able to move from that position for many hours.|$|E
25|$|Klein {{showed that}} the modular group moves the {{fundamental}} region of the complex plane so as to tessellate that plane. In 1879, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the action of PSL(2,7), thought of as {{an image of the}} modular group, and obtained an explicit representation of a Riemann surface today called the Klein quartic. He showed that that surface was a curve in projective space, that its equation was x3y+y3z+z3x=0, and that its group of symmetries was PSL(2,7) of order 168. His Ueber Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting potential theory and conformal mappings. This work drew on notions from fluid dynamics.|$|E

25|$|To {{write the}} book, {{in his spare}} time, he {{collected}} {{a lot of information}} on Canton Hospital, scouring newspapers, books, journals published by the hospital, and annual reports written by the Canton Medical Missionary Society. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> every single report, which included all the names of those employed at the hospital, names of all the patients, what diseases they had, what surgeries took place, income and expense sheets, donations to the hospital, and more. In both China and the USA, he searched for and interviewed previous staff of the hospital and graduates of the University Medical School. Part of the inspiration for writing the book came from his idol William Osler, who was both an internist and writer.|$|E
25|$|Rivers {{had already}} formed {{a career in}} {{physiology}} and psychology. But now he moved more definitively into anthropology. He wanted a demographically small, fairly isolated people, comparable to the island societies of the Torres Strait, where {{he might be able}} to get genealogical data on each and every individual. The Todas in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, with their population then about 700 plus, suited Rivers’s criteria. And they had speciﬁc features of social organization, such as polyandrous marriage and a bifurcation of their society into so-called moieties that had interested historical evolutionists. Whether his fieldwork was initially so single-minded is questionable, however, since at first <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> other local communities and studied their visual perception before fixing all his attention on the Todas.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{rejected}} the notion, which was universal {{in his day}} and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In {{the course of his}} empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; material handling equipment {{as we know it today}} was mostly not developed yet. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.|$|E
