2500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 9, 1968, Raiford dropped off a couple of just-freed A {{students}} and was returning home when he violated the curfew. Raiford, now age 61, said <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> quietly exited his car, sensing something was not right. Raiford said he attempted to continue stealthily on foot, hoping the darkness of a neighborhood park would protect him.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and up at Mr. Wrenn impatiently.|$|E
60|$|Brendon {{dismissed}} {{the subject with}} a wave of the hand. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|Gildart could scarce avoid {{laughing}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion.|$|R
60|$|Austin set <b>his</b> lips as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> comrade, {{whose face}} grew {{suddenly}} hard.|$|R
60|$|Maccario, it seemed, {{understood}} what he was thinking, for his face was sympathetic as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> He was wholly {{unable to}} conceal his {{annoyance}} at their appearance.|$|E
60|$|Wingate's nerves {{were all}} on edge. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and rose regretfully to his feet.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood for}} a moment on the pavement. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and hailed a cab.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Nairn {{went into the}} house with Carroll, and as they entered <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion.|$|R
60|$|Filled with {{a daring}} determination, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> note book for Dede's {{telephone}} number, {{and called for}} the switch.|$|R
60|$|Their way led {{past the}} theatre. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch--the last act {{was still in}} full swing. He pulled the check cord.|$|R
60|$|Ray and I {{left the}} {{building}} together. As we turned into Pall Mall <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> {{and looked}} out seaward. It was even as she had said. There were {{indications}} of another storm. Even while they stood there the large raindrops fell.|$|E
60|$|The {{difficulty}} of seeing, {{owing to the}} increase of shadow, first called {{his attention to the}} fact that time was slipping away. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and saw that it was ten minutes to the hour.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> chubby white hand, {{fingering}} {{the stem of}} his glass. [...] "I have put on flesh since then," [...] he said. [Pause].|$|R
6000|$|... "Open up!" [...] Reinhart snapped. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wristwatch. [...] "I'll {{be at the}} {{entrance}} in five minutes. I expect to find it ready for me." ...|$|R
60|$|To dress, he {{had merely}} to buckle on <b>his</b> shoes. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{fireplace}} and <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hillside, wavered, but fought down the temptation {{and started the}} fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess we've {{got about}} {{everything}} now," [...] resumed Dave, {{looking around the}} bedroom. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "Ten minutes to twelve. We are to have lunch at a quarter past, and start at one, sharp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, now is {{our time}} to make a record," [...] came cheerfully from Sam. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "Four minutes after two. Come on, let us see how quickly we can get that new tire on." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{his hand}} was his watch. He would wait another fifteen minutes, and if by then the signal had not come that the Serbians were approaching, he would strike the blow that he had decided upon. From time to time <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mr. Blake," [...] he greeted. [...] "Sorry I was delayed." [...] <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wrist-watch. [...] "Only four minutes, however. I just couldn't {{get away}} sooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those----" [...] <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> cuff--"those 'Idylls of the King!' I do {{not like}} to think what an ocean voyage would be if I had not my Tennyson with me." ...|$|R
60|$|There was grave applause, but {{the glint}} in the steady eyes was {{pleasant}} to see, and Seaforth felt a curious thrill as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> partner. Alton, however, proceeded quietly.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and was going, {{but after}} a [...] "Thanks, father," [...] she had stopped him. [...] "There's one thing more." [...] An embarrassment showed in her manner, but {{at the cost of}} some effect of earnest abruptness she surmounted it. [...] "What does your American--Mr. Bender--want?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{rose and}} {{threw open the}} door of my cottage. For several moments he stood bareheaded, looking up towards the house, looking and listening. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and walked several times {{backwards}} and forwards {{from the edge of the}} cliff to my door. Then he came in for his hat and stick.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> relit his pipe, and relapsed {{once more}} into sombre silence. Julia's {{thoughts}} went flitting away. She {{closed her eyes}} and leaned back. She had only one fear now. Would he find out! He was thick enough, in his way, but he was no fool, and he was already coarsely jealous.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> whole {{handsome}} maturity, {{the firm}} plating of his breasts, the full thighs, creatures proud in themselves. Only he {{was marred by}} the long raw scratch, which he regretted deeply.|$|R
6000|$|Torrance {{considered}} for a second, and then smiled significantly as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> daughter's face. [...] "Well, you would be 'most as safe down there--and I guess it was born in you," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, the man didn't pay me, and I wouldn't ask for it. Took {{it out in}} {{beating the}} boy," [...] and Dan laughed, yet looked ashamed, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> ragged clothes and dirty hands.|$|R
60|$|He {{sat up in}} his chair. His dreaming moments {{were few}} and this one had passed. He set his heel upon that tide of {{weakening}} memories, sipped his coffee and looked out upon the crowd. Three or four times <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> impatiently. Precisely at nine o'clock, a man moved {{from somewhere in the}} throng behind and took the vacant chair by his side.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two Foster sat still, with his face set. Lucy was guarded, but the {{mountaineering}} friend was Walters and she had given him an urgent hint that he was needed. Then he picked up a railroad folder that lay near and noting the time of Walters' arrival, saw that the telegram had been delayed. After this <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and ran out into the street.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{leaned back}} in his chair with a long, deep sigh of content. The labour of years was {{concluded}} at last. With that final little sketch his work was done. A pile of manuscripts and charts lay before him; everything was in order. He took a bill of lading from his letter-case, and pinned it carefully to the rest. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and, taking a cigarette-case from his pocket, began to smoke.|$|E
6000|$|The lawyer, I fancied, had now heard {{rather more}} than he knew before, and {{it struck me that}} the prisoner's cunning had overreached itself in not posting him better, for <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> papers before continuing: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{paused at}} this point as if in meditation. Benjy, whose eyes and mouth had been {{gradually}} opening to their widest, almost gasped with astonishment as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> cousins, whose expressive countenances were somewhat similarly affected.|$|R
60|$|He rolled {{himself up}} in his blanket and lay down among the soft spruce twigs, but Carroll sat still in the {{darkness}} and smoked his pipe out. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> comrade, who lay still, breathing evenly.|$|R
