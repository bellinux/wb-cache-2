All Stimuli {{were derived from}} phase scrambled versions of forty face or nature images. There were four types of test images: symmetry, in which {{one part of the}} image was the reflective transform of the other part about an axis; repetition, one part of the image was a copy of the other part; anti-symmetry, similar to symmetry but the contrast of one side was reversed; and interleaved patterns, half of the symmetric pattern was replaced by a scrambled image. The number of axes ranged from 1 to 16 for all image types. The task of our 20 observers was to give a preference rating to each image on a 6 -point Lickert Scale. The preference rating increased with the number of axis for all stimulus type. The preference to symmetry was similar to that to repetition and was slightly better than anti-symmetry. The preference to <b>interleaved</b> <b>pattern</b> was much less than other types of stimuli.

40|$|Accurate {{classification}} of multiple or partial multispectral or hyperspectral signatures {{is a crucial}} task in the nonimaging detection and recognition of space objects. Previous approaches to signature classification {{have been based on}} artificial intelligence techniques such as Bayesian networks, rule-based systems, and linear operators or neural networks (NNs) expressed in terms of the algebra (R, +, x). Unfortunately, in these methods the separation of tightly <b>interleaved</b> <b>pattern</b> classes tends to be suboptimal, and the number of signatures that can be accurately classified often depends linearly on the number of classifier inputs. Further, such classifiers tend to be static and therefore brittle, leading to potentially significant classification errors in the presence of noise or densely interleaved signatures, as well as decreased performance in the presence of input nonergodicities. In previous publications, the first author and his colleagues have shown that the performance of classical neural nets can be improved upon by the use of autoassociative morphological memories (AMM), a construct similar to Hopfield autoassociative memories defined on the lattice algebra (R, +, ∨, ∧). Unlimited storage and perfect recall of noiseless real valued patterns has been proven for AMMs [1]. However, AMMs suffer from sensitivity to specific noise models, which can be characterized as erosive and dilative noise. It has further been shown that AMMs can be based on dendritic computation, which yields improved classification accuracy as well as clas...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{development}} of Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA) [1], several algorithms have been proposed to incorporate it into the dynamic MRI applications. TGRAPPA tries to reduce the ACS acquisition by forming a composite frame via adding several neighbouring time frames, which are sampled in an <b>interleaved</b> <b>pattern</b> [2], and its image reconstruction of each frame is performed in a one-dimensional (1 D) fashion by interpolating the linear correlation of the acquired data along phase encoding direction. Using the same composition and sampling scheme, k-t GRAPPA introduces a 2 D reconstruction format, which interpolates the linear correlation of the acquired data in both phase-encoding and temporal directions [3]. The same as original GRAPPA [1], both these methods use moving average kernels with finite impulse response (FIR) for interpolation. We propose a novel 3 D Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) temporal GRAPPA method. Different from [1]-[3], this method reconstructs the unacquired data points by interpolation along phase encoding, frequency encoding and temporal three directions, and uses autoregression (AR) moving average kernels with infinite impulse response in the interpolation. The AR part of the IIR kernel uses the previously reconstructed data points for further reconstructions, which captures more precisely the data acceleration along three directions and renders further reduction of required ACS lines and significant improvement of reconstructed images...|$|E

Materials and Methods This study {{was approved by the}} Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurologic Disorder and Stroke. As a preclinical demonstration of this new detection technology, five different millimeter-scale wireless amplified nuclear MR detectors configured as double frequency resonators were chronically implanted on the medial surface of the kidney in five Sprague-Dawley rats for MR imaging at 11. 7 T. Among these rats, two were administered gadopentetate dimeglumine to visualize renal tubules on T 1 -weighted gradient-refocused echo (GRE) images, two were administered cationized ferritin to visualize glomeruli on T 2 *-weighted GRE images, and the remaining rat was administered both gadopentetate dimeglumine and cationized ferritin to visualize the <b>interleaved</b> <b>pattern</b> of renal tubules and glomeruli. The image intensity in each pixel was compared with the local tissue signal intensity average to identify regions of hyper- or hypointensity. Results T 1 -weighted images with 70 -μm in-plane resolution and 200 -μm section thickness were obtained within 3. 2 minutes to image renal tubules, and T 2 *-weighted images of the same resolution were obtained within 5. 8 minutes to image the glomeruli.

An explanation based on responses in first-order motion energy detectors tuned to low spatiotemporal frequencies (effectively summating the <b>interleaved</b> <b>patterns</b> over time) was tested using a stimulus in which each pattern inverted in contrast mid-way through each frame. Contrary to predictions based on temporal summation, performance with contrast-inverting patterns was only slightly lower than with non-inverting patterns.

40|$|Abstract—The {{downlink}} {{bit error}} rate (BER) performances of DS- and MC-CDMA in a frequency-selective fading channel can be significantly improved {{by the use of}} frequency-domain equalization (FDE) based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. However, the uplink BER performance degrades due to strong multi-user interference (MUI). In this paper, we propose frequency-interleaved CDMA using MMSE-FDE, in which the subcarrier components of each user’s CDMA signal are interleaved onto wider bandwidth. Then, the frequency-interleaved CDMA signal is transformed into a time-domain signal by the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). <b>Interleaving</b> <b>patterns</b> assigned to different users are orthogonal each other. The proposed scheme can avoid the MUI completely while achieving frequency diversity gain due to MMSE-FDE.

The technique rearranges the symbols according to instantaneous channel state information of the OFDM subcarriers so as to reduce or minimize the bit error rate (BER) of each OFDM frame.

Previous work has made significant progress in detecting and validating concurrency bugs under a given input. Unfortunately, software testing always faces large sets of test inputs, and existing techniques are still too expensive to be applied to every test input in practice. In this paper, we use open-source software to study how existing concurrency-bug detection tools work for a set of inputs. The study shows that an <b>interleaving</b> <b>pattern,</b> such as a data race or an atomicity violation, can often be exposed by many inputs. Consequently, existing bug detectors would inevitably waste their bug detection effort to generate duplicate bug reports, when applied to a set of inputs.

Using CFP, we have designed a new approach to detecting data races and atomicity-violation bugs for a set of inputs.

In 2008, Rombaut et al. presented an interesting approach introducing a packetization mask generator based in Simulated Annealing (SA), including a cost function, which allows assessing the suitability of a packetization pattern, avoiding extensive simulations. In this work, we present a complementary study about the non-trivial problem of generating optimal packetization patterns. We propose a genetic algorithm, {{as an alternative to the}} cited work, adopting the mentioned cost function, then comparing it to the SA approach and a torus automorphism interleaver. In addition, we engage the validation of the cost function and provide results attempting to conclude about its implication in the quality of reconstructed images. Several scenarios based on visual sensor networks applications were tested in a computer application. Results in terms of the selected cost function and image quality metric PSNR show that our algorithm presents similar results to the other approaches. Finally, we discuss the obtained results and comment about open research challenges...|$|R
