The analytical analysis reveals that, {{similar to the}} case of digital PWM control, limit cycles of such systems will occur when the LSB of the control is changing the output by a value that is larger than the resolution of the ADC. However, unlike the case of PWM, limit cycle oscillations is dependent on the operating point since both the power stage gain and the resolution of the <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> drive <b>frequency,</b> are not constant over the operational frequency range. Consequently, at high gains (close to resonant) the required frequency resolution may not be supported by the digital core. A time-domain simulation model, that was developed and verified experimentally, enables the steady state analysis of digitally controlled resonant converters including the limit cycles phenomenon as well as the closed loop response. The proposed static analysis and dynamic modeling were verified experimentally on a series-resonant parallel-loaded converter that was operated in closed current loop. The digital control algorithm was implemented on a TMS 320 F 2808 DSP core. Very good agreement was found between the analytical derivations, simulations and the experimental results. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{conditions}} for limit-cycle oscillations in digitally controlled resonant converters are explored theoretically and are tested by simulation and experiment. The analytical analysis reveals {{that in a}} manner similar to digital pulsewidth modulation (PWM) control, limit cycles occur in such systems when the LSB of the control changes the output by a value that is larger than the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) resolution. However, in resonant converters, unlike the case of PWM, limit-cycle oscillations depend on the steady-state control input, since both the power stage gain and the resolution of the <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> drive <b>frequency</b> are not constant over the operating frequency range. Consequently, at high gains (close to resonance), the required frequency resolution may not be supported by the digital core. A time-domain behavioral simulation model, developed, and experimentally verified, allows the steady-state behavior of digitally controlled resonant converters to be analyzed, including the phenomenon of limit cycles as well as the closed-loop response. A cycle-by-cycle Powersim (PSIM) simulation model of a digitally controlled resonant converter, developed in this study, includes a digital core realization using C code block. This simulation model enables the exploration of the system in fine details. The proposed method of static analysis and dynamic modeling is experimentally verified on a series-resonant parallel-loaded converter operated in closed-current loop. The digital control algorithm was implemented on a TMS 320 F 2808 DSP core. Very good agreement is found between the analytical derivations, simulations, and experimental results.

40|$|Object {{recognition}} {{is a much}} studied computer vision problem, where the task {{is to find a}} given object in an image. This Master Thesis aims at doing a MATLAB implementation of an object recognition algorithm that finds three kinds of objects in images: electrical outlets, light switches and wall mounted air-conditioning controls. Visually, these three objects are quite similar and the aim {{is to be able to}} locate these objects in an image, as well as being able to distinguish them from one another. The object recognition was accomplished using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). During the training phase, the program was trained with images of the objects to be located, as well as reference images which did not contain the objects. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used in the classification phase. The performance was measured for two different setups, one where the training data consisted of photos and one where the training data consisted of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> images created using a 3 D modeling software, in addition to the photos. The results show that using <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> images as training images didn’t improve the accuracy in this case. The reason for this is probably that there is too little intraclass variability in the gradients in <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> images, they’re too synthetic in a sense, which makes them poor at reflecting reality for this specific approach. The result might have been different if a higher number of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> images had been used...|$|R

Reprinted by {{permission}} of the International Community for Auditory Display, [URL] effective navigation and analysis of large data sets is a persistent challenge within the scientific community. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether participants who received no training were able to identify audified data sets at a rate above chance in a forced-choice listening task. Nineteen participants with various levels of musical and scientific expertise were asked to place audio examples into one of the five following categories: <b>Digitally</b> <b>Generated</b> Sound - White Noise, Solar Wind Data, Neuron Firing Data from a Human Brain, Seismic Data (Earthquake Activity), and <b>Digitally</b> <b>Generated</b> Sound - Sinusoidal Waveform. At no time were participants made aware of the accuracy of their responses during the experiment. Participants who had never been exposed to audified data sets were able to recognize audification examples at a rate that was 23 percentage points above chance performance; however, the sample size of individuals with no previous exposure to audified data was not large enough to determine statistical significance. When controlling for previous exposure to any of the provided listening examples, all participants performed well above the statistical likelihood of chance responses in the recognition of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> white noise and sinusoidal waveforms. This indicates that participants with no previous exposure to audified data were able to discriminate between audified data and <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> sounds.

40|$|The line {{currents}} of three-phase {{diode bridge rectifier}} suffer from high THD. This THD is higher than IEEE standards. Injection of six harmonic components to the control signal of the boost converter connected to the three-phase diode bridge rectifier reduces the THD of the utility line current. In this paper a digital implementation of injecting six harmonic to the control signal of three-phase boost rectifier is shown. The digital implementation is carried out by using FPGA. In this study a sin-wave and a triangle-wave with six times the fundamental frequency and variable amplitude are <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> in the FPGA.

40|$|PURPOSE This {{systematic}} review verified the usefulness/limitations of static surgical guides during implant {{surgery in the}} edentulous maxilla. The PICO question was: "Does the use of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> surgical guides vs conventional techniques affect the following outcomes: surgical complications, implant complications, prosthesis complications, implant survival, prosthesis survival, economics, patient satisfaction, and maintenance intervention?" MATERIALS AND METHODS The electronic searches retrieved 2, 588 unique articles from which eventually 36 full-text articles were read for eligibility. Because no randomized controlled clinical trials could be found, the PICO question had to be reformulated, now only looking to the outcome of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> surgical guides without comparison with conventional techniques. RESULTS Although long-term data are lacking, the outcome of implants placed with a static guide and of the prosthetic reconstruction seems similar to that expected from conventional techniques. The number of surgical complications with guided surgery is negligible. Guided flapless implant surgery offers slightly more comfort for the patient; however, the economic benefits are unclear. CONCLUSION Implant therapy via static surgical guides in the maxilla is predictable, with slightly more comfort for the patient but with only minor economic advantages...|$|R
