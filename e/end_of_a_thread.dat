60|$|Rollo then {{wanted to}} try a very long one, and {{proposed}} that he should climb up into the tree, and tie {{the end of the}} string to a high branch. But Mary was afraid that he would fall; and besides, she said that the pendulum would not swing clear of the branches below. She, however, immediately thought of the chamber window, and said that she would try it there. She accordingly went up into her chamber, taking a large pebble stone with her, and Rollo remained below to set the pendulum in motion, when it should be ready. Mary soon appeared at the window, and Rollo watched her while she tied her pebble to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now, to do this, {{they must}} show {{themselves}} to be engineers of no small ability. Sometimes they fasten one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> to a twig {{on one side of}} the stream, and, hanging on the other end, swing over until they can land on the other side. But this is not always possible, for they cannot, in some places, get a chance for a fair swing. In such a case, they often wait until the wind is blowing across the stream from the side on which they are, and, weaving a long line, they let it out until the wind carries it over the stream, and it catches in the bushes or grass on the other side. Of course, after one thread is over, the spider can easily run backward and forward on it, and carry over all the rest of his lines.|$|E
6000|$|But {{directly}} afterward, on {{the other}} side, came Montaigne, whose sceptical acuteness could arrive at negatives without any apparatus of method. A certain keen narrowness of nature will secure a man from many absurd beliefs which the larger soul, vibrating to more manifold influences, would have a long struggle to part with. And so we find the charming, chatty Montaigne—in {{one of the brightest}} of his essays, “Des Boiteux,” where he declares that, from his own observation of witches and sorcerers, he should have recommended them to be treated with curative hellebore—stating in his own way a pregnant doctrine, since taught more gravely. It seems to him much less of a prodigy that men should lie, or that their imaginations should deceive them, than that a human body should be carried through the air on a broomstick, or up a chimney by some unknown spirit. He thinks it a sad business to persuade oneself that the test of truth lies in the multitude of believers—“en une prosse où les fols surpassent de tant les sages en nombre.” Ordinarily, he has observed, when men have something stated to them as a fact, they are more ready to explain it than to inquire whether it is real: “ils passent pardessus les propositions, mais ils examinent les conséquences; ils laissent les choses, et courent aux causes.” There is a sort of strong and generous ignorance which is as honorable and courageous as science—“ignorance pour laquelle concevoir il n’y a pas moins de science qu’à concevoir la science.” And à propos of the immense traditional evidence which weighed with such men as Bodin, he says—“As for the proofs and arguments founded on experience and facts, I do not pretend to unravel these. What <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> is there to lay hold of? I often cut them as Alexander did his knot. Après tout, c’est mettre ses conjectures â bien haut prix, que d’en faire cuire un homme tout dif.” ...|$|E

40|$|To reveal {{intermediates}} in lambda DNA packaging, infected {{cells were}} osmotically ruptured and the cell lysates were deposited on electron microscope grids by sedimentation through a sucrose/formalin cushion. A fixation procedure that crosslinks head-related structures to DNA {{allowed us to}} study successive stages {{in the process of}} head filling. Three types of head-related structures can be distinguished: (i) empty heads (petit lambda), less angular in outline than complete lambda heads; (ii) heads partially filled with DNA (partially filled heads), having a roundish outline; and (iii) particles tightly packed with DNA (full heads), having a hexagonal outline. DNA-head complexes were bound either at the terminal <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> DNA <b>thread</b> or at <b>a</b> point intermediate along the thread. The terminal complexes were more abundant. No head-related structures could be found in an induced lambda mutant lysogen blocked in the synthesis of petit lambda (amber in lambda gene E). One type of mutant blocked in DNA packaging (amber in gene A) produces empty heads and free tails, whereas another (amber in gene D) produces partially filled heads in addition. Our data suggest that a DNA-petit lambda complex may be an early intermediate in packaging and that the lambda DNA substrate can be a cohesive-ended concatemer or a concatemer with double-stranded cohesive site sequences...|$|R

Figure  9 highlights ancillary functions and sender characteristics; all messages and connections with community-building functions are in panel a. Figure  9 b highlights all messages and connections sent by facilitators (participant messages and connections are grayed out). Facilitators sent numerous “summarize” messages with multiple “thank” connections. Indeed, “summarize” messages come almost exclusively from facilitators, often towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conversation <b>thread,</b> as evidenced by the high number of parent (M[*]=[*] 2.33, U[*]=[*] 772, p[*]<[*] 0.001) and ancestor messages (M[*]=  4.67, U[*]=[*] 568, p[*]<[*] 0.001) compared to descendant messages (M[*]=[*] 1.33, U[*]=[*] 2288.5, p[*]=[*]n.s.). These types of messages do not create new conversation but tend to provide closure and maintain a positive, helpful email community. For example, one such message capped an ongoing discussion on grading group worksheets. The facilitator thanked the participants who had provided opinions and summarized how various decisions would affect student engagement. This provided context for each choice and made it easier for participants to pick an option that would align with their goals. The similarities between Fig.  9 a, Community-building, and Fig.  9 b, Facilitator activity, highlight that much of the community building is done by the facilitators and conversely, much of the activity of facilitators is community building.|$|R

40|$|Some predators sidestep {{environments that}} render them {{conspicuous}} to the sensory systems of prey. However, these challenging environments are unavoidable for certain predators. Stenolemus giraffa is an assassin bug that feeds on web-building spiders; the web is {{the environment in}} which this predator finds its prey, but it also forms part of its preys’ sophisticated sensory apparatus, blurring the distinction between environment and sensory systems. Stenolemus giraffa needs to break threads in the web that obstruct its path to the spiders, and such vibrations can alert the spiders. Using laser vibrometry, this study demonstrates how S. giraffa avoids alerting the spiders during its approach. When breaking threads, S. giraffa attenuates the vibrations produced by holding on to the loose <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the broken thread and causing them to sag prior to release. In addition, S. giraffa releases the loose <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> broken <b>thread</b> one at <b>a</b> time (after several seconds or minutes) and in this way spaces out the production of vibrations in time. Furthermore, S. giraffa was found to maximally reduce the amplitude of vibrations when breaking threads that are prone to produce louder vibrations. Finally, S. giraffa preferred to break threads in the presence of wind, suggesting that this araneophagic insect exploits environmental noise that temporarily impairs the spiders’ ability to detect vibrations. The predatory behaviour of S. giraffa seems to be adaptated in intricate manner for bypassing the sophisticated sensory systems of web-building spiders. These findings illustrate how the physical characteristics of the environment, along with the sensory systems of prey can shape the predatory strategies of animals. 14 page(s...|$|R
60|$|But {{the strongest}} {{case of this}} Victorian power of being {{abruptly}} original in a corner {{can be found in}} two things: the literature meant merely for children and the literature meant merely for fun. It is true that these two very Victorian things often melted into each other (as was the way of Victorian things), but not sufficiently to make it safe to mass them together without distinction. Thus there was George Macdonald, <b>a</b> Scot <b>of</b> genius as genuine as Carlyle's; he could write fairy-tales that made all experience a fairy-tale. He could give the real sense that every one had the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elfin <b>thread</b> that must at last lead them into Paradise. It was <b>a</b> sort <b>of</b> optimist Calvinism. But such really significant fairy-tales were accidents of genius. Of the Victorian Age as a whole it is true to say that it did discover a new thing; a thing called Nonsense. It may be doubted whether this thing was really invented to please children. Rather it was invented by old people trying to prove their first childhood, and sometimes succeeding only in proving their second. But whatever else the thing was, it was English and it was individual. Lewis Carroll gave mathematics a holiday: he carried logic into the wild lands of illogicality. Edward Lear, a richer, more romantic and therefore more truly Victorian buffoon, improved the experiment. But the more we study it, the more we shall, I think, conclude that it reposed on something more real and profound in the Victorians than even their just and exquisite appreciation of children. It came from the deep Victorian sense of humour.|$|R
