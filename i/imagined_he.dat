25|$|When Hall {{agreed to}} the design role and was {{appointed}} in April 1966, he <b>imagined</b> <b>he</b> would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was {{an enormous amount of}} work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure. In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall. Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role. With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.|$|E
500|$|With {{the draft}} memoir {{complete}} and clandestinely transmitted, Speer sought a new project. He found one while taking his daily exercise, walking in {{circles around the}} prison yard. Measuring the path's distance carefully, Speer set out to walk the distance from Berlin to Heidelberg. He then expanded his idea into a worldwide journey, visualizing the places he was [...] "traveling" [...] through while walking the path around the prison yard. Speer ordered guidebooks and other materials about the nations through which he <b>imagined</b> <b>he</b> was passing, so as to envisage as accurate a picture as possible. Meticulously calculating every meter traveled, and mapping distances to the real-world geography, he began in northern Germany, passed through Asia by a southern route before entering Siberia, then crossed the Bering Strait and continued southwards, finally ending his sentence [...] south of Guadalajara, Mexico.|$|E

500|$|Hades first {{appeared}} in God of War; the original design portrayed Hades as a fiery, demonic face with horns. Statues in the game adhered to this design. Hades' character design was changed in God of War II, with the character now appearing in a more human-like form with spikes protruding from his body and wielding a pair of chained claws, similar to Kratos' chained blades. The new design featured a helmet that appeared to cover a fiery face, which in God of War III, it is eventually revealed to be very grotesque but more human-like than the original design from God of War. Hermes was originally designed for God of War II by Andy Park and did appear in the final cut scene of the game. For God of War III, Park updated the design and painting of the character. Park said he [...] "wanted to create a character that was sly, cunning, and a bit comical in both appearance and personality" [...] and he <b>imagined</b> <b>he</b> would be [...] "much like a dancer." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, it was {{confirmed}} by Daniel Kilkelly, a reporter for Digital Spy, that a new storyline would see Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Fatboy spend the night together after he rescues her when she gets unwanted attention from a man. Norwood, who plays Fatboy, told Inside Soap, [...] "Right now, I don't think Fatboy is looking for love - but he's happy to be swept off his feet by Denise, who's this hot older woman he never <b>imagined</b> <b>he</b> could be with."Denise is a scorching woman - she's got a dynamite body and a beautiful smile. She's way out of his league, {{but there is a}} lot of chemistry between them. I think they'd make a really good couple. That would be cool. Fatboy may be young, but he's got an old soul and he's not just some young boy messing about. There is potential there if Denise could see it, but because of the age thing, I think she might worry that people were saying things about her. Right now, she's just enjoying herself." [...] Norwood added that while the pair's relationship was sexual, a serious future for them could be possible.|$|E

2500|$|The American philosopher Eric Hoffer {{employed}} Montaigne both stylistically and in thought. In Hoffer's memoir, Truth <b>Imagined,</b> <b>he</b> said of Montaigne, [...] "He {{was writing}} about me. He knew my innermost thoughts." [...] The Welsh novelist John Cowper Powys expressed his admiration for Montaigne's philosophy in his books Suspended Judgements (1916) and The Pleasures of Literature (1938). Judith N. Shklar introduces her book Ordinary Vices (1984), [...] "It is only if we step outside the divinely ruled moral universe that we can really put our minds to the common ills we inflict upon one another each day.

In the early 1960s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of Venus' surface, and Sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a Time–Life book, Planets. His own view was that Venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had <b>imagined.</b> <b>He</b> had investigated radio emissions from Venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of [...] As a visiting scientist to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he contributed to the first Mariner missions to Venus, working on the design and management of the project.

2500|$|The {{narrative}} language of Vara baroc has also drawn the critical interest. Citing {{the book as}} a prime example, Dan C. Mihăilescu called its author [...] "a monster of brilliant loquacity". Commenting {{on the use of}} word plays and the accumulation of metaphors, Simuţ argues: [...] " [...] are put to use into a signification which goes beyond simple gratuitousness; language is to Gabriel Dimancea a windscreen that emerges suddenly, like a wall, in front of those who seek pathways toward understanding him and uncovering his secret." [...] The dense nature of the account, Simuţ believes, doubles as a pace-maintaining technique, {{to make up for the}} steadiness of the plot, to entertain by means of a [...] "comedy of language", to illustrate the breakdown of intelligent behavior, and to blur the lines between real and <b>imagined.</b> <b>He</b> notes: [...] "Loquacity is the illusion of action and engagement [...] The real and the fantastical short-circuit one another." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special. By April 1965, Time featured the Peanuts gang on its magazine cover, perhaps prompting a call from John Allen of the New York-based McCann Erickson Agency. Mendelson <b>imagined</b> <b>he</b> would sell his documentary, and blindly agreed to Allen's proposal: an animated half-hour Peanuts Christmas special. The Coca-Cola Company was looking for a special for advertising during the holiday season. [...] "The bad news is that today is Wednesday and they'll need an outline in Atlanta by Monday," [...] Allen remarked to Mendelson. He quickly contacted Schulz, and the duo got to work with plans for a Peanuts Christmas special. The duo prepared an outline for the Coca-Cola executives in less than one day, and Mendelson would later recall that the bulk of ideas came from Schulz, whose [...] "ideas flowed nonstop." [...] According to Mendelson, their pitch to Coca-Cola consisted of [...] "winter scenes, a school play, a scene to be read from the Bible, and a sound track combining jazz and traditional music." [...] The outline did not change over the course of its production.|$|E
2500|$|Following his win in Hong Kong A Shin Hikari {{was off the}} racecourse for {{six months}} before being sent to France for the Prix d'Ispahan on 24 May. The race was run at Chantilly Racecourse as its usual venue, Longchamp, was being redeveloped. He was made the 7.4/1 fourth choice behind New Bay, Dariyan (Prix Ganay) and Vadamos (Prix du Muguet) whilst the other five runners {{included}} the Grand Prix de Paris winner Erupt. Racing on heavy ground he settled in second place behind Vadamos {{before going to the}} front 400 metres from the finish. He drew further and further away from his rivals in the straight and crossed the line ten lengths clear of Dariyan. After the race Sakaguchi said [...] "I had <b>imagined</b> <b>he</b> would jump to the front and lead the race, so I was surprised, but it was good judgement by Yutaka to run him a bit away from the rail where the ground was not as bad. It was great to see that he could settle and race from second place, as well as win with that style. We can now proudly hold our heads high and go to England for the Royal Ascot meeting". Bookmakers responded by making the horse favourite for the Prince of Wales's Stakes. In the June 2016 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings A Shin Hikari was rated the best horse in the world, three pounds ahead of California Chrome and Winx.|$|E
2500|$|More {{offers for}} Leno had sprung up (including a lucrative {{one for a}} {{syndicated}} program by Sony Pictures Television), and Zucker began to make trips to the Burbank studio {{in an effort to}} keep Leno in spring 2008. He gave him numerous suggestions, including a Bob Hope-type deal (high-profile specials), a Sunday night primetime show, or even a nightly cable show on USA Network (owned by NBCUniversal). Executives began to entertain an ideal solution—pay off O'Brien and retain Leno—but Zucker viewed the idea as [...] "outrageous". By this time, NBC had already broken ground on a new studio for O'Brien's Tonight Show, renovating Stage 1 at the Universal lot in Universal City, for a reported US$50 million. During a spring lunch meeting with Jeff Ross, NBC sports chief Dick Ebersol imparted some advice: that O'Brien retire silly antics (such as his signature [...] "string dance") and focus more on pitching his show to middle America, which would involve stretching out his monologue. O'Brien, then a year away from inheriting the sacred ground of The Tonight Show, was indeed lengthening his monologue, but viewed suggestions from Ludwin as largely unnecessary: [...] "I think people are overthinking the twelve-thirty-to-eleven- thirty shift", he said, instead desiring to put his own stamp on the show's tradition. By this point, O'Brien's popularity, sky high at the time of the contract signing, had gone down slightly. He had neglected to change his act to suit a more mainstream audience (as NBC <b>imagined</b> <b>he</b> would) and CBS's Craig Ferguson, who occupied the post-Letterman slot, had begun to occasionally trump O'Brien in overall ratings. Though internal anxiety increased among executives, most tended to still support O'Brien.|$|E
