5|$|In Multani v. Marguerite-Bourgeoys (Commission scolaire) (2006), {{the issue}} was whether a ban <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> on Sikh {{students}} carrying kirpans (ceremonial daggers) for religious purposes was justifiable. Justice Louise Charron, who delivered the Court's majority opinion, applied the Oakes test to section 2(a) of the Charter. She held that the school could not discharge its burden of proving that prohibiting the kirpan was a reasonable limit on the student's constitutional freedom of religion.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as {{an important contribution to}} liberal theory.

25|$|Medwin {{was from}} a prosperous rather than a wealthy family that {{expected}} their sons {{to work for a}} living. He attended Syon House Academy in Isleworth in 1788–1804, as did Shelley in 1802–8. Medwin related that Shelley and he remained close friends at Syon House, forming a bond so close that Shelley apparently sleepwalked his way to Medwin's dormitory. After a further year <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>school,</b> Medwin matriculated at University College, Oxford in the winter of 1805, but left without taking his degree.

25|$|Early in 1902, Hobbs {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the job of assistant professional at Bedford School, which he held throughout the summer term. The work mainly consisted of working as a groundsman and bowling in the nets, which left him exhausted and unhappy. Living away from home from the first time and working <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> environment left him feeling socially out of his depth and he did not enjoy his cricketing duties, although he later admitted that the cricketing strength of the school improved his own batting. In late August, Hobbs returned to Cambridge to play as a professional for the first time. For a fee of ten shillings, he appeared for a team from the nearby town of Royston against Hertfordshire Club and Ground. Appearing in his highest level of cricket to date, Hobbs scored 119. His success delighted his family and made him a local celebrity. Hobbs' father had helped to arrange his appearance in the match but was already seriously ill with pneumonia, and he died a week after his son scored his century, on 3 September 1902. His death left his wife and children facing great financial hardship.|$|E

500|$|In Educational Researcher, Luis Mirón and Pradeep Dhillon {{wrote that}} theorists of {{education}} and liberal political philosophy could not [...] "afford to ignore" [...] the book. They wrote that the state {{would have to be}} [...] "benign" [...] and [...] "hermetically sealed" [...] from external influence for her theory to hold—that such a state would be weak against the interests of illiberal parties. They added that her evaluation of public education across several countries did not account for supranational influence and that she did not engage the potential issues endemic to integrating heteronymous illiberals. Additionally, they felt that the book lacked in its practical proposals for public school civics education, particularly in how a weak perfectionist, [...] "activist" [...] state can intervene on behalf of marginalized group interests <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> setting.|$|E

The Liebers's brewery was closed in 1921 after the advent of Prohibition in the United States.

Vonnegut's brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in private schools, but Vonnegut was placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>school,</b> called Public School No. 43, now known as the James Whitcomb Riley School. He was not bothered by this, but both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a [...] "dreamy artist". His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family's wealth and status, and Vonnegut said she expressed hatred [...] "as corrosive as hydrochloric acid" [...] for her husband. Edith Vonnegut forayed into writing and tried to sell short stories to magazines like Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post with no success.|$|E
