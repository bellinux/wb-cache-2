5|$|The AACS LA {{announced}} on April 16 {{that it had}} revoked the decryption keys associated with certain software high-definition <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> which {{will not be able}} to decrypt AACS encrypted disks mastered after April 23, without an update of the software.|$|E
5|$|Monster {{also makes}} cables for TVs, <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> computers, printers, gaming consoles, and cameras, and for audio {{equipment}} in cars. As high-definition televisions grew in popularity, the company expanded into HDMI and high-def cables, including a lower-cost HDMI Basic and HDMI cables with five different speed ratings. It also produces cables intended for specific gaming consoles and Apple products.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the creator}} of BackupHDDVD, he or she first set out to {{circumvent}} AACS to bypass a restriction in software HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> which reduced the quality of AACS restricted 1080p high definition video to that of standard definition DVD video or refused to play outright unless an HDCP compliant chain of video hardware was present. At the time only a few computer monitors and video cards supported HDCP. As a result, configurations {{that would have allowed}} high-definition HD DVD viewing in software players were exceptionally rare.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as tantalium, its {{name comes from}} Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology. Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It {{is part of the}} refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum. Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> video game systems and computers.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} use of DVDs gave initiative for scratchable <b>DVD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 2008 Toshiba {{announced}} {{that close to}} one million dedicated HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> had been sold.|$|E
25|$|Backward {{compatibility}} {{is available}} with all HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> allowing users {{to have a}} single player to play all types of HD DVD, DVD and CD. There is also a hybrid HD DVD format which contains both DVD and HD DVD {{versions of the same}} movie on a single disc, providing a smooth transition for the studios in terms of publishing movies, and allowing consumers with only <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> to still use the discs. DVD replication companies can continue using their current production equipment with only minor alterations when changing over to the format of HD DVD replication. Due to the structure of the single-lens optical head, both red and blue laser diodes can be used in smaller, more compact HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
25|$|Amstrad {{has also}} {{produced}} {{a variety of}} home entertainment products over their history, including hi-fi, televisions, VCRs, and <b>DVD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
25|$|Playback {{hardware}} plays back {{an existing}} video stream from disk or tape based storage mediums, e.g. VHS tape players and <b>DVD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December 2006 Toshiba {{reported}} that roughly 120,000 Toshiba branded HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> {{had been sold}} in the United States, along with 150,000 HD DVD add-on units for the Xbox 360.|$|E
25|$|HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> {{and movies}} were {{released}} in the United States on April 18, 2006. The first Blu-ray Disc titles were released on June 20, 2006 and the first movies using dual layer Blu-ray discs (50GB) were introduced in October 2006.|$|E
25|$|On 19 February 2008, after a {{protracted}} format war with rival Blu-ray, Toshiba abandoned the format, announcing {{it would no}} longer develop or manufacture HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> and drives. The HD DVD Promotion Group was dissolved on March 28, 2008.|$|E
25|$|The company {{started out}} {{designing}} chipsets for optical drives and subsequently expanded into chip solutions for <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> digital TVs, mobile phones, smartphones and tablets. In general MediaTek {{has had a}} strong record of gaining market share and displacing competitors after entering new markets.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Raúl Castro's {{administration}} {{hinted that}} {{the purchase of}} computers, <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> and microwaves would become legal. However, monthly wages remain less than 20 U.S. dollars. Mobile phones, which had been restricted to Cubans working for foreign companies and government officials, were legalized in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Video CDs {{were unable}} to gain {{acceptance}} as a mainstream format in North America, chiefly because the established VHS format was less expensive, offered comparable video quality, and could be recorded over. The advent of recordable CDs, inexpensive recorders, and compatible <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> spurred VCD acceptance in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, DVD burners and DVD-Video recorders were available by that time, and equipment and media costs for making DVD-Video fell rapidly. DVD-Video, with its longer run time and much higher quality, quickly overshadowed VCD in areas that could afford it. In addition many early <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> could not read recordable (CD-R) media, and this limited the compatibility of home-made VCDs. Almost every modern stand-alone DVD-Video player can play VCDs burned on recordable media.|$|E
25|$|In its decision, {{the court}} did not address the {{legality}} of companies who offered software or hardware that would “read” unaltered media and skip objectionable content. Section (II) allows the sale of hardware, such as modified <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> sold by CleanPlay, and software, like downloadable plug-ins, that would skip such content.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of hybrid formats which contain {{standard}} DVD-Video format video for playback in regular <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> and HD DVD video for playback in high definition on HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players.</b> The Combo disc is a dual sided disc with one side DVD and the other HD DVD, each of which can have up to two layers. The Twin disc is a single sided disc that can have up to three layers, with up to two layers dedicated to either DVD or HD DVD. These hybrid discs make retail marketing and shelf space management easier. Another advantage is hardware cross-compatibility. The average consumer does {{not have to worry about}} whether or not they can play a hybrid DVD: any standard home DVD player can access the DVD-encoded content and any HD DVD player can access both the DVD- and HD DVD-encoded content.|$|E
25|$|Coby {{products}} spanned {{home and}} portable {{audio and video}} electronics plus accessories. Leading categories included LCD televisions, internet tablets, MP3 players, tablet <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> digital picture frames and surround-sound home theater systems. Available in metropolitan and regional brick and mortar storefronts or via the Internet, Coby's products were found {{in a wide range}} of locations.|$|E
25|$|KVCD (K Video Compression Dynamics) is an XVCD variant that {{requires}} the use of a proprietary quantization matrix, available for non-commercial use. KVCD is notable because the specification recommends a non-standard resolution of 528x480 or 528x576. KVCDs encoded at this resolution are only playable by computers with CD-ROM drives, and a small number of <b>DVD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
25|$|All HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> are {{required}} to decode uncompressed linear PCM, Dolby Digital AC-3, Dolby Digital EX, DTS, Dolby Digital Plus E-AC-3 and Dolby TrueHD. A secondary soundtrack, if present, {{can be stored in}} any of the aforementioned formats, or in one of the HD DVD optional codecs: DTS-HD High Resolution Audio and DTS-HD Master Audio. For the highest-fidelity audio experience, HD DVD offers content-producers the choice of LPCM, Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio.|$|E
25|$|HD DVD-ROM, HD DVD-R and HD DVD-RW have a {{single-layer}} {{capacity of}} 15GB, and a dual-layer capacity of 30GB. HD DVD-RAM has a single-layer capacity of 20GB. Like the original DVD format, the data layer of an HD DVD is 0.6mm {{below the surface}} to physically protect the data layer from damage. The numerical aperture of the optical pick-up head is 0.65, compared with 0.6 for DVD. All HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> are backward compatible with DVD and CD.|$|E
25|$|Certified PlaysForSure devices, {{as well as}} a {{large number}} of uncertified devices, ranging from {{portable}} hand-held music players to set-top <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> support the playback of WMA files. Most PlaysForSure-certified online stores distribute content using this codec only. In 2005, Nokia announced its plans to support WMA playback in future Nokia handsets. In the same year, an update was made available for the PlayStation Portable (version 2.60) which allowed WMA files to be played on the device for the first time.|$|E
25|$|He {{is known}} to have trouble {{handling}} new technology and is frequently confused when operating electronics (such as remote controls and <b>DVD</b> <b>players).</b> He does not usually use computers (although he did use one for an episode of Live during summer 2008, demonstrating how to find homes online) and did not own a cell phone until September 10, 2008. It is often noted, however, that Philbin does not completely reject the technology; he simply has Joy make calls and send e-mails for him.|$|E
25|$|On February 23, 2008, the Xbox 360 HD DVD {{player was}} {{discontinued}} by Microsoft. This decision came {{just days after}} Toshiba's announcement to discontinue all HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> and effectively end the format war between Blu-ray and HD DVD. Two days later, {{the price of the}} HD DVD Player was reduced to a clearance price of $49.99. Peter Moore had stated that if HD DVD loses the format war, Microsoft may also release an external Blu-ray drive. This was later denied by Microsoft.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> are {{compatible}} with VCDs, and VCD-only players are available throughout Asia, and online through many shopping sites. Older Blu-ray and HD-DVD players also retained support, as do CBHD players as well. However, most current Blu-ray players and the Sony PlayStation 3/4 cannot play VCDs; this is because while they have backwards playback compatibility with the DVD standard, these player can not read VCD data because the player software does not have support for MPEG-1 video and audio.|$|E
25|$|CD-RW is a re-recordable {{medium that}} uses a {{metallic}} alloy instead of a dye. The write laser {{in this case is}} used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players cannot read CD-RW discs, although most later CD audio players and stand-alone <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> can. CD-RWs follow the Orange Book standard.|$|E
25|$|In November 2007, the Toshiba HD-A2 was {{the first}} high {{definition}} player to be sold at a sale price of less than US$100; this was done through several major retailers {{to make room for}} the new HD-A3 models. These closeout sales lasted less than a day each due to both limited quantities and high demand at that price point. In the same month, the HD DVD promotion group announced that 750,000 HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> had been sold, which included stand-alone players and the Xbox 360 add-on.|$|E
25|$|Indirect network effects: Increases in {{usage of}} one product or network spawn {{increases}} {{in the value of}} a complementary product or network, which can in turn increase the value of the original. Examples of complementary goods include software (such as an Office suite for operating systems) and DVDs (for <b>DVD</b> <b>players).</b> This is why Windows and Linux might compete not just for users, but for software developers. This is also called a cross-side network effect. Most two-sided markets (or platform-mediated markets) are characterized by indirect network effects.|$|E
25|$|Headphones may be {{used with}} {{stationary}} CD and <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> home theater, personal computers, or portable devices (e.g., digital audio player/MP3 player, mobile phone). Cordless headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as FM, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a Silent disco or Silent Gig.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of more sophisticated, higher capacity optical disc formats yielded the DVD format, released {{only a few years}} later with a copy protection mechanism. <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> use lasers that are of shorter wavelength than those used on CDs, allowing the recorded pits to be smaller, so that more information can be stored. The DVD was so successful that it eventually pushed VHS out of the video market once suitable recorders became widely available. Nevertheless, VCDs made considerable inroads into developing nations, where they are still in use today.|$|E
25|$|The {{display is}} the most {{expensive}} component in most laptops. In April 2005, Negroponte hired Mary Lou Jepsen—who was interviewing to join the Media Arts and Sciences faculty at the MIT Media Lab in September 2008—as OLPC Chief Technology Officer. Jepsen developed a new display for the first-generation OLPC laptop, inspired by the design of small LCDs used in portable <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> which she estimated would cost about $35. In the OLPC XO-1, the screen is estimated to be the second most expensive component (after the CPU and chipset).|$|E
25|$|The HD DVD Promotion Group was a {{group of}} {{manufacturers}} and media studios formed to exchange thoughts and ideas to help promote the format worldwide. Its members comprised Toshiba as the Chair Company and Secretary, Memory-Tech Corporation and NEC as Vice-Chair companies, and Sanyo Electric as Auditors; there were 61 general members and 72 associate members in total. The HD DVD promotion group was officially dissolved on March 28, 2008, following Toshiba's announcement on February 19, 2008 that it would no longer develop or manufacture HD <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> and drives.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the design of computers and computer systems. This may involve the design of new hardware, the design of PDAs, tablets, and supercomputers, {{or the use of}} computers to control an industrial plant. Computer engineers may also work on a system's software. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of software engineering, which is usually considered a separate discipline. Desktop computers represent {{a tiny fraction of the}} devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including video game consoles and <b>DVD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
25|$|A basic karaoke machine {{consists}} of a music player, microphone inputs, a means of altering the pitch of the played music, and an audio output. Some low-end machines attempt to provide vocal suppression so that one can feed regular songs into the machine and remove {{the voice of the}} original singer; however, this is rarely effective. Most common machines are CD+G, Laser Disc, VCD or <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> with microphone inputs and an audio mixer built in. CD+G players use a special track called subcode to encode the lyrics and pictures displayed on the screen while other formats natively display both audio and video.|$|E
25|$|An early {{example of}} a DRM system is the Content Scrambling System (CSS) {{employed}} by the DVD Forum on film DVDs circa 1996. CSS uses an encryption algorithm to encrypt content on the DVD disc. Manufacturers of <b>DVD</b> <b>players</b> must license this technology and implement it in their devices {{so that they can}} decrypt the encrypted content to play it. The CSS license agreement includes restrictions on how the DVD content is played, including what outputs are permitted and how such permitted outputs are made available. This keeps the encryption intact as the video material is played out to a TV.|$|E
25|$|LCDs {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of {{applications}} including computer monitors, televisions, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, and indoor and outdoor signage. Small LCD screens are common in portable consumer devices such as digital cameras, watches, calculators, and mobile telephones, including smartphones. LCD screens are also used on consumer electronics products such as <b>DVD</b> <b>players,</b> video game devices and clocks. LCD screens have replaced heavy, bulky cathode ray tube (CRT) displays in nearly all applications. LCD screens are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays, with LCD screens available in sizes ranging from tiny digital watches to huge, big-screen television sets.|$|E
