60|$|General Booth and his Officers are, as I {{know from}} various conversations with them, firmly {{convinced}} {{that many of}} the great and patent evils of our civilization result from the desertion of the land by its inhabitants, and that crowding into cities {{which is one of the}} most marked phenomena of our time. Indeed, it was an identity of view upon this point, which is one that I have advanced for years, that first brought me into contact with the Salvation Army. But to preach the advantages of bringing people back to the land is one thing, and to get them there quite another. Many obstacles stand in the way. I need only mention two of these: the necessity for large capital and the still more important necessity of enabling those who are settled on it to <b>earn</b> <b>out</b> of Mother Earth a sufficient living for themselves and their families.|$|E

50|$|The one {{exception}} to this risk-taking investment was Eugene O'Neill. While most of Liveright's avant-garde publications failed to <b>earn</b> <b>out</b> their advances during the 1920s (Hart Crane would die $210 in debt to the house), O'Neill's plays were frequently amongst the firm's top-selling books. After winning the Pulitzer Prize for Beyond the Horizon in 1920, the Greenwich Village playwright reached national attention. The B&L edition of Strange Interlude would sell over 100,000 copies, becoming the bestselling play of the decade. In all Liveright would publish thirteen of O'Neill's dramas, but would have to relinquish those rights in 1933 during bankruptcy proceedings.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of wealth on labor supply using the {{randomized}} assignment of monetary prizes in a large sample of Swedish lottery players. We find winning a lottery prize modestly reduces labor earnings, with the reduction being immediate, persistent, and similar by age, education, and sex. A calibrated dynamic model of individual labor supply implies an average lifetime marginal propensity to <b>earn</b> <b>out</b> of unearned income of - 0. 11, and labor-supply elasticities in the lower range of previously reported estimates. The earnings response is stronger for winners than their spouses, which is inconsistent with unitary household labor supply models...|$|E

30|$|The {{results for}} women in Table  8, on the other hand, are not {{supportive}} {{of the idea that}} windfall gains reduce labour supply. None of the coefficients on windfall gains dummies are statistically significant, {{and many of them are}} nonnegative. In light of the fact that women are usually considered as being less attached to the labour market than men, this result is surprising. One would indeed expect the effect of windfall gains to be stronger and more negative for women. For instance, Henley (2004) finds a significant adjustment in hours worked to unanticipated financial gains for both men and women, but the largest impact occurs for women. In addition, the author shows that while men seem to make a (positive) adjustment in hours to housing losses but not a (negative) adjustment to gains, for women the reverse is true. On the other hand, Imbens et al. (2001) estimate the marginal propensity to <b>earn</b> <b>out</b> of unearned income and find that it does not differ significantly between men and women. Joulfaian and Wilhelm (1994) also show that the hours’ reduction by married women is of the same order of magnitude as men’s.|$|E
