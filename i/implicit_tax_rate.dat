The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the way the (macroeconomic <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> on labour income is calculated in the European Commission Structures of the Taxation Systems in the EU? publication, to show its relationship to the widely recognised (microeconomic) tax wedge indicator for an average production worker from the "Taxing Wages" approach of the OECD, and to illustrate its use. It appears from the European Commission report that evidence from the implicit tax ratio at the macro level in a single year cannot simply be projected to observations for an average worker at the micro level, and conversely. With a few exemptions, however, both the macroeconomic and the microeconomic indicator appear to have comparable informative content as regards to general increasing or decreasing trends over time.

The <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> relates to actual tax revenue data and it could be, for example, that the revenue effect of targeted reductions in personal income tax, at say, the lower end of the income scale, has been offset by increases in wage income at the top of the wage scale.

In {{the actual}} world {{economic}} framework, in which the financial crisis is running at full steam, and is being felt, not in the least, by the small and medium enterprises, the fiscal impact of the social taxes and contributions levied on employed labour (id est, on employed labour income) is of the outmost importance, {{for the management of}} such firms.

40|$|During {{the recent}} flat tax debate, {{interest}} rates on long-term municipal bonds rose relative to the rate on U. S. Treasury bonds. This was widely attributed to expectations of a reduction in future tax rates.

The information content in implicit tax rates is particularly high around the time of major tax debates that have resulted in significant changes in tax rates. At other times, including the flat tax debate of 1996 - 96, implicit tax rates carry little information about future tax rates. Forecasting; Municipal bonds; Taxation...|$|E

An extended version of the New View, in which municipal bonds are sold at interest rates which increase with leverage, predicts that all communities will choose tax finance at the margin.

The aim of this work is to model the real impact of legislative changes in the Czech Republic on the actual tax burden of employees with different incomes and propose optimal solution of tax calculation.
