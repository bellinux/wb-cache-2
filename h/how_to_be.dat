5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time was not supposed to be prescribed to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent.

5|$|Nigella Lucy Lawson (born 6 January 1960) is an English journalist, broadcaster, {{television}} personality, gourmet, {{and food}} writer. She {{is the daughter}} of Nigel Lawson, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Vanessa (née Salmon) Lawson, whose family owned the J. Lyons and Co. food and catering business. After graduating from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University, Lawson started work as a book reviewer and restaurant critic, later becoming the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986. She then embarked upon a career as a freelance journalist, writing for a number of newspapers and magazines. In 1998, she brought out her first cookery book, How to Eat, which sold 300,000 copies and became a best-seller. She wrote her second book in 2000, <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> a Domestic Goddess, which won her the British Book Award for Author of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Schools {{have been}} the center of {{controversy}} over both the anthem and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education {{requires the use of}} both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. Some have protested that such rules violate the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees have an obligation to teach their students <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good Japanese citizens. As a sign of protest, schools refused to display the Hinomaru at school graduations and some parents ripped down the flag. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the Hinomaru and Kimigayo. After earlier opposition, the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>be</b> {{understood in terms of}} "learning a prior," from a Bayesian point-of-view (Baxter, 1996 b). This paper presents an alternative interpretation: learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>is</b> ordinary learning but on point sets, rather than points. The idea behind learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>is</b> <b>to</b> partition the data, learn a model for the partitions, and then apply this model to new partitions. Ordinary learning methods do the same thing but with individual data points as the partitions. The partitioning for learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> learn may <b>be</b> recovered automatically and may be applied recursively, leading to "task clustering" models. Virtually all existing approaches fit naturally into this unifying framework, including learning a distance metric and learning internal representations. 1 INTRODUCTION In the classical learning scenario, we have some independent and identically distributed (IID) samples of a function and want to complete the function, i. e. guess the values [...] ...|$|R
