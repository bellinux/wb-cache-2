60|$|Mr. Ramsdale was not our nearest English neighbour--the {{one to be}} {{described}} in another chapter; nor was he a man we cared much about, and his meagre establishment was not attractive, as his old slatternly native housekeeper and the other servants were allowed to do just what they liked. But he was English and a neighbour, and my parents {{made it a point}} of paying him an occasional visit, and I always managed to go with them--certainly not to see Mr. Ramsdale, who had nothing to say to a shy little boy and whose hard red face looked the face of a hard drinker. My visits were to the paroquets exclusively. Oh, why, thought I many and many a time, did not these dear green people come over to us and have their happy village in our trees! Yet when I visited them they didn't like it; no sooner would I run out to the grove where the nests were than the place would be in an uproar. Out and up they would rush, to unite in a flock and <b>hover</b> shrieking <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and the commotion would last until I left them.|$|R
