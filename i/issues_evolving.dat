There has been an explosion of private schooling mostly at the primary but at higher levels as well and, somewhat surprisingly, private schooling cannot be relegated the status of an urban èlite phenomenon alone [Andrabi, et al.

This transformation of the education sector has generated many concerns among which the ‘equity’ issue has been raised to the fore. The unprecedented growth of cheap private schooling has also raised questions regarding the role of these institutions in the delivery of education, the question of parental ‘choice’ 1 as well as the future of government educational policy. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{factors that}} {{help explain why}} community-environmental social movement organizations (SMOs) expand or fail to expand their organizational goals beyond single-issue, reactive issues. A {{review of the literature}} suggests that a movement-centered model of movement change can better explain goal-expansion than natural-history, resource mobilization and new social movement theories alone. Goal-expansion is examined in terms of networks that SMOs activate, the grievances that members construct, and the socio-economic context of the community where these SMOs develop. A purposive sample of six SMOs in the state of Connecticut is used; two of these are goal-nonexpanding, two expanded in number of issues (watchdogs), and two expanded in direction (proactives). ^ Qualitative and quantitative findings suggest that goal-expansion is correlated with (1) having more rather than fewer internal networks (or emergent, intra-SMO networks), and not with having more previous movement networks, as initially proposed. Data suggest that goal-expansion is also correlated with whether activists (2) 2 ̆ 2 own a social problem, 2 ̆ 2 (3) whether they lose trust toward authority; and (4) whether they develop an emergent sense of proactivity. Additionally, goal-expanding SMOs are more likely to become incorporated as non-profit organizations. This model suggests the fallacy of determinism afflicting resource mobilization and political process approaches, i. e., their frequent emphasis on external influences. This model also challenges the Weber-Michels model; rather than decay, disband or displace their goals, the organizations labeled 2 ̆ 2 goal-expanding 2 ̆ 2 outlive their <b>issues,</b> <b>evolving</b> into a source of opposition to local political players. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{critical}} {{equity and}} change enabler, literacy/education continues to prove very challenging to transform in South Africa. Having {{been a major}} apartheid resource through Bantu Education in entrenching South Africa‟s existing two worlds, business intervention in this crucial sector is the overriding interest of this research. How corporate social responsibility in education, assisted by public policy, reinforces inequality in the South African society, even as it attempts to alleviate poverty, is {{the thrust of the}} argument here around which many questions evolve. Some of the questions to which this thesis attempts to offer answers, therefore, are: What informs how business invests in education? How is public policy not an enabler of business investment in education? The objective is {{to determine the extent to}} which business investment in literacy/education can empower meaningful change in a market-driven South African society. The argument reiterated in this thesis is that Corporate Social Investment (CSI) in education has the potential to be a strong change driver. Unfortunately, its current positioning in the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (BB-BEE) strategy is weak and its effect on change equally weak. The extent to which CSI in literacy can facilitate transformation in South Africa is highly dependent on the elimination of the many challenges beyond the scope of business endeavour. The challenges include the low weighting of CSI in the BEE agenda which is a hindrance to mind-set change about the relevance of education to South Africa‟s transformation. Employing the qualitative method, using elite interviewing, and relying on written records, this thesis starts off by finding the South African definition of the word Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) vis-à-vis global definitions. While Corporate Social Investment (CSI), it was discovered, is the preferred word in the private sector, findings here reveal that irrespective of what it is called in South Africa, CSR or CSI, both terms are fundamentally the same because, more in South Africa than anywhere else, the moral values that drive CSR or CSI are the same. That is, social justice, equity, and transformation. In order to determine its potency in the change process, a cursory assessment of CSI in the various sectors of education reinforces the place of the definition in that process. As an „investment‟, CSI is driven by market forces. Inherent in these forces are the inequalities that motivate capitalism and CSI is not insulated from those forces. Findings here emphasise that CSI, as yet another capitalist means of intervention in education, is thus severely challenged to be more than a tip of the ice-berg in the nation‟s change process. Very importantly, this thesis shows how paradoxically, public policy through the DTI Codes of Conduct for BB-BEE further disempowers CSI in education. As a “residual element” with an insignificant weighting on the BEE Scorecard, this research argues that legislation diminishes the importance of education as an empowerment driver. The inadequate creation of jobs further makes the benefit of education to transformation even less stimulating. It concludes that although CSR or CSI has enormous potential to drive change, the BEE legislation, the conceptualisation of CSR, and other micro <b>issues</b> <b>evolving</b> around poverty conspire to limit the extent to which CSI can empower change...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project explores knitting three-dimensional (3 D) preforms suitable for fibre-reinforced composite structures utilising Shima Seiki’s industrial knitting technology. The research positions weft knitting as a 3 D additive fabrication {{process that has}} potential applications in a wider design context away from the textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry. The knitting machine could expand its usefulness from being purely a manufacturing process, to become a design tool for creating innovative 3 D forms. Within this context, 3 D shape knitting offers enormous potential to achieve efficiencies of systems, waste minimisation and material optimisation. Technological advances in flat-bed seamless knitting, such as Shima Seiki’s WholeGarment® allow for the automated production of 3 D forms that once could only be handmade. These advances provide a unique opportunity for new applications not traditionally associated with knitted textiles. The research undertaken is set out in three parts. Part one focuses on the background knowledge {{required in order to}} understand the significance of the research. Part two, the Shape Lexicon, is a visual record of 3 D shape knitted preforms, organised into three broad groups and described in detail. To communicate the 3 D shape knitted forms, a new methodology focusing on the essential design parameters within a framework of technical constraints was developed via design specifications. Part three shifts to design <b>issues</b> <b>evolving</b> out of the technical explorations of the Shape Lexicon. A small case study CraFormaTion of knitted artefacts demonstrates how the research could be a useful tool for designers to develop new ways of thinking about form and the potential of 3 D shape knitting to contribute to a wider design discourse. The Shape Lexicon establishes a link between 3 D shape knitting and parametric design principles. By focusing on the relationship of a shape’s variables and not specific values, a more flexible and systems orientated approach to form building was developed. Understanding the basis of parametric design within a knitting context also points to the next generation of digital knit software technology. To date, there has been no concentrated survey of 3 D shape knitting techniques or generic knitted 3 D forms in one informative document. Therefore this {{research project}} fills a significant gap in academic literature. 3 D shape knitting informs current design debates including; considerations of design optimisation in nature, new technology and materials for design, the reconsideration of craft in a digital context, and the interplay between design and science. Innovations occurring with textile technology and material science are expanding the creative possibilities for designers to reconsider the relationship between surface and form in a more integrated manner. The Shape Lexicon potentially instigates these exchanges and enacts new ways of thinking about form. Trans-disciplinary approaches are necessary to creatively respond to the nexus of technology and craft, and to be able to blend scientific and technical know-how, with a poetic and aesthetic sensibility. In this context, the potential for Textile Design and Architecture to work more closely together is considered. For textile designers such exchanges assist the discipline to reposition itself beyond the surface...|$|E
