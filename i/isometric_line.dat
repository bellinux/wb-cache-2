40|$|AbstractOn the {{manifold}} {{of positive}} definite matrices, a Riemannian metric Kϕ {{is associated with}} a positive kernel function ϕ on (0,∞) ×(0,∞) by defining KDϕ(H,K) =∑i,jϕ(λi,λj) - 1 TrPiHPjK, where D is a foot point with the spectral decomposition D=∑iλiPi and H,K are Hermitian matrices (tangent vectors). We are concerned with the case ϕ(x,y) =M(x,y) θ where M(x,y) is a mean of scalars x,y> 0. We clarify the isometric structure among such kernel metrics and discuss the convergence properties of geodesic distances and geodesic shortest curves along each <b>isometric</b> <b>line</b> of metrics. The metric corresponding to the square of the logarithmic mean shows up as the attractor of the whole metrics concerned...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the thinning {{of the whole}} crust, and {{the contribution of the}} upper versus lower crust to the stretching since Cenozoic, we calculated the stretching factor of the northern margin of South China Sea with data such as whole crustal thickness, depth of Cenozoic sedimentary basement and the horizontal displacement of faults. An <b>isometric</b> <b>line</b> drawing on whole crustal stretching factor is then obtained. Along the seismic Line 1530 in Baiyun sag, we also calculated the stretching factors of the upper and lower crust. The results suggest that the whole crustal thickness decreases seaward while the whole crustal stretching factor increases from shelf to slope. The Moho upwells highest beneath where the crust is thinned most. The value of the whole crustal stretching factor ranges from 1. 5 to 6. Two areas were thinned intensely: the center of Yinggehai Basin, and the Baiyun sag in the Pearl River Mouth Basin. The calculation of the upper and lower crustal stretching factors from DSP 1530 in Baiyun sag shows that the original crust of Baiyun sag should be thinned before deformation. Its pre-Cenozoic evolution as well as tectonic position during Cenozoic might be responsible for that...|$|E

50|$|Good contour {{on the map}} can be {{described}} as the viewer’s ability to continue the line throughout the map. The figure is formed by a contour or outline (as opposed to an <b>isometric</b> contour <b>line),</b> the common boundary between the figure and ground, usually through a brightness contrast. If a figure is not separated entirely from the ground, a simple black contour line can be drawn around the figure enclosing it and thus differentiating it from the ground.|$|R

Before the 20th century, anisometric verse was rarely seen. Two {{exceptions}} are William Wordsworth's Ode: Intimations of Immortality, and Afanasy Fet's Flights Beyond Fancy or Fantasy.|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the in vivo tensile {{behavior}} of a double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis graft used to reconstruct a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the human knee. In 14 subjects: intraoperative tension was measured for each of the four graft bundles during passive motion from 0 to 90 ° of flexion. Two hypotheses were tested: (a) the peak tension carried by each of the four bundles was equal during passive motion, and (b) the mechanics of the bundles mimicked the functional bands of the native anterior cruciate ligament. The total tension was also calculated and used to determine strength requirements for fixation devices. The peak tensions of the four bundles during passive motion were not equal: however, enough tension was present in each bundle that load-sharing occurred between bundles. The pattern of tension between the anterior and posterior bundles mimicked the reciprocating load-sharing be-havior of the functional bands of the native anterior cruciate ligament. Reciprocal tensile behavior was con-sistently achieved with the use of a single femoral tunnel centered on the most <b>isometric</b> <b>line</b> without the need for two separate femoral sockets. The maximum total tension was 296 N; this was nearly equal to the strength of one commonly used fixation device. The double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis graft is an attractive alternative to the patellar tendon for replacing a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Although material testing result...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{intuitive}} and interactive freehand sketching interface for 3 D polyhedrons reconstruction. The inter-face mimics sketching with pencil {{on paper and}} takes freehand sketches as input directly. The sketching environ-ment is natural by allowing sketching with discontinuous, overlapping and multiple strokes. The input sketch is a natural line drawing with hidden lines removed that depicts a 3 D object in an <b>isometric</b> view. The <b>line</b> drawing is interpreted {{by a series of}} 2 D tidy-up processes to produce a vertex-edge graph for 3 D reconstruction. A novel reconstruction approach based on three-line-junction analysis and planarity constraint is then used to approxi-mate the 3 D geometry and topology of the graph. The reconstructed object can be transformed {{so that it can be}} viewed from different viewpoints for interactive design or as immediate feedback to the designers. A new sketc...|$|R
40|$|Manual dexterity declines with {{increasing}} age however, {{the way in}} which inter-manual asymmetry responds to aging is unclear. Our purpose was to determine the effect of age and practice on inter-manual performance asymmetry in an <b>isometric</b> force pinch <b>line</b> tracing task that varied in difficulty within segments. Thirty right handed participants, 5 males and 5 females in each of three age groups, young (Y 20), young-old (O 70), and old-old (O 80), practiced an isometric force pinch task for 10 trials with each hand on each of five consecutive days. Inter-manual performance asymmetry of the right and left hands was analyzed with a repeated measures ANOVA of asymmetry with age groups, practice, task difficulty, and hand as factors. The within-individual magnitude of asymmetry was also analyzed with a repeated measures ANOVA of manual asymmetry calculated as an asymmetry index (AI). Post hoc pair-wise comparisons were performed when significance was found. We observed no inter-manual performance asymmetry on this isometric tracing task among any of the age groups, either in the hand performance differences or in the magnitude of the asymmetry index (AI). Age and practice interacted in terms of manual performance: the Y 20 and O 70 group improved accuracy and task time across the five days of practice but the O 80 group did not. However, practice did not differentially affect the AI for accuracy or task time for any group. Accuracy of performance of the two hands was differentially affected by practice. All age groups exhibited poorer performance and larger AIs on the most difficult segments of the task (3 and 6) and this did not change with practice...|$|R
