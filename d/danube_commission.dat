25|$|Troubridge {{remained}} in the Balkans for several months {{after the end of}} the war, and returned to Britain in early 1919, having been promoted to admiral in January 1919. While he was able to restore his position, he attempted to intervene without orders in the establishment of Béla Kun's Hungarian Soviet Republic in March 1919. His actions brought questionable results, and he remained out of favour with the Admiralty. His experience in the Danube area led to his appointment as president of a provisional inter-allied <b>Danube</b> <b>Commission</b> in 1919. He was replaced by a representative favoured by the Foreign Office on the establishment of the permanent international <b>Danube</b> <b>commission,</b> but when this representative, and a representative favoured by the Admiralty both departed, Troubridge was recalled in June 1920. He had been created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1919. His tenure as president of the commission lasted until March 1924, during which time he was placed on the retired list by the Admiralty, on the grounds that his salary came from the commission.|$|E

2500|$|Romania had desired the {{outright}} {{abolition of}} the <b>Danube</b> River <b>Commission</b> since 1881, when King Carol I said he would insist on the mouths of the Danube, which ran through Romanian territory, being [...] "exclusively controlled by Romanian officials." [...] The country renewed its demands in 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference and in 1921 at a conference at which the <b>Danube</b> River <b>Commission</b> was renewed and strengthened as an independent agency.|$|R
50|$|Charles Cunningham, Esq., the {{paternal}} great-uncle of Henry Stryker Taylor, was {{a native}} of Scotland, served as the British Consul (and earlier as Vice Consul) to Russia, and was instrumental in the establishment of the <b>Danube</b> River <b>Commission</b> system of tariffs and trade structures, serving as {{one of the founders of}} the <b>Danube</b> River <b>Commission,</b> and as an originator of the concept for the Commission. Cunningham had also engaged in the mercantile business in Smyrna (now Izmir), in the country of Turkey.|$|R
25|$|The same year, Zamfirescu {{was named}} a Minister Plenipotentiary and the Romanian Kingdom's envoy to the <b>Danube</b> <b>Commission.</b> His Furfanțo volume of short stories and his novel Lydda were both printed in 1911. He was {{relieved}} of his diplomatic post in 1913, {{at a time when}} Maiorescu became Premier of a Conservative Party cabinet—this came after a Romanian Army officer reported statements made by Zamfirescu, which he alleged were unpatriotic. Reportedly, Maiorescu never gave Zamfirescu a chance to explain himself.|$|E

25|$|Troubridge {{never had}} another {{seagoing}} command, but did command naval detachments and flotillas on the Danube during the Balkan campaigns, winning {{the respect of}} Serbian Crown Prince Alexander. After the war he served on the <b>Danube</b> <b>Commission</b> and was promoted to admiral, but remained out of favour with the Admiralty. He spent several years {{as president of the}} commission, retiring in 1924 and dying in 1926. He had married twice; his second wife, the sculptor Margot Elena Gertrude Taylor, left him to begin a lesbian relationship with the writer Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall.|$|E
50|$|The {{project manager}} of the Lower Austrian Donau-Regulierungs-Kommission (<b>Danube</b> Regulation <b>Commission)</b> also {{reported}} on the proposal to dig an overflow canal through the flood plain and then to turn the canal into a harbour in 1920, although not in as much detail.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a good tract of land secured by the regulation of the Danube 1870-75, {{and many of the}} major streets are named after members of the <b>Danube</b> Regulation <b>Commission.</b> Therefore, it does not contain any distinctive historical areas. Brigittenau was separated from the 2nd district in 1900. Earlier component districts were named Schottenau, Wolfsau, Taborau, and Zwischenbrücken.|$|R
50|$|The {{commission}} {{dates to}} the Paris Conferences of 1856 and 1921, which established {{for the first time}} an international regime to safeguard free navigation on the <b>Danube.</b> Today the <b>Commission</b> include riparian and non-riparian states.|$|R
25|$|Before World War II, {{international}} trade and commerce at the mouths of the Danube River, {{as well as many}} of the physical works needed to keep vessels from running aground, were regulated by an international agency called the European Commission of the Danube, founded in 1856. By the time the Hitlerian invasions began in 1938 the commission was composed of the riparian (river-bordering) states, plus France, Great Britain, and Italy, the chief commercial nations of Europe at that time. Above Brăila, the river was {{under the control of the}} International <b>Danube</b> <b>Commission,</b> a body composed only of the riparian states.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the end of}} 1882, Junimea {{constituted}} {{itself into}} an independent group and was courted by the other political poles. In that context, Carp became Ambassador to the Austrian Court, appointed by the Brătianu cabinet. He mistrusted the Premier's sincerity, but argued: [...] "he cannot back out, everything is directed against Russia and for sure {{things are going to}} stay put for two or three years." [...] His diplomatic skill was invoked in settling a major litigious issue, that of free navigation on the Danube. Brătianu hoped that Carp could persuade the German side in the <b>Danube</b> <b>Commission</b> to vote against the Austrians, allowing Romania to fully control its territorial waters. Carp accomplished his task with unexpected ease.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{upstream}} International <b>Danube</b> <b>Commission</b> {{was undergoing}} similar Nazi-imposed changes. The Reich had {{pulled out of}} the commission in November 1936, with an announcement that it was assuming [...] "full sovereignty" [...] over all German watercourses. After the Anschluss in 1938, Austria's membership also came to a close. Early in 1940, German sources were quoted in the Times that Germany was attempting [...] "through innuendo and informal suggestions" [...] to take over control of the river, and late that year a conference was held in Vienna (then part of the German Reich) to dissolve the upriver commission. A new group, [...] "The Consultative Commission for Danubian Affairs Above Brăila" [...] was instituted, under the chairmanship of Germany, the only nation that had the power to call meetings. Other members were Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Yugoslavia, which nation was later excluded when relations with Germany became strained.|$|E
50|$|In 1861, Felder again {{became a}} member of the Vienna Gemeinderat and also {{obtained}} a seat in the Landtag diet of Lower Austria. He was elected deputy mayor of Vienna in 1863 and head of the Vienna <b>Danube</b> regulation <b>commission</b> in the following year. Also in 1863, he took over the custody of 14-year-old Anton Dreher jr., the son of late Anton Dreher, owner of one of the largest breweries in Europe. Felder mastered this task until Dreher reached majority in 1870.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the ICC arose from {{navigation}} on the Rhine and the <b>Danube</b> (Central <b>Commission</b> for Navigation on the Rhine) {{and the need for}} reassurance that vessel operators were competent to ensure safety of navigation and protection of the environment as they moved from one country to another. As a result, on 29 January 1979, the United Nations Working Party on Inland Water Transport adopted Resolution 14, which recommended the introduction of a European document for an International Certificate (International Card) to provide those assurances.The Resolution was also intended to facilitate 'waterborne tourism'. Until then operators could well have been expected to produce competency certificates for each country whose waters they were on.|$|R
25|$|Zawinul {{also wrote}} a symphony, called Stories of the <b>Danube,</b> which was <b>commissioned</b> by the Brucknerhaus, Linz. It was first {{performed}} {{as part of}} the Linzer Klangwolke (a large-scale open-air broadcast event), for the opening of the 1993 Bruckner Festival in Linz. In its seven movements, the symphony traces the course of the Danube from Donaueschingen through various countries ending at the Black Sea. It was recorded in 1995 by the Czech State Philharmonic Orchestra, Brno, conducted by Caspar Richter.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1871, he was {{appointed}} British representative on the international commission to maintain the navigation of {{the mouth of the}} River Danube, with headquarters at Galatz. Gordon was bored with the work of the <b>Danube</b> <b>commission,</b> and spent as much time as possible exploring the Romanian countryside whose beauty enchanted Gordon when he was not making visits to Bucharest to meet up with his old friend Romolo Gessi who was living there at the time. During his second trip to Romania, Gordon insisted on living with ordinary people as he traveled over the countryside, commenting that Romanian peasants [...] "live like animals with no fuel, but reeds", and spent one night at the home of a poor Jewish craftsman whom Gordon praised for his kindness sharing the single bedroom with his host, his wife and their seven children. Gordon seemed pleased by his simple lifestyle, writing in a letter that: [...] "One night, I slept better than I have for a long time, by a fire in a fisherman's hut".|$|E
60|$|So {{far there}} is much to be said for the Treaty. Freedom of through transit is a not {{unimportant}} part of good international practice and should be established everywhere. The objectionable feature of the Commissions lies in their membership. In each case the voting is so weighted as to place Germany in a clear minority. On the Elbe Commission Germany has four votes out of ten; on the Oder Commission three out of nine; on the Rhine Commission four out of nineteen; on the <b>Danube</b> <b>Commission,</b> which is not yet definitely constituted, she will be apparently in a small minority. On the government of all these rivers France and Great Britain are represented; and on the Elbe for some undiscoverable reason there are also representatives of Italy and Belgium.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the wars}} and unrest, Galați {{developed}} based on trade (especially grain exports). In 1805, France and England established vice-consulates. In 1832, the School of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel is founded. Two years later, in 1834, Austrian ships were having scheduled arrivals and in 1837, Galați was declared a free port (this was revoked in 1882). In 1850, James Buchanan, the U.S. president, sent a vice-consul to Galați and the U.S. opened a consulate in 1858. Galați {{was also a}} trading port for German lands. When the Crimean War (1854-1856) finished, Galați became a seat of the <b>Danube</b> European <b>Commission.</b> In 1869, the Mihai Eminescu municipal park opened and by 1870, factories were opening. By, 1908 they numbered 41. On 13 September 1872, the King Charles I railway station and northern city rail tunnel opened. The River station opened shortly after on 24 September 1880. In 1889, the V.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the Danube delta evolution during the Holocene {{with an emphasis}} on the last three centuries. Detailed descriptions of the physiographic evolution and depositional characteristics of the delta are given on the basis of detailed sedimentological and geomorphological studies. For the recent period (last three centuries) the physiographical changes are highlighted using the most interesting cartographic documents stored in different archives and libraries of European countries and the USA. The main documents used are: the maps of 1771 and 1778, the maps of 1856 - 1857 made by the <b>Danube</b> European <b>Commission</b> (HMSV Medina under the direction of Captain Spratt), the Austrian map of 1918, the Royal Navy Chart of 1926 / 1936, the German map of 1944, the Soviet map of 1983, the Romanian map of 1985, the British Sea Chart of 1999 and the most recent satellite images offered by Google (2004, 2006). Some conclusions on the delta development and on the hydrodynamic and sedimentological laws governing the processes in the delta area, especially at the distributary mouth zones and on the coastal area are given...|$|R
50|$|Lechner {{was born}} and studied {{architecture}} in Pest and later, from 1866, under Karl Bötticher at Berlin's Schinkel Academy. After finishing his studies in Berlin, Lechner departed on a one-year tour and study in Italy. In 1869 he went into a partnership with Gyula Pártos and the architecture firm received {{a steady flow of}} commissions during the boom years of the 1870s, when the construction of buildings lining the ring roads on the Pest side of the <b>Danube</b> occurred. The <b>commissions</b> the partners received were primarily apartment houses in which Lechner worked in the prevailing historicist style, drawing on neo-classical influences from Berlin and the Italian renaissance.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the design}} of Apollodorus of Damascus, Trajan ordered the {{building}} of a massive bridge over the Danube, over which the Roman army was able to cross the river swiftly and in numbers, as well as to send in reinforcements, even in winter when the river was not frozen enough to bear the passage of a party of soldiers. Trajan also reformed the infrastructure of the Iron Gates region of the <b>Danube.</b> He <b>commissioned</b> either the creation or enlargement of the road along the Iron Gates, carved {{into the side of the}} gorge. Additionally, Trajan commissioned a canal to be built around the rapids of the Iron Gates. Evidence of this comes from a marble slab discovered near Caput Bovis, the site of a Roman fort. The slab, dated to the year 101, commemorates {{the building of a}}t least one canal that went from the Kasajna tributary to at least Ducis Pratum, whose embankments were still visible until recently. However, the placement of the slab at Caput Bovis suggests that the canal extended to this point or that there was a second canal downriver of the Kasajna-Ducis Pratum one.|$|R

50|$|The country renewed {{its demands}} in 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference and in 1921 at the Danube Conference. On both instances, it was overruled. Romania changed tactics, but not motives, at the Conference of Lausanne in 1923, when {{affairs of the}} Middle East were discussed. On this occasion, Romania {{suggested}} that {{the powers of the}} CED should be expanded; it would also be given control over the Bosporus and the Dardanelles.Of course the acceptance of this proposal would have meant the end of effective control of the <b>Danube,</b> for the <b>Commission,</b> far from the mouths of the Danube and charged with new tasks, would have hardly been able to fulfill its primary tasks, and the actual control of the Lower Danube would have devolved upon Rumania. wrote Joseph D.

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the two years, {{the powers}} that signed the treaty were to [...] "pronounce the {{dissolution}} of the European Commission", and the so-called [...] "permanent", upstream, IDC was then to extend its supervision to the Lower <b>Danube.</b> The latter <b>commission</b> was supposed to consist of Austria-Hungary, Bavaria, the Sublime Porte (Turkey), Württemberg and the two Danubian principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia). The IDC did draw up an Upper Danubian Navigation Act in November 1857, but it was not accepted multilaterally because of opposition of all the powers except Austria. It was, however, applied to parts of the river by conventions between Austria, Bavaria, and Württemberg. The river-bordering states, Krehbiel stressed in his 1918 article, [...] "were eager to get control of the river into their own hands", but the non-riparian states were [...] "loath to lose control." [...] As a result, the CED was constantly strengthened, and the IDC never came into power, but [...] "was presently abandoned." ...|$|R
