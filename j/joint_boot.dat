25|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} indicates that the baroque bassoon was a newly invented instrument, rather than a simple modification of the old dulcian. The dulcian was not immediately supplanted, but continued to be used well into the 18th century by Bach and others. The man most likely responsible for developing the true bassoon was Martin Hotteterre (d.1712), who may also have invented the three-piece flûte traversière and the hautbois (baroque oboe). Some historians believe that sometime in the 1650s, Hotteterre conceived the bassoon in four sections (bell, bass <b>joint,</b> <b>boot</b> and wing joint), an arrangement that allowed greater accuracy in machining the bore compared to the one-piece dulcian. He also extended the compass down to B by adding two keys. An alternate view maintains Hotteterre {{was one of several}} craftsmen responsible {{for the development of the}} early bassoon. These may have included additional members of the Hotteterre family, as well as other French makers active around the same time. No original French bassoon from this period survives, but if it did, it would most likely resemble the earliest extant bassoons of Johann Christoph Denner and Richard Haka from the 1680s. Sometime around 1700, a fourth key (G♯) was added, and it was for this type of instrument that composers such as Antonio Vivaldi, Bach, and Georg Philipp Telemann wrote their demanding music. A fifth key, for the low E, was added during the first half of the 18th century. Notable makers of the 4-key and 5-key baroque bassoon include J.H. Eichentopf (c. 1678–1769), J. Poerschmann (1680–1757), Thomas Stanesby, Jr. (1668–1734), G.H. Scherer (1703–1778), and Prudent Thieriot (1732–1786).|$|E

Results showed that the daily CO 2 flux was closely related to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), growth stage, soil temperature and rainfall. The average CO 2 flux at different growth stages followed the order <b>jointing</b> and <b>booting</b> > erecting > reviving > heading > wintering > seeding and tillering > grain filling > ripening. The first four stages were carbon sinks, whereas the last four stages were carbon sources. The relationship between nighttime CO 2 flux and air temperature was significant and fitted the index model (y=aebt). The relationship between daytime CO 2 flux and PAR was also significant and fitted the quadratic model (y=ax 2 +bx+c). Moreover, daytime CO 2 flux was significantly correlated with air temperature and PAR at the erecting, <b>jointing</b> and <b>booting,</b> and heading stages. Nighttime CO 2 flux was also significantly correlated with soil temperature at 5 cm depth at the heading as well as <b>jointing</b> and <b>booting</b> stages. The carbon budget in the rain-fed wheat ecosystem was - 401 g C m- 2 yr- 1, which was higher than those in other wheat ecosystems.

Previous studies focused on developing vegetation indices, however limited research exists on modeling algorithms. The emerging Random Forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm is {{regarded as one of}} the most precise prediction methods for regression modeling. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the applicability of the RF regression algorithm for remotely estimating wheat biomass, (2) test the performance of the RF regression model, and (3) compare the performance of the RF algorithm with support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning algorithms for wheat biomass estimation. Single HJ-CCD images of wheat from test sites in Jiangsu province were obtained during the <b>jointing,</b> <b>booting,</b> and anthesis stages of growth. Fifteen vegetation indices were calculated based on these images. In-situ wheat above-ground dry biomass was measured during the HJ-CCD data acquisition. The results showed that the RF model produced more accurate estimates of wheat biomass than the SVR and ANN models at each stage, and its robustness is as good as SVR but better than ANN.

40|$|A {{delay in}} the {{mechanical}} transplantation (MT) of rice seedlings frequently occurs in Huanghuai wheat-rice rotation cropping districts of China, due to the late harvest of wheat, the poor weather conditions and the insufficiency of transplanters, missing the optimum transplanting time and causing seedlings to age. To identify how delaying transplanting rice affects the agronomic characteristics including the growth duration, photosynthetic productivity and dry matter remobilization efficiency and the grain yield under mechanical transplanting pattern, an experiment with a split-plot design was conducted over two consecutive years. The main plot includes two types of cultivation: mechanical transplanting and artificial transplanting (AT). The subplot comprises four japonica rice cultivars. The {{results indicate that the}} rice <b>jointing,</b> <b>booting,</b> heading and maturity stages were postponed under MT when using AT as a control. The tiller occurrence number, dry matter weight per tiller, accumulative dry matter for the population, leaf area index, crop growth rate, photosynthetic potential, and dry matter remobilization efficiency of the leaf under MT significantly decreased compared to those under AT. In contrast, the reduction rate of the leaf area during the heading-maturity stage was markedly enhanced under MT. The numbers of effective panicles and filled grains per panicle and the grain yield significantly decreased under MT. A significant correlation was observed between the dry matter production, remobilization and distribution characteristics and the grain yield. We infer that, as with rice from old seedlings, the decrease in the tiller occurrence, the photosynthetic productivity and the assimilate remobilization efficiency may be important agronomic traits that are responsible for the reduced grain yield under MT...|$|R

30|$|Polychloroprene (CR) is {{commonly}} known as an excellent, versatile synthetic rubber with a variety of industrial application range. It has several advantages like extraordinary oil and fuel resistance, toughness, good adhesion to other materials and high heat resistance up to 100  °C [18]. The commercial application of CR was started in 1932 [19]. CR is available in both dry and latex forms. Dry grades of polychloroprene rubber are normally used in industrial and automotive rubber goods, such as hoses and belts. Latex grades of polychloroprene rubber are used in waterborne adhesives and dipped goods, such as gloves and constant velocity <b>joint</b> <b>boots.</b> Several studies have been reported on the incredible property improvement of CR nanocomposites in the presence of different types of nano filler [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Das et al. [18] studied the effect of surface-modified filler on CR-based nanocomposites with two different types of clay materials, namely montmorillonite (MMT) and layered double hydroxide (LDH). It was observed that organic modification improves the reinforcing efficiency of MMT in a greater extent than that of LDH [18]. Das et al. [20] explained an approach of compatibilization between polychloroprene (CR) and ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) using nano clay as a compatibilizer as well as strong reinforcing filler. The remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of CR nanocomposites in the presence of ionic liquid modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was reported by Subramaniam et al. [21]. This was mainly due to the fine dispersion of modified MWCNTs within the CR matrix [21]. Very recently, Fahma et al. [23] elucidated that excellent improvement in the mechanical properties of CR was observed due to the introduction of a small amount of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) into the CR matrix. Moreover, most of the studies in the literature have reported fantastic property improvement of CR nanocomposites based on either MWCNTs or nano clay as nano filler. But, the vast study on nano CaCO 3 -filled CR composites is still very scanty.|$|R

Development of wheat genotypes were measured at five phenological growth stages (tillering, <b>jointing,</b> <b>booting,</b> heading and maturity) and correlation of growth indices (30, 45, 60 and 75 DAS) were also estimated against final grain yield. Phenological {{development study}} measured early tillering in drought stressed plots, while at maximum, 31 days were taken to complete tillering stage. Days to complete 50 % heading and physiological crop maturity were the most susceptible growth stages {{that resulted in a}} reduction of 31 - 72 % in number of days to complete these growth stages.

December sowing mitigated the drought and delayed plantation effects by producing superior growth and yield (2162 kg ha- 1) at severe drought stress. The genotype Fsd- 08 and L- 7096 recorded the minimum plant height (36 cm) and the shortest growth cycle (76 days) for January plantation with 50 % FC.

Asymmetric warming during the early growth periods of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) profoundly affects vegetative growth and post-anthesis grain productivity, but the underlying physiological mechanism is still unclear. We conducted field experiments from 2012 to 2014 using two wheat cultivars, namely, Yangmai- 13 (vernal type) and Yannong- 19 (semi-winter type), to investigate the influences of night-warming during the winter (warming by 1. 56 – 1. 67 °C from tillering to jointing) or during the spring (warming by 1. 78 – 1. 92 °C from <b>jointing</b> to <b>booting)</b> on post-anthesis physiological activities and grain-filling processes. Both night-warming treatments enhanced the source activity by increasing flag leaf area, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic capability in both cultivars compared with those of the control. The night-warming treatments caused an increase in the antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase, and catalase (CAT) in the flag leaves of both cultivars, while ROS contents such as superoxide anion radical (O 2 •−) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) decreased. Moreover, the expression levels of Rubisco activase B (RcaB), major chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (Cab), chloroplast Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), and CAT genes were upregulated at anthesis and were associated with higher photosynthetic capacity and antioxidant activities. Furthermore, night-warming improved sink activities by increasing the concentrations of grain indole- 3 -acetic acid and cytokinins as well as the sucrose synthase activity for both cultivars. Winter night-warming showed greater potential for improving source strength and grain filling, with consistent performance in both cultivars compared with that of spring night-warming. We concluded form these results that night-warming can improve source and sink capacities in winter wheat, and winter night-warming has greater advantages in this respect than does spring warming...|$|R

The initial study expanded to 44 original bassoons and 14 reproductions. Original makers included Scherer, Poerschmann and Eichentopf. Multiple bassoons by five makers were compared and measurable differences between period and contemporary makers were noted. Unique to woodwinds, dimensional measurements determining pitch allowed an exhaustive study comparing 47 temperaments selected from English, French, German and Italian temperaments of the 18 th and early 19 th centuries. Sensitivity was enhanced by including forked fingerings, E-flat and B-flat. For each instrument results indicated a grouping of 5 - 7 preferred temperaments, typically mean-tone. Preferred temperaments exhibited a correlation with region and maker. Pitch differences by note for every temperament was evaluated for each bassoon. The model demonstrated the proficiency of 18 th century bassoon makers. It is also predictive. In about 25 % of the instruments, minor {{changes to the}} wing joint result in a significantly improved designer bassoon. The model also illustrates bassoon evolution leading to changes in mid- 19 th century bassoons...|$|R
5000|$|The {{left thumb}} alone {{operates}} nine keys. B1, B1, C1, D1, D4, C4 (also B4), two keys when combined create A4, and the whisper key. Additional notes {{can be created}} with these keys. The D1 and bottom key above whisper key on the tenor joint creates both C2 and C3. The same bottom tenor-joint key is also used, with additional fingering setup on the instrument, to create E4 and F4. D4 and C4 together create C4. When the two keys on the tenor joint to create A4 are used with slightly altered fingering on the <b>boot</b> <b>joint,</b> B4 is created. The whisper key is used throughout the instrument's register, along with other fingerings, to produce either a more muted or more piercing sound. The right thumb operates four keys. The top lever, which is very thin, is used to produce B2 and B3, and is used in B4, C4, D4, F4, and E4. The large, circular key (otherwise known as the [...] "pancake key"), is used in mostly the bass register. From B1 to E1, it is held constantly. It is also used, like the whisper key, in additional fingerings for muting the sound. For example, in Ravel's [...] "Boléro", the bassoon is asked to play the ostinato on G4. This is easy to perform with the normal fingering for G4, but with the E1 key (pancake key). The next key operated by the right thumb {{is known as the}} [...] "spatula key". Its primary use is to produce F1 and F2. The bottom key is used the least often. With the combination of the backmost key of the right hand little finger it produces A1 and A2. This is most advantageous in pieces like Dukas's [...] "The Sorcerer's Apprentice". The four fingers of the left hand can each be used in at least two different positions, three {{in the case of the}} index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E4. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player can lift the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the finger down, so the key remains closed, but the hole is open. The middle finger typically stays on the centre hole on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E4 and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a Polisi Artist bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C1. The upper key is used for E1, E3, F3, F3, A4, B4, B4, C4, C4, and D4. The four fingers of the right hand have at least one assignment each. The index finger stays over one hole, except when E4 is played. A side key at the top of the boot is used. The middle finger remains stationary over the hole with a ring around it. The ring, with other pads, are lifted when the smallest finger on the right hands pushes a lever. The ring finger typically remains stationary on the lower ring-finger key. However, the upper ring-finger key can be used in place of the top thumb key on the front of the <b>boot</b> <b>joint.</b> The smallest finger operates three keys. The backmost one, closest to the bassoonist, is held down throughout most of the bass register. The key is not used after F1 is played. F2 is created with this key, as well as G4, B4, B4, and C4. The lowest key for the smallest finger on the right hand is primarily used for A1 and 2, but can be used E4, and F4. The frontmost key is used with the bottom thumb key on the <b>boot</b> <b>joint</b> to create A1 and A2.|$|R
40|$|In 2008 to 2010, {{the effects}} of postponing N {{application}} on wheat grain yield and process quality were studied in low-yield field in Jianghan Plain in wheat. The results were as follows. When the Topdressing fertilizer N (TN) was postponed from tilling stage to jointing stage, the biomass and the SPAD value in flag leaf reduced, respectively. And grain yield, protein content in grain and stability time of paste, reduced as a result. When the topdressing fertilizer N was postponed from <b>jointing</b> stage to <b>booting</b> stage, the regularity of above index changed conversely. For the treatments with the same topdressing fertilizer date (jointing stage), the appropriate ratio of Basal dressing fertilizer (BN) to topdressing fertilizer was 3 : 7, with high biomass, high SPAD value in flag leaf, high grain yield and high process quality as a result. The results also indicated that the right stage for more N in organ vegetative {{to be transferred to}} grain was jointing stage and the right ratio of BN to TN was 3 : 7, which was the very basis for high nitrogen fertilizer utilization. Based on the above results, it was suggested that to gain high grain yield and high process quality the appropriate date for topdressing fertilizer N in low-yield field in Jianghan Plain was jointing stage and the ratio of BN to TN was 3 : 7...|$|R
40|$|Lodging {{is one of}} the {{constraints}} that limit wheat yields and quality due to the unexpected bending or breaking stems on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production worldwide. In addition to choosing lodging resistance varieties, husbandry practices also {{have a significant effect on}} lodging. Nitrogen management {{is one of the}} most common and efficient methods. A field experiment with Yangmai 20 as research material (a widely-used variety) was conducted to study the effects of different nitrogen levels and ratios on culm morphological, anatomical characters and chemical components and to explore the nitrogen application techniques for lodging tolerance and high yield. Results showed that some index of basal internodes, such as stem wall thickness, filling degree, lignin content, cellulose content, water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) and WSC/N ratio, were positively and significantly correlated with culm lodging-resistant index (CLRI). As the increase of nitrogen level and basal nitrogen ratio, the basal internodes became slender and fragile with the thick stem wall, while filling degree, chemical components and the strength of the stem decreased gradually, which significantly increased the lodging risk. The response of grain yield to nitrogen doses was quadratic and grain yield reached the highest at the nitrogen ratio of 50 %: 10 %: 20 %: 20 % (the ratio of nitrogen amount applied before sowing, at tillering stage, <b>jointing</b> stage and <b>booting</b> stage respectively, abbreviated as 5 : 1 : 2 : 2). These results suggested that for Yangmai 20, the planting density of 180 × 104 ha- 1, nitrogen level of 225 kg ha- 1, and the ratio of 5 : 1 : 2 : 2 effectively increased lodging resistance and grain yield. This combination of planting density and nitrogen level and ratio could effectively relieve the contradiction between high-yielding and anti-lodging...|$|R
40|$|The {{four main}} crops {{produced}} in the Texas High Plains {{have been the subject}} of water management research for several decades by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and the USDA/Agricultural Research Service. As expected, experimental results for yield and water use efficiency have varied for these four major crops, but many common principles have likewise emerged from this research. Definite improvements in water use efficiency have been made, and widespread application of these management principles is underway. Limited irrigation is now being widely practiced on drought tolerant crops that take advantage of expected rainfall. A 30 -day period of fairly reliable rainfall occurs from mid-May through mid-June which coincides with sorghum and cotton planting and follows typical corn planting. Sorghum has good ability to adjust to water stress. Sorghum grain requires 13 to 24 inches (330 - 610 mm) of seasonal water use (evapotranspiration) from precipitation, stored soil moisture and irrigation to achieve 3, 000 to 6, 700 pounds per acre (3, 400 - 7, 500 kg/ha) of grain sorghum yield. Dryland sorghum yields average about 1, 600 pounds per acre (1, 800 kg/ha), and yields up to 3, 000 pounds per acre (3, 400 kg/ha) are not uncommon. Peak water use rate is about 0. 30 inches per day (7. 6 mm/day). Irrigations should be timed to avoid water stress during periods of peak water use [...] boot, heading and flowering stages [...] to achieve reasonably good yields and maximum irrigation water use efficiency. Two well-timed seasonal irrigations of 4 inches (100 mm) per irrigation or the equivalent are adequate in normal years for good yields of medium maturity hybrids. Preplant irrigation is often not needed, and the same amount of water may be more efficiently used if applied at later stages of crop growth especially for conventional graded furrow irrigation systems. Conservation tillage can reduce the need for preplant irrigation of sorghum through improved soil moisture storage. Irrigation water use efficiencies may reach 400 - 500 pounds per acre-inch (1. 8 - 2. 2 kg/m 3) with limited but well-timed irrigations as compared to about 200 - 250 pounds per acre-inch (0. 88 - 1. 10 kg/m^ 3) with adequate irrigation. Saving irrigation water by withholding a 4 -inch (100 mm) irrigation reduces sorghum grain yields by only about 10 percent during the early 6 - 8 leaf stage but by almost 50 percent if withheld at the heading and bloom stage. : Corn is much more sensitive to water stress than sorghum, wheat or cotton. Corn is planted earlier than sorghum which typically allows more efficient use of the May-June wet season than for sorghum. However, early planting dates required for corn increases the need for preplant irrigation for stand establishment. Moisture stress caused by low soil water availability or hot, dry conditions during the flowering (tasseling, silking and pollination) stage can severely restrict corn yield. Preplant irrigation is often necessary, and 3 or 4 seasonal irrigations of 4 -inch (100 mm) each are essential for high corn yields in most years in the Texas High Plains. Drought seasons require one or two additional irrigations. Reduced irrigation of corn has generally resulted in significant yield decreases. Irrigation water use efficiency values are usually 250 - 450 pounds per acre-inch (1. 1 - 2. 0 kg/m^ 3) with adequate irrigation, although peak IWUE values of 500 pounds per acre-inch (2. 2 kg/m^ 3) or more have been obtained with limited irrigation in good rainfall seasons. Center pivot irrigation allows frequent irrigations of 1 to 1. 5 inches (25 - 38 mm) during peak water use periods on corn. The total seasonal water use (ET) for corn to achieve any grain yield is about 13 inches (330 mm), while seasonal ET's for peak yields are around 28 - 32 inches per year (710 - 810 mm). Peak ET rates are 0. 3 - 0. 4 inches per day (8 - 10 mm/day), depending upon weather conditions. Planned water deficits into the stress range are feasible only on soils with moderate to high water storage and during the early vegetative or grain ripening stages. Reduced acreage, rather than reduced irrigation, offers the primary way to adjust corn irrigation to limited water supplies. Winter wheat is a major drought tolerant crop with a 9 -month growing season. Wheat grows vegetatively during the drier fall to early spring period and develops grain during a period of increasing spring rainfall. Wheat is normally planted around October 1 and requires available 8011 moisture for germination and early growth, plus perhaps one late fall irrigation followed by 2 to 3 spring irrigations for good production. About one additional early irrigation (and additional applied fertilizer) is needed for early planted wheat that is grazed and also managed for grain production. Seasonal water use is around 26 to 28 inches (660 - 710 mm) for wheat (grain only) yielding 4, 700 - 5, 800 pounds per acre, or 85 - 100 bushels per acre (5, 270 - 6, 500 kg/ha). The highest yield response to irrigation usually occurs during <b>jointing</b> and <b>boot</b> stages (a relatively low rainfall period), during which irrigation water use efficiency values of about 230 pounds per acre-inch (1. 0 kg/m^ 3) are realized from a 4 inch (100 mm) irrigation. Spring irrigations totaling 4 to 12 inches (100 - 305 mm) have resulted in good irrigation water use efficiencies above 170 pounds per acre-inch (0. 75 kg/m^ 3). The least efficient irrigation is during grain filling, where IWUE values have been less than 115 pounds per acre-inch (0. 51 kg/m^ 3), and is associated with increased rainfall. Short wheat varieties in recent tests have exhibited 50 percent higher irrigation water use efficiency values than tall wheat varieties in earlier tests. Wheat yields have been increased in some experiments using no-till, limited tillage, or furrow diking as compared to conventional tillage. Cotton is a drought-tolerant long-season crop that lends itself to limited irrigation despite a somewhat complicated pattern of water use, deficits, and application. Cotton is the major irrigated crop on the Texas High Plains and is second to Wheat in dryland production acreage. Widespread production under limited irrigation has major impact on water demands and the state's water budget. Production, placement, and retention of fruiting sites are sensitive to soil water status. Early fruit set is important. Under dryland conditions, expected lint yields are in the range of 250 to 300 pounds per acre (280 - 336 kg/ha). Cotton requires over 13 inches (330 mm) of seasonal water use to produce good yields, and maximum yields occur at about 27 inches (685 mm) of seasonal water use. High water levels can decrease lint yield through excessive vegetative development and fall immaturity. A preplant irrigation of 4 -inches (100 mm) is usually advantageous especially if spring rainfall is not excessive, but heavier preplant irrigations are not warranted. Cotton has the ability to overcome moisture stress at most growth stages, but the growing season length may not accomodate late-season regrowth. The most critical period for irrigation is early to mid-bloom. If available, a second irrigation should be applied at peak to late bloom. The irrigation cut off date for cotton is mid- to late August. For irrigated cotton, yield results generally favor narrow-row with high plant populations. Irrigation water use efficiencies for cotton have ranged from as little as 20 - 30 pounds per acre-inch (0. 09 - 0. 13 kg/m^ 3) for full irrigation to as high as 80 - 100 pounds per acre-inch (0. 35 - 0. 44 kg/m^ 3) for two well-timed furrow irrigations (preplant and peak bloom) in some experiments. A reasonable target for limited furrow irrigation appears to be 50 pounds per acre-ineh (0. 22 kg/m^ 3). Cotton Irrigated with LEPA Sand drip systems produced around 90 pounds lint per acre-inch (0. 40 kg/m^ 3). Land leveling on slopes of 0. 5 percent or greater have increased yields by more than 100 pounds lint per acre (110 kg/m^ 3) for both furrow irrigated and dryland cotton...|$|R

The {{origin of}} the railway systems is {{considerably}} old. In very old times, {{it is known that}} people were carrying heavy freights by the similar way in concept to railway transportation. From history to present day, there have been significant improvements in the rail system. With the industrial revolution and the appearance of motor vehicles together with the rapid population growth, the need of railway transportation gradually increased and that demands resulted in modern railway establishment. Today, maglev trains have been exceeded 500 km/h speed but this type of railway transportation is not in public use yet. Only one line of maglev train in China known in service carrying passengers with high-speed (maximum velocity is 430 km/h).   On the other hand, conventional rapid trains recently have reached over 300 km/h velocity. These rapid trains nowadays have significant share of transportation in the world. Thanks to all these developments, the railway transportation has been taking more important place in human life. To fulfill the increased demands, many types of railway systems have been implementing and more passengers have been benefiting from railway transportation day by day. Therefore, to provide a secure and comfortable transportation system concurrently with favorable cost, railway track design becomes more prominent. In this study, 2 nd chapter explains conventional railway and the layers of the railway track by giving technical properties. The layers that form the track superstructure are the formation, sub-ballast, ballast, geotextile, frost protection layer. Since the topic of this study is a ballastless track design, sub-ballast and ballast layers are not explained here. Add to this, brief information about sub-base soil condition is given. Besides, according to UIC Code, formation layer thickness has been shown by table depending on the different types of soil quality class.   Types of slab track systems used worldwide and their cross-section properties are also briefly shown together with figures of cross section properties. Some of these balastless tracks have been examined more detailed and their advantages are introduced in general. Lots of different balasstless track systems have been classified in a table and the advantages of ballastless track systems are given in general. In the 3 rd chapter, the components of the cast in-situ slab track system which are rail, fasteners, sleepers and concrete plate or plinth beams are examined and the components of these in worldwide use are classified and introduced. Rail types are described as flange rail, double headed rail and Vignol rail. Technical properties of the rail types briefly given and the specification, features that they should have and information about pros and cons of these elements explained. Rail fasteners systems are described as two types, rigid system fasteners and elastic system fasteners. The features of these types of fasteners are shown together with figures. After that sleepers defined under the titles of wooden, steel, concrete and plastic sleepers. Some types of the sleepers that tried and currently being used in the world explained. In concrete sleeper title, post-stressed and pre-stressed concrete sleepers have been described. In this chapter we also give some information about plinth concrete beam and explain the measures must be taken during its construction stage briefly. In the 4 th chapter, a type of slab track systems LVT has been chosen and explained in more detail. Here we also mentioned about ground born noise and vibration mitigation which has an inspiration to choosing LVT slab track. Some measures that should be taken for special buildings such as hospital and theater are given. Besides this, LVT systems features and advantages are explained. In 5 th chapter, design of railway superstructure with an example of LVT system has been explained. At first, we explain how the wheel loads are transferred from top (rail) to sub-base showing modeling of railway superstructure in figure. Slab track modeling has springs between the layers that form the superstructure. From bottom to top, first springs take place under the rigid concrete slab which represents the soil elasticity. Since we examined LVT system here, second spring is between rigid slab and LVT concrete block so called block pad as explained in chapter 4 and the third spring for modeling takes place under the rail representing rail pad stiffness. This type of modeling can also be seen in figure.   In chapter 5 we also introduce the forces which effect railway superstructure. Forces studied under the titles of vertical forces, horizontal forces, temperature stresses and other forces and technical information about these forces are given. Vertical forces investigated under two titles, static and dynamic vertical forces. As for the horizontal forces, they are shown under two titles either as the forces acting parallel to longitudinally direction of railway superstructure and forces acting perpendicular direction to the railway. In temperature stresses section, the calculation of forces emanating from temperature has been given by equation depending on unit length change and temperature change. Railway roadway design is performed assuming that railway is a beam laid on elastic platform, and therefore, determination of soil type and coefficient of soil stiffness or soil spring value is important. Here in chapter 5, we give information about calculation of coefficient of soil stiffness in light of Winkler and Zimmermann’s equations. For obtain one soil coefficient of stiffness when multi-layer case is subject, Eisenmann’s equivalent layers theory has been used and introduced by the help of a figure and the calculation of this method has been explained. Another coefficient used for superstructure static analyses is dynamic impact factor. Today many types of calculation method developed for taking into consideration of the impact of dynamic forces acting on railway. In this study we used Eisenmann’s equations for the speed until 200 km/h.   5 th chapter also explain the analyses and concrete slab design calculation for LVT system under different vehicle loads. The loads chosen here have been taken from UIC and EN 1991 standards. For freight train maximum speed taken as 100 km/h. As for the passenger train and high-speed train maximum speed taken as 120 km/h and 250 km/h respectively. Load Model 71 from UIC is used for freight train. For passenger and high speed train, type- 2 and type- 3 load model from EN 1991 has been used. It should be kept in mind that there is much more different type of load models depending on vehicle style. For analysis, FEA base computer program SAP 2000 has been preferred. This program allows engineers to model almost every type of structure realistically. To model LVT system in the program, modeling technique of which illustration is given by figure in chapter 5 has been used. Rail pad which take place under the rails at <b>joints</b> and rubber <b>boot</b> and LVT block pad represented by springs. Here LVT concrete block pad and the rubber boot which contains the block thought together and their stiffness combined calculating an equivalent spring coefficient.   Soil condition considered as good and class of the subbase soil taken as QS 3 according to soil classification of UIC Code. In the model soil represented with springs either. Slab area that considered here a bearing beam laid on elastic platform divided into small finite elements for analysis. The analysis results are shown in figures as contours diagram and concrete design has been performed using the longitudinally and transverse moment values. There might be lots of soil types and geometrical properties on the route of railway track. Thus, quite a lot different conditions may be needed to take into account. In this study the chosen part is regarded as an alignment and calculation is performed accordingly. In final section we explained our assessments and thoughts about the results of the study.
