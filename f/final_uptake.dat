40|$|It is {{now clear}} that {{cerebrospinal}} fluid [CSF, produced by the choroid plexi (CP) ] plays a fundamental role in brain pathophysiology and neurodegenerative processes. However, the CP's functional activity has only been studied in vitro. This article presents a new approach for studying the CP and the CSF with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Ten elderly, non-neurological patients underwent a 45 -min, dynamic FDG-PET acquisition with scheduled 34 time frames. Our method provided successive images representing the FDG uptake dynamics, with calculation of three parameters of an exponential fitting function for the 34 frames and every voxel in the brain volume. Regions of interest in the CSF and CP were manually selected on the reconstructed map, and mean raw FDG uptake curves were reconstructed. We have monitored the kinetics of FDG uptake by the CP and the CSF during PET acquisition. The FDG kinetics in the CP differs markedly from those seen in the CSF and all other brain tissues. In our study population, the CP's <b>final</b> <b>uptake</b> intensity was significantly greater than that of the CSF. This work is an initial step toward using PET to evaluate CP functions in vivo...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:The {{elementary}} {{diagnostic method}} for the de-tection of lymph circulation abnormalities in extremities is lym-phoscintigraphy. This method {{provides information on}} the mor-phology and function of the lymphatic system. However, there are no generally acceptable standards for lymphoscintigraphy, which makes judgment of its clinical usefulness very difficult. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this work, a discussion is pre-sented on the usefulness of static qualitative scintigraphy of the lymphatic system of lower extremities {{as well as of}} its quantita-tive interpretation, depending upon: (1) time measurement of radiopharmaceutical transport in the system, and (2) assess-ment of its regional uptake in lymph nodes. The effectiveness of visual assessment combined with each of the quantitative evalu-ations mentioned is also presented. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Combination of visual evaluation of stat-ic scintigraphy with each of the listed quantitative procedures im-proves the sensitivity of lymphoscintigraphy in the diagnosis of lym-phatic oedema of lower extremities without affecting the specificity of visual evaluation. Both combined methods are characterized by similar indices of diagnostic efficacy. This enables limitation of the quantitative evaluation of lymphatic scintigraphy to the measure-ment of the <b>final</b> <b>uptake</b> of RPh in the inguinal lymphatic nodes...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen in slit-like carbon nanopores at 77 K {{represents}} a quantum fluid in strong confinement. We have used path-integral grand canonical Monte Carlo and classical grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations {{for the investigation}} of the "quantumness" of hydrogen at 77 K adsorbed in slit-like carbon nanopores up to 1 MPa. We find that classical simulations overpredict the hydrogen uptake in carbon nanopores due to neglect of the quantum delocalization. Such disagreement of both simulation methods depends on the slit-like carbon pore size. However, the differences between the <b>final</b> <b>uptakes</b> of hydrogen computed from both classical and quantum simulations are not large due to a similar effective size of quantum/classical hydrogen molecules in carbon nanospaces. For both types of molecular simulations, the volumetric density of stored energy in optimal carbon nanopores exceeds 6. 4 MJ dm(- 3) (i. e., 45 kg m(- 3); Department of Energy target for 2010). In contrast to the hydrogen adsorption isotherms, we found a large reduction of isosteric enthalpy of adsorption computed from the quantum Feynman 2 ̆ 7 s path-integral simulations in comparison to the classical values at 77 K and pressures up to 1 MPa. Depression of the quantum isosteric enthalpy of adsorption depends on the slit-like carbon pore size.

40|$|Objectives: (1) To compare an {{interactive}} multimedia decision aid (IMDA) with a leaflet {{and a video}} to give information about prenatal screening for Down syndrome and (2) to determine the women's acceptance of IMDA. Methods: Two hundred and one women were recruited from the prenatal clinic of a university teaching hospital and randomised into the intervention group (IMDA, video, and information leaflet) or the control group (video and information leaflet). Results: There {{were no significant differences}} in the initial decision for and the <b>final</b> <b>uptake</b> of the prenatal screening test between the control and intervention groups. The proportion of women who were undecided was less than 10 % in both groups. Of the women in the intervention group, 86. 6 % and 78. 9 % agreed that IMDA was user-friendly and acceptable, respectively. Significantly more women aged = 35 (68. 3 %) (P = 0. 030), but the logistic regression analysis did not confirm this finding after adjusting for other factors (computer knowledge and usage of computer). Conclusion: The use of IMDA did not affect the women's overall uptake rate of the prenatal screening test for Down syndrome. More women less than 35 years accepted IMDA probably because they used computer more frequently and had more computer knowledge.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{characterized}} the binding of multilamellar colloids to J 774 cells. Cationic colloids {{were shown to}} bind much more efficiently than neutral ones. Particle uptake by cells was followed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of the kinetics of uptake of cationic particles indicated that binding on the cell surface occurred with two characteristic times. Analysis of the dissociation properties allowed discriminating between several alternative models for adsorption and led us to propose a mechanism that involved two independent classes of binding sites on the cell surface. One class of sites appeared to be governed by a classic mass action law describing a binding equilibrium. The other sites were populated irreversibly by particles made of 10 % cationic lipids. This was observed {{in the absence of}} endocytosis, under conditions where both the equilibrium and the irreversible binding occurred at the cell surface. We determined the rate constants for the different steps. We found that the reversible association occurred with a characteristic time of the order of tens of seconds, whereas the irreversible binding took a hundred times longer. The presence of serum proteins in the incubation medium did not drastically affect the <b>final</b> <b>uptake</b> of the particles. In contrast, the capture of the particles by cells significantly dropped when the fraction of positively charged lipids contained in the colloids was decreased from 10 % to 5 %. Finally, the results will be discussed within a comprehensive model where cationic particles find labile binding sites in the volume of the pericellular network (glycocalyx and extracellular matrix) and less-accessible irreversible binding sites at the cell membrane itself...|$|E
40|$|A novel calcium looping (CaL) process {{integrated}} with a spent bleaching clay (SBC) treatment is proposed whereby fuels and/or heat from regeneration of SBC provide extra {{energy for the}} calcination process, in addition, the regenerated SBC {{can be used to}} synthesize enhanced CaO-based sorbents. Different kinds of composite samples were prepared with the regenerated SBC and/or aluminate cement at various doping ratios via a pelletization process. All pellets were subjected to thermogravimetic analyzer tests employing severe reaction conditions to determine the optimal doping ratios and regeneration method for the SBC based sorbents. These results demonstrate that pellets containing combustible components showed higher CO 2 uptakes, due to the improved pore structure, which was verified by N 2 adsorption measurements. The as-prepared sorbent “L- 10 PC” (90  wt. % CaO/ 10  wt. % pyrolytic SBC) achieved a final CO 2 uptake of 0. 164  g(CO 2) g(calcined sorbent) − 1 after 20 cycles, which was 67. 3 % higher than that of natural limestone particle. A new larnite (Ca 2 SiO 4) phase was detected by X-ray diffraction analysis, however the weak diffraction peak associated with it indicated a low content of larnite in the pellets, which produced a smaller effect on performance compared to cement. A synergistic effect was achieved for a sample designated as “L- 5 PC- 10 CA” (85  wt. % CaO/ 5  wt. % pyrolytic SBC / 10  wt. % cement), which resulted in the highest <b>final</b> <b>uptake</b> of 0. 208  g(CO 2) g(calcined sorbent) − 1 after 20 cycles.

These ionic plasticizers were shown to allow a more efficient melting of native starch in both processes. The investigation of macromolecular structure changes during processing shows that this efficiency can be ascribed to a starch chain scission mechanism, resulting in lower specific mechanical energy input need for starch thermoplasticization compared to glycerol plasticized starch.

Design: Randomized controlled trial. Participants: All those with type 1 or 2 diabetes from 2 clinics were recruited. Intervention: Diabetic retinopathy screening {{with a small}} copayment versus free access in a publicly funded family medicine service. Main Outcome Measures: Uptake of screening and severity of DR detected. Association between these outcome variables and independent variables were determined using multivariate logistic regression models and reported as odds ratios (ORs). Results: After randomization, 1387 subjects in the free group and 1379 subjects in the pay group were eligible for screening, and 94. 9 % (1316 / 1387) and 92. 6 % (1277 / 1379), respectively, {{agreed to participate in}} the study. The offer of screening was accepted by 94. 8 % (1247 / 1316) in the free group and 91. 2 % (1164 / 1277) in the pay group, and the <b>final</b> <b>uptake</b> ratios were 88. 5 % (1165 / 1316) and 82. 4 % (1052 / 1277), respectively (Pearson chi = 19. 74, P< 0. 001). Being in the pay group was associated with a lower uptake of screening than being in the free group (OR, 0. 59; confidence interval [CI], 0. 47 - 0. 74) and a lower detection rate of DR (OR, 0. 73; CI, 0. 60 - 0. 90) after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Subjects with higher socioeconomic status were more likely to attend screening and had a lower prevalence of DR detected. Conclusions: The inverse care law seems to operate in a preventive intervention when a relatively small copayment is applied. There is a case for making effective preventive services free of charge.

40|$|A microsorbent with {{magnetic}} properties {{has been successfully}} synthesized {{by means of the}} deposition of manganese dioxide onto magnetite particles. For the physicochemical characterization of the synthesized magnetic microsorbent different measurements were carried out. Magnetic properties were determined by means of an altemating gradient magnetometer (AGM). The specific surface area was determined based on BET theory. Further information about composition and morphology was gathered by the use of an environmental scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (ESEM/EDAX). By means of microelectrophoresis measurements of the zeta potential of the particle surface were carried out. The results showed, that the resulting microsorbents have a particle size between 0. 5 and 18 μm. Magnetization ofthe material is between 41 and 75 Am 2 /kg, in the arder ofmagnitude of that of magnetite. Therefore efficient solid-liquid separation by means of the application of a modera te magnetic field is possible. Due to the properties of Mn 02 the point of zero charge of the surface was found to be clase to 3. Therefore, the adsorbent is almost exclusively a cation exchanger although sorption of oxyanions is also possible. Sorption experiments were carried out and evaluated by means of the Langmuir and Freundlich relationships. The influence of pH, competitive sorption, and complexing ligands was studied. Results of the equi librium experiments canied out with Cd 2 +, Ni 2 +, and Pb 2 + ions, showed that the sorption process was highly dependent on the pH of the solution and the uptake of heavy metal ions is preferred against the sorption of other cations. Sorption of alkaline earth ions such as Ca 2 + affects the uptake only at high concentrations. Other ions such as chloride ions affect also the uptake dueto changcs in the metal ion speciations. Kinetic experiments were carried out in batch systems. The sorption kinetics was evaluated by means of four models; film diffusion, Lagergren or pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and the Elovich model. It was found, that the film diffusion model can successfully describe the sorption kinetics and in conjunction with the equilibrium parameters, the sorption at determined conditions can be modeled well. Beca use of the small size of the particles and the respective large specific surface, sorption is fast. It was observed that within the first 10 minutes around 90 % of the <b>final</b> <b>uptake</b> takes place and sorption equilibrium was reached within one hour. Besides the experiments with heavy metal cations, kinetic and equilibrium sorption experiments with the oxyanion MoO 42 - were carried out. It was found that the sorption of oxyanions onto the magnetic microsorbent was possible too. As well as for the metal ions the sorption process was fast and highly dependent on the pH of the solution. On the basis of the results the order of sorption capacity was found to be: Pb 2 + > Ni 2 + > Cd 2 + >> MoO 42. Finally, results of consecutive sorption-desorption cycles demonstrated that the magnetic microsorbent can be recycled, although the sorption capacity drops considerably within the first few cycles. Nevertheless, the high selectivity for bivalent heavy metal ions makes the synthesized microsorbents an interesting alternative to conventional ion exchangers.

40|$|Seed {{reserves}} {{are the primary}} source of mineral nutrients for early seedling development. ?Nutrient seed priming? is a technique in which seeds are soaked in nutrient solution and subsequently dried back to initial moisture content for storage. It is an efficient approach to increase seed nutrient contents along with priming effects to improve seed quality, germination speed and seedling establishment. Various abiotic stresses, such as sub-optimal temperature, drought, submergence and soil pH extremes can seriously affect seedling establishment and nutrient acquisition at early growth stages. This thesis focused on the role and contribution of nutrient seed priming in plant growth and nutritional status in maize and soybean under conditions of limited nutrient availability and low root-zone temperature. Protocols for nutrient seed priming with Zn, Mn, Zn+Mn, B and P were optimised for application in maize and soybean seeds (B and P priming in maize only). Optimum priming durations of 24 h (maize) and 12 h (soybean) were identified for both plant species but in instead of submerging seeds in priming solutions slow imbibition between filter papers was essential for soybean to minimise development of abnormal seedlings to avoid imbibition damage. Nutrient concentrations were calculated according to water uptake to double the natural seed reserves of the respective micronutrients and 50 % increase in phosphorus. However, <b>final</b> <b>uptake</b> of the micronutrients was generally much higher (+ 500 - 1000 %) while it was lower for P (+ 20 %). In case of soybean this could be attributed to a high Zn and Mn binding capacity of the seed coat, which adsorbed up to 60 % of the primed nutrients. Particularly, Zn and Zn+Mn priming stimulated plant growth in hydroponic culture systems and to a lower extent also on a soil with low availability of P, Zn and Fe. This was associated with a high shoot translocation of the primed nutrients (Zn and Mn), which was most expressed in the hydroponic culture system. Combined priming treatments with Zn and Mn were usually less effective than Zn priming alone, suggesting an antagonistic interaction. By contrast, mobility of primed B was extremely low and B priming was completely ineffective. In soil culture also P priming moderately increased shoot biomass production by 10 - 20 %. However the efficiency of P priming was largely limited by the high P demand of the plants. Low root zone temperature (RZT) at early spring is a limiting factor for maize production in Central and Northern Europe. Nutrient acquisition, nutrient uptake and particularly root growth are severely affected at low RZT and the consequences of these growth depressions are often not completely compensated until final harvest. Model experiments in hydroponics and soil culture revealed that maize nutrient seed priming with Zn, Mn and Fe is a promising strategy to diminish the deficiency of specific nutrients, such as Zn, Mn and also P and to maintain plant growth under low RZT stress. This was mainly attributed to significantly increased root growth and particularly fine root production in plants grown from nutrient-primed seeds. Improved net photosynthesis of primed plants was mainly related with increased leaf area and preliminary results suggest a higher tolerance to oxidative damage due to increased production of protective phenolics. Two independent field experiments under conditions of suboptimal temperatures during germination and early growth revealed an increase in grain yield of 10 ? 15 % for plants derived from Zn+Mn and Fe primed seeds. This finding demonstrates long-lasting persistence of priming effects. The molecular and physiological mechanisms behind require further investigation. Samenreserven sind die primäre Quelle für die Mineralstoffversorgung während der frühen Keimlingsentwicklung. Nährstoffpriming ist ein methodischer Ansatz, bei dem Saatgut in Mineralstofflösungen vorgequollen und anschließend zur weiteren Lagerung auf Ausgangsfeuchte zurückgetrocknet wird. Hierdurch ist es möglich, neben vorquellungsbedingten Primingeffekten auch die Mineralstoffreserven zur Verbesserung der Saatgutqualität zu erhöhen sowie die Auflauf-Geschwindigkeit und die Keimlingsentwicklung zu verbessern, die durch verschiedenste Stressfaktoren, wie suboptimale Temperaturbedingungen, Trockenheit, Staunässe und pH-Extreme beeinträchtigt werden kann. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Wirkung von Nährstoffpriming auf das Wachstum und den Ernährungsstatus von Mais und Soja unter Bedingungen eingeschränkter Nährstoffverfügbarkeit und niedriger Wurzelraumtemperatur. Für die Saatgutapplikation von Zink (Zn), Mangan (Mn), Mn+Zn, Bor (B), Eisen (Fe) und Phosphat (P) bei Mais und Soja wurden Primingprotokolle entwickelt. Bei beiden Pflanzenarten ergab sich eine optimale Behandlungsdauer von 24 h. Jedoch war es notwendig, das Soja-Saatgut anstelle von submerser Inkubation in den Nährlösungen, langsam in Nährlösungsgetränktem Filterpapier einzuquellen, um die Entwicklung abnormaler Keimlinge aufgrund von Quellungsschäden zu vermeiden. Anhand der Wasseraufnahme der Keinlinge wurden die Nährlösungskonzentrationen so berechnet, das sich nach Einquellen eine Verdopplung der natürlichen Mineralstoffreserven im Samen ergeben sollte. Jedoch wurden für die Mikronährstoffe erheblich höhere Aufnahmeraten gemessen (+ 500 - 1000 %), während die Aufnahme von P geringer war (+ 20 %). Bei Soja konnte gezeigt werden, das die erhöhten Mikronährstoffgehalte auf eine hohe Bindungskapazität der Zwei unabhängige Feldversuche bei suboptimaler Temperatur während der Keimphase und des Jugendwachstums ergaben Kornertragssteigerungen von 10 - 15 % bei Mais nach Saatgutpriming mit Zn+Mn oder Fe.

The phase equilibria of CO 2 (20 %) + N 2 (80 %) + promoter clathrates at different promoter concentrations revealed {{that the presence of}} THF, CP, and TBAC could significantly reduce the clathrate formation pressure. THF solutions provided the highest gas uptake and steepest CO 2 concentration changes in the vapor phase, whereas TBAC solutions showed the highest CO 2 selectivity (∼ 61 %) in the clathrate phase. CP solutions exhibited a slower formation rate, but their <b>final</b> gas <b>uptake</b> and CO 2 selectivity in the clathrate phase were comparable to the THF solutions. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the enclathration of both CO 2 and N 2 in the clathrate cages and a structural transition due to the inclusion of promoters in the clathrate phase. The overall experimental results indicate that TBAC is a viable thermodynamic promoter for clathrate-based CO 2 capture from simulated flue gas, considering the lower pressure requirement for clathrate formation, higher CO 2 enrichment in the clathrate phase, non-toxicity, and non-volatility. clos...|$|R

"Samsun") in {{suspension}} cultures is inhibited {{in the presence}} of 0. 8 mM L-cysteine as sole sulfur source, when inoculated at densities up to 9. 5 mg dry weight. Under these conditions, hydrogen sulfide is emitted in amounts increasing with increasing inoculation densities. An inoculum of 19 mg dry weight, however, enables a moderate growth of the cells (doubling time 178 h) while reducing the emission of hydrogen sulfide. Feeding of 0. 4 mM L-leucine to the suspension did not only reduce hydrogen sulfide emission at all inoculation densities applied; it also caused exponential growth (doubling time 110 h) at inoculation densities of 9. 5 mg and upwards. Initial and final rate of growth of tobacco cells supplied with L-cysteine as sulfur source increased, hydrogen sulfide emission decreased with increasing L-leucine concentrations in the medium.

Imposition of a transmembrane pH gradient (pHo less than pH 1) markedly accelerated the uptake of [14 C]urate and [3 H]PAH and caused the transient accumulation ("overshoot") of each anion above its <b>final</b> level of <b>uptake.</b> The transport of urate and PAH under both stimulated (pHo less than pHi) and basal (pHo = pHi) conditions was insensitive to valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potentials. The pH gradient-stimulated uptake of 25 microM [14 C]urate and 1. 0 microM [3 H]PAH was significantly inhibited by 1. 2 mM PAH, urate, furosemide, salicylate, or probenecid. The effect of each inhibitor on [14 C]urate transport was identical {{to the effect of}} the same inhibitor on [3 H]PAH flux. We conclude that the transport of urate and PAH in dog renal microvillus membrane vesicles occurs via a pH gradient-stimulated electroneutral carrier-mediated process such as 1 : 1 H+-anion cotransport or OH-anion exchange.

Pure fungal cultures were transferred to straw and wood substrate and colonized substrate was transferred to aquaria containing concentrations of estradiol in moving water. Samples were analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-UV). Results were inconclusive due to detection limitation of the HPLC-UV system utilized and the adsorption of 17 B-estradiol onto components in the aquarium. In a separate experiment, water samples of the Flint River Watershed, were sent to Arizona Laboratory for Emerging Contaminants for analysis through GC/LC/MS. This analysis showed levels of 17 a-ethynyl estradiol well above those that caused morphological and behavioral changes (40 ng/L) in fish during in vitro experiments.

40|$|Appropriate {{nitrogen}} {{management is}} one of the main challenges of agricultural production and for the environment. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficiency of crop N uptake in a longterm wheat crop in a Mediterranean environment of Southern Italy, and to identify optimal N rate for reasonable economic returns and minimum nitrate leaching using SAWS crop simulation model. The study was part of a long-term monoculture wheat system that started in 1991 / 1992 season, with two levels of nitrogen (0 and 90 kg N ha(- 1)). Simulations of the treatment with no nitrogen (0 N) and 90 kg N ha(- 1) (90 N) were performed using the SALUS crop model for wheat. The model was tested against measurements of harvested grain yield, <b>final</b> N <b>uptake,</b> soil water content and total soil N. Long-term simulation over 56 years showed that grain yield median value was 3435 kg ha(- 1) for 0 N and 3876 kg ha(- 1) for 90 N. Simulation scenarios with different N rates (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 kg N ha(- 1)) showed that yield response was higher for 120 N (3528 kg ha(- 1)), with the 60 and 90 N yields giving the same response, 3010 and 3054 kg ha(- 1), respectively. The most profitable treatments were 120 N (302 Euro ha(- 1)), followed by the 60 N (220 Euro ha(- 1)). The simulation results showed that nitrate leaching was higher for the N rate of 120 and 180 with a mean annual value of 49 and 81 kg ha(- 1), respectively. Results suggest that in such environment 60 kg N ha(- 1) can be the most appropriate as an N fertilization management due to the best trade-off between leaching and economic. Since N fertilization rates are linked to nitrous oxide (N(2) O) emissions and N leaching, a trade-off between N fertilization rates profit and grain yield should be thought as way to reduce environmental pollution while keeping productivity and profit. The adoption of simulation models to approximate the best N rate for durum wheat in rainfed Mediterranean environment proved to be a useful tool for supporting management decisions through quantifying the temporal variability related to weather uncertainty as it influences on the yield and nutrient dynamics.

40|$|PURPOSE: Each {{pathological}} {{stage of}} {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{consists of a}} heterogeneous population containing patients at much higher risk than others. Noninvasive functional imaging modalities, such as 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), could play a role in further characterization of NSCLCs. As many factors can influence the extent of FDG uptake, the underlying mechanisms for FDG accumulation in tumors, are still a matter of debate. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate these possible mechanisms in the primary site of early stage preoperatively untreated NSCLC. METHODS: 19 patients with early stage NSCLC, who had undergone both preoperative FDG-PET imaging and curative surgery, were enrolled in this study. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were used for evaluation of primary tumor FDG <b>uptake.</b> <b>Final</b> diagnosis, tumor type, tumor cell differentiation and size of the primary tumors were confirmed histopathologically in resected specimens. Histologic sections were analyzed for amount of inflammation and necrosis. Expression of the glucose membrane transporters (GLUT- 1 and GLUT- 3); the isoforms of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase (HK-I, HK-II and HK-III); and the cysteine protease caspase- 3, was evaluated immunohistochemically. RESULTS: FDG uptake was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas (mean SUV 13. 4 +/- 4. 9, n= 8) compared to adenocarcinomas (7. 1 +/- 3. 3, n= 8, p= 0. 007), or large cell carcinomas (5. 9 +/- 1. 9, n= 3, p= 0. 02). The degree of FDG accumulation seemed to depend especially on GLUT- 1, GLUT- 3 and tumor cell differentiation. The summed standardized values of these three parameters correlated significantly with the SUV (r= 0. 47, p= 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The present study supports the hypothesis that tumor cell differentiation in combination with overexpression of GLUT- 1 and GLUT- 3 determine the extent of FDG accumulation and that squamous cell carcinomas accumulate more FDG than adenocarcinomas or large cell carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Midwestern United States, {{a region}} that {{produces}} one-third of maize and one-quarter of soybean grain globally, is projected to experience increasing rainfall variability. One approach to mitigate climate impacts is to utilize crop and soil management practices that enhance soil water storage and reduce the risks of flooding as well as drought-induced crop water stress. While some research indicates that a winter cover crop in maize-soybean rotations increases soil water availability, producers continue to be concerned that water use by cover crops will reduce water for a following cash crop. We analyzed continuous in-field soil water measurements from 2008 to 2014 at a Central Iowa research site that has included a winter rye cover crop in a maize-soybean rotation for thirteen years. This period of study included years in the top third of the wettest on record (2008, 2010, 2014) as well as drier years in the bottom third (2012, 2013). We found the cover crop treatment to have significantly higher soil water storage at the 0 – 30 cm depth from 2012 to 2014 {{when compared to the}} no cover crop treatment and in most years greater soil water content on individual days analyzed during the cash crop growing season. We further found that the cover crop significantly increased the field capacity water content by 10 – 11 % and plant available water by 21 – 22 %.

40|$|In {{the current}} study cell {{labeling}} was performed with water-soluble gadolinium (Gd) -DTPA containing liposomes, to allow for cell tracking by MRI. Liposomes were used to assure a highly concentrated intracellular build up of Gd, aiming to overcome the relatively low MRI sensitivity of Gd (compared to T 2 contrast agents). Liposomes were positively charged (cationic) to facilitate uptake by binding to anionic charges in the cell membrane of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We determined the cellular Gd load by variations in labeling time (1, 4, and 24 h) and liposome concentration (125, 250, 500, 1000 μM lipid), closely monitoring effects on cell viability, proliferation rate, and differentiation ability. Labeling was both time and dose dependent. Labeling for 4 h was most efficient regarding the combination of processing time and <b>final</b> cellular Gd <b>uptake.</b> Labeling for 4 h with low-dose concentration (125 μM lipid, corresponding to 52 ± 3 μ,M Gd) yielded an intracellular load of 30 ± 2. 5 pg Gd cell - 1, without any effects on cell viability, proliferation, and cell differentiation. Gd liposomes, colabeled with fluorescent dyes, exhibited a prolonged cellular retention, with an endosomal distribution pattern. In vitro assay over 20 days demonstrated {{a drop in the}} average Gd load per cell, as a result of mitosis. However, there was no significant change in the sum of the Gd load in all daughter cells at endpoint (20 days), indicating an excellent cellular retention of Gd. MSCs labeled with Gd liposomes were imaged with MRI at both 1. 5 T and 3. 0 T, resulting in excellent visualization both in vitro and in vivo. Prolonged in vivo imaging of 500, 000 Gd-labeled cells was possible for at least 2 weeks (3. 0 T). In conclusion, Gd-loaded cationic liposomes (125 μM lipid) are an excellent candidate to label cells, without detrimental effects on cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation, and can be visualized by MRI...|$|R
40|$|The {{program and}} the manual {{presented}} in this report allow for the exposure assessment of compounds contained in consumer products. The main similarity between consumer products is their diversity. Consumer products range from shoe polish to household detergents to pesticides against aphids. All these products may contain hazardous compounds, both as wanted, active compounds and as unwanted contaminants. Assessing the exposure to these compounds urges for steps beyond simply measuring the concentration in the product. Most products release their compounds while being used and the concentrations that are contacted differ from the concentrations in the product. The present report provides a modeling approach based on simple exposure and uptake models. In order {{to cope with the}} diversity in consumer products, it is based on a general model framework that provides a general setting for widely differing exposure situations, and, secondly, it offers a number of predefined exposure and uptake models, which the users can chain to build a complete exposure and uptake model. The starting point is the route of exposure, the inhalatory, dermal and oral ones. For each of these routes, a limited number of models is available to model exposure and uptake. Of course, multiple routes of entry are defined by defining a model for more than one route. In some cases, the program automatically uses multiple routes of entry, for example in the case of airborn compounds, which can enter via the inhalatory, dermal and oral routes ! The program reports several important exposure variables, namely the per event concentration, the yearly averaged concentration, the fraction taken up, the amount taken up during a year (per route and summed) and the uptake per kilogram body weight per day.

40|$|Traumatic joint injury can induce acute {{damage to}} {{cartilage}} and surrounding joint tissues {{accompanied by an}} inflammatory response, which can significantly {{increase the risk of}} developing Qsteoarthritis. The mechanism by which joint injury results in disease development is not fully understood. However, chondrocyte metabolism is greatly affected by the transport properties of cartilage extracellular matrix, which determine the accessibility and the concentrations of various proteins and therapeutic agents to cells and cell receptors. Using in vitro models of mechanical injury to cartilage, we have characterized the uptake and binding of proteins and biopharmaceuticals in normal articular cartilage and have compared the results to those in cartilage subjected to mechanical injury and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We studied equilibrium partitioning and non-equilibrium transport into cartilage of Pfpep, a 760 Da positively charged peptide inhibitor of the pro protein convertase PACE 4. Competitive binding measurements revealed negligible binding to sites in the matrix. The uptake of Pf-pep depended on GAG charge density, consistent with predictions of Donnan equilibrium. The diffusivity of Pf-pep was measured to be ~ 1 x 10 - 6 cm 2 /s, close to other similarly-sized non-binding solutes. These results suggest that small positively charged therapeutics will have a higher concentration within cartilage than in the surrounding synovial fluid, a desired property for local delivery; however, such therapeutics may rapidly diffuse out of cartilage unless there is additional specific binding to intratissue substrates that can maintain enhanced intratissue concentration. We have also examined the effect of mechanical injury and inflammatory cytokines, TNFa, on the uptake of anti-IL- 6 antibody Fab fragment (48 kDa). Anti-IL- 6 Fab was able to penetrate into cartilage, though <b>final</b> equilibrium <b>uptake</b> would likely occur only after 6 - 10 days within 1 mm thick explant disks. Uptake of anti-IL- 6 Fab was significantly increased following mechanical injury of the cartilage in vitro. A further increase in uptake was caused by TNFa treatment combined with mechanical injury. The increase in uptake was accompanied by GAG loss from the tissue, suggesting that there can be greater accessibility of large solutes into cartilage after direct mechanical injury or inflammatory cytokine treatment to the tissue, where the increase in uptake was related with the severity of matrix damage and loss. We also studied the binding and uptake of TNFa in articular cartilage and observed significant binding of TNFa to matrix sites. Binding was stronger for the monomeric form of TNFa compared to trimeric form. Binding of TNFa was not disrupted by pre-treatment of the tissue with trypsin, indicating that the intra-tissue binding sites were not removed by trypsininduced proteolysis of the matirx. These results suggest that matrix binding as well as monomer-trimer conversion of TNFa both play crucial roles in regulating the accessibility of TNFa to cell receptors. The results of this thesis are significant in that they suggest that injurious mechanical loading and inflammatory cytokine applied to cartilage can affect transport processes within the tissue. The resulting altered transport, in turn, can influence the accessibility of proinflammatory cytokines and anti-catabolic drugs which are designed to treat pathogenesis of OA. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Fertilizer {{management}} practices for nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and zinc (Zn) in corn production are {{heavily dependent on}} tillage system. Many long-term no-till producers, confined largely to surface fertilizer applications, struggle with nutrient stratification and potential surface P runoff or gaseous N losses shortly after broadcast nutrient applications. Strip-till systems offer alternative nutrient placement options in both fall and spring. This strip-till study focused on pre-plant, coulter-based mixing of the upper Ap soil horizon in the future corn row zones with and without simultaneous incorporation of urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) and/or a commercial granular N, P, S, and Zn fertilizer, MicroEssentials® SZ™ (MESZ). Different strip-tillage timings (fall, spring, or fall and spring) and nutrient placements (zone-banded or surface broadcast) were compared both with and without starter (N and P) fertilizer applications during the precision-guided corn planting operation. The pre-plant P rate applied with the MESZ product equaled that applied in the sub-plots with starter (67 kg P ha- 1). Corn was grown in rotation with soybean for two location-years on high organic matter prairie soils with a mean soil-test P concentration of 14. 9 ppm (2013) and 24. 1 ppm (2014) in non-fertilized control treatments (both no-till and fall strip-till). Total N application at 202 kg ha- 1 was constant for all treatments. Treatments were evaluated by measuring soil nutrient distributions, whole-plant nutrient uptake (V 6, R 1 earleaf, R 6), and final grain yields. ^ Soil fertility samples, collected at 3 depths (0 - 5, 5 - 10, and 10 - 20 cm) shortly after planting, revealed successful incorporation of MESZ in the zone-banded area, largely confined {{to a depth of}} 5 cm. Zone banding, therefore, changed the soil P stratification little, though it did mix the fertilizer with soil in that zone. Early (V 6) plant growth and nutrient (N, P, and S) uptake was significantly increased with fall applied MESZ, regardless of placement, compared to a no-till (NT) check treatment, but not consistently relative to strip-tilled treatments with no MESZ. Early Zn uptake response was less consistent; only the fall zone-banded MESZ placement with no spring zone-banded UAN resulted in a consistent significant Zn uptake advantage over NT. As the season progressed, significant responses to main treatment differences diminished. Earleaf samples collected at silking revealed treatment differences only in N concentration, with slightly higher values for treatments without added MESZ. No R 6 -stage nutrient <b>uptake</b> or <b>final</b> grain yield differences were significant among main treatments. Spring zone banding of a 50 kg N ha- 1 in the form of UAN provided no growth, nutrient or yield benefits relative to the more common sidedress UAN application at the higher N rate. Grain yields averaged 14. 7 Mg ha- 1 in 2013 and 15. 0 Mg ha- 1 in 2014. Systems with fall zone-banded MESZ produced the highest yield (0. 6 Mg ha - 1, 4. 2 %) above the NT treatment, but this advantage was not significant. The slight (0. 2 Mg ha- 1) yield increase for zone-banded MESZ over the broadcast MESZ placement was also not significant. However, application of starter fertilizer, regardless of main treatment effects, significantly increased both early plant growth and nutrient uptake (N, P, and S; Zn 2013 only) and final grain yield (0. 1 Mg ha- 1 in 2013 and 0. 2 Mg ha- 1 in 2014). With constant N rates for all treatments, on moderate to high fertility soils, fall zone-banding N, P, S, and Zn resulted in significantly increased early growth and nutrient <b>uptake</b> but non-significant <b>final</b> nutrient <b>uptake</b> and grain yield benefits compared to NT planted with no additional P, S or Zn fertilizer. Zone banding of these nutrients thus provided little immediate corn production benefit on these soils, but the potential environmental benefits, especially with fall P application, merit additional investigation. ...|$|R
40|$|Sediments are an {{important}} sink for and source of environmental pollutants. Because of these two qualities, sediments have been acknowledged in environmental risk assessment and corresponding regulations. In case of the European Water Framework Directive (EWFD), for instance, sediments were addressed {{by means of an}} amendment published in 2008. In order to adequately response to sediment contamination within the context of this legal obligation, however, there is still a need for research in several key fields. One open question is the correlation between the effects of pollutants in sediments and factors which can potentially confound such effects. The present thesis aimed to investigate potential confounding impacts in order to identify the importance of the given influences on biotests results and eventually the assessment of sediment contamination. Impact of contact-time on results obtained in biotests appeared to be of particular priority. Hence, time-dependence of data acquired in direct sediment contact tests (SCTs) was the major focus of the given studies. Further investigated were the impacts of test vessel material, extraction methodology, and difference between single- and multi-metal exposures. A literature survey and two experimental studies were carried out in order to address the time-dependence of results obtained in SCTs. The main experimental investigation compared the impact of time on the effects of 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA), fluoranthene (FA) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo SCT, the nematode SCT with Caenorhabditis elegans, and the bacterial SCT with Arthrobacter globiformis. The second experimental study assessed the impact of short-term (two week) contact-time between sediments and pollutants on bioaccumulation of FA and PCP in the earthworm species Lumbriculus variegatus. All three studies concurrently revealed that time can severely impact results of SCTs. Literature indicated a complete loss of initially observable effects within weeks and statistically significant changes in effects in different SCT which mostly utilised invertebrates. These changes in effects included both increases and decreases, depending on the respective combination of species, substances, sediments, and additional accompanying parameters. In the two experimental studies, the impact of time was sufficiently severe that distinct changes of results were observed. In the case of the fish embryo SCT, a complete loss of originally observed toxicity of all three substances was recorded within two to sixteen weeks. In the nematode contact test, low number of juveniles in comparison to controls indicated toxicity in all four tested combinations of sediments and substances. Reproduction of worms exposed to FA-spiked natural sediment increased in the test conducted after 4 weeks of contact between FA and the sediment, and reached reproduction in the controls after six weeks. In the other three combinations of sediment and substance that were tested in the nematode SCT, no changes were observed until the end of experiments after six weeks. Toxicity of PCP remained unchanged in the bacterial SCT over the course of 44 weeks in both sediments. Accumulation of PCP in earthworms significantly decreased in FA-spiked natural sediment within 13 days of ageing and exhibited no change in PCP-spiked artificial sediment and both FA-spiked sediments. In an additional study, four different sediment extraction methodologies and one corresponding SCT were intercompared with regard to biological effectiveness on zebrafish embryos: Soxhlet extraction (SOX), membrane dialysis extraction (MDE), hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin extraction (HPCD) and Tenax TA® extraction (TNX). TNX was identified as a putatively suitable method for the prediction of toxicological bioavailability in the SCT with zebrafish embryos. SOX, MDE and HPCD overestimated bioaccessibility, as was expected for SOX and MDE. HPCD is a methodology that was reported to be predictive of bioaccessibility, but induced effects at least as great as effects induced by the two vigorous extraction methodologies Soxhlet and MDE. This result may be explained by short sediment-pollutant contact-time, and indicated that results obtained from different extraction methodologies can be severely altered by time. In an investigation comparing the impact of glass or plastic test vessel material on results in the aqueous zebrafish embryo test, glass vessels were shown to be better suited for testing of DCA. In the case of plastic, 16 hours of DCA-vessel contact prior to embryo exposure resulted in an almost complete loss of effects in the tested concentrations, whereas in glass vessels, an LC 50 could still be obtained. These results confirm that currently discussed measures, such as semi-static tests, passive dosing and flow-through renewal, are necessary to minimise the influence of vessel material. Furthermore, experimental timing, i. e. the exact time test compounds are introduced into test vessels, can be crucial for the outcomes of experiments. The <b>final</b> study assessed <b>uptake,</b> accumulation, and corresponding changes in transcript abundance of selected genes in zebrafish embryos exposed to Cd-, Cu-, Ni- and Zn-spiked sediment. In terms of potentially confounding impacts, multi- vs. single-metal exposures were compared. Results emphasized the great relevance of Cu as toxicant on fish. Furthermore, it was shown that multi-metal exposure can impact uptake and bioaccumulation, most likely by means of inhibition and competition. This correlation was established for the first time concerning the zebrafish embryo sediment contact test. Literature indicated that this impact can be further influenced by additional confounding factors like pH or time. Transcript abundances were not sensitive to these changes. This finding could indicate that molecular biomarkers are more robust in their response to confounding factors than other endpoints, but needs to be further investigated. In most studies in the present thesis, a recurring comparison was conducted on the impact of sediment type, either artificial or natural sediment, on results in spiking-based investigations of sediment contamination. Results indicated no preference for either type, and depended, again, on the specific combination of species and substance. It is concluded that both artificial and natural sediments are very useful tools with advantages as well as inherent limitations. A parallel application should be considered in spiking-based assessments. The observed significant alterations of results induced by time concurrently indicated a need to developed research strategies to sustainably address time-dependence as potential confounding impact. Difference between exposures to single substances or mixtures was also identified as a relevant impact. Both identified influences might result in severe over- or underestimations of risks associated with contamination of sediments. However, acknowledgement of factors impacting results in environmental assessment creates a novel challenge. Assessing confounding impacts apparently calls for more tests, whereas economical and animal welfare considerations prioritise a minimisation of test demands. Hence, a three step, long-term strategy is proposed, which can eventually reduce necessity for extensive testing and address confounding impacts at the same time: a) Pilot-studies on the targeted confounding impacts (such as given in the present thesis), b) Integrative studies to assess the interlinking of the addressed impacts between different organisational levels and c) Inclusion of the confounding impacts into holistic, predictive models. In addition, the novel idea of adverse outcome pathways was identified as promising conceptual strategy to characterise and understand the mechanisms of confounding impacts. To realise such long-term research strategies on the organisational level, concentrated cooperational efforts in research frameworks are necessary. Current EU-founded projects such as MODELKEY provide examples how frameworks can be conceived that are developed to address the challenge posed by confounding impacts. The impact of time, in particular, was identified to be sufficiently severe to justify its inclusion into such frameworks...|$|R
