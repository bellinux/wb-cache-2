2500|$|Barnes v. Train (1974) is {{commonly}} {{viewed as the}} first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term [...] "sexual harassment" [...] was not used. The term [...] "sexual harassment" [...] was coined and popularized by Lin Farley in 1975, based on a pattern she recognized during a 1974 Cornell University class she taught on women and work. In 1976, Williams v. Saxbe established sexual harassment {{as a form of}} sex discrimination when sexual advances by a male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, the Supreme Court first recognized [...] "sexual harassment" [...] as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of <b>employer</b> <b>liability,</b> and that speech or conduct in itself can create a [...] "hostile environment". The Civil Rights Act of 1991 added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive damages for sexual discrimination or harassment, and the case of Ellison v.

Also in 1991, Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co. became the first sexual harassment case to be given class action status paving the way for others. Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the [...] "discovery" [...] process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the litigation process to be included in assessing damages awards. In the same year, the courts concluded in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida, and Burlington v. Ellerth, that employers are liable for harassment by their employees. Moreover, Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of [...] "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.|$|E

The thesis is composed of seven chapters. Chapter one is introductory with focus on liability for damage in labour law. In {{the beginning of this}} chapter the thesis deals with the division of liability for damage into <b>employer's</b> and employee's <b>liability.</b> The first subchapter brings a brief characterization of contemporary legal regulation of <b>employer's</b> <b>liability</b> for occupational accidents and diseases. The second subchapter concerns with mutual relationship between civil code and labour code and the use of civil code in labour law. In the chapter two, you can find a description of terms occupational accident, damage and causality between occupational accident and damage, which are necessary preconditions of <b>employer's</b> <b>liability</b> for occupational accident. Subsequent chapter is about <b>employer's</b> <b>liability</b> for occupational diseases and is subdivided into three parts. Part one gives an account of term occupational disease.

50|$|This is {{the first}} case to set a clear {{precedent}} for how courts must deal with harassment in cyberspace.

The court's decision emphasizes that the intent is not to make companies monitor all employee communications, but rather to make clear that companies must take all necessary steps to stop harassment if the company has reason to believe it is occurring, whether it is online or in person.|$|E

50|$|Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, , was an {{important}} decision by the United States Supreme Court {{on the issues of}} prescriptive sex discrimination and <b>employer</b> <b>liability</b> for sex discrimination. The employee, Anne Hopkins, sued her former employer, the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. She argued that the firm denied her partnership because she didn't fit the partners' idea of what a female employee should look like and act like. The employer failed to prove that it would have denied her partnership anyway, and the Court held that constituted sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The significance of the Supreme Court's ruling was twofold. First, it established that gender stereotyping is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the mixed-motive framework that enables employees to prove discrimination when other, lawful reasons for the adverse employment action exist alongside discriminatory motivations or reasons.|$|E

5000|$|In Baker v. Willoughby the {{defendant}} negligently injured the claimant's leg {{in a car}} accident. The claimant was later an innocent victim when shot in the same leg by some robbers and the leg was amputated. The House of Lords held that {{the defendant}} was liable to pay full compensation for the injury he had caused, based on the claimant's losses beyond the time when his leg was amputated. Since the claimant's disability would have been permanent, damages were assessed as if the second event had not occurred. If the chain had been treated as broken and the defendant had had no liability in respect of the period after the claimant's leg had been amputated, the claimant would have fallen between two sets of defendants (the robbers were not available as defendants to pay their share of full compensation). This decision was criticised in Jobling v. Associated Dairies where the claimant's employer negligently caused a slipped disk which reduced his earning capacity by half. Four years later, the claimant {{was found to have}} a pre-existing spinal disease unrelated to the accident which gradually rendered him unable to work. The <b>employer</b> <b>liability</b> was limited to four years' loss of earnings because, whatever had happened, this illness would have caused the disability and was a “vicissitude of life”. The Lords considered that Baker should be regarded as an exception to the general [...] "but-for" [...] test, which was justified on its facts but not representing a general precedent.|$|E
