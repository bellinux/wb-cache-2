40|$|The {{main purpose}} of our paper is to {{reconstruct}} the <b>intervention</b> <b>logic</b> of the Swedish government's proposal to introduce a tax deduction for homework help. Furthermore, we also intend to outline the perceived impacts of this tax deduction in the municipality of Linköping. Our material consists of the government bill regarding the tax deduction, the parliamentary debate which preceded {{it as well as}} interviews with key people in the municipality of Linköping. In our study and in the light of Matthew Clarke’s theory of neo-liberalism within education policy, we also ask ourselves if the <b>intervention</b> <b>logic</b> behind the tax deduction and its perceived effects {{can be seen as a}} manifestation of neo-liberalism. To obtain our results, we have used Evert Vedung’s <b>intervention</b> <b>logic</b> model and side-effect model. The results are discussed in our analysis chapter which leads us to the conclusion that the tax deduction in some respects can be seen as a manifestation of neo-liberalism. The paper concludes with suggesting further research, in which we propose that the phenomenon should be investigated further and from different approaches. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an intervention framework for collaboration to improve services. When collaboration is an intervention, its development and effectiveness depend on <b>intervention</b> <b>logic.</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>logic</b> requires a precise conceptualization of collaboration. This conceptualization emphasizes its vital and unique components. It includes a developmental progression in which collaboration is contrasted with companion concepts. It also includes progress benchmarks, outcome measures, and logic models. These models depict relations among the benchmarks and outcomes, and they identify the mediating and moderating variables {{that account for}} collaboration 2 ̆ 7 s development and effectiveness. These models are designed to improve planning, evaluation, and their relations. This intervention framework for collaboration contrasts sharply with other conceptualizations and strategies. Although its aim is to unify and improve collaboration policy and practice, its inherent selectivity is an obvious limitation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT...|$|E

From the Post-colonial time to the era of globalisation, from Washington Consensus to the Post-Washington Consensus, there are various aid discourses, motives and the <b>intervention</b> <b>logics.</b> This paper explores the Western aid through a critical review to the history and the contemporary development of ‘aid’. It argues, despite these changes, the fundamental logic of aid, the logic of ‘catching up’, has not been changed.

30|$|Nevertheless, {{the chosen}} {{approach}} of actor-centered institutionalism may ignore or conceal {{certain aspects of}} integration processes. Other explanatory approaches focussing on factors such as ethnic discrimination or educational resources are complementary to the proposed framework. Considering integration outcomes {{as a product of}} capabilities and aspirations is illuminating for an institutionalist perspective on integration policy outcomes and allows identifying specific policy <b>intervention</b> <b>logics</b> as demonstrated in this article. The benefits of this study are threefold. Firstly, from a theoretical perspective, the capability-aspiration framework provides a conceptual tool for the analysis of the effectiveness of policy interventions by combining the idea of an agency-structure relationship of actor-centered institutionalism with the comparative study of immigrant integration. Instead of a full-fledged explanation model, the capability-aspiration framework is a research heuristic on a high level of abstraction that allows the identifying and arranging of different explanatory factors relevant for immigrant integration outcomes in different dimensions.|$|R

This article examines how policy-makers conceive monitoring {{in the context of}} the current European territorial and innovation policy. In this setting, monitoring activities have to move beyond an audit-oriented logic in order to integrate a range of strategic functions such as producing the information needed to manage evidence-based policy decisions effectively and keep stakeholders informed and engaged in the policy cycle. To analyse this transition, we first conceptualize the logic of intervention of smart specialization. In a second step, we present the findings from a survey of policy-makers on their perceptions of this <b>intervention</b> <b>logic</b> and monitoring. We find that strategy monitoring is an exercise that must go beyond a narrow audit focus. Regional policy-makers involve stakeholders to interpret monitoring results for strategy revision and they adopt a priorityspecific <b>intervention</b> <b>logic,</b> albeit with problems of implementing this logic in practice.

40|$|Why did the United States {{intervene}} in World War I, breaking with its {{long tradition of}} noninvolvement in European political and military conflicts? During the 1920 s and 1930 s, many revisionist historians argued that American efforts to protect its trade with the Allies ultimately led to <b>intervention.</b> The <b>logic</b> of the revisionist position closely parallels the contemporary liberal case that interdependence promotes peace but arrives at different conclusions {{about the relationship between}} trade and conflict. Historians have largely abandoned this economic interpretation of American intervention, but data on the impact of the wartime export boom on the United States suggest that it should be reconsidered. The export boom was so large {{that it would have been}} difficult to ignore, and its progress corresponds to the timing of important decisions leading to American belligerency. An analysis of congressional voting on war-related measures also suggests that export income helped shape politicians views of the war. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of new blood vessels, {{a process known}} as angiogenesis, is important for embryonic development and wound healing as well as the development of cancer and inflammation; therefore, angiogenesis is a valuable target for clinical <b>intervention.</b> Both <b>logic</b> and empiricism suggest that a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory switches is required for orderly {{formation of}} blood vessels. Thrombospondins 1 and 2 were among the first natural angiogenesis inhibitors to be identified. However, the cellular origins and mechanisms of action of these important proteins during angiogenesis have remained largely unknown. Studies by Kopp et al., presented in this issue of the JCI, clarify some of these issues by revealing that megakaryocytes and their “sticky” wound-healing progeny, platelets, are important sources of thrombospondins 1 and 2 and that these thrombopoietic cells play key roles in controlling blood vessel formation during hematopoiesis and ischemic wound healing (see the related article beginning on page 3277) ...|$|R

The Ugandan case study demonstrates that facilitating multi-stakeholder engagement was pivotal in creating favourable conditions for other innovations and forms of capacity development support.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the seemingly natural objectivity and self-evidence of "data," this paper builds on recent francophone literature by developing a critical conceptualization of "digital traces. " Underlining the materiality and discursiveness of traces allows us to understand and articulate both the technical and sociopolitical implications of digital technology. The philosophies of Gilbert Simondon and Michel Foucault give strong ontological and epistemological groundings for interpreting the relationships between technology and processes of subjectification. In this light, digital traces are framed as objects and products of eteronomous <b>interventions,</b> the <b>logics</b> of which can be traced through the programs and algorithms deployed. Through the empirical examples of "Predictive Policing" and "Quantified Self" digital traces are contrasted with the premises and dreams of Big Data. While the later claims to algorithmically correlative, predict and preempt the future by reducing it to a "what-is-tocome," the digital trace paradigm offers a new perspective on how forms of self-control and control of the self are interdependent facets of "algorithmic governmentality.

40|$|What {{should we}} make of appeals to {{human rights in the}} context of struggles against {{dispossession}} or armed repression? After the ‘death of man’ as transcendent ground of all right, critics have highlighted the disciplinary effects and absolutist tendencies of human rights discourse. However, {{attempts have been made to}} ‘rescue’ human rights – and wider forms of humanistic advocacy – as an immanent, self-grounding ethical practice. Drawing on analysis of struggles over natural resource extraction and indigenous rights in Latin America, this paper argues that such accounts mirror the assumptions of a predominant mode of international humanitarian activism. By reifying humanistic ideals, without sufficient attention to the effects of practices within which rights are invoked, both obscure entanglements between humanist <b>interventions</b> and <b>logics</b> of dispossession. This is particularly significant at the current juncture. Through these interventions rights have been absorbed into a neoliberal regime of truth in which the subjects of rights are interpellated as parties to private contract, such that rights themselves become tools of exception. Taking struggle as a starting point, by contrast, highlights not only the indeterminacy of rights but also the potential of human rights discourse to disrupt these logics. Through ethnographic engagement with ‘people’s hearings’ into ‘Multinational Corporations and Crimes against Humanity’ in Colombia, I revisit the questions of ‘the human’ and ‘rights’ and propose a more dialectical approach to the relation between normative principle and immanent critique...|$|R
40|$|Logic {{models are}} {{becoming}} an increasingly common feature of systematic reviews, {{as is the}} use of programme theory more generally in systematic reviewing. Logic models offer a framework to help reviewers to 'think' conceptually at various points during the review, and can be a useful tool in defining study inclusion and exclusion criteria, guiding the search strategy, identifying relevant outcomes, identifying mediating and moderating factors, and communicating review findings. In this paper we critique the use of logic models in systematic reviews and protocols drawn from two databases representing reviews of health interventions and international development interventions. Programme theory featured only in a minority of the reviews and protocols included. Despite drawing from different disciplinary traditions, reviews and protocols from both sources shared several limitations in their use of logic models and theories of change, and these were used almost unanimously to solely depict pictorially {{the way in which the}} <b>intervention</b> worked. <b>Logic</b> models and theories of change were consequently rarely used to communicate the findings of the review. Logic models have the potential to be an aid integral throughout the systematic reviewing process. The absence of good practice around their use and development may be one reason for the apparent limited utility of logic models in many existing systematic reviews. These concerns are addressed in the second half of this paper, where we offer a set of principles in the use of logic models and an example of how we constructed a logic model for a review of school-based asthma interventions...|$|R

40|$|Integrating {{a larger}} set of {{instruments}} into Rural Development Programmes implied an increasing focus on monitoring and evaluation. Against the highly diversified experience {{with regard to}} implementation of policy instruments the Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework {{has been set up}} by the EU Commission as a strategic and streamlined method of evaluating programmes’ impacts. Its indicator-based approach mainly reflects the concept of a linear, measure-based <b>intervention</b> <b>logic</b> that falls short of the true nature of RDP operation and impact capacity on rural changes. Besides the different phases of the policy process, i. e. policy design, delivery and evaluation, the regional context with its specific set of challenges and opportunities seems critical to the understanding and improvement of programme performance. In particular the role of local actors can hardly be grasped by quantitative indicators alone, but has to be addressed by assessing processes of social innovation. This shift in the evaluation focus underpins the need to take account of regional implementation specificities and processes of social innovation as decisive elements for programme performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{information}} systems (CIS) produce a complete medical documentation at the bedside. Particularly in on-line monitoring at the inten-sive care unit, {{a large amount}} of minutely mea-surements is given. The analysis of the data allows to support decision making. This trend towards data-intensive systems [3] invites ma-chine learning or data mining techniques to ap-ply [1], [6]. The combination of knowledge-based reasoning with data-driven prediction and validation has a great impact on evidence-based medicine and decision support [2], [7]. A set of analysis tasks provides physicians with alarms, recommendation of therapeutical interven-tions, and predictions of effects of the intervention. Whereas statistical analysis of time series is the kind of method for alarm systems, statis-tical learning (here: using the support vector machine) proved its success in recommending therapeutical <b>interventions.</b> Inductive <b>logic</b> pro-gramming was capable of learning rules about observed effects of interventions. Statistical ver-ifications of the results have been performed as well as a blind test which acquired an expert’s response to patient data. [5][4][9] Moreover, a combination of machine learning and knowledge-based inference, enables us to validate decisions. A knowledge base about (intended) drug ef-fects can be compared with the observed outcome. A knowledge base modeling a treatment protocol can be compared with the ob-served sequence of interventions. Consistency checking or critiquing a knowl-edge base on the basis of empirical data speeds up the process of protocol developement, fo-cuses medical discussion on critical and relevant questions, and improves the protocol’s quality [8][10]. This talk shows how knowledge-based and data-driven procedures in concert contribute to enhanced treatments and protocols.

40|$|Food has {{featured}} in the global development agenda for several decades. However, increasing food prices and the global food crisis of 2007 - 2008, fuelled the debate around food security, which was also one the main thematic priorities of Finn Church Aid's strategy in 2009 - 2012. This thesis was commissioned by FCA {{in order to examine}} food security {{in the context of their}} development cooperation project in Cambodia. The purpose of the study is to support FCA and their local partner organization, the Lutheran World Federation Cambodia’s work on food security. The study has two objectives: to contribute to the understanding of the intertwined issues of rural development and food security, and to the understanding of the food security approach and <b>intervention</b> <b>logics.</b> Firstly, food reality is scrutinized in a Cambodian rural village. The focus is on the functioning of the food system at the local level, and as part of a wider food system reaching beyond the village boundaries and even the national level. In addition, the household level food security is analysed from the perspective of livelihoods - means of gaining a living - and different ways of commanding or accessing food. This level allows scrutinizing how village level changes in the food system affect different kinds of families. Secondly, the study analyses the food security approach of LWF, with regard to the village food reality and in the light of politicised international discourses on food security. The thesis is a contextual case study of the village of Chrokhlong, based on one month’s field work period in November and December 2010, as well as LWF Cambodia’s program documents and interviews with the staff. The field work material consists of 43 interviews with the villagers, 76 informal discussions and personal observation. Food security and general development themes in Cambodia are explored through literature and personal interviews. The study found that the local food security is affected by important changes of the wider food system. Population growth and economic liberalization increase pressures on land and natural resources in the village context. Accumulation and fragmentation of land and degradation of common resources are related to the increasing commoditization of the village food system. Food security has become an issue of purchasing power. Land for rice cultivation appears as the most important factor contributing to household food security. The most food insecure families lack land and means of generating incomes in order to purchase food, such as family members in working age and good health. The poorest families are the most affected by the depletion of common resources and the increasing food prices. At a strategic level, LWF has adopted a holistic approach to food security and defines their objective as 'right to food' in line with a rights based approach to development. However, at the practical level the approach seems narrower, and the work on food security focuses on enhancing food production. This focus risks not taking into account the food insecurity of the land-poor families who do not benefit from increasing productivity. The centrality of the land issue and the specific situation of the most food insecure families is no considered sufficiently. Based on this case study, an integrated and holistic rural development approach would seem to provide relatively more benefits to households that are able to produce to markets, while the food security of the poorest families can be even further threatened by a greater dependence of markets. While LWF’s ideals seem to reflect a 'food justice' discourse, their practical work is more in line with the hegemonic discourse labelled as 'food security', that does not aim at affecting the structural causes of food insecurity at different levels...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of accounting {{has already been}} extended to include aspects of customer services, employee satisfaction and innovation. These applications have however continued to focus on efficiencies and sustainability at the business activity end of the spectrum. The long term impact of business and other social activities continues to be unaddressed from an accountability perspective. This paper aims to contribute to closing this {{gap in the literature}} by introducing a framework for measuring outcomes and linking them back to the investments, events, projects or interventions that preceded them. The proposed framework is an adaptation of the balanced scorecard model first introduced by Kaplan and Norton. The paper uses a case study of a social services initiative aimed at reducing domestic violence in at risk communities in New Zealand. Although this model has been developed from an accounting perspective, it draws on the specific practices, theories and <b>intervention</b> <b>logic</b> found in the social services and social development literature. The proposed framework is suggested here as a mechanism for better capturing the performance parameters that will support greater sustainability for Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) in the Social Services sector.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{discusses}} contemporary {{approaches to}} workplace health and well-being, articulating key {{differences in the}} intervention architecture between public and workplace health contexts and implications for intervention design. Approach: Contemporary practice is discussed in light of calls for a paradigm shift in occupational health from a treatment orientation to an holistic approach focused on mitigation {{of the causes of}} ill health and the promotion of well-being. In practice, relatively few organizations have or seem able to engage with a broader perspective that encompasses challenges to health and well-being associated with contextual organizational drivers, e. g. job design/role, workload, systems of reward, leadership style and the underpinning climate. Drawing upon insights from public health and the workplace safety tradition, the scope for broadening the perspective on intervention (in terms of vectors of harm addressed, theory of change and <b>intervention</b> <b>logic)</b> is discussed. Findings: There are important differences in scope and options for intervention between public health and workplace health contexts. While there is scope to emulate public health practice, this should not constrain thinking over intervention opinions. Increased awareness of these key differences within work organizations, and an evidence-based epidemiological approach to learning has the potential to strengthen and broaden the approach to workplace health and well-being management.

Design/methodology/approach - Contemporary practice is discussed in light of calls for a paradigm shift in occupational health from a treatment orientation to an holistic approach focused on mitigation {{of the causes of}} ill health and the promotion of well-being. In practice, relatively few organizations have or seem able to engage with a broader perspective that encompasses challenges to health and well-being associated with contextual organizational drivers, e. g. job design / role, workload, systems of reward, leadership style and the underpinning climate. Drawing upon insights from public health and the workplace safety tradition, the scope for broadening the perspective on intervention (in terms of vectors of harm addressed, theory of change and <b>intervention</b> <b>logic)</b> is discussed. Findings - There are important differences in scope and options for intervention between public health and workplace health contexts. While there is scope to emulate public health practice, this should not constrain thinking over intervention opinions. Increased awareness of these key differences within work organizations, and an evidence-based epidemiological approach to learning has the potential to strengthen and broaden the approach to workplace health and well-being management. Originality/value - We argue that approaches to workplace well-being interventions that selectively cross-fertilise and adapt elements of public health interventions offer promise for realising a broader change agenda and for building inherently healthy workplaces...|$|E
40|$|Pregnancy is {{recognised}} as {{a critical}} life-stage for optimal nutrition to promote maternal, infant and inter-generational health. Participation of the community in different stages of public health projects {{has been identified as}} a key capacity building strategy that facilitates community participation and sustainability of project effects. This study (part of the broader Growing Years Project) aimed to investigate the determinants of pregnant women eating well and being physically active, as a basis for informing intervention design. This process encouraged the target group to become involved in the decision making process with respect to problem identification and strategy development. A purposive sample of 35 women were recruited postnatally to participate in a semi-structured interview that retrospectively explored women’s experiences relevant to their diet during pregnancy, information sources, services they used during this period, barriers and enablers to healthy eating and perceptions of needed strategies relevant to nutrition promotion. Thematic analysis of interviews indicates that there was widespread basic knowledge of the profile of a healthy diet and a range of common concerns about diet and health during pregnancy. A diverse range of information sources were accessed during this period. A range of physiological, social, cultural and environmental determinants were identifiable that have been used to focus <b>intervention</b> planning and <b>logic</b> modelling, consistent with good practice in intervention design...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effects of}} a karate intervention on the cognition, executive function and classroom behaviours of secondary school pupils. Participants were six year eight students (12. 7 ±. 5 years) from a bottom set mathematics class of a secondary school in the south of England. Cognitive measures and classroom behaviours were assessed prior to, throughout {{and at the end of}} the <b>intervention,</b> using a <b>logic</b> and reasoning task, Stroop Colour-Word test and adapted Direct Behaviour Rating scale. The intervention was a six week karate program lead by the participants’ Physical Education teacher who is a qualified martial arts instructor. A social validation interview was conducted after all the data was collected. To assess the effects of the karate the raw data was reported for each participant. Responses to the measures, as a result of the karate, varied between the participants, with some significant positive and negative deviations from group trends. Links were shown between the responses in the incongruent condition of the Stroop Colour-Word test and classroom behaviours for four of the participants, as a consequence of the karate. The results show that karate may be a mediator of executive function and classroom behaviour, so interventions such as this may be used in schools in the future. It further reinforces the need for Physical Education in the curriculum where the physical activity directly impacts on other aspects of learning...|$|R
40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} the intervention planning process for HOME BP, a digital intervention to promote hypertension self-management. It illustrates how a Person- Based Approach {{can be integrated}} with theory- and evidence-based approaches. The Person-Based Approach to intervention development emphasises the use of qualitative research {{to ensure that the}} intervention is acceptable, persuasive, engaging and easy to implement. Methods: Our intervention planning process comprised two parallel, integrated work streams, which combined theory-, evidence- and person-based elements. The first work stream involved collating evidence from: a mixed methods feasibility study, a systematic review, and a synthesis of qualitative research. This evidence was analysed to identify likely barriers and facilitators to uptake and implementation as well as design features that should be incorporated in the HOME BP intervention. The second work stream used three complementary approaches to theoretical modelling: developing brief guiding principles for intervention design; causal modelling to map behaviour change techniques in the intervention onto the Behaviour Change Wheel and Normalisation Process Theory frameworks; and developing a logic model. Results: The different elements of our integrated approach to intervention planning yielded important, complementary insights into how to design the intervention to maximise acceptability and ease of implementation by both patients and health professionals. From the primary and secondary evidence we identified key barriers to overcome (such as patient and health professional concerns about side effects of escalating medication) and effective intervention ingredients (such as providing in-person support for making healthy behaviour changes). Our guiding principles highlighted unique design features that could address these issues (such as online reassurance and procedures for managing concerns). Causal modelling ensured that all relevant behavioural determinants had been addressed, and provided a complete description of the <b>intervention.</b> Our <b>logic</b> model linked the hypothesised mechanisms of action of our intervention to existing psychological theory. Conclusion: Our integrated approach to intervention development, combining theory-, evidence- and person-based approaches, increased the clarity, comprehensiveness and confidence of our theoretical modelling and enabled us to ground our intervention in an in-depth understanding of the barriers and facilitators most relevant to this specific intervention and user population. <br/...|$|R
