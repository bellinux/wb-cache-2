5|$|Chipped {{stone tools}} found at Zemun {{show that the}} area around Belgrade was {{inhabited}} by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools belong to the Mousterian industry, which are associated with Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and <b>Gravettian</b> tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Around 16,000BC, Europe {{witnessed}} {{the appearance of}} a new culture, known as Magdalenian, possibly rooted in the old <b>Gravettian.</b> This culture soon superseded the Solutrean area and the <b>Gravettian</b> of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine. The Hamburg culture prevailed in Northern Europe in the 14th and the 13th millennium BC as the Creswellian (also termed the British Late Magdalenian) did shortly after in the British Islands.|$|E
25|$|Around 28,000BC a new technology/culture {{appeared}} in the western region of Europe: the <b>Gravettian.</b> This technology/culture has been theorised to have come with migrations {{of people from the}} Balkans.|$|E
50|$|One typical {{artefact}} of the industry, {{once considered}} diagnostic, {{is a small}} pointed blade with a straight blunt back, known as the Gravette point. These were used to hunt big game including bison, horse, reindeer and mammoth. <b>Gravettians</b> also used nets to hunt small game.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} (before about 33 ka BP) European {{modern humans}} {{and the subsequent}} (Middle Upper Paleolithic) <b>Gravettians,</b> falling anatomically largely inline with the earliest (Middle Paleolithic) African modern humans, also show traits that are distinctively Neanderthal, suggesting that a solely Middle Paleolithic modern human ancestry was unlikely for European early modern humans.|$|R
50|$|Following its {{inhabitants}} from the Lower Palaeolithic {{culture in the}} Pleistocene era, the caves have sheltered Neanderthals from the Middle Palaeolithic (Mousterian and Châtelperronian); those have left behind them circular huts supported by mammoth tusks. Modern humans followed, with Aurignacians, <b>Gravettians,</b> Proto-Solutreans and Magdalenians. All in all the caves were inhabited up to the Middle Ages.|$|R
25|$|Some {{archaeologists have}} {{questioned}} these dates. Christian Züchner, relying on stylistic comparisons with similar paintings at other well-dated sites, expressed {{the opinion that}} the red paintings are from the <b>Gravettian</b> period (c. 28,000–23,000BP) and the black paintings are from the Early Magdalenian period (early part of c. 18,00010,000BP). Pettitt and Bahn also contended that the dating is inconsistent with the traditional stylistic sequence {{and that there is}} uncertainty about the source of the charcoal used in the drawings and the extent of surface contamination on the exposed rock surfaces. Stylistic studies showed that some <b>Gravettian</b> engravings are superimposed on black paintings proving the paintings' older origins.|$|E
25|$|Settlement in Ukraine {{by members}} of the homo genus has been {{documented}} into distant prehistory. The Neanderthals are associated with the Molodova archaeological sites (43,000-45,000 BC) which include a mammoth bone dwelling. <b>Gravettian</b> settlements dating to 32,000 BC have been unearthed and studied in the Buran-Kaya cave site of the Crimean Mountains.|$|E
25|$|From a {{study of}} 51 individuals, {{researchers}} {{were able to identify}} five separate genetic clusters of ancient Europeans during the Ice Age: the Věstonice Cluster (34,000–26,000 years ago), associated with the <b>Gravettian</b> culture; the Mal'ta Cluster (24,000–17,000), associated with the Mal'ta-Buret' culture, the El Mirón Cluster (19,000–14,000 years ago), associated with the Magdalenian culture; the Villabruna Cluster (14,000–7,000 years ago) and the Satsurblia Cluster (13,000 to 10,000 years ago), Caucasus hunter-gatherers.|$|E
25|$|Modern human {{settlement}} in Ukraine and its vicinity {{dates back to}} 32,000 BC, with evidence of the <b>Gravettian</b> culture in the Crimean Mountains. By 4,500 BC, the Neolithic Cucuteni-Trypillian Culture flourished in a wide area that included parts of modern Ukraine including Trypillia and the entire Dnieper-Dniester region. During the Iron Age, the land was inhabited by Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians. Between 700BC and 200BC {{it was part of}} the Scythian Kingdom, or Scythia.|$|E
25|$|Haplogroup I (M170), {{which is}} now {{relatively}} common and widespread within Europe, may represent a Palaeolithic marker – its age has been estimated at ~ 22,000 BP. While it is now concentrated in Europe, it probably arose in a male from the Middle East or Caucasus, or their near descendants, c. 20–25,000 years BP, when it diverged from its immediate ancestor, haplogroup IJ. At about this time, an Upper Palaeolithic culture also appeared, known as the <b>Gravettian.</b>|$|E
25|$|The mother goddess {{model is}} the major one applied to the Neolithic of the middle and near east, the civilization of the Aegean and Europe. The {{iconography}} was inherited from the Palaeolithic. The <b>Gravettian</b> culture introduced it into {{the range of the}} future LBK from western Asia and south Russia. From there, it diffused throughout Europe in the Upper Palaeolithic, which was inhabited by Cro-Magnon man and was responsible for many works of art, such as the Venus of Willendorf.|$|E
25|$|Martin Richards et al. {{found that}} 15–40% of extant mtDNA {{lineages}} trace {{back to the}} Palaeolithic migrations (depending on whether one allows for multiple founder events). MtDNA haplogroup U5, dated to be ~ 40–50 kYa, arrived during the first early upper Palaeolithic colonisation. Individually, it accounts for 5–15% of total mtDNA lineages. Middle U.P. movements are marked by the haplogroups HV, I and U4. HV split into Pre-V (around 26,000 years old) and the larger branch H, both of which spread over Europe, possibly via <b>Gravettian</b> contacts.|$|E
25|$|The figurine was cleaned {{after the}} discovery, thus all organic traces {{which could have}} been dated with {{conventional}} methods were destroyed. For this reason, any dating was controversial since the beginning and can only be done by comparisons with other figurines. Thanks to these comparisons, it is now generally assumed that the Venus of Savignano belongs to the <b>Gravettian</b> culture and that it can be roughly dated back to 25,000–20,000 BP, although some sources tend to lean toward an earlier dating, up to c. 28,000 BP, and some sources favor a much later dating.|$|E
25|$|Upper Paleolithic remains {{are more}} {{numerous}} in Lower Austria. The best known {{are in the}} Wachau region, including the sites of the two oldest pieces of art in Austria. These are figurative representations of women, the Venus of Galgenberg found near Stratzing and thought to be 32,000 years old, and the nearby Venus of Willendorf (26,000 years old) found at Willendorf, near Krems an der Donau. In 2005 in the same area, a double infant burial site was discovered at Krems-Wachtberg, dating from <b>Gravettian</b> culture (27,000 years old), the oldest burial ground found in Austria to date.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists {{have found}} prehistoric human skeletons in the region, {{as well as}} {{numerous}} objects and vestiges of the <b>Gravettian</b> culture, principally in the river valleys of Nitra, Hron, Ipeľ, Váh {{and as far as}} the city of Žilina, and near the foot of the Vihorlat, Inovec, and Tribeč mountains, as well as in the Myjava Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of mammoth-bone (22,800BC), the famous Venus of Moravany. The statue was found in the 1940s in Moravany nad Váhom near Piešťany. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile gastropods of the Tertiary period have come from the sites of Zákovská, Podkovice, Hubina, and Radošina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the Mediterranean and Central Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Based on {{radiocarbon}} dating, {{the cave}} {{appears to have}} been used by humans during two distinct periods: the Aurignacian and the <b>Gravettian.</b> Most of the artwork dates to the earlier, Aurignacian, era (30,000 to 32,000 years ago). The later <b>Gravettian</b> occupation, which occurred 25,000 to 27,000 years ago, left little but a child's footprints, the charred remains of ancient hearths, and carbon smoke stains from torches that lit the caves. The footprints may be the oldest human footprints that can be dated accurately. After the child's visit to the cave, evidence suggests that due to a landslide which covered its historical entrance, the cave remained untouched until it was discovered in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|... the {{entrance}} to the cave system leads through La Garma A, as the only entrance into the cave system. It lies at [...] above sea level and has an extensive stratigraphy, containing Aurignacian, <b>Gravettian,</b> Solutrean and Magdalenian layers, as well as Mesolithic, Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Bronze Age and Middle Ages layers.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, the {{earliest}} known European art is from the Upper Palaeolithic period of between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago and France has a large selection of extant pre-historic art from the Châtelperronian, Aurignacian, Solutrean, <b>Gravettian,</b> and Magdalenian cultures. This art includes cave paintings, such as the famous paintings at Pech Merle in the Lot in Languedoc which date back to 16,000 BC, Lascaux, located {{near the village of}} Montignac, in the Dordogne, dating back to between 13,000 and 15,000 BC, or perhaps, as far back as 25,000 BC, the Cosquer Cave, the Chauvet Cave dating back to 29,000 BC, and the Trois-Frères cave; and portable art, such as animal carvings and great goddess statuettes called Venus figurines, such as the [...] "" [...] of 21,000 BC, discovered in the Landes, now in the museum at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye or the Venus of Lespugue at the Musée de l'Homme. Ornamental beads, bone pins, carvings, as well as flint and stone arrowheads also are among the prehistoric objects from the area of France.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the general}} {{impression}} of these tools {{were based on}} ideal (or classic) pieces that were of such perfect shape that they {{caught the attention of}} non-experts. Their typology broadened the term's [...] meaning. Biface hand axe and bifacial lithic items are distinguished. A hand axe need not be a bifacial item and many bifacial items are not hand axes. Nor were hand axes and bifacial items exclusive to the Lower Palaeolithic period in the Old World. They appear throughout the world and in many different pre-historical epochs, without necessarily implying an ancient origin. Lithic typology is not a reliable chronological reference and was abandoned as a dating system. Examples of this include the [...] "quasi-bifaces" [...] that sometimes appear in strata from the <b>Gravettian,</b> Solutrean and Magdalenian periods in France and Spain, the crude bifacial pieces of the Lupemban culture (9000B.C.) or the [...] tools found near Sagua La Grande in Cuba. The word biface refers to something different in English than biface in French or bifaz in Spanish, which could lead to many misunderstandings. Bifacially carved cutting tools, similar to hand axes, were used to clear scrub vegetation throughout the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. These tools are similar to more modern adzes and were a cheaper alternative to polished axes. The modern day villages along the Sepik river in New Guinea continue to use tools that are virtually identical to hand axes to clear forest. [...] "The term biface should be reserved for items from before the Würm II-III interstadial", although certain later objects could exceptionally be called bifaces.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gravettian</b> {{culture was}} located across Europe. <b>Gravettian</b> sites {{generally}} date between 33,000 to 20,000 BP.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gravettian</b> period (also {{known as}} Périgordian) {{according}} to the classical French sequence, assimilates Chatelperronian and <b>Gravettian</b> in one single cultural complex.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gravettian</b> period {{occurred}} in Europe between 30,000 and 22,000 years ago (during the Upper Paleolithic). <b>Gravettian</b> lifestyle {{was shaped by}} the climate. Pleniglacial environmental changes forced early humans to adapt. West and Central Europe were extremely cold during this period. <b>Gravettian</b> culture thrived {{on their ability to}} hunt animals. They utilized a variety of tools and hunting strategies. Compared to theorized hunting techniques of Neanderthals and earlier human groups, <b>Gravettian</b> hunting culture appears much more mobile and complex.|$|E
50|$|Around 32,000 BCE, the <b>Gravettian</b> culture {{appears in}} the Crimean Mountains (southern Ukraine). Around 22,000 BCE, the Solutrean and <b>Gravettian</b> {{cultures}} reach the southwestern region of Europe. The <b>Gravettian</b> technology/culture has been theorized to have come with migrations {{of people from the}} Middle East, Anatolia, and the Balkans. The cultures might be linked with the transitional cultures mentioned before, because their techniques have some similarities and are both very different from Aurignacian ones but this issue is thus far very obscure. The <b>Gravettian</b> soon disappears from southwestern Europe, with the notable exception of the Mediterranean coasts of Iberia. The <b>Gravettian</b> culture also {{appears in the}} Caucasus and the Zagros mountains.|$|E
50|$|The Eastern <b>Gravettian</b> {{had a long}} evolution, {{featuring}} several {{stages of}} development as documented especially by the settlements in Moldova. The <b>Gravettian</b> has left traces in the Ţara Oaşului and Ţara Maramureşului, the sites of microlite fashioned mainly out of obsidian indicating the connection with the <b>Gravettian</b> in the neighboring regions (Moldavia, South-Carpathian Ukraine, Eastern Slovakia, and Northeastern Hungary).|$|E
50|$|Around 32,000 years ago, the <b>Gravettian</b> culture {{appeared}} in the Crimean Mountains (southern Ukraine).

5000|$|The Epigravettian (Greek: epi [...] "above, on top of", and <b>Gravettian)</b> {{was one of}} {{the last}} archaeological {{industries}} of the European Upper Paleolithic. It arose after the Last Glacial Maximum around ~21,000 cal. BP. It is related to the <b>Gravettian,</b> of which it is considered a continuation by some scholars (e.g. G. Laplace). In this sense, the Epigravettian is simply the <b>Gravettian</b> after ~21,000 BP, when the Solutrean had replaced the <b>Gravettian</b> in most of France and Spain. Its known range extends from southeast France to the western shores of the Volga River, Russia, with a large number of sites in Italy. It was replaced by Mesolithic cultures around 10,000 BP.|$|E
50|$|The earliest-known ceramic {{objects are}} <b>Gravettian</b> figurines {{such as those}} {{discovered}} at Dolní Věstonice in the modern-day Czech Republic. The Venus of Dolní Věstonice is a Venus figurine, a statuette of a nude female figure dated to 29,000-25,000 BC (<b>Gravettian</b> industry).|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{information on}} animal remains {{is based on}} an excavation that took place during the field seasons of 1954 and 1956 at a location known as Pavlov I in southern Moravia. The <b>Gravettian</b> era landscape is the most closely related to the landscape of present day Moravia.
