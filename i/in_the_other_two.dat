In his home debut for Chesterfield, on 13 August 2016 against Swindon Town, Evans produced a match-winning performance, scoring Chesterfield's third goal and having a hand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> from Gary Liddle and Jay O'Shea as they won 3–1.|$|E

5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E

Female and immature birds are harder to distinguish, but can be differentiated by the reddish tinge of the crown and whiter underparts.|$|E

5|$|Docherty built a {{new team}} around the group of talented young players {{emerging}} from the club's youth set-up and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into {{the final stages of}} the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two.</b> In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, Dave Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in 1970, beating Leeds United 2–1 in a final replay. Chelsea took their first European honour, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph, the following year, with another replayed win, this time over Real Madrid in Athens.|$|E
5|$|During the season, Poulton {{also played}} in the Under-19 interstate tournament during the break in the WNCL, captaining her state. In five innings, she made three half-centuries, with a best of 73 against Queensland in the final, which New South Wales won by five wickets. She was unbeaten <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> fifties after opening the batting; New South Wales {{completed}} ten-wicket wins in both instances. Poulton ended the competition with 191 runs at 63.66. She was rewarded with selection in and captaincy of the national Under-19 team during the season and played in two matches against England Under-19s, scoring 13 and 35 as Australia won both matches. At {{the end of the}} season, she was selected to lead an Australian Under-23 team to play against the senior England team. Poulton made 15 in her only innings.|$|E
5|$|Early on, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice between three {{different}} game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team Path, the Wits Path, and the Fists Path. In the Team Path, protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits Path features an abundance of complex puzzles, while the Fists Path focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is completely optional <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> modes. Atypical for LucasArts titles, {{it is possible for}} the player character to die at certain points in the game, though dangerous situations were designed to be easily recognizable. A score system, the Indy Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles solved, the obstacles overcome and the important objects found.|$|E

5|$|The 1910 Dual Contracts {{called for}} {{extending}} IRT and BMT lines to Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Owing to Queens' lack of {{development at the}} time, it did not receive many new IRT and BMT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city's Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> boroughs first before building in Queens. The IRT Flushing Line was {{to be one of}} two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, and it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens' oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.|$|E
5|$|The first {{forecast}} {{for the year}} was issued by CSU on December 11, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. The scenario considered most likely was that Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and thermohaline circulation (THC) would be stronger, but effects from El Niño would remain, resulting in a slightly above average season. The next most likely scenario was that both the AMO and THC would strengthen and the El Niño effects would cease to exist, causing a well above average season. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> scenarios, which were given the same probability of occurrence, the AMO and THC would weaken {{and the effects of}} El Niño would either disappear or some would remain, resulting in either a near average or well below average season.|$|E
5|$|The {{ordering}} of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use of}} boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> directions.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} Canis {{dentition}} {{shows that in}} comparison with the modern gray wolf and the Pleistocene LaBrea wolf, the Beringian wolf possessed large carnassial teeth and a short, broad palate relative to the size of its skull. The row length of the Beringian wolf's premolars was longer, the P4 premolar (the upper carnassial) longer and wider, and the M1, M2, and m1 (the lower carnassial) molars longer than those found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> types of wolves. The Beringian wolf's short, broad rostrum increased the force of a bite made with the canine teeth while strengthening the skull against the stresses caused by struggling prey. Today, the relatively deep jaws {{similar to those of the}} Beringian wolf can be found in the bone-cracking spotted hyena and in those canids that are adapted for taking large prey. Beringian wolves possessed a craniodental morphology that was more specialized than modern gray wolves and Rancho LaBrea wolves for capturing, dismembering, and consuming the bones of very large megaherbivores, having evolved this way due to the presence of megafauna. Their stronger jaws and teeth indicate a hypercarnivorous lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Since 2001, Oxford United {{have played}} at the Kassam Stadium. The all-seater stadium has a {{capacity}} of 12,500 and has only three stands {{instead of the usual}} four; when first planned in 1995 it was originally going to have a 16,000-seat capacity, {{but by the time the}} stadium opened Oxford was playing in a lower division, so the smaller capacity was deemed adequate. Construction of the fourth stand is not expected to take place for several years, although foundations have already been put in place. The record attendance is 12,243, which was achieved in the final game of the 2005–06 season, when a defeat against Leyton Orient condemned them to relegation from the Football League. The average attendance in the previous season was 7,415, which was the second highest in League Two and the thirty-fourth highest in the whole Football League. The average attendance was highest in the Conference in two out of the four years the team spent in the division, with the average <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> years placing second, behind Exeter City and Cambridge United respectively. The stadium has also hosted rugby union matches, a woman's international football match (England v Sweden), an Under-17 international football tournament and music concerts.|$|E
