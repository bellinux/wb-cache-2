25|$|To {{support and}} verify such {{assumptions}} about dialogue journal writing, studies {{will need to}} provide for random assignment of students to either dialogue journal writing or a control condition for a sufficient length of time, ideally within the same instructional context. Where this is not possible, carefully designed studies of <b>individual</b> <b>students</b> can yield strong research evidence. For example, Regan, Mastropiere, and Scruggs conducted a study of special-needs students using a multiple baseline design to measure outcomes of a dialogue journal intervention compared to baseline data. Studies following this design can provide a model of dialogue journal research that addresses issues of selection and maturation.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the many}} values of {{dialogue}} journals is the opportunity {{for the teacher to}} provide informal counseling in a non-threatening, private context for <b>individual</b> <b>students</b> on their challenges and problems, whether about instructional or personal concerns. This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage students to think through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E
25|$|EPI has {{developed}} several software products to support educators. In 2006, EPI developed the Institutional Student Retention Assessment (ISRA), {{which serves as}} a web-based campus audit system focused on student retention. The ISRA was developed with funding from Lumina Foundation for Education. That same year, with support from TG, EPI created the Effective Practices in Student Success (EPSS) database. The EPSS currently includes 141 programs from across the US and Canada with evidence-based strategies for postsecondary access and success. In 2007, EPI created the Retention Calculator, which calculates the benefit-cost of saving or losing students in higher education institutions and systems. EPI unveiled the EPI-DAS in 2009, a longitudinal data management system {{that can be used in}} conjunction with GEAR UP and other education initiatives to track <b>individual</b> <b>students,</b> collect and analyze data, and generate reports based on findings. EPI-DAS is designed to meet the reporting requirements of the federal government under the No Child Left Behind Act.|$|E
25|$|In the {{war years}} of 1917–1919, the break between the United States and Germany struck a {{military}} tone on campus. <b>Individual</b> <b>students</b> were volunteering in the Marines, in the Canadian Forces, {{and other forms of}} service. As America entered World War I the U.S. War Department inaugurated the Students' Army Training Corps, a program designed to use existing colleges and universities as training facilities for new military personnel. On the morning of October 1, 1918, about 150,000 college boys on US campuses transformed into student soldiers. This was the induction into the Students' Army Training Corps. In Delaware, on campus, approximately 400 students were given the oath of allegiance. The men received the regular army training and academic instruction prescribed by the Committee on Education and Special Training of the War Department. The mode of student activities changed: campus traditions were put aside, and athletic events were cancelled throughout the fall semester of 1918.|$|E

500|$|In 1860, Creangă enlisted at the Faculty of Theology, part of {{the newly}} founded University of Iași, and, in December 1860, fathered a son, Constantin. His life still lacked in stability, {{and he decided to}} move out of Grigoriu's {{supervision}} and into Bărboi Church, before his position as deacon was cut out of the budget and his belongings were evicted out of his temporary lodging in 1864. He contemplated leaving the city, and even officially requested a new assignment in the more remote Bolgrad. Since January 1864, when the Faculty of Theology had been closed down, he had been attending Iași's Trei Ierarhi Monastery normal school (Trisfetite or Trei Sfetite), where he first met the young cultural figure Titu Maiorescu, who served as his teacher and supervisor, and whence he graduated as the first in his class (June 1865). Embittered by his own experience with the education system, Creangă became an enthusiastic promoter of Maiorescu's ideas on education reform and modernization, and in particular of the new methods of teaching reading and writing. During and after completing normal school, he was assigned to teaching positions at Trisfetite. While there, he earned the reputation of a demanding teacher (notably by accompanying his reports on <b>individual</b> <b>students</b> with characterizations such as [...] "idiot", [...] "impertinent" [...] or [...] "envious"). Accounts from the period state that he made use of corporal punishment in disciplining his pupils, and even surpassed the standards of violence accepted at the time.|$|E
