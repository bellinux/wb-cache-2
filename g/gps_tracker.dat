25|$|Hogan and {{her father}} {{appeared}} in the hour-long profile (Inside) Out: Hulk Hogan, Stage Dad. The television special chronicled Hogan working on her debut album, as well as showed her father's role in the album making process. Her father later stated that the show was mainly an attempt to help promote Brooke and her upcoming music career. The special was a major success for the network, {{and the success of}} the special led to VH1 turning it into an entire television series, titled Hogan Knows Best. The series premiered in July 2005, and was the highest rated series in the network's history. The show chronicled the Hogan family's life together, although it mainly focused on Brooke {{and her father}}. Hogan Knows Best presented her father as strict with her dating. On the show, Hulk placed a <b>GPS</b> <b>tracker</b> on Brooke's vehicle that enabled him to track her whereabouts and shut down the engine of her car remotely. However, Brooke said in a later interview that her father loosened up after her eighteenth birthday.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{argued that}} his {{conviction}} should be overturned because {{the use of}} the <b>GPS</b> <b>tracker</b> violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure. In August 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned Jones's conviction, holding that the police action was a search because it violated Jones's [...] "reasonable expectation of privacy". Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg was joined by Judges David S. Tatel and Thomas B. Griffith. [...] The D.C. Circuit then denied prosecutors' petition for rehearing en banc, over the dissent of Chief Judge David B. Sentelle, joined by Judges Karen L. Henderson, Janice Rogers Brown, and Brett Kavanaugh.|$|E
40|$|The {{sense of}} sight {{is one of}} the main outlets to how we {{interact}} with the world. Using eye tracking methods, this sensory input channel may also be used as an output channel to provide commands for robots to follow. These gaze-commanded robots could then be used to assist severely mobility-limited individuals in the home or similar environments. This thesis explores the use of visually drawn shapes as the input for robot commands. These commands were recorded using low-cost gaze tracking hardware (Gazepoint <b>GP</b> 3 Eye <b>Tracker).</b> The data were then processed using a custom algorithm in MATLAB to detect commands to be passed to two different mobile robots. The ability to use stochastic analysis for path prediction is also explored. Using the techniques and procedures given in this paper, people with limited mobility will be able to input shape commands to have robots react as personal assistants. This research is extensible to gaze-based human-machine interfaces in general for a variety of applications. In order to better under understand the eye, improvements and retro-fitting of an episcleral venomanometer were conducted. A portable video enabled venomanometer was created to observe vein occlusion and its correlating pressure. This was then improved upon through design iteration. The current issue with measuring is receiving accurate and precise readings of eye parameters due to variations in user technique. Designing improved medical devices for collection of information on ocular health and function will provide better understanding of related medical conditions, including but not limited to, glaucomatous damage.

500|$|Sherlock {{offers to}} trade Magnussen's {{information}} on Mary {{for the state}} secrets contained in Mycroft's laptop. However, Magnussen is aware that Sherlock is setting him up in a trap. [...] Magnussen then explains Sherlock's plan to John: security services looking for the laptop using a <b>GPS</b> <b>tracker</b> it contains will raid Appledore and, upon finding the laptop, will have a legal reason to search the blackmail vaults. [...] Magnussen, with visible joy, reveals that the plan will not work because Appledore's vaults don't physically exist, but are stored in his mind palace. By giving Magnussen the laptop, Sherlock and John are now guilty of attempting to sell government secrets and can be imprisoned for high treason, whereas Magnussen remains legally untouchable. When Mycroft and the police arrive, Sherlock coldly shoots Magnussen in the head, having realised {{that this is the}} only way to free his friends and everyone else from his power.|$|E

However, Walternate arranges for Olivia's brain to be removed for further study on how to traverse universes safely. Before she is to start the operation, Olivia receives a visit from Colonel Broyles (the alternate universe's counterpart to her FBI supervisor), who is still grateful to Olivia for helping his son. Olivia convinces him that her universe is not at war with theirs; the troubles started not from any hostile action, but only as an accidental side-effect of Walter's initial crossing to save Peter. Broyles later talks {{with his wife and}} then returns to Liberty Island to save Olivia. Together, the two reach the immersion tank that Olivia used earlier, but find it empty. As a back-up plan, the two travel to Walternate's long abandoned lab at Harvard to use the sensory deprivation tank. Broyles reveals there is a <b>GPS</b> <b>tracker</b> in him, but manages to buy Olivia enough time to successfully return to her universe.|$|E

However, over the course of the series, Vaughn has been manipulating Lucas, by giving him Maya back into his life, in order to get his hands on an MI5 file named [...] "Albany", which contain blueprints for a genetic weapon. To further force Lucas' hand in getting the file, Vaughn abducts Maya, though he was possibly doing this in order to protect her from Chinese agents who wish to acquire Albany, and threatening to rape then behead Maya should Vaughn fail to deliver. Later, Lucas finds Maya after mortally wounding Vaughn. Having confessed his past crimes to his MI5 superior, Harry Pearce (Peter Firth), Lucas intends to flee the country with Maya, and agrees to give the Chinese Albany in exchange for money, and new identities for the couple. However, Maya is approached by hired specialist, Alec White (Vincent Regan), who tells her of Lucas's past crimes. By doing so, Maya turns against Lucas, and attempts to get him to surrender. However, when Beth Bailey (Sophia Myles) and Dimitri Levendis (Max Brown) arrive, Lucas takes Maya to his car and evades them.
