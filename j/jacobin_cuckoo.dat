5000|$|Particularly {{enticing}} is {{an abundance}} of cuckoo species in summer with up to eleven species being found, including the Diederic cuckoo and <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo</b> ...|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{recorded}} as host of the following brood parasites diderick cuckoo Chrysococcyx caprius, <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo</b> Clamator jacobinus and Levaillant's cuckoo Clamator levaillantii. Predators include the rufous-breasted sparrowhawk Accipter rufiventris, as well as cats and rats Rattus spp.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> pied cuckoo, or pied crested cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus) is {{a member}} of the cuckoo order of birds that is found in Africa and Asia. It is {{partially}} migratory and in India, it has been considered a harbinger of the monsoon rains due to the timing of its arrival. It has been associated with a bird in Indian mythology and poetry, known as the chatak (Sanskrit: चातक) represented as a bird with a beak on its head that waits for rains to quench its thirst.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species was}} first given its {{binomial}} name by Linnaeus in 1766. His {{description of what}} he called Cuculus coromandus was based on the notes of Brisson who described the bird as [...] "Le coucou hupé de Coromandel" [...] which was collected on the Coromandel coast of India (probably near Pondicherry which was a French colony). Buffon noticed the close relation to the <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo</b> and called it [...] "le Jacobin huppé de Coromande". The species was later placed under the genus names of Coccystes, Oxylophus before being placed in Clamator.|$|E
50|$|This {{dark and}} crested cuckoo has {{chestnut}} wings, a glossy black crest and a graduated tail (the feathers shortening in {{steps from the}} center outwards) whose terminal edges are white and inconspicuous unlike the white tips of the <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo</b> which is found in parts of its range. The black capping on the head is broken from black of the back by a white collar that extends {{to the sides of}} the neck. The lower parts are rufous turning to dark grey towards the vent. Young birds are dusky with a scaly appearance to the wing feathers.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is in {{summer in the}} temperate ranges. The nest is a deep and loose cup made up of thorny twigs, rags and hair. This is placed in a thorny bush, trees such as Flacourtia and wild date palms (Phoenix). The usual clutch is about 3 to 6 eggs which are incubated by both sexes. The eggs hatch after about 13 to 16 days. Young chicks are often fed with pieces of small birds captured by the parents. A second brood may be raised in the same nest. They are sometimes parasitized by cuckoos such as the common cuckoo (Dehra Dun), common hawk-cuckoo, <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo</b> and the Asian koel in Bangladesh.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} widely {{mentioned}} in ancient Indian poetry as the chātak. [...] According to Indian mythology {{it has a}} beak atop its head and it thirsts for the rains. The poet Kalidasa used it in his [...] "Meghadoota" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} deep yearning and this tradition continues in literary works. Satya Churn Law, however noted that in Bengal, the bird associated with the [...] "chatak" [...] of Sanskrit was the common iora unlike the <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo</b> suggested by European orientalists. He further noted that a captive iora that he kept drank water only from dew and spray picked up from plant leaves suggesting that {{it may have been the}} basis for the idea that the [...] "chatak" [...] only drank raindrops. To compound the issues with matching vernacular names, it has been pointed out that in Bengal chātak also refers to skylarks (which are also crested).|$|E
50|$|Several {{breeding}} pairs may {{be found}} within a group. Adults will often indulge in preening {{the head and neck}} feathers of other group members. The nesting season in India is in summer (May to July) with two peaks broken by a gap during the rains. They build a shallow cup nest low in a thorny bush and lay about 2-3 turquoise blue eggs. In northern India, they have been found to use heaps of lopped up Zizyphus for nesting. The eggs hatch after about 13-15 days. Broods may be parasitized by the <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo</b> and the common hawk-cuckoo. The young birds are able to fly about after about a week and continue to stay with the group, joining the adults at the roost. Helpers, possibly young birds from the previous brood may assist the parents, feeding the brooding females and the young birds. The feeding bird often hops after delivering food calls with a low trill and shivers its feathers. The gape of young birds is yellow and the iris colour changes from hazel to dark brown. They roost communally. The cooperative breeding structure is thought to be formed by groups of males with a shared lineage with the females moving out of their natal groups.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species is}} usually seen in pairs or small parties and only rarely in larger groups. Larger groups are formed {{especially}} when drinking at waterholes in arid regions. Small numbers assemble on trees near waterholes before flying to the water's edge {{where they are}} able to suck up water like other members of the pigeon family. Laughing doves eat the fallen seeds, mainly of grasses, other vegetable matter and small ground insects such as termites and beetles. They are fairly terrestrial, foraging on the ground in grasslands and cultivation. Their flight is quick and direct with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. The male in courtship display follows the female with head bobbing displays while cooing. The male pecks its folded wings in [...] "displacement-preening" [...] to solicit copulation from the female. A female accepts by crouching and begging for food. The male may indulge in courtship feeding before mounting and copulating. Pairs may preen each other. Males may also launch into the air with wing clapping sounds and then glide down in a gentle arc when displaying. The species has a spread out breeding season in Africa. Almost year round in Malawi and Turkey; and mainly May to November in Zimbabwe, February to June in Egypt and Tunisia. In Australia the main breeding season is September to November. The nest is a very flimsy platform of twigs built in a low bush and sometimes in crevices or under the eaves of houses. Both parents build the nest with males bringing the twigs which are then placed by the female. Two eggs are laid within an interval of a day between them and both parents take part in building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. Males spend more time incubating the nest during the day. The eggs are incubated after the second egg is laid and the eggs hatch after about 13 to 15 days. Nesting adults may feign injury to distract and draw predators away from the nest. Multiple broods may be raised by the same pair in the same nest. Seven broods by the same pair have been noted in Turkey. The young fledge and leave the nest after about 14 to 16 days. The <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo</b> sometimes lays its egg in the nests of the laughing dove in Africa.|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} African subspecies of <b>Jacobin</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Clamator jacobinus serratus is a brood parasite of a {{range of}} host species. While Jacobin Cuckoos do not evict host young, previous research has found that host young rarely survive the nestling period. Here we provide the first records of <b>Jacobin</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> parasitism of a new host species, the Southern Pied Babbler Turdoides bicolor. We investigate rates of brood parasitism and the survival of host young. The Southern Pied Babbler {{is one of the largest}} recorded hosts for Jacobin Cuckoos and, unusually, we find that host young tend to survive the nestling period and maintain similar body mass to host young in unparasitized broods. However, host young were less likely to survive to independence than young raised in unparasitized nests, suggesting a post-fledging reproductive cost to hosts. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|I {{examined}} the breeding biology of the Cape Bulbul Pycnonotus capensis at a study site in Port Elizabeth for a {{comparison with the}} results obtained by Richard Liversidge from a study made 40 years ago. There were no differences in methods, so results were directly comparable. No {{differences were found between}} the two study periods in the timing of breeding, clutch size, number of fledglings per nesting attempt or successful nesting attempt, indicating no major shift in the life history strat-egy or breeding success of the population. During my study period, there was a strong calendar effect on breeding success: early nests were more likely to be successful than late ones. I found strong differences between bush species with regard to predation risk and brood parasitism risk by the <b>Jacobin</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Clamator jacobinus. These differences emphasise the com-plex interaction between the timing of breeding, risk of predation and risk of brood parasitism, which influences decisions about when to start nesting and nest site selection in the Cape Bulbul. The breeding biology of animals is influenced by a great number of factors, such as food supply, predation risk and nest site selection, amongst others (Newton 1998). Changes in the breeding biology or even anatomy can be related to changes in the abiotic (Hughes 2000, Yom-Tov 2001, Gjerdrum et al. 2003) or biotic environment (Boveng et al...|$|E
40|$|In coevolutionary arms races, like between cuckoos {{and their}} hosts, {{it is easy}} to {{understand}} why the host is under selection favouring anti-parasitism behaviour, such as egg rejection, which can lead to parasites evolving remarkable adaptations to 'trick' their host, such as mimetic eggs. But what about cases where the cuckoo egg is not mimetic and where the host does not act against it? Classically, such apparently non-adaptive behaviour is put down to evolutionary lag: given enough time, egg mimicry and parasite avoidance strategies will evolve. An alternative is that absence of egg mimicry and of anti-parasite behaviour is stable. Such stability is at first sight highly paradoxical. I show, using both field and experimental data to parametrize a simulation model, that the absence of defence behaviour by Cape bulbuls (Pycnonotus capensis) against parasitic eggs of the <b>Jacobin</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Clamator jacobinus) is optimal behaviour. The cuckoo has evolved massive eggs (double the size of bulbul eggs) with thick shells, making it very hard or impossible for the host to eject the cuckoo egg. The host could still avoid brood parasitism by nest desertion. However, higher predation and parasitism risks later in the season makes desertion more costly than accepting the cuckoo egg, a strategy aided by the fact that many cuckoo eggs are incorrectly timed, so do not hatch in time and hence do not reduce host fitness to zero. Selection will therefore prevent the continuation of any coevolutionary arms race. Non-mimetic eggs and absence of defence strategies against cuckoo eggs will be the stable, if at first sight paradoxical, result...|$|E
