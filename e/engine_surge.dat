5|$|Each engine {{had its own}} {{intake and}} the engine {{nacelles}} were paired with a splitter plate between them to minimise adverse behaviour of one powerplant influencing the other. Only above Mach 1.6 was an <b>engine</b> <b>surge</b> likely to affect the adjacent engine.|$|E
5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent <b>engine</b> <b>surge)</b> and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E
25|$|At speeds {{below the}} intake {{starting}} speed, or on aircraft with external compression intakes, <b>engine</b> <b>surge</b> {{can cause a}} hammershock. Hammershocks have caused damage to intakes. For example, the North American F-107 during flight at high speed experienced an <b>engine</b> <b>surge</b> which bent the intake ramps. Concorde, during development flight testing, experienced significant damage to one nacelle after both engines surged.|$|E
50|$|Three {{seconds after}} {{lift-off}} from Runway 14 at Irkutsk, the No.3 <b>engine</b> <b>surged</b> at approximately 5 m altitude. The aircraft continued to climb, {{but at a}} high angle of attack, disrupting airflow to No.1 and No.2 <b>engines</b> which also <b>surged.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the pilot's {{point of}} view, after 25 seconds of flight, noise, bangs and {{vibrations}} caused by No. 2 engine (the right <b>engine)</b> being in <b>surge</b> were first noticed. The flight crew responded by throttling down a little, but an automatic system (ATR, Automatic Thrust Restoration) {{that had not}} been described to the flight crew by the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), simultaneously increased throttle {{as a response to the}} asymmetric engine power and reduced climb rate. As a consequence, the <b>engine</b> <b>surges</b> continued. SAS flight captain Per Holmberg, who was on board as a passenger, noticed the problems early and hurried to the cockpit to assist the crew. Engine No. 1 (the left <b>engine)</b> <b>surged</b> 39 seconds later, and both engines failed at 76 and 78 seconds into flight, at an altitude of 3,220 ft (980 m).|$|R
50|$|In December 1970 a Buccaneer {{was lost}} after one <b>engine</b> <b>surged</b> {{and failed to}} {{accelerate}} on an overshoot and a week later another aircraft was lost after an uncontained engine failure. This last accident brought Gyron Junior flying to a halt forever.|$|R
500|$|... 12 April 1989: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAF, on a {{chartered}} {{flight from}} Christchurch, New Zealand, to Sydney, suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. As the aircraft was climbing and accelerating through Mach 1.7 a [...] "thud" [...] was heard. The crew {{did not notice}} any handling problems, and they assumed the thud they heard was a minor <b>engine</b> <b>surge.</b> No further difficulty was encountered until descent through 40,000 feet at Mach 1.3, when a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft, lasting two to three minutes. Most of the upper rudder had become separated from the aircraft at this point. Aircraft handling was unaffected, and the aircraft made a safe landing at Sydney. The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) concluded that {{the skin of the}} rudder had been separating from the rudder structure {{over a period of time}} before the accident due to moisture seepage past the rivets in the rudder. Furthermore, production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder, but the procedures were difficult to adhere to. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.|$|E
500|$|... 21 March 1992: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAB, on a {{scheduled}} flight from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet above mean sea level, the crew heard a [...] "thump". No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected {{there had been}} a minor <b>engine</b> <b>surge.</b> One hour later, during descent and decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden [...] "severe" [...] vibration began throughout the aircraft. The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine, and it was attenuated when that engine's power was reduced. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting only that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the skin had become separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in-flight. The (AAIB) concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in-flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.|$|E
2500|$|The Buccaneer S.1's Gyron Junior engines {{were not}} {{powerful}} enough, and they {{led to the}} type's career coming {{to an abrupt end}} in December 1970. [...] On 1 December, an S.1 was making a landing approach when an <b>engine</b> <b>surge</b> disrupted the approach and forced the two crewmen to eject. [...] On 8 December, an S.1 on a training flight suffered a turbine failure. [...] The pilot successfully ejected, but due to a mechanical failure the navigator was killed. [...] Subsequent inspections concluded that the Gyron Junior engine was not to a standard now considered to be suited for operations. [...] All remaining S.1s were grounded immediately, and permanently.|$|E
50|$|The plane {{departed}} from Stockholm at 08:47, {{on the day}} of the crash. Shortly after liftoff, pieces of ice slammed onto the fans of both engines, deforming the fan blades sufficiently to disturb the airflow to the compressors. The disturbed airflow caused the compressors to stall and this in turn caused the <b>engines</b> to <b>surge.</b> Because the <b>engines</b> were not throttled down sufficiently, the surges continued. The high loads from repeated <b>engine</b> <b>surges</b> quickly led to the breakup of both engines.|$|R

5000|$|... 200: On July 10, 1985, a Tupolev Tu-154B-2, Aeroflot Flight 7425, on a {{domestic}} Karshi-Ufa-Leningrad route, crashed near Uchkuduk, Uzbek SSR, Soviet Union, {{on the second}} leg of its route. All 191 passengers and 9 crew were killed. An investigation concluded that the plane went down due to pilot error. The air crew used an inappropriately low airspeed, causing vibrations which they incorrectly interpreted as <b>engine</b> <b>surges.</b> As a result, they further reduced engine power, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.|$|R
5000|$|On December 27, 1991, SAS Flight 751, MD-81 OY-KHO [...] "Dana Viking", crash-landed at Gottröra, Sweden. In {{the initial}} climb, both engines {{ingested}} ice broken {{loose from the}} wings (although they had been properly deiced before departure). The ice damaged the compressor blades causing compressor stall. The stall further caused repeated <b>engine</b> <b>surges</b> that finally destroyed both engines, leaving the aircraft with no thrust. The aircraft landed in a snowy field and broke into three parts. No fire occurred and all aboard survived.|$|R
5000|$|Driveline shunt {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>engine</b> <b>surge</b> in automatic vehicle transmissions where an engine [...] "searches" [...] for its idle speed whilst at very low road speeds, and causes unexpected surges in acceleration. This is a different phenomenon which can be mitigated by an experienced driver using left foot braking for such very low speed maneuvering.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} the first {{developed}} with a full authority analogue computer, de Havilland's own, {{as part of the}} fuel control system, specifically to anticipate helicopter power demand from pilot control inputs and to limit fuel flow during acceleration to prevent <b>engine</b> <b>surge</b> from occurring. The system developed relieved the helicopter pilot of the need to control rotor speed directly and in this way was the analogue forerunner of all subsequent FADEC systems world wide.|$|E
50|$|Proponents of the {{technique}} note that in low-speed maneuvers, a driver of a vehicle with a manual transmission will usually keep a foot poised over the clutch pedal, ready to disengage power when the vehicle nears an obstacle. This means that disengagement is also possible {{in the event of}} malfunction such as an <b>engine</b> <b>surge.</b> However, the absence of a clutch on a vehicle with automatic transmission means {{that there is no such}} safety override, unless the driver has a foot poised over the brake pedal.|$|E
50|$|An Antonov 124 {{transport}} plane was destroyed when it crashed immediately after takeoff from Irkutsk-2 Airport in Russia. Three seconds after lifting off from Runway 14, at {{a height of}} about 5 m, the number 3 <b>engine</b> <b>surged.</b> Climbing away with a high angle of attack, engines 1 and 2 also surged, causing the aircraft to crash some 1600 m past {{the end of the}} runway.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work accomplished through computer simulation {{to understand the}} impact of the hydromechanical turbine assembly (TA) fuel control on rocket gas ingestion induced <b>engine</b> <b>surges</b> on the AH- 1 (Cobra) helicopter. These surges excite the lightly damped torsional modes of the Cobra rotor drive train and can cause overtorqueing of the tail rotor shaft. The simulation studies show that the hydromechanical TA control has a negligible effect on drive train resonances because its response is sufficiently attenuated at the resonant frequencies. However, a digital electronic control working through the TA control's separate, emergency fuel metering system has been identified as a solution to the overtorqueing problem. State-of-the-art software within the electronic control can provide active damping of the rotor drive train to eliminate excessive torque spikes due to any disturbances including <b>engine</b> <b>surges</b> and aggressive helicopter maneuvers. Modifications to the existing TA hydromechanical control are relatively minor, and existing engine sensors can be utilized by the electronic control. Therefore, it is concluded that the combination of full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) with hydromechanical backup using the existing TA control enhances flight safety, improves helicopter performance, reduces pilot workload, and provides a substantial payback for very little investment...|$|R

"It is {{possible}} that the bird momentarily disturbed the air flow into the engine before it was struck by the propeller, causing a surge and the suspected flame seen in the CCTV footage, but the engine manufacturer considered this unlikely. The manufacturer considered that if the bird had been sufficiently close to the air intake to disturb the air flow it would have been sucked in. If the flame seen in the CCTV and accompanying ‘bang’ heard on the CVR were evidence of an <b>engine</b> <b>surge,</b> then another possible cause is a fuel flow problem.
