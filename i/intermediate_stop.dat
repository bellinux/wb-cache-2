5|$|On 20 July 1913, {{while making}} an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop</b> in Hoboken, New Jersey, Breslau was being warped into {{position}} when an electrical {{fire broke out}} at the pier where she was docking.

5|$|In December 2001, {{a single}} morning rush-hour round trip branded SLExpress was {{extended}} to Stamford, with a stop at Bridgeport plus eastbound-only stops at Stratford and Milford. An evening eastbound trip was also extended to Stamford with only the Bridgeport <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop.</b> This trip was intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in Bridgeport and Stamford without having to make a transfer at New Haven. On June 24, 2002, additional Stamford trains were added, {{for a total of}} two westbound and three eastbound trains. When West Haven opened in August 2013, it was added to these trips as well.|$|E
5|$|PDISs are {{intermediate}} {{stops at}} a depth above the depth at which the leading compartment for the decompression calculation switches from ongassing to offgassing and below {{the depth of the}} first obligatory decompression stop, (or the surface, on a no-decompression dive). The ambient pressure at that depth is low enough to ensure that the tissues are mostly offgassing inert gas, although under a very small pressure gradient. This combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth. The leading compartment is generally not the fastest compartment except in very short dives, for which this model does not require an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Røros service {{continues}} south, making {{two more}} stops within Trondheim: Selsbakk and Heimdal. It continues through Melhus, where it makes five stops, {{one in the}} town center at Melhus {{and then in the}} villages of Kvål, Ler, Lundamo and Hovin. In Midtre Gauldal, the service stops at Støren, where the Røros Line branches from the Dovre Line. The single daily service to Oppdal runs southwards, with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop</b> at Berkåk. The Røros service continues along the Røros Line, stopping at Singsås before entering Holtålen, where there are stops at Haltdalen and Ålen.

5|$|The oil {{terminal}} supplied 30% of Heathrow Airport's fuel, {{and because}} of the fire, the airport had to start rationing fuel. Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop</b> at Stansted Airport or other European airports to refuel, while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow. Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they would normally take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months after the explosion.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{plans for an}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop</b> at the current Woodside LIRR station, and an {{additional}} 63rd Street line station at Northern Boulevard adjacent to Queens Plaza. The bypass and proposed Woodside station would have necessitated the widening of the LIRR Main Line right-of-way onto private property west of Winfield Junction, where the Main Line merges with the Port Washington Branch, and reorganization of the track layout in the Sunnyside Yards. Later proposals suggested routing the bypass directly to the Archer Avenue line via the LIRR Montauk Branch (which no longer has passenger service).|$|E
5|$|Empire Cheetah {{spent two}} and a half months at Barry before sailing to Swansea on 14 February 1942. Heading to Milford Haven on 23 February, she sailed the next day as a part of convoy ON 70 headed to Portland, Maine, where she safely arrived on 20 March after an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop</b> at Halifax from 15–18 March. Four days later, Empire Cheetah sailed for Boston. She {{departed}} Boston on 12 April for Halifax and departed from there in convoy SC 80 five days later for Hull with a general cargo. Empire Cheetah arrived at Loch Ewe on 2 May and sailed the next day for Methil. After arriving at Methil on 6 May, she headed to her destination of Hull on 7 May.|$|E

After making two trips to Philadelphia and back, she departed for Cape Cod Bay to form up with convoy BX 28 for Halifax, where she arrived on 11 July. Hobbema sailed from Halifax to Sydney, Nova Scotia, in convoy HS 28, and from there sailed on 17 July for Liverpool with convoy SC 92. After her arrival on 31 July, she spent nearly a month at Liverpool before joining convoy ON 126 for New York, arriving at that destination on 19 September.|$|E
5|$|The ship, with Stars of David {{painted on}} her funnels, {{pulled away from}} the dock at eight minutes before noon, nearly an hour later than her planned {{departure}} time, and headed to Haifa, with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop</b> in Naples. On board were some 400passengers from all over the United States and Canada, most of whom were tourists wanting to see the Holy Land. Many of the passengers, including a contingent from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, were also sailing in order to attend the dedication of the Hebrew University at Mount Scopus by former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour. President Arthur also carried agricultural equipment and trucks to be used for farm development in Palestine. In addition, the liner featured Bernice P. Schmitt and Rebeccca Adelman, who, according to contemporary news reports, were the first ever female officers on an ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the harbour is Watchet station. This {{is now an}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop</b> on the West Somerset Railway, {{a largely}} steam-operated {{heritage}} railway that links Bishops Lydeard, near Taunton, with Minehead. The station was first opened on 31 March 1862 when the West Somerset Railway was opened from Norton Junction. The station was built as a terminus, {{as part of the}} commercial aim of the WSR was to provide a wider and cheaper distribution route for goods from the then major port of Watchet. On 16 July 1874 the line was extended westwards by the Minehead Railway Company, with an industrial railway siding provided at the same time into the Wansbrough Paper Mill. The GWR undertook many projects to increase the capacity of the line in the 1930s. Nationalisation in 1948 saw the GWR become the Western Region of British Railways. Freight traffic was withdrawn on 6 July 1964 and passenger trains on 4 January 1971. The station was reopened by the new West Somerset Railway on 28 August 1976.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completion}} and acceptance by Royal Holland Lloyd, Tubantia {{was used in}} service between Amsterdam and Buenos Aires. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Tubantia was returning from South America with £500,000 in gold destined for banks in London, {{a large portion of}} which was intended for the German Bank of London. She was also carrying about 150 German reservists in steerage and a cargo of grain destined for Germany. After making an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop</b> in Vigo, Spain, Tubantia was stopped and boarded by an officer and crewmen from the Royal Navy cruiser , and escorted into port at Plymouth. There, the German reservists were taken off Tubantia by Royal Marines; the gold was confiscated and removed from the ship. Although news accounts do not report when it occurred, Tubantia was released from Plymouth and allowed to resume her Royal Holland Lloyd service.|$|E
5|$|The Chesham {{branch is}} a {{single-track}} railway branch line in Buckinghamshire, England, {{owned and operated}} by the London Underground. It runs from a junction at Chalfont & Latimer station on the Metropolitan line for 3.89miles (6.26km) northwest to Chesham. The line was built as part of Edward Watkin's scheme to turn his Metropolitan Railway (MR) into a direct rail route between London and Manchester, and it was envisaged initially that a station outside Chesham would be an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stop</b> on a through route running north to connect with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Deteriorating relations between the MR and LNWR led to the MR instead expanding to the northwest via Aylesbury, and the scheme to connect with the LNWR was abandoned. By this time much of the land needed for the section of line as far as Chesham had been bought. As Chesham was at the time the only significant town near the MR's new route, it was decided to build the route only as far as Chesham, and to complete the connection with the LNWR at a future date if it proved desirable. Local residents were unhappy at the proposed station site outside Chesham, and a public subscription raised the necessary additional funds to extend the railway into the centre of the town. The Chesham branch opened in 1889.|$|E
