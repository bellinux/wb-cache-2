5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me.

No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E

[...] "Let me say this: I don't believe that <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to quit because I'm not a quitter. And, incidentally, Pat's not a quitter. After all, her name was Patricia Ryan and she was born on St. Patrick's Day, and you know the Irish never quit." ...|$|E
500|$|Early on, Adams {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} turn the correspondence {{to a discussion of}} their actions in the political arena. Jefferson refused to oblige him, saying that [...] "nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age." [...] Adams made one more attempt, writing that [...] "You and <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other. Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to other matters.|$|E

Her novels, which {{journalist}} Lesley McDowell described as containing [...] "derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril", allowed readers {{to escape from}} the mundane and difficult elements of their lives. In a letter describing her novel Friday's Child, Heyer commented, [...] "'I think myself <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to be shot for writing such nonsense. ... But it's unquestionably good escapist literature and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition's physician, Alexander Macklin, to his cabin, {{complaining}} of back pains and other discomfort. According to Macklin's own account, Macklin told him he had been overdoing things and should try to [...] "lead a more regular life", to which Shackleton answered: [...] "You are always wanting me to give up things, what is it <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to give up?" [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss," [...] replied Macklin. A few moments later, at 2:50a.m. on 5 January 1922, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack.|$|E

I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. They made me run around the track a couple times to try my wind.

500|$|Darwin became {{engrossed in}} meticulous {{microscopic}} examination, tracing the complicated mechanisms of flowers that attracted insects by their nectar {{so that the}} insects transported pollen to cross-pollinate other plants, and on 19 July he told Hooker, [...] "I am intensely interested on subject, just as at a game of chess." [...] In September, he [...] "dissected with the greatest interest" [...] and wrote, [...] "The contrivances for insect fertilisation in Orchids are multiform & truly wonderful & beautiful." [...] By October, he had [...] "a large mass of notes with many new facts", but set them aside [...] "convinced that <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to work on Variation & not amuse myself with interludes".|$|E

500|$|After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton {{applied to}} cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: [...] "though I {{know he had}} many imperfections... now the brethren say he is unworthy, (though I know not who {{appointed}} them to judge him,) they urge that I stand in a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, {{as well as my}} own, <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to marry again." [...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E
500|$|Seven men met {{to draft}} the {{invitation}} to the Protestant Dutch Stadtholder, William, Prince of Orange, to invade England and assume the throne. The signatories to the letter included Whigs, Tories, and the Bishop of London, Henry Compton, who assured the Prince that, [...] "Nineteen parts of twenty of the people... are desirous of change". William needed no further encouragement. Although the invitation was not signed by Churchill (he was not, as yet, of sufficient political rank to be a signatory), he declared his intention through William's principal English contact in The Hague – [...] "If {{you think there is}} anything else that <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to doe, you have but to command me". Churchill, like many others, was looking for an opportune time to desert James.|$|E
500|$|When Wodehouse {{heard of}} the furore the {{broadcasts}} had caused, he contacted the Foreign Office—through the Swiss embassy in Berlin—to explain his actions, and attempted to return home via neutral countries, but the German authorities refused to let him leave. In Performing Flea, a 1953 collection of letters, Wodehouse wrote, [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> {{to have had the}} sense to see that it was a loony thing to do to use the German radio for even the most harmless stuff, but I didn't. I suppose prison life saps the intellect". The reaction in America was mixed: the left-leaning publication P.M. accused Wodehouse of [...] "play Jeeves to the Nazis", but the Department of War used the interviews as an ideal representation of anti-Nazi propaganda.|$|E

In a letter quoted by Elizabeth Gaskell in her book The Life of Charlotte Brontë, Charlotte wrote: [...] "My dear husband, too, appears in a new light in his own country. More than once I have had deep {{pleasure}} in hearing his praises on all sides. Some of the old servants and followers of the family tell me I am a most fortunate person; for that I have got one of the best gentlemen in the country .... I trust I feel thankful to God for having enabled me to make what seems a right choice; and I pray to be enabled to repay as <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> the affectionate devotion of a truthful, honourable man." ...|$|E
500|$|During the evening, Elliot and Smith {{discussed}} {{destroying the}} three junks and deploying men {{to attack the}} battery the next day, but Smith acceded to Elliot's recommendation not to do so. Elliot stated that an attack would destroy the village and cause [...] "great injury and irritation" [...] to the inhabitants. In a letter to trader James Matheson on 5 September, Elliot felt {{that it would be}} unbecoming of a British warship to shoot to death the Chinese junks, which his [...] "poor Cutter" [...] could do under their batteries. He wrote: [...] "Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> not to have fired at all but every man's patience has limits and mine has been sorely tried. I am afraid I have disappointed the men's ardent spirits here but I believe I have done well to refrain." [...] He circulated a paper on shore the same day which stated: ...|$|E
500|$|After {{his brother}} died in 1929, Pond married Katherine N. de Nancrede, who was 47 years old, at a {{ceremony}} in Ann Arbor. [...] Pond said at the time, [...] "It's the first time I ever did it, and I thought <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to be pardoned because of my youth." [...] Pond was also an amateur acrobat and remained a physical fitness buff all of his life. [...] At {{the time of his}} wedding in 1929, the Associated Press reported that he is [...] "almost as well known for his present athletic agility as for his architectural accomplishments. A part of his daily routine is to turn handsprings and flipflops and do other strenuous exercises." [...] He drew applause when, on his 80th birthday, he grabbed his bare knees with both hands and performed a backflip. [...] A photograph of Pond's feat was published in Life magazine in June 1937.|$|E

500|$|A preview {{screening}} of Sweet Smell of Success was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were {{expecting him to}} play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview. He said, 'You didn't have to leave – you could have made this a much better picture. <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to beat you up.' I said, 'Go ahead – I could use the money.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Emerson saw a kindred {{spirit in}} Very and defended his sanity. As {{he wrote to}} Margaret Fuller, [...] "Such a mind cannot be lost". Emerson was {{sympathetic}} with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the [...] "Divinity School Address". He helped Very publish a small volume, Essays and Poems in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the Western Messenger between 1838 and 1840 {{as well as in}} The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, [...] "Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but I felt a little sad at the aspect of the piece." [...] He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work.|$|E
500|$|As {{a member}} of Harvard's class of 1829, Holmes lived at {{home for the first}} few years of his college career rather than in the dormitories. Since he {{measured}} only [...] "five feet three inches when standing in a pair of substantial boots", the young student had no interest in joining a sports team or the Harvard Washington Corps. Instead, he allied himself with the [...] "Aristocrats" [...] or [...] "Puffmaniacs", a group of students who gathered in order to smoke and talk. As a town student and the son of a minister, however, he was able to move between social groups. He also became a friend of Charles Chauncy Emerson (brother of Ralph Waldo Emerson), who was a year older. During second year, Holmes was one of 20 students awarded the scholastic honor Deturs, which came with a copy of The Poems of James Graham, John Logan, and William Falconer. Despite his scholastic achievements, the young scholar admitted to a schoolmate from Andover that he did not [...] "study as hard as <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> to'. He did, however, excel in languages and took classes in French, Italian and Spanish.|$|E
