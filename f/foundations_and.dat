5|$|According to the Constitution of 1831, the Belgian {{government}} {{was allowed to}} override {{the wishes of the}} King if he had been declared incompetent to reign. On 28 May 1940, under pressure from the French government, the Pierlot government in France declared the King to be under the power of the invaders and unfit to reign according to article 82, providing strong legal <b>foundations</b> <b>and</b> making itself the only official source of government. The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.|$|E
5|$|All {{buildings}} have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and {{were supported by}} large stone columns. These stone columns {{can be seen in}} several buildings such as the Lovamahapaya (brazen palace). Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned, and terra cotta pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the Kuttam Pokuna (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, bricks and stones. Stones were used for <b>foundations</b> <b>and</b> columns, while brick were used for walls. Lime mortar was used for plastering walls.|$|E

5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched the history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical <b>foundations</b> <b>and</b> implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in physics.|$|E
5|$|Excavation of {{the site}} began in 1971, and became the largest {{to be carried out}} by modern methods on any European monastic site. It {{revealed}} the <b>foundations</b> <b>and</b> lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; a floor of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the kiln where the tiles were fired; a bell casting pit used for casting the bell; and a large medieval statue of SaintChristopher.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, {{commissioned}} by the painter Lluís Graner, he designed the decoration of the Sala Mercè, in the Rambla dels Estudis, {{one of the first}} cinemas in Barcelona; the theatre imitated a cave, inspired by the Coves del Drac (Dragon's Caves) in Mallorca. Also for Graner he designed a detached house in the Bonanova district of Barcelona, of which only the <b>foundations</b> <b>and</b> the main gate were built, with three openings: for people, vehicles and birds; the building would have had a structure similar to the Casa Batlló or the porter's lodge of the Park Güell.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, UBS {{made its}} first {{acquisition}} in the United States, purchasing Chase Investors Management Corporation, the asset management business of Chase Manhattan Bank. Chase Investors, which was established in 1972, was subsequently folded into UBS Asset Management after the acquisition. At {{the time of the}} acquisition, which resulted in approximately US$100million for Chase, the business managed in excess of US$30billion in public and private pension plans, as well as various financial assets of corporations, governments, <b>foundations</b> <b>and</b> endowments.|$|E
5|$|Later in the decade, Millwall {{established}} {{a record of}} 59 home games without defeat (43 wins and 16 draws) from 22 August 1964 to 14 January 1967. During this spell, Millwall played 55 different teams, kept 35 clean sheets, scored 112 goals and conceded 33. This was thanks largely to managers Billy Gray, who laid the <b>foundations,</b> <b>and</b> Benny Fenton, a former player who continued to build on Gray's side. All the players, which included winger Barry Rowan, goalkeeper Alex Stepney and strikers Hugh Curran and Len Julians, were presented with a commemorative gold cigarette lighter by the Football Association. The record was eventually broken by Liverpool, who were unbeaten for 63 games at home between 1978 and 1981.|$|E
5|$|Significant Roman finds include {{parts of}} shops and houses {{that would have}} fronted onto Ermine Street, down which Roman armies marched {{to and from the}} Legionary Fortress at Lincoln. The city of Lincoln was very {{important}} at that time, probably the capital of the late Roman Province of Flavia Caesariensis. Evidence suggests that Navenby was a significant staging point along Ermine Street. The Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village, and a possible Romano-British temple and burial sites have been unearthed in the area. A 2009 archaeological dig uncovering a road, building <b>foundations</b> <b>and</b> Roman graves along with pottery and coins, showed Navenby to be a Roman Service Station.|$|E

5|$|The Cub {{section is}} open to boys and girls {{between the ages of}} 7 and 11, and is {{intended}} to lay <b>foundations</b> <b>and</b> teach basic skills for when a Cub becomes a Scout. The Cub programme is based on a system of progressive leadership, with members being given increasing responsibility depending on age as they advance through the Cub Pack. Cubs are divided into small groups called Sixes led by a Sixer and a Second. The Pack Scouter may appoint the most responsible Cub in the Pack as a Senior Sixer.|$|E
5|$|The Eco Beach {{tourist resort}} was only built to resist wind gusts of Category3 strength. Only about 10 of the 40 {{accommodation}} huts were left standing. Some of the huts {{were removed from}} their concrete <b>foundations,</b> <b>and</b> were carried by the winds and smashed into other buildings. Showing how strong Rosita's winds were, a sea container weighing 2.5 tonnes (5500 lb) and filled with 2 to 3 tonnes (4400 to 6600lb) of equipment was blown 700m (0.4mile) across sand dunes. The magnitude of the devastation to the vegetation in this area resembled a place being destroyed by bushfires.|$|E
5|$|The Fujita {{scale and}} the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. An EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees but not {{substantial}} structures. An EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their <b>foundations</b> <b>and</b> can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.|$|E
