5|$|The {{firewall}} scans for Internet-enabled {{applications and}} creates access rules {{based on a}} knowledge base maintained by Symantec during installation. In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, <b>Intrusion</b> <b>Detection</b> with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides notifications for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put the computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Intrusion</b> <b>Detections</b> Systems(IDSs) in ad hoc net-works monitor {{other devices}} for {{intentional}} deviation from protocol, i. e., misbehavior. This process is complicated due to limited radio range and mobility of nodes. Unlike conventional IDSs, {{it is not}} possible to monitor nodes for long durations. As a result IDSs suffer from a large number of false positives. Moreover other environmental conditions like radio interference and congestion increase false positives, complicating classication of legitimate nodes and attackers. We present a scheme that helps in accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks in ad hoc networks. Our scheme employs cross-layer interactions based on observations at various networking layers to decrease the number of false positives. Our simulations show that our scheme is more effective and accurate than those based on isolated observations from any single layer. I...|$|R

High-traffic stations, including Taipei Main Station, Zhongxiao Fuxing, and Taipei City Hall, have platform gates to prevent passengers and other objects from falling onto the rails. For safety reasons, fifteen additional stations will be equipped with these gates in the future (including Ximen, Guting, and Banqiao). All lines and extensions currently under construction will be equipped with platform screen doors. A Track <b>Intrusion</b> <b>Detection</b> System has also been installed to improve passenger safety at stations without platform doors.

40|$|We {{consider}} the sequence comparison problem, {{also known as}} "hidden pattern" problem, where one searches for a given subsequence in a text (rather than a string understood as a sequence of consecutive symbols).

25|$|Manipulation of the buffer, {{which occurs}} {{before it is}} read or executed, {{may lead to the}} failure of an {{exploitation}} attempt. These manipulations can mitigate the threat of exploitation, but may not make it impossible. Manipulations could include conversion to upper or lower case, removal of metacharacters and filtering out of non-alphanumeric strings. However, techniques exist to bypass these filters and manipulations; alphanumeric code, polymorphic code, self-modifying code and return-to-libc attacks. The same methods can be used to avoid detection by <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> systems. In some cases, including where code is converted into unicode, the threat of the vulnerability has been misrepresented by the disclosers as only Denial of Service when in fact the remote execution of arbitrary code is possible.|$|E

25|$|The {{prior art}} {{qualification}} for the Live Traffic paper {{centered on the}} public accessibility of a document available on a FTP server. SRI argued that the FTP site was not publicly accessible because one would need the complete FTP address to view the paper. Additionally, the posting was not indexed and could only be found by an ordinary skilled user through “dumb luck”. Symantec and SSI countered that on multiple occasions SRI had provided links to the FTP site to multiple members of the <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> community. Furthermore, SRI’s FTP site had been referenced by Google Groups and was widely regarded as a repository of information for computer security. Robinson’s examination of the case evidence noted that no {{attempts were made to}} limit access via password security. Robinson deemed the Live Traffic paper publicly accessible as established by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the precedent cases In re Bayer, In re Hall, In re Cronyn, and In re Klopfenstein. As such, Robinson ruled that the Live Traffic paper constituted as prior art and that the patents described in the publication were invalid.|$|E
40|$|With the {{spreading}} {{of the internet}} and online procedures requesting a secure channel, it has become an inevitable requirement to provide the network security. It is very clear that firewalls are not enough to secure a network completely because the attacks committed from outside of the network are stopped whereas inside attacks are not. This is the situation where <b>intrusions</b> <b>detection</b> systems (IDSs) are in charge. IDSs are used in order to stop attacks, recover from them with the minimum loss or analyze the security problems. String matching algorithms are essential for IDS that filter packets and flows based on their payload. This work describes the concept of single keyword pattern matching algorithms. A new improved single keyword pattern matching algorithm is proposed. The new method reduces character comparisons, faster and more reliable in network security applications. The experimental results show that the new algorithm is highly efficient. Its search time is cut down significantly compared with other popular existing algorithms and its memory occupation stays at a low level. Moreover, conclusion on results is made and direction for future works is presented...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{show that}} {{vigilance}} decreases rapidly after several minutes when human operators {{are required to}} search live video for infrequent <b>intrusion</b> <b>detections.</b> Therefore, {{there is a need}} for systems which can automatically detect targets in live video and reserve the operator`s attention for assessment only. Thus far, automated systems have not simultaneously provided adequate detection sensitivity, false alarm suppression, and ease of setup when used in external, unconstrained environments. This unsatisfactory performance can be exacerbated by poor video imagery with low contrast, high noise, dynamic clutter, image misregistration, and/or the presence of small, slow, or erratically moving targets. This paper describes a highly adaptive video motion detection and tracking algorithm which has been developed as part of Sandia`s Advanced Exterior Sensor (AES) program. The AES is a wide-area detection and assessment system for use in unconstrained exterior security applications. The AES detection and tracking algorithm provides good performance under stressing data and environmental conditions. Features of the algorithm include: reliable detection with negligible false alarm rate of variable velocity targets having low signal-to-clutter ratios; reliable tracking of targets that exhibit motion that is non-inertial, i. e., varies in direction and velocity; automatic adaptation to both infrared and visible imagery with variable quality; and suppression of false alarms caused by sensor flaws and/or cutouts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two {{fundamental}} problems in combinatorics on words and string manipulation are string matching and sequence comparison. In string matching one searches for all occurrences {{of a given}} string, understood as a sequence of consecutive symbols, in a text. In sequence comparison a subsequence rather than a string is searched in a text The string matching problem has been extensively studied in literature from algorithmic and probabilistic points of view. The sequence comparison problem, also known as hidden pattern problem, is harder {{and it has been}} much less investigated. In this paper we study the number of occurrences of a given pattern of length as a subsequence in a random text of length generated by a memoryless source. In particular, we consider two versions of this problem, namely the unconstrained one in which the subsequence can appear anywhere in the text, and the constrained one that puts bounds on the distances between symbols of the word. We determine the mean and the variance of the number of occurrences, and establish a Gaussian limit law. These results are obtained via combinatorics on words, formal languages, and methods of analytic combinatorics based on generating functions and moment methods.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, an {{innovative}} mechanism to convert a USB drive into a key has been introduced. A unique key file is written {{on to the}} drive which acts as the authentication mechanism to access the user’s computer. This device {{can be used to}} lock or unlock the system by simply removing or attaching it. The current session is not hampered even though the system is secure and cannot be accessed without the specific USB drive. To further improve security, the key file contents are rewritten after a set time interval, to preserve the security even if the drive is lost. In absence of the USB drive, the user can gain access by entering the master password. A particular system might have more than one USB keys as well, and a key can be used to access multiple systems. This mechanism was then coded into a deliverable software which implemented all the security features including possible <b>intrusion</b> <b>detections</b> and alerts. The advantage of this mechanism {{is that it is a}} faster and efficient way to temporarily pause the current session of a system without having to log out.
