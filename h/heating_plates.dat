This drastically increases the cycle time, which limits it to short runs, but to offset this is the low cost of the mould.

If only a short run is required then the moulds may be made from aluminum or brass, but if more parts are required then they are made from conventional steels.|$|E

In this paper, the infl uence {{of surface}} load of <b>heating</b> <b>plates</b> {{and degree of}} fi neness of {{champignon}} fruits (Agaricus bisporus L) on the energy consumption in the freeze drying process was studied.

When the heating load was low (form 6 to 8 kgm- 2), the degree of fi neness of raw material had no infl uence on the specifi c energy requirements needed to heat of plates and to dry the raw material. How-ever, the increase of heating load from 10 to 14 kgm- 2 resulted in the increase of specifi c energy inputs with the increasing degrees of fi neness.

40|$|Abstract. Natural {{convection}} heat transfer {{in a square}} cavity induced by <b>heated</b> <b>plate</b> is studied numerically. Top {{and bottom of the}} cavity are adiabatic, the two vertical walls of the cavity have constant temperature lower than the plate’s temperature. The flow is assumed to be two-dimensional. The discretized equations were solved by finite difference method using Alternating Direction Implicit technique and Successive Over-Relaxation method. The study was performed for different values of Grashof number ranging from 103 to 105 for different aspect ratios and position of <b>heated</b> <b>plate.</b> Air was chosen as a working fluid (Pr = 0. 71). The effect of the position and aspect ratio of <b>heated</b> <b>plate</b> on <b>heat</b> transfer and flow were addressed. With increase of Gr heat transfer rate increased in both vertical and horizontal position of the plate. When aspect ratio of <b>heated</b> thin <b>plate</b> is decreased the heat transfer also decreases.

30|$|In a {{previous}} study [4], a hot press was developed that discharges the vapor trapped inside the particleboard and thus prevents blowout. The press has holes punched in {{the upper and lower}} <b>heating</b> <b>plates.</b> High-pressure air is injected through the holes of one plate {{to the inside of the}} board and is discharged from the holes of the other plate. The high-pressure air forces out trapped vapor and prevents blowout of the board. This press is called an air-injection press.|$|E
30|$|As heat {{does not}} {{transfer}} quickly {{from the upper}} and lower <b>heating</b> <b>plates</b> {{to the center of the}} board in an ordinary hot press (Fig.  1 a, hot press), an additional heating method is needed to reduce the pressing time. Moreover, for manufacturing a thick board, long pressing time is needed owing to low heat conduction at the center of the board. Thus, other heating methods are needed for manufacturing a thick board. A hot press with a radio-frequency heating device installed has been designed to reduce the pressing time and to manufacture thicker boards (Fig.  1 c, radio-frequency hot press) [7 – 10]. This radio-frequency hot press can not only heat board surfaces between {{the upper and lower}} <b>heating</b> <b>plates,</b> but can also heat the inside of a board by radio-frequency heating. This results in simultaneous and uniform heating of the entire board and a rapid rise in temperature at the center of the board [10]. Thus, a thick board can be manufactured with reduced pressing time [11]. However, the radio-frequency hot press significantly increases the water vapor pressure inside the board because of the rapid rise in temperature; therefore, this press is likely to be more prone to inadvertent blowout than an ordinary hot press [12].|$|E
30|$|An air-injection {{press was}} {{developed}} to prevent particleboard from blowing out during the manufacturing process. The air-injection press, which has holes punched in the <b>heating</b> <b>plates,</b> injects high-pressure air into the board through the holes of one plate and releases the air through the holes of the other plate. The high-pressure air forces out vapor trapped within the board, thus preventing blowout. The newly developed press reduced the pressing time required for manufacturing board from high-moisture-content particles. However, the manufactured boards exhibited mechanical properties and dimensional stability inferior to conventionally manufactured boards.|$|E

A <b>heating</b> <b>plate</b> was used to apply thermal stimulation, and the correla-tion of culture medium temperature with varying surface temperature of the <b>heating</b> <b>plate</b> was monitored.
