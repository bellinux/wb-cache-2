Only 16 were complete before the declaration of war in September. The growing tension in Europe made war more likely. John was forced to commit himself either to de Havilland or the RAF at this juncture. The RAF <b>had</b> <b>trained</b> him and he felt he could be of far more use in the RAF than test-flying aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Deep Purple's {{members were}} {{experienced}} musicians with different musical backgrounds: Lord <b>had</b> <b>trained</b> in classical music and {{had played in}} jazz and blues rock ensembles, Blackmore and Simper came from session work in pop rock, Paice and Evans from beat bands. However, no one was an accomplished songwriter. The only one with experience in musical composition was Lord, who treated the arrangements and wrote {{the bulk of the}} music for the first album, with some guitar riffs added by Blackmore. The album shows the potential of the band but does not focus on a distinct sound. Clearly identifiable on the album are the musical styles which were developing in the UK in that period and that influenced the young musicians in Deep Purple, a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock, pop rock and hard rock, the latter mostly evident in Blackmore's guitar parts.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{disapproval of}} the union, Venizelos allowed Aspasia {{and her mother}} {{to move into the}} Royal Palace on {{condition}} that the marriage remain secret. The information leaked, however, and to escape public opprobrium Aspasia was forced to leave Greece. She fled to Rome, and then to Paris, where Alexander was allowed to join her, six months later, on condition that they did not attend official functions together. On their Parisian honeymoon, while motoring near Fontainebleau, the couple witnessed a serious car crash in which Count Kergariou's chauffeur lost control of his master's vehicle. Alexander avoided the count's car, which swerved and hit a tree. The king drove the injured to hospital in his own car, while Aspasia, who <b>had</b> <b>trained</b> as a nurse during World War I, rendered first aid. The count was seriously injured and died shortly afterward, after having both legs amputated.|$|E

Denny's work on the Scheme resulted in a clash with former Premier Sir Henry Barwell, whom he sued for libel after Barwell made statements suggesting that Denny had made false statements to induce merchants to provide goods and services.
