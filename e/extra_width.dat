25|$|The Type C barge was {{specifically}} converted {{to carry the}} Panzer II amphibious tank (Schwimmpanzer). Because of the <b>extra</b> <b>width</b> of the floats attached to this tank, cutting a broad exit ramp into {{the bow of the}} barge was not considered advisable as it would have compromised the vessel's seaworthiness to an unacceptable degree. Instead, a large hatch was cut into the stern, thereby allowing the tanks to drive directly into deep water before turning under their own motive power and heading towards shore. The Type C barge could accommodate up to four Schwimmpanzern in its hold. Approximately 14 of these craft were available by the end of September.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{dismantling}} began, TCRT had purchased {{a significant number}} of PCC streetcars. These were sold off in 1952 and 1953, still in very good operating condition. The cars ended up in Mexico City (91 cars), Newark, New Jersey (30) and Shaker Heights, Ohio (20). Relatively few places could have taken them because of their <b>extra</b> <b>width</b> and each of these buyers had significant amounts of dedicated right-of-way. For instance, the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit commuter line in Cleveland was grade-separated in many areas. The vast majority of the older wooden streetcars, mostly built by TCRT itself, were destroyed. Out of 1240 built by the company, only five have survived to be restored and operated by rail museums.|$|E
50|$|Spadina was the {{original}} name of the street from Bloor Street to Queen Street West, built by Dr. William Baldwin beginning in 1815. The southern portion was named Brock Street and remained so until 1884. Baldwin designed the street, choosing its <b>extra</b> large <b>width</b> and placing the circle that is today 1 Spadina Crescent. He named the connecting Baldwin Street after himself, and Phoebe Street to the south was named after his wife Phoebe Baldwin.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>extra</b> font <b>width</b> and weight combinations, the fonts are digitally interpolated, so that character widths scale uniformly with changing font weights. For fonts {{within a specific}} font weight, caps height, x-height, ascender and descender heights are the same. For oblique fonts, the slope is increased from 12° to the 16° of Frutiger's original drawings, and the character widths were adjusted optically. In addition, characters such as &, ®, euro sign, are redesigned, the ampersand to Frutiger's preferred true et ligature.|$|R
25|$|After {{analyzing}} {{hundreds of}} designs, and finally {{coming up with}} what {{was believed to be}} the best design, Bostich finally released the nail in 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus. Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's holding power, weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and wobbly, so the team went {{back to the drawing board}} where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the <b>extra</b> <b>width</b> of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the top portion of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall holding power.|$|E

The Midland Railway's Ripley to Heanor branch was built {{across the front of}} the Western portal with a new section of tunnel passing underneath bringing the total length at this time to 3063 yards (2801m). After the tunnel's closure the A38 road was built over the old railway track. The <b>extra</b> <b>width</b> required by the road brought about the introduction of an extra [...] wide, [...] long cylindrical culvert to the Western end of the tunnel bringing the new length to about 3083 yards (2819m).|$|E
25|$|The building's facade {{was covered}} with {{continuous}} glass windows along with alternating azure and aquamarine porcelain spandrels. The colorful design was a popular way to add color to otherwise bland urban skylines of the mid-twentieth century. The ground floor, containing the main entrance on Ervay, was covered in granite and recessed to provide <b>extra</b> sidewalk <b>width</b> for street level retail space; the second floor was covered in mosaics. Opened in 1958 as a general office building, it was popular with insurance companies, law firms, and aviation-related companies.|$|R

2500|$|The {{bridge over}} the Waimakariri River still carries the road, {{performing}} half of its original function as a road/rail bridge. [...] The road from Oxford approaches the bridge along the railway alignment as it took a much easier route than the original road; the old winding road route is visible from the current road. [...] The railway's track bed is sometimes still visible, especially around the Waimakariri Gorge area, and in Rangiora the <b>extra</b> <b>width</b> of Blackett Street reveals the route. [...] Loading banks still exist at the sites of Bennetts Junction and Carleton stations; Fernside and Springbank both still have their goods sheds, loading banks, and stockyards; replica station signs {{can be found at}} a few sites of old stations; and until 1997 East Oxford station stood behind the Oxford Working Men's Club. [...] It was relatively large for a rural New Zealand station and was once well preserved, but it fell into such a severe state of disrepair that it was demolished and all that remains are the almost indestructible station safe and the platform.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} the walk, June 15, 2012, crowds {{estimated}} {{in the tens of thousands}} gathered on the American side of the falls. On the Canadian side, the crowd was estimated at 120,000 people. Due to the location, the wire could not use supports and had to be custom made. As a result, the wire was able to sway significantly in the breeze, making the crossing more difficult than it would have otherwise been. It was the first time in Wallenda's career that he performed without guy wire stabilizers. [...] The wire was two inches (five centimeters) in diameter, significantly wider than the 5/8 of an inch wire Wallenda typically uses, and weighed roughly 8.5 tons (7,700kg). The <b>extra</b> <b>width</b> was necessary to make the cable strong enough to withstand the tension required. [...] Getting it across the Falls was a major technological challenge. [...] On June 12, a helicopter flew a yellow rope across the canyon. The rope was attached to the steel high-wire and a giant winch was used to slowly pull the wire across as the crew slowly increased tension to support the increasing weight. [...] Weighted pendulums were attached every [...] to keep the wire from twisting.|$|E

5000|$|The base {{resolution}} {{increased by}} increasing the width and keeping the height constant, for square or near-square pixels on a widescreen display, usually with an aspect ratio of either 16:9 (adding an <b>extra</b> 1/3rd <b>width</b> vs a standard 4:3 display) or 16:10 (adding an extra 1/5th). However, it is sometimes used to denote a resolution that would have roughly the same total pixel count as this, but in a different aspect and sharing neither the horizontal OR vertical resolution - typically for a 16:10 resolution which is narrower but taller than the 16:9 option, and therefore larger in both dimensions than the base standard (e.g. compare 1366x768 and 1280x800, both commonly labelled as [...] "WXGA", vs the base 1024x768 [...] "XGA").|$|R

40|$|High {{performance}} {{thin film}} transistor (TFT) {{can be a great}} driving force for display, sensor/actuator, integrated electronics, and distributed computation for Internet of Everything applications. While semiconducting oxides like zinc oxide (ZnO) present promising opportunity in that regard, still wide area of improvement exists to increase the performance further. Here, we show a wavy channel (WC) architecture for ZnO integrated TFT which increases transistor width without chip area penalty, enabling high performance in material agnostic way. We further demonstrate digital logic NAND circuit using the WC architecture and compare it to the conventional planar architecture. The WC architecture circuits have shown 2 × higher peak-to-peak output voltage for the same input voltage. They also have 3 × lower high-to-low propagation delay times, respectively, when compared to the planar architecture. The performance enhancement is attributed to both <b>extra</b> device <b>width</b> and enhanced field effect mobility due to higher gate field electrostatics control...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} wavy channel (WC) {{architecture}} thin-film transistor-based digital circuitry using ZnO as a channel material. The novel architecture allows for extending device width by integrating vertical finlike substrate corrugations {{giving rise to}} 50 % larger device <b>width,</b> without occupying <b>extra</b> chip area. The enhancement in the output drive current is 100 %, when compared with conventional planar architecture for devices occupying the same chip area.

Fabricated inverters show that WC inverters can achieve two times the peak-to-peak output voltage for the same input when compared with planar devices. In addition, WC inverters show 30 % faster rise and fall times, and can operate up to around two times frequency of the planar inverters for the same peak-to-peak output voltage.
