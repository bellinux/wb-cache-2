5|$|The 1942–43 {{season was}} Bouchard's {{breakthrough}} year {{as he finished}} leading all Canadien defencemen in points and was key to the Canadiens' first season in several years without a losing record. They finished in fourth place {{with a record of}} 19 wins, 19 losses and 12 ties. Although they lost {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, the team was building <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

5|$|Progression through Shadow of the Colossus {{occurs in}} cycles. Beginning at a central point in an {{expansive}} landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is {{then returned to}} the central point to repeat the process. To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> of the next encounter. The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{attitude}} and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation, control laws embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flight software, and actuators (reaction wheels, thrusters).

5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b> In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, Gates {{and other}} {{officials}} viewed the Corps as fraught with internal squabbling and alienated from the other services. Because of this condition, combined with the reputation gained from the Ribbon Creek incident, {{it was decided that}} Pate needed to be replaced. Gates believed Shoup was a strong leader who could steer the Corps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b> Shoup was selected over five lieutenant generals and four major generals senior to him in rank. Lieutenant General Merrill B. Twining was considered the likely appointee to the position; Lieutenant Generals Edward Pollock and Vernon E. Megee also aspired to the position of Commandant. Twining openly vied for the position and retired immediately after Shoup was selected, reportedly in protest, as did several other officers. Shoup emphasized military readiness, training, and inter-service cooperation, which differed from the political climate of the time. He rapidly gained a reputation as being extremely demanding and critical of poor performance, especially by Marine generals and leaders. He was sometimes blunt in his criticism of what he saw as poorly performing officers, to the extent that some considered him a bully.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, {{and can be used}} to talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> without giving any explicit hints.|$|E

The results showed significantly slower RTs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper and upper left directions than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other directions. The RTs were significantly slower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left <b>directions</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>directions.</b> These results suggest that <b>the</b> UFOV <b>in</b> driving may be asymmetrical among <b>the</b> meridians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visual field...|$|R

5|$|Boy Scouting uses {{a series}} of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank {{consists}} of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction,</b> which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank. Life has a First Class emblem on a red heart, and initially symbolized the first-aid and health-related merit badges that the rank required. Now it signifies that the ideals of Scouting have {{become a part of the}} Scout's life and character.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Concept mining (CM) is {{the area}} of {{exploring}} and finding links, associations, relationships, and patterns among huge collections of information. In this paper, we propose concept-based text representation, {{with an emphasis on}} using <b>the</b> proposed representation <b>in</b> different application s such as information retrieval, text summarization, and question answering. This work presents a new paradigm for concept mining by extracting the concept-based information from a raw text. At the text representation level, we introduce a sentence based conceptual ontological representation that builds concept-based representations for the whole document. A new concept-based similarity measure is proposed to measure the similarity of texts based on their meaning. The proposed approach is domain independent and it could be applied to general domain applications. The proposed approach has been applied to the domain of information retrieval and preliminary results are promising, and give an affirmation for proceeding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>directions</b> of this research. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{financial}} reforms on efficient reallocation of capital within and between sectors in South Africa using firm-level panel data for the period 1991 – 2008. The measure of efficient allocation of capital is based on the Tobin’s Q. We find that financial reforms are associated with improvements in within-sector, but not between-sector allocation of capital. These results imply that for South Africa to unleash the potential for take-off that is often associated with reallocation of resources from the primitive to modern sectors, reforms that focus beyond the financial sector are necessary. While more research is necessary to determine what would fully constitute such additional reforms, our analysis shows that reforms that improve the quality of economic institutions may be a step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction...</b>|$|R
