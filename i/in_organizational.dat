25|$|At {{the end of}} the Civil War, Augustus reorganized Roman {{military}} forces, discharging {{soldiers and}} disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, distributed through the provinces of the Empire. During the Principate, the tactical organization of the Army continued to evolve. The auxilia remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new versatile type of unit, the cohortes equitatae, combining cavalry and legionaries in a single formation could be stationed at garrisons or outposts, could fight on their own as balanced small forces or could combine with other similar units as a larger legion-sized force. This increase <b>in</b> <b>organizational</b> flexibility over time helped ensure the long-term success of Roman military forces.|$|E
