5|$|With the {{development}} of the particle accelerator {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>induction</b> was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst. His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300MeV. In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric. This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Kerst {{worked at}} General Electric Company for a year, {{working on the}} {{development}} of x-ray tubes and machines. He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>induction,</b> reaching energies of 2.3 MeV.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>induction</b> to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E

5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>induction,</b> enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E

However, {{scientists at the}} time widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly {{because they were not}} formulated mathematically. An exception was James Clerk Maxwell, who used Faraday's ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic theory. In Maxwell's model, the time varying aspect of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>induction</b> is expressed as a differential equation, which Oliver Heaviside referred to as Faraday's law even though it is slightly different from Faraday's original formulation and does not describe motional EMF.

50|$|One major {{advantage}} of this launch system compared to others is its low power consumption. The hydraulic pumps run constantly and actually use less energy than most chain lift drive motors.

5000|$|The pulse-induction {{method is}} based on <b>electromagnetic</b> pulse <b>induction</b> {{technology}} to detect rebars. Coils in the probe are periodically charged by current pulses and thus generate a magnetic field. On the surface of any electrically conductive material {{which is in the}} magnetic field eddy currents are produced. They induce a magnetic field in opposite directions. The resulting change in voltage can be utilized for the measurement. Rebars that are closer to the probe or of larger size produce a stronger magnetic field.|$|R

25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power {{is transferred to}} the rotor by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>induction,</b> much like transformer action. An {{induction motor}} resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.|$|E
30|$|As well known, the {{two modes}} of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>inductions</b> are {{available}} for 2 -D cases: the transverse magnetic (TM) mode and the transverse electric (TE) mode (e.g., page 37 in Chave and Jones 2012). In the TM mode, the magnetic field points in the strike of 2 -D structure and the electric field lies in the plane orthogonal to strike. The TE mode has the complementary set, with electric field in the strike direction and the magnetic field orthogonal to the strike. In this study, I focus the TM mode induction for evaluation of the coastal effect on GIE. As typically shown in Vozoff (1972), the apparent resistivity at a frequency rapidly changes at a vertical contact of conductivity heterogeneity, similar to coastline. Since the amplitude of magnetic field is common at the earth’s surface in the TM mode theoretically, the rapid change means less-continuous electrical field across the vertical contact. On the contrary, in the TE mode, the apparent resistivity gradually changes across the vertical contact. It means that the TE-mode electrical field can be approximately inferred by interpolation of calculated results on the 1 -D models. Therefore, the GIE estimation in the TM mode is more meaningful for the 2 -D studies.|$|R
30|$|Mapping the {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) electrical conductivity of Earth’s mantle {{has been identified}} as one of the primary scientific objectives for the Swarm multi-satellite geomagnetic mission (Friis-Christensen et al., 2006). An improved knowledge of the mantle conductivity provides an advanced understanding of the mantle’s chemical and physical properties and reflects the connectivity of constituents such as graphite, fluids and partial melt. Global 3 -D <b>electromagnetic</b> (EM) <b>induction</b> studies can thus provide complementary information to global seismic tomography (e.g. Becker and Boschi, 2002; Romanowicz, 2003), which is used to ascertain the mantle’s bulk mechanical properties.|$|R
40|$|Scattering of {{femtosecond}} laser pulses on resonant transmission and reflection gratings made of dispersive (Drude metals) and dielectric materials is studied by a time-domain numerical algorithm for Maxwell's theory of linear passive (dispersive and absorbing) media. The algorithm {{is based on}} the Hamiltonian formalism in the framework of which Maxwell's equations for passive media are shown to be equivalent to the first-order equation, ∂Ψ/∂ t = HΨ, where H is a linear differential operator (Hamiltonian) acting on a multi-dimensional vector Ψ built of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>inductions</b> and auxiliary matter fields describing the medium response. The initial value problem is then solved by means of a modified time leapfrog method in combination with the Fourier pseudospectral method applied on a non-uniform grid that is constructed by a change of variables and designed to enhance the sampling efficiency near medium interfaces. The algorithm is shown to be highly accurate at relatively low computational costs. An excellent agreement with previous theoretical and experimental studies of the gratings is demonstrated by numerical simulations using our algorithm. In addition, our algorithm allows one to see real time dynamics of long leaving resonant excitations of electromagnetic fields in the gratings in the entire frequency range of the initial wide band wave packet as well as formation of the reflected and transmitted wave fronts.

Sq variations originate from an Sq electric current system flowing in a thin ionospheric E-layer. This current system is driven by atmospheric tides of predominantly thermal origins in the ambient magnetic field of the Earth and is active on the sunlit side at midlatitudes (Campbell 1989; Yamazaki and Maute 2017).|$|R
