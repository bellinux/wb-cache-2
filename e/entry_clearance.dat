25|$|In 2000 Singh was {{appointed}} by then Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as 'Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance' between October 2000 and November 2002. The position was established in 1993 and requires a review of around 1000 randomly chosen <b>entry</b> <b>clearance</b> refusals without a right of appeal {{and looking at the}} overall quality of refusal decisions, paying particular attention to fairness, consistency and the procedures used to reach those decisions. He makes random checks on some 800-1,000 visa refusals a year to see whether decisions are consistent and fair, and makes an annual report to the Parliament of the United Kingdom suggesting any improvements he thinks necessary. Singh is the second person to hold the job â€“ his predecessor was Dame Elizabeth Anson. Rabinder Singh QC was also an independent member on a three-strong panel commissioned {{in the wake of the}} race row which erupted on Big Brother UK 2007 where Jade Goody and fellow housemates were accused of racist bullying towards Indian actress Shilpa Shetty.|$|E

50|$|The {{quality of}} <b>Entry</b> <b>Clearances,</b> (Visas), issued abroad {{in the newly}} {{controlled}} Commonwealth countries also gave cause for concern when presented at British ports. The initial assumption when the 1962 Act was introduced was that these would be taken at face value on arrival. An instruction to Immigration Officers created a general understanding that written entry conditions would only be recorded and stored in exceptional circumstances. By 1965 new instructions had been issued which, although very liberal by later standards, encouraged control officers to impose conditions more often and to refuse people who had clearly obtained <b>entry</b> <b>clearances</b> by misrepresentation.|$|R

50|$|Cairns was {{established}} by Europeans as a port {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century.

50|$|Port {{settlements}} {{were established}} along the Queensland coast to serve inland pastoral districts to their west. In 1859 {{a site for}} the (then) most northern settlement of Queensland {{was found on the}} excellent natural harbour, Port Denison, to service the growing Kennedy pastoral district. It was declared a Port of <b>Entry</b> and <b>Clearance</b> in March 1861 and settlers began arriving immediately.

50|$|Mackay was {{declared}} a port of <b>entry</b> and <b>clearance</b> in February 1863, following {{the opening of}} the Pioneer River district to pastoral settlement in 1862. Early activity centred on the south bank of the river, along River Street. Stores were constructed to receive wool from the hinterland and dray-loads of copper from Peak Downs. With the establishment of the sugar industry in the hinterland in the late 1860s local agitation for improved facilities at the river port resulted in the construction of a government wharf at River Street, Mackay, opened in September 1868.|$|R

50|$|All other colonials {{not already}} {{resident}} in the UK or the Crown Dependencies lost {{the rights of}} abode {{and work in the}} UK when the Act went into force. This caused anger in the affected colonies as the Act, which resulted from the desire to prevent ethnic-Chinese people in Hong Kong with UK and Colonies Citizenship from migrating to the UK prior to the planned 1997 hand-over of the colony to China, was seen as racist, especially as those colonials in affected colonies who possessed a qualifying connection to the UK sufficient to retain either British citizenship or a right to remain (in the UK) notification in their BDTC passports were usually white. The former colonials also objected to being described as dependent, especially in Bermuda, which had been self-reliant virtually since 1612, and largely self-governed since 1620. This resentment was exacerbated when full British citizenship was returned to Gibraltarians, ensuring that those from territories perceived as having negligible non-white populations retained free movement into the UK, with rights of abode and work, as did many of the whites in the remaining coloured colonies. Most non-whites in those remaining territories, by contrast, could only enter the UK as short-term visitors (with a date stamped in their passports by which they must exit) or with difficult-to-obtain <b>entry</b> <b>clearances.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{lack of a}} {{specific}} biomarker makes preclinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) impossible, and it precludes assessment of therapies aimed at preventing or reversing {{the course of the}} disease. The development of a tool that enables direct, quantitative detection of the amyloid-Î² deposits found in the disease would provide an excellent biomarker. This article demonstrates the real-time biodistribution kinetics of an imaging agent in transgenic mouse models of AD. Using multiphoton microscopy, Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) was imaged with sub-Î¼m resolution in the brains of living transgenic mice during peripheral administration. PIB entered the brain quickly and labeled amyloid deposits within minutes. The nonspecific binding was cleared rapidly, whereas specific labeling was prolonged. WT mice showed rapid brain <b>entry</b> and <b>clearance</b> of PIB without any binding. These results demonstrate that the compound PIB has the properties required for a good amyloid-imaging agent in humans with or at risk for AD...|$|R
5000|$|It is the {{interpretation}} of the rules that make immigration law so controversial. The practicalities of assessing large numbers of people arriving at ports mean that a great deal of discretion is given to the immigration officer, (although less now than was once the case). While the officer must obtain the approval of a Chief Immigration Officer or Inspector to refuse someone entry the way in which interviews are conducted and recorded are based on a lower level of proof than those in other areas of law enforcement. The immigration rules for visitors say that the immigration officer must be [...] "satisfied" [...] that the person is a genuine visitor not intending to stay longer than the rules allow and is not intending to seek employment. The idea that a relatively low ranking officer merely has to satisfy himself or herself as to the person intentions rather than prove an offence, {{as is the case in}} criminal matters, is a long-standing cause of legal and legislative tension. The level of proof is effectively a balance of probabilities rather than that of an overwhelming case being proven against the arriving passenger. In practice the immigration officer is required to conduct an in-depth interview, seek corroborative evidence from other sources and present a compelling case to a Chief Immigration Officer before refusing the person. The work of a port based immigration officer is to sift arriving passengers to detect those whose accounts of their intentions give some cause for concern. The officer will briefly interview all arriving people who are not British Citizens or EU nationals, check their document for alterations or forgery, verify any <b>entry</b> <b>clearances</b> held, assess their travel history against the stamps in their passport, check them against warnings lists and do all of this, usually, in less than two minutes. If the officer is satisfied they will stamp the passport with one of a variety of wordings, (conditions), depending on the reason for the persons stay and apply a time limit according to pre-set criteria. The pressure on port immigration officers is to do this quickly so as to satisfy various targets concerning waiting times. There has never been a quota or target for detecting and refusing inadmissible passengers - the performance standards for immigration officers at ports have always revolved around the quality of interviewing, decision making and their investigative qualities.|$|R
