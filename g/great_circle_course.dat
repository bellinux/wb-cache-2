5000|$|Converting ruler {{distance}} on the Mercator map into true (<b>great</b> <b>circle)</b> {{distance on}} the sphere is straightforward along the equator but nowhere else. One {{problem is the}} variation of scale with latitude, and another is that straight lines on the map (rhumb lines), other than the meridians or the equator, do not correspond to <b>great</b> <b>circles.</b> The distinction between rhumb (sailing) distance and <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> (true) distance was clearly understood by Mercator. (See Legend 12 on the 1569 map.) He stressed that the rhumb line distance is an acceptable approximation for true <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> distance for <b>courses</b> of short or moderate distance, particularly at lower latitudes. He even quantifies his statement: [...] "When the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> distances which are to be measured {{in the vicinity of}} the equator do not exceed 20 degrees of a <b>great</b> <b>circle,</b> or 15 degrees near Spain and France, or 8 and even 10 degrees in northern parts it is convenient to use rhumb line distances".|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the solution of a series of practical problems relevant to <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> navigation, including the determination of the true course at any point on the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> route and the determination of the lateral deviation from a desired <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> route. Intersection between two <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> or between a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> and a parallel is also analyzed. These problems are approached by means of vector analysis, which yields solutions in a very compact form that can be computed numerically in a very straightforward manner. This approach is thus particularly appealing for performing computer-aided <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> navigation...|$|R
50|$|For most {{pairs of}} {{points on the}} surface of a sphere, there is a unique <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> through the two points.

In this sense, the minor arc is analogous to “straight lines” in Euclidean geometry. The length of the minor arc of a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> is taken as the distance between two points on a surface of a sphere in Riemannian geometry where such <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> are called Riemannian <b>circles.</b> These <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> are the geodesics of the sphere.|$|R

50|$|For simplicity, Moncrieff and Hood {{had planned}} to fly a rhumb line course, {{intending}} to make landfall at Farewell Spit at the western entrance to Cook Strait. This was not the shortest course - that would have required more complicated navigation to fly a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>course</b> - but the difference over the trans-Tasman flight was not prohibitive. Unexpected winds could cause a drift north or south of the intended course, making an exact landfall unlikely, but the Aotearoa carried no flight instruments that could detect or compensate for such a drift. The radio had no navigational capability or function.|$|E

The only submarine encountered was the USS Queenfish.

Several days prior to their scheduled arrival at Pearl Harbor, the group ran into a heavy gale, with winds in excess of 60 knots, accompanied by towering seas. Damage among the ships of the group was so extensive, they had to put into Midway for voyage repairs. A great circle route is the shortest sailing distance on the earth's spherical surface, and was taken in order to arrive home for Christmas as quickly as possible. However, it was ill-advised {{to do so in the}} North Pacific in winter, when storms such as that encountered are the norm.Thus the ships arrived later than if they had sailed the longer southern rhumb line route.

In the launch segment, four kinds of heading angle commands were presented adopting the arc method and reduction law. In the variable height flight segment, two kinds of height commands were gained by using the parabolic and exponential function. Considering the earth curvature, the formula of the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>course</b> and distance was gotten applying spherical triangle solution method, and the flight command along the route dot in the lateral plane was obtained.
