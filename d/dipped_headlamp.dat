50|$|Equipment {{includes}} <b>dipping</b> <b>headlamps</b> for {{use during}} fog {{and to prevent}} dazzle of other motorists controlled by a lever {{on the right of}} the driver.|$|R
50|$|The body is {{fitted with}} unsplinterable glass and <b>dipping</b> <b>headlamp</b> reflectors. The car's spare wire wheel and folding luggage grid are carried at the back.|$|R
50|$|At the Motor Show 1925 the 14/28 {{power output}} was {{reported}} to be 34 bhp and four-wheel brakes were standard, the same car had Barker <b>dipping</b> <b>headlamps</b> and thermostatic control of its engine's cooling water.|$|R
5000|$|For 1933 {{detailed}} refinements {{were made}} to provide more comfort and better appearance, [...] "the bodies are more imposing and the cars look lower". Bonnet flutes, lamps and bumpers were chromium-plated. The saloon's rear seats were deeper and finer quality leather upholstery provided. An eddy-free roof front, anti-glare sloping windscreen and anti-dazzle <b>dipping</b> <b>headlamps</b> were fitted, and dual electric screenwipers replaced the single vacuum instrument.|$|R
40|$|Luminous intensities of <b>dipped</b> car <b>headlamps</b> in {{directions}} {{of the eyes}} of drivers of oncoming cars (glare intensity) and the right roadside (illumination intensity) were measured (404 cars). The often too high glare intensities are mainly due to dirt and lamp age; the often too low illumination intensities are mainly due to low aim...|$|R
50|$|The {{gear change}} was {{mounted on the}} {{steering}} column. The direction indicator switch was mounted in the instrument panel. The <b>headlamp</b> <b>dip</b> switch was foot operated. The starter switch was push-operated and mounted on the floor panel below the handbrake.|$|R
50|$|In another type, {{a ratchet}} relay has a ratchet {{mechanism}} {{that holds the}} contacts closed after the coil is momentarily energized. A second impulse, in the same or a separate coil, releases the contacts. This type {{may be found in}} certain cars, for <b>headlamp</b> <b>dipping</b> and other functions where alternating operation on each switch actuation is needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} specification includes twelve volt lighting, electrically operated <b>dip</b> and switch <b>headlamps</b> and combined stop and tail lamps, single wiper with provision {{for a second}} blade, chrome finish on all bright parts, petrol gauge, bumpers etc. There is a concealed spare wheel under a metal cover on the back panel and a fold-down luggage grid.|$|R
25|$|UN R48 has {{mandated}} {{the installation}} of automatic headlamp since July 30, 2016. With Daytime running lamp equipped and operated, the <b>dipped</b> beam <b>headlamp</b> should automatically turn on if the car is driving in less than 1,000 lux ambient condition (Automatic switching condition), such as in tunnel and in dark environment. while driving in tunnel or dark environment, Daytime running lamp would make glare more evident to the upcoming vehicle driver, which in turn would influence the upcoming vehicle driver's eyesight, such that, by automatically switching the Daytime running lamp to the dipped-beam headlamp, the inherent safety defect could be solved and safety benefit ensured.|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{systems for}} {{activating}} the headlamps {{have been available}} since the mid-1960s, originally only on luxury American models such as Cadillac, Lincoln and Imperial. Basic implementations turn the headlights on at dusk and off at dawn. Modern implementations use sensors to detect the amount of exterior light.UN R48 has mandated the installation of automatic headlamp since July 30, 2016.

5000|$|The first styling change came in August 1934 with {{a change}} to the {{radiator}} when the plated surround or cowl was replaced by one painted in body colour and it was given a slight slope. Synchromesh was added to second gear and dual screenwipers, flush-fitting self-cancelling trafficators (worked by the steering) and a foot-operated <b>headlamp</b> <b>dip</b> switch were fitted. The engine controls were simplified by the adoption of automatic ignition, compensated voltage control, {{and the provision of}} a [...] "choke" [...] (combined strangler and throttle control). The saloon was given the name Lichfield and got a protruding boot which enclosed the spare wheel. During 1935 the friction dampers were replaced with hydraulic dampers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conventional approach for assessing highway visibility {{at night in}} foggy weather, based on the Visibility Level (VL) concept. The method is adapted from a nighttime visibility assessment method published earlier. First, we recall the basics of the VL concept and the associated target visibility computation model. We also recall the conventional obstacle collision scenario which serves to estimate the nighttime visibility distance {{as a function of}} pavement retroreflectivity for a given headlamp beam pattern, using the basic laws of photometry. Then we introduce the visibility impairing effects of fog. The first effect is the exponential attenuation of luminance with distance, described by Beer-Lambert law. The second effect is the veiling luminance generated by the backscattering of headlight, for which we propose an empirical model based on physically-based simulations. We apply the presented approach to low-beam and high-beam patterns in different fog conditions, and we bring quantitative proof for the need to <b>dip</b> the <b>headlamps</b> in dense fog. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of the presented approach for road operation as well as for automotive front-lighting and advanced driver aiding system design...|$|R
50|$|The {{projection}} {{of light from}} low-beam headlamps is asymmetrical. The kerbside lamp projects light forwards, while the other <b>headlamp</b> <b>dips</b> the beam down and away from oncoming traffic, {{so as not to}} dazzle drivers coming in the opposite direction. In Europe, headlamps approved for use {{on one side of the}} road must be adaptable to produce adequate illumination with controlled glare for temporarily driving on the other side of the road. This is done by affixing masking strips or prismatic lenses to a designated part of the lens or by moving all or part of the headlamp optic so all or part of the beam is shifted or the asymmetrical portion is occluded. Some cars have a built in adjustment to adapt the projection mechanically.|$|R
