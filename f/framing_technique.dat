50|$|After the Protestant reformation {{when the}} {{construction}} of new (or replacement of old) churches was resumed, wood was still the dominant material but the log technique replaced stave technique. The log construction gave a lower more sturdy style of building compared to the light and often tall stave churches. Log construction easily became structurally unstable for long and tall walls, particularly if cut through by tall windows. Adding transepts improved the stability of the log technique and is one reason why the cross-shaped floor plan was widely used during 17th and 18th centuries. For instance the Old Olden Church (1759) replaced a building damaged by hurricane, the 1759 church was then constructed in cruciform shape to make it withstand the strongest winds. Between the Reformation and modern days, log building was so predominant that some medieval stone churches (such as Søndeled Church and Lunner Church) were enlarged by adding a log-built sections. Log buildings are often covered by clapboards concealing the load-bearing structure, one exception is the uncovered logs of Bøverdal Church.

Through this article, he expounds upon the history and trajectory of Afrofuturism. He illuminates the specific functions of this genre, specifically its ability [...] "to engineer feedback between a preferred future and a becoming present" [...] and [...] "to encourage a process of disalienation." [...] Eshun deploys an unconventional framing device, inviting the reader to imagine [...] "a team of African archaeologists from the future" [...] attempting to reconstruct 20th-century Afrodiasporic subjectivity through a comparative study of various cultural media and artefacts. This <b>framing</b> <b>technique</b> can be read in terms of Eshun's notion of the [...] "chronopolitical," [...] the [...] "temporal complications and anachronistic episodes that dis- turb the linear time of progress, adjusting the temporal logics that condemned black subjects to prehistory." [...] Kodwo, following Toni Morrison among others, positions African slaves as the first modern subjects, as well as “real world” subjects of science fiction scenarios. Thus, while hegemonic future projections implicitly or explicitly exclude black subjects from (post)modernity and its attendant techno-scientific innovations and alienations, Afrofuturism highlights the Afrodiasporic subject’s fundamental role in initiating and producing modernity. In other words, Afrofuturism “reorients history,” in part in order to offer counter- or alternative futures.

A minimal model-based approach for framing in temporal logic programming is presented. Since framing destroys monotonicity, canonical models–used to define the semantics of non-framed programs–are no longer appropriate. To deal with this, a minimal model theory is developed, using which the temporal semantics of framed programs is captured. The existence of a minimal model for a given framed program is demonstrated. A synchronous communication mechanism for concurrent programs is provided by means of the <b>framing</b> <b>technique</b> and minimal model semantics...|$|E

In this study we evaluated the results of soft tissue distraction with no collateral ligament transection or volar plate removal in comparison with traditional operation of contracture re-lease and partial ligament transection and volar plate removal. Methods: In this prospective study, a total of 40 pa-tients in two equal groups (A and B) were studied. Patients suffering from chronic flexion contracture of abrasive trau-matic nature were included. Group A were treated by soft tissue distraction using pentagonal <b>frame</b> <b>technique</b> and in Group B the contracture release was followed by finger splinting. Results: Analyzed data revealed a significant differ-ence {{between the two groups}} for range of motion in the proximal interphalangeal joints (P 0. 05). There was not {{a significant difference in the}} degrees of flexion contracture between groups (P> 0. 05). Regression analysis showed that using pentagonal <b>frame</b> <b>technique</b> significantly increased the mean improvement in range of motion of proxi-mal interphalangeal joints (P< 0. 001), while the higher the preoperative flexion contracture was observed in proximal interphalangeal joints, the lower improvement was achieved in range of motion of proximal interphalangeal joints after intervention (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Soft tissue distraction using pentagonal <b>frame</b> <b>technique</b> with gradual and continuous collateral liga-ment and surrounding joint tissues distraction combined with skin Z-plasty significantly improves the range of mo-tion in patients with chronic traumatic flexion deformity of proximal and/or distal interphalangeal joints.
