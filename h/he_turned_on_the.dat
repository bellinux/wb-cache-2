He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the Southport Garrick Theatre. That September <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Blackpool Illuminations.|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east {{side of the}} river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower {{does not seem to have}} required extensive repairs.|$|E
25|$|The Maravi claimed {{descent from}} Karonga (kalonga), who took that title as king. The Maravi {{connected}} Central Africa {{to the east}} coastal trade, with Swahili Kilwa. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between Lake Malawi and {{the mouth of the}} Zambezi River. The karonga was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the Shona in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcome back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.|$|E

25|$|The galley from Napoli, which {{sailed to}} his left, was again {{showing signs of}} disorder, so he ordered it moved to the right, away from the {{approaching}} Turks. Loredan had his ships withdraw a while, in order to draw the Turks further from Gallipoli and have the sun in the Venetians' back. Once ready, Loredan led his own flagship to attack the leading Ottoman galley. Its crew offered determined resistance, and the other Ottoman galleys came astern of Loredan's ship to his left, and launched volleys of arrows against him and his men. Loredan himself was wounded by an arrow below the eye and the nose, and by another that passed through his left hand, {{as well as other}} arrows that struck him with lesser effect. Nevertheless, the galley was captured after most of its crew was killed, and Loredan, after leaving a few men of his crew to guard it, turned against a galleot, which he captured as well. Again leaving a few of his men and his flag on it, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other Ottoman ships. The fight lasted from morning to the second hour of the night. The Venetians defeated the Ottoman fleet, killing its commander and many of the captains and crews (tutti andarono pel fil di spada) and capturing six great galleys and nine galleots, according to Loredan's account, but 27 vessels in total according to Doukas. Loredan gives a detailed breakdown of the ships captured by his men: his own ship captured a galley and a galleot of 20 banks of oars; the Contarini galley captured a galley; the galley of Giorgio Loredan captured two galleots of 22 banks and two galleots of 20 banks; the Grimani galley of Negroponte captured a galley; the galley of Jiacopo Barbarini captured a galleot of 23 banks and another of 19 banks; the same for the Capello galley; the galley of Girolamo Minotto from Napoli captured the Ottoman flagship galley, which had been defeated and pursued before by the Capello galley; the Venieri and Barbarigo galleys of Candia took a galley. Venetian casualties were light, twelve killed—mostly by drowning—and 340 wounded, most of them lightly.|$|E

Rolling Stone magazine found that there were three ways in which the investigation was flawed: 1)"Confirmation bias, selective hearing and the misleading 911 call analysis", 2)"Dismissing the DNA evidence entirely" [...] and 3)"Overselling linguistic forensics and behavioral analysis as conclusive". They found that since the investigation did not unearth any new evidence, the conclusions were not new but subjective, and based upon the initial [...] "flawed" [...] police investigation.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the ships}} were being repaired, Jones {{had to deal}} with the {{consequences}} of landing in a neutral port with prizes of war. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> charm for diplomatic negotiations at The Hague and networking in Amsterdam, where he was the toast of society, known as [...] "The Terror of the English". On 8 October, the British ambassador, Sir Joseph Yorke, wrote to the rulers of the United Provinces, claiming that under international law, Jones, not being accredited by a recognised state, was a rebel and a pirate. Therefore, the two captured ships should be detained for handing back to their rightful owners. Yorke also asked that the wounded from the two ships should be taken ashore and treated at British Government expense. That request was agreed to immediately, but it was over a fortnight later, during which repair work proceeded without any hindrance, when the Dutch replied that their neutrality meant they could not judge the legality of actions between foreigners on the open sea, but that that would also apply to any attempt made by the British to retake their ships once they left port. Furthermore, Jones’s squadron was obliged to leave the Texel [...] "as soon as possible", and could not be supplied with arms or ammunition except [...] "what are absolutely necessary to carry [...] them safe to the first foreign port they can come at". Yorke replied by quoting treaties, returning to the [...] "pirate" [...] theme, and pointing out that under Dutch law, commanders of foreign naval forces were obliged to present authorisation from their governments when docking in Dutch ports. As the United Provinces did not officially recognise the government of the United States, that was a very tricky legal point, which the Dutch took quite a while to consider. To get round the problem, Pallas and Vengeance were declared officially French, and Captain Cottineau became commodore of a French squadron, his flagship the captured Serapis. With Landais barred from command until the case against him could be heard, Jones became captain of the avowedly American Alliance, not associated in any way with the newly French squadron. Several Royal Navy ships were waiting just off the coast for the day he was obliged to leave—the Dutch authorities making a great show of trying to eject him—but as winter storms made it more and more difficult for them to keep station, John Paul Jones (after recruiting another American commander, Gustavus Conyngham, who had escaped from British captivity) slipped away among a group of Dutch ships on 27 December and sailed to France.|$|E
