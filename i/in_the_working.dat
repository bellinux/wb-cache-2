5|$|Brown's 2000 Spending Review {{outlined}} a major expansion of government spending, particularly {{on health and}} education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance {{to pay for health}} spending. He also introduced working tax credits, and in his last budget as Chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3billion in pension allowances, an increase in the child tax credit, and an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> tax credit. These increases were followed by another £1billion of support for increases in the child tax credit.|$|E

He was happy with this occupation, but after a bout of tuberculosis in 1927, had {{to give it up}} as well, and started working as secretary for the party. In 1931 he was made leader of Arbeidernes Opplysningsforbund (AOF, Workers' Information Society), an institution recently created to promote education <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> class. Lie has cited the AOF as the proudest achievement of his career.|$|E

5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, 9.4% of Wigan's {{population}} was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 12.4% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this {{slight increase in}} the middle classes of Wigan was {{the decline of the}} working class population. In 1931, 38.7% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 33.5% in Wigan and 26% nationwide. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers or other miscellaneous. The slow decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> class goes against the trend for a steeper national decline, reinforcing the perception of Wigan as a working-class town.|$|E
5|$|Scandium has no {{biological}} role, but it {{is found}} in living organisms. Once reached a human, scandium concentrates in the liver and {{is a threat to}} it; some its compounds are possibly carcinogenic, even through in general scandium is not toxic. Scandium is known to have reached the food chain, but in trace amounts only; a typical human takes in less than 0.1micrograms per day. Once released into the environment, scandium gradually accumulates in soils, which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles, animals and humans. Scandium is mostly dangerous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> environment, {{due to the fact that}} damps and gases can be inhaled with air. This can cause lung embolisms, especially during long-term exposure. The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals, causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system.|$|E

5|$|The AKC {{accepted}} {{registration of}} the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers {{were introduced to the}} United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. International Kennel Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> Group. In the AKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living Miniature Schnauzer in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.|$|E
5|$|The {{council was}} a {{virtually}} full-time institution {{by the late}} fifteenth century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> of royal justice. Nominally members of the council {{were some of the}} great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings. Most of the active members of the council for most of the late Medieval Period were career administrators and lawyers, almost exclusively university-educated clergy. The most successful of these moved on to occupy the major ecclesiastical positions in the realm as bishops and, {{towards the end of the}} period, archbishops. By the end of the fifteenth century, this group was being joined by increasing numbers of literate laymen, often secular lawyers, of which the most successful gained preferment in the judicial system and grants of lands and lordships. From the reign of James III onwards, the clerically dominated post of Lord Chancellor was increasingly taken by leading laymen.|$|E
5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.|$|E

5|$|Trautmann {{was born}} on 22 October 1923 in Walle, a middle class area in west Bremen, living with his father who worked in a {{fertiliser}} factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda, a housewife. He had a brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship. The bleak economic climate of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns to sell their house and move to an apartment block <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> class area of Gröpelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941.|$|E
5|$|After the Crown {{the most}} {{important}} government institution was the Privy Council, composed of the king's closest advisers, but which, unlike in England, retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, {{some of whom were}} nominated by Parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent. The council was a virtually full-time institution by the late 15th century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> of royal justice. Nominally members of the council were some of the great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings.

25|$|In general, kennel clubs assign larger breeds {{that are}} engaged {{in some sort of}} {{physically}} active work to their Working Group.

These breeds may also be placed in a kennel club's Utility Group.|$|E
