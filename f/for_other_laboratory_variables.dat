40|$|Background and Aims: Normalization of serum {{alkaline}} phosphatase (SAP) was recently shown to correlate with better prognosis in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). We aimed at evaluating the impact of SAP improvement to below 1. 5 the upper limit of normal (ULN) on the prognosis of this cholestatic liver disease. Methods: Oxford PSC database was screened for cases diagnosed between 1980 and 2004. Cases which met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively examined for clinical parameters, laboratory values, and clinical end points (liver decompensation, liver transplantation, and liver-related deaths including cholangiocarcinoma). Cases were followed-up to 31 / 12 / 2010. Results: 139 patients were included, (87 males). Improvement of SAP to below 1. 5 ULN was achieved by 55 (40 %) patients in a median time of 2 years, compared to 84 (60 %) who did not. 3 / 55 (6 %) patients with SAP improvement reached an end point compared to 32 / 84 (38 %) patients with no SAP improvement (p < 0. 0001). 13 / 84 (15 %) patients with no SAP improvement developed cholangiocarcinoma compared to no cholangiocarcinoma in the group with SAP improvement (p = 0. 002). The end point free survival was significantly longer in patients with SAP improvement (p < 0. 0001). The significance of SAP improvement {{as a predictor of}} prognosis persisted after controlling <b>for</b> <b>other</b> clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>variables.</b> Improvement of SAP to below 1. 5 ULN was comparable to complete normalization of SAP in terms of prognosis. Conclusions: Improvement in SAP to below 1. 5 ULN is associated with better outcome and reduced risk of CCA in PSC. This was comparable to the achievement of complete normalization of SAP. © 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: We {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that}} RDW is an independent predictor of acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality in patients in the coronary care unit (CCU). Methods: In this prospective, observational study, we screened 412 adults admitted to the CCU at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1, 2014 to June 1, 2015. AKI was defined based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. The survivors were followed up for up to 2 years after hospital discharge. The primary endpoint {{of the study was}} the incidence of AKI, while the secondary endpoints of the study were in-hospital mortality and 2 -year mortality. Results: RDW was significantly correlated with the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) score, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, inflammatory marker levels, nutrition and renal function at the time of CCU admission. The incidence of AKI was much higher in the high RDW group (RDW ≥ 14. 0 %) than in the low RDW group, a finding that was confirmed by multivariable logistic regression, which showed that RDW was independently associated with the incidence of AKI (odds ratio (OR), 1. 059, 95 % coincidence interval (95 % CI), 1. 024 - 1. 095, P= 0. 001). A total of 61 patients died during their hospital stay, and baseline RDW was also an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 1. 129, 95 % CI 1. 005 - 1. 268, P= 0. 041). Patients with a high RDW exhibited significantly higher 2 -year mortality than patients with a low RDW during a median follow-up period of 19. 8 months (P&#x 3 c; 0. 001), and RDW independently predicted the risk of 2 -year mortality (HR, 1. 189, 95 % CI 1. 045 to 1. 354, P= 0. 009) in the multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis after adjustments <b>for</b> <b>other</b> clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>variables.</b> Conclusion: RDW is an independent predictor of AKI and mortality in patients in the CCU...|$|R

Our objective was to evaluate the usefulness of DNI for predicting in-hospital mortality within 30 days after surgery in patients with sepsis caused by peritonitis by means of comparing DNI, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil percentage, and C-reactive protein (CRP) before and after surgery. We performed a retrospective analysis of demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. DNI, WBC count, neutrophil percentage, and CRP were measured before surgery, and at 12 - 36 h (day 1) and 60 - 84 h (day 3) after surgery. There were 116 (73. 7 %) survivors and 44 (26. 3 %) non-survivors. The rates of septic shock, norepinephrine administration, renal replacement, mechanical ventilator therapy, and reoperation, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score- 3 (SAPS 3), and the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were greater in non-survivors.

40|$|Dedicated to Professor Dr. Erich Kaiser on the {{occasion}} of his 70 th birthday Summary: Concentrations of neopterin, which is produced by human monocytes/macrophages when stimulated by γ-interferon, were measured in urine specimens from 72 patients with lung cancer at diagnosis. Other routine clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>variables</b> were concomitantly determined. Neither neopterin nor any <b>other</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>variable</b> studied showed a significant correlation with clinical indicators of the disease (morphologic type, tumour stage, grading, lymph node status, presence of distant metastases). The cancer patients were followed up for up to 10 years, and the abilities of all variables to predict fatal outcome were assessed. In univariate survival analyses, all clinical indicators except morphologic type (P = 0. 86) were significant predictors of survival (P < 0. 002), but of all the <b>laboratory</b> <b>variables</b> studied, only neopterin was significantly predictive (P = 0. 0013).

40|$|Laboratory {{analyses}} {{represent a}} key element in veterinary medicine diagnosis providing objective information about the health status of a patient. Analytic data are interpreted by comparing them with a specific reference intervals previously determined on a reference population of healthy animals. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry recommends the use of nonparametric methods and, as a consequence, a reference sample of at least 120 healthy subjects, to obtain reliable reference intervals. Such order of magnitude for the reference sample is not always feasible especially if the <b>laboratory</b> <b>variable</b> under study is affected by several sources of variation, e. g., environmental conditions, physiological status of the animal, age, or gender. A convenient method to estimate reference intervals should be able to avoid assumptions on the probability distribution of the considered variable and produce robust results even with a limited sample size. This study presents a new statistical approach, based on data bootstrap, to estimate reference intervals for 12 blood biochemical variables in Sarda dairy sheep. The method was applied to real and simulated data from 120 to 40 animals. The reference intervals calculated with the new method remained quite constant as sample size decreased from 120 down to 60 animals, and became wider with fewer individuals. So, a minimum threshold of 60 animals could be considered a good limit to obtain reliable reference intervals for blood biochemical variables in Sarda dairy sheep.

40|$|Background: Intravenous fluids are {{commonly}} prescribed in childhood. 0. 9 % saline is the most-used fluid in pediatrics as resuscitation or maintenance solution. Experimental studies and observations in adults suggest that 0. 9 % saline {{is a poor}} candidate for fluid resuscitation. Although anesthesiologists, intensive care specialists, perioperative physicians and nephrologists {{have been the most}} active in this debate, this issue deserves some physiopathological considerations also among pediatricians. Results: As compared with so-called “balanced ” salt crystalloids such as lactated Ringer, administration of large volumes of 0. 9 % saline has been associated with following deleterious effects: tendency to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (called dilution acidosis); acute kidney injury with reduced urine output and salt retention; damaged vascular permeability and stiffness, increase in proinflammatory mediators; detrimental effect on coagulation with tendency to blood loss; detrimental gastrointestinal perfusion and function; possible uneasiness at the bedside resulting in unnecessary administration of more fluids. Nevertheless, there is no firm evidence that these adverse effects are clinically relevant. Conclusions: Intravenous fluid therapy is a medicine like insulin, chemotherapy or antibiotics. Prescribing fluids should fit the child’s history and condition, consider the right dose at the right rate as well as the electrolyte levels and <b>other</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>variables.</b> It is unlikely that a single type of fluid will be suitable for all pediatric patients. “Balanced ” salt crystalloids, although more expensive, should be preferred for volume resuscitation, maintenance and perioperatively. Lactated Ringer appears unsuitable for patients at risk for brain edema and for those with overt or latent chloride-deficiency. Finally, in pediatrics {{there is a need for}} new fluids to be developed on the basis of a better understanding of the physiology and to be tested in well-designed trials...|$|R

Moreover, the association between lymphopenia and clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>variables</b> were also studied. There were 54 (66. 7 %) non-Saudi and 27 (33. 3 %) Saudi patients with a male to female ratio of 1. 3 : 1. The mean age of the patients was 40. 4 years, ranging from (12 – 82) years with a SD of ± 18. 95. Cervical lymph nodes were the most common finding at the time of presentation. Mixed cellularity was the most frequent pathology followed by nodular sclerosis with prevalence of advanced stages of the disease in 48 (59. 2 %) and B symptoms 67 (82. 7 %). Lymphopenia was seen in 33 patients, 24 (72. 7 %) of them were above the age of 30. A comparison between Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma regarding lymphopenia, using the same number of patients after standardization for age, sex and presentation did not turn out to be significant (P > 0. 05). Relationship between lymphopenia and <b>other</b> clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>variables</b> also did not turn out to be significant with the exception of anemia where the P-value was < 0. 05. Our data demonstrated that HD is more common among males, mainly at middle age with lack of bimodal age distribution. Cervical lymphadenopathy is a common presenting sign. Similar to other developing countries the mixed cellularity type of HD was the most common type followed by the nodular sclerosis type. Lymphopenia on presentation is common among patients with HD especially above the age of 30. In order to analyze the importance of this finding as a diagnostic marker in HD, a comparison was made to NHL patients but the association was insignificant. The relationship between lymphopenia and anemia among HD patients is significant as compared to <b>other</b> clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>variables...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hospitalized {{patients}} {{frequently have}} considerable volumes of blood removed for diagnostic testing {{which could lead}} to the development of hospital-acquired anemia. Low hemoglobin levels during hospitalization may result in significant morbidity for patients with underlying cardiorespiratory and other illnesses. We performed a retrospective study and data was collected using a chart review facilitated through an electronic medical record. A total of 479 patients who were not anemic during admission were included in analysis. In our study, we investigated the incidence of HAA and found that, between admission and discharge, 65 % of patients dropped their hemoglobin by 1. 0 [*]g/dL or more, and 49 % of patients developed anemia. We also found that the decrease in hemoglobin between admission and discharge did not differ significantly with smaller phlebotomy tubes. In multivariate analysis, we found that patients with longer hospitalization and those with lower BMI are at higher risk of developing HAA. In conclusion, our study confirms that hospital-acquired anemia is common. More aggressive strategies such as reducing the frequency of blood draws and expanding the use of smaller volume tubes <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>laboratory</b> panels may be helpful in reducing the incidence of HAA during hospitalization...|$|R

The period of observation covered the years 1978 / 9, in which there were no major spills in the area. A video processor capable of generating false color renderings of any satellite image from eight density levels was used in the synoptic search <b>for</b> spills. <b>Other</b> <b>laboratory</b> equipment, and associated analyses, were used to study the thermal behavior of oil spills on water.

40|$|Proteome {{analysis}} involves {{many steps}} that generate {{large quantities of}} data in different formats. This creates a need for automatic data merging and extraction of important features from data. Furthermore, metadata need to be collected and reported to enable critical evaluation of results. Many data analysis tools are developed locally in research laboratories and are nontrivial to adapt <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>laboratories,</b> preventing optimal exploitation of generated data. The proteomics field would benefit from user-friendly analysis and data management platforms in which method developers can make their analysis tools available for the community. Here, we describe the Proteios Software Environment (ProSE) that is built around a Web-based local data repository for proteomics experiments. The application features sample tracking, project sharing between multiple users, and automated data merging and analysis. ProSE has built-in support for several quantitative proteomics workflows, and integrates searching in several search engines, automated combination of the search results with predetermined false discovery rates, annotation of proteins and submission of results to public repositories. ProSE also provides a programming interface to enable local extensions, as well as database access using Web services. ProSE provides an analysis platform for proteomics research and is targeted for multiuser projects with needs to share data, sample tracking, and analysis result. ProSE is open source software available at [URL]...|$|R
