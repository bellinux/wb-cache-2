5|$|Writing for GameSpot, {{reviewer}} Joe Fielder {{highlighted the}} graphics <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> lighting effects and varied textures, {{saying that they}} improve the gameplay experience because they {{make it easier for}} players to identify ledges and jump-off points. Douglass Perry of IGN remarked that the upgraded engine made the game look better than its predecessors, but overall considered Tomb Raider III to be outdated, especially when compared to newer engines that were released at the time. Edge felt that the old controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack of narrative and cinematic presentation.|$|E
5|$|After Dieppe the {{headquarters}} staff changed again. Lovat {{was promoted to}} brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth {{and the formation of}} a heavy weapons troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started to move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations. To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a raiding force.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} {{settlers}} of the municipality, the Islanders {{and their descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established settlers resented the Islanders <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. The newcomers {{did not know how}} to handle horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against the Apaches. Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage and the need for closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E
5|$|Chrisye {{stopped playing}} {{altogether}} until the Nasutions {{invited him to}} rejoin Gipsy <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> project with Guruh, who offered Chrisye several songs {{in which he would}} be lead singer, with lyrics written especially for him. Overcoming his depression, he joined the group as they practised at Guruh's house in Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta. The band often rehearsed late into the night; the indie project mixed Western rock and Balinese gamelan and was produced collaboratively. Recording took place in mid-1975, with only four songs completed in the first several months. It was released to critical acclaim in 1976, with a production of 5000copies. The success of Guruh Gipsy convinced Chrisye that he could sing as a soloist.|$|E

5|$|On 3 February 1997, {{the airline}} {{announced}} it had ordered six 134-seat Boeing 737-700 aircraft for NOK1.5 billion. These aircraft would be delivered in 1998, {{prior to the}} opening of the new airport at Gardermoen. In addition, the airline had an option for additional ten planes to be delivered after 2000. In 1997, Transwede started replacing its Fokker 100s with Boeing 737s. In May 1997, Braathens SAFE was criticized by the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association because it was using retired Braathens SAFE pilots to fly Transwede aircraft, due to Transwede not having certified pilots <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> Boeing 737-300. Braathens SAFE stated that this was within the rules of the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration and the Joint Aviation Authorities.|$|E
5|$|Philibert Rabezoza {{was born}} in 1923 in Ankadinandriana, a suburb of Antananarivo. His mother {{was born in}} Antananarivo and his father, a {{herdsman}} and farmer from Fianarantsoa, had previously been a singer at the Merina royal court before the colonization of Madagascar in 1897. Both of Philibert's parents were already aged {{at the time of}} his birth and they struggled to care <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> son alongside his six brothers and four sisters. As a child, Philibert assisted his family with looking after the livestock and farming their plot of land.

5|$|Six {{units were}} leased by CFL between 2000 and 2004. The Luxembourgian State Railways were {{in need of}} new diesel {{locomotives}} to overcome the three different electrification systems in use. Because of a three-year waiting time for new locomotives, CFL leased the Di6 units for freight trains between Esch-sur-Alzette, Bettembourg and Mertert. In November 2003, the locomotives were sold to Vossloh and given the designation DE 2700. Since 2006, the main leaser is the Veolia Verkehr-owned Nord-Ostsee-Bahn, which operates passenger trains in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Eight locomotives are used to haul six to ten-car passengers trains on the route between Hamburg and Sylt. In 2008, three locomotives returned to Norway, when Cargolink leased them <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> autorack freight operations. In 2009, NOB transferred its ninth unit to HSL Logistik.|$|E

5|$|The Democratic Party Tammany Hall {{political}} machine {{had been working}} to enroll immigrants as U.S. citizens so they could vote in local elections and had strongly recruited Irish, most of whom already spoke English. In March 1863, with the war continuing, Congress passed the Enrollment Act to establish a draft for the first time, as more troops were needed. In New York City and other locations, new citizens learned {{they were expected to}} register for the draft to fight <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> country. Black men were excluded from the draft as they were largely not considered citizens, and wealthier white men could pay for substitutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} engine used {{to power the}} game was christened the Diesel Engine. Grin developed this engine for flexibility and scalability, allowing the engine to be easily upgraded with new features. Based on DirectX, this meant the engine could be used across Windows and Xbox platforms. Grin worked closely with NVIDIA to incorporate then new technologies such as pixel and vertex shaders to render complex scenes. Ballistics was marketed by NVIDIA as a flagship title <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> series of GeForce 3 graphics cards. The game came bundled with various versions of the GeForce 3, with distribution of the bundled game handled by Interplay OEM. Later versions of the Diesel Engine would be used in Grin games such as the Windows version of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.|$|E
5|$|With the school's growing popularity, the Butlers saw {{the need}} for a larger space so they {{developed}} plans to build a 1,500-seat facility. In an article published in the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1997, the estimated cost of the project was quoted at $700,000, with a groundbreaking planned for April 1998. The Butlers initiated their capital campaign on February 18, 1998, with the goal of raising $1.1 million <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> building. By August 1999, they had raised $1 million of their expanded $1.6 million goal for the circus expansion, with plans to break ground on the new facility that November. Part of the funding came from Saint Paul's Sales Tax Revitalization (STAR) program, through which surplus funds were distributed by councilmembers to worthy organizations. A total of $627,183 was disbursed for the circus through the program, split between three STAR components: $450,000 as part of Neighborhood STAR which sought to fund local initiatives, $122,183 as part of Cultural STAR which funded arts and culture programs, and $55,000 from 3rd Ward City Councilmember Pat Harris's discretionary Neighborhood Investment Initiative budget. Another $60,000 came from an anonymous recently retired Saint Paul businessperson.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} 1827–40, Mary Shelley was busy {{as an editor}} and writer. She wrote the novels The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck (1830), Lodore (1835), and Falkner (1837). She contributed five volumes of Lives of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French authors to Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia. She also wrote stories for ladies' magazines. She was still helping to support her father, and they looked out for {{publishers}} for each other. In 1830, she sold the copyright for a new edition of Frankenstein for £60 to Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> Standard Novels series. After her father's death in 1836 {{at the age of}} eighty, she began assembling his letters and a memoir for publication, as he had requested in his will; but after two years of work, she abandoned the project. Throughout this period, she also championed Percy Shelley's poetry, promoting its publication and quoting it in her writing. By 1837, Percy's works were well-known and increasingly admired. In the summer of 1838 Edward Moxon, the publisher of Tennyson and the son-in-law of Charles Lamb, proposed publishing a collected works of Percy Shelley. Mary was paid £500 to edit the Poetical Works (1838), which Sir Timothy insisted should not include a biography. Mary found a way {{to tell the story of}} Percy's life, nonetheless: she included extensive biographical notes about the poems.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to remake the game for the WonderSwan Color, and Square's merger with former {{competitor}} Enix to form Square Enix in , the company posted assurance that the game's promised remake would not be completely forgotten, and there was speculation that it might find its way to Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Game Boy Advance as its predecessors had. Square Enix considered porting the game to the PlayStation 2, but was eventually convinced by Nintendo to develop the title <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> handheld system, the Nintendo DS, a decision that would later be positively reinforced by the commercial success of the Nintendo DS. The Final Fantasy III remake was first announced on October 24, 2004, but detailed information did not emerge for a year. Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director. His guidance and supervision were needed because the remake was not a mere graphical update as Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IIs remakes were, but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS's 3D capabilities. Along with 3D graphics, a full motion video opening scene was produced for the game, {{similar to those found}} in the ports of the 2D Final Fantasy games for the PlayStation. Programming was handled by developer Matrix Software.|$|E
