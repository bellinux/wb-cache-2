5|$|While {{assigned}} to the nuclear delivery role, the Victor was finished in an all-over anti-flash white colour scheme, {{designed to protect the}} aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation. The white colour scheme was intended to reflect <b>heat</b> <b>away</b> from the aircraft; paler variations of RAF's roundels were also applied for this same reason. When the V-bombers were {{assigned to}} the low-level approach profile in the 1960s, the Victors were soon repainted in green/grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation; the same scheme was applied to subsequently converted tanker aircraft.|$|E

It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.|$|E

5000|$|Generally speaking, the go <b>away</b> <b>heat</b> happens {{either because}} the fans feel the {{promotion}} {{has been pushing}} a certain wrestler (regardless of his character alignment) too far or [...] "down their throats" [...] and thus deeming him as [...] "undeserving" [...] of his push, or because his character has become stale and are not impressed (sometimes bored or annoyed too) of his performances on the ring and/or by his promos anymore. While {{it can be difficult}} to distinguish the good heat for the villain from the go <b>away</b> <b>heat,</b> with some fans and critics claiming it is indeed go <b>away</b> <b>heat</b> and others claiming it is good heat, there are a few example which are closer to be go <b>away</b> <b>heat,</b> most notably in WWE because of its major exposure. Notorious examples of the concept are The Rock as Rocky Maivia, X-Pac (who popularized the term in the early 2000s so much that go <b>away</b> <b>heat</b> is also known as [...] "X-Pac heat"), Triple H, John Bradshaw Layfield, Stephanie McMahon and more recently Roman Reigns (see Persona and reception of Roman Reigns).|$|R
25|$|Very low {{voltages}} are inefficient {{since the}} lead wires would conduct too much <b>heat</b> <b>away</b> from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts. Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the moving}} parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting <b>heat</b> <b>away</b> from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing knocking and distortion.|$|E

500|$|Studies in 2004 and 2006 {{attempted}} {{to test the}} urban heat island theory, by comparing temperature readings taken on calm nights with those taken on windy nights. [...] If the urban heat island theory is correct then instruments should have recorded a bigger temperature rise for calm nights than for windy ones, because wind blows excess <b>heat</b> <b>away</b> from cities {{and away from the}} measuring instruments. There was no difference between the calm and windy nights, and one study said that [...] "we show that, globally, temperatures over land have risen as much on windy nights as on calm nights, indicating that the observed overall warming is not a consequence of urban development." ...|$|E

2500|$|The chassis, frame, or basket, is {{designed}} to be rigid, avoiding deformation that could change critical alignments with the magnet gap, perhaps causing the voice coil to rub against the sides of the gap. Chassis are typically cast from aluminum alloy, or stamped from thin steel sheet, though in some drivers with large magnets cast chassis are preferable as sheet metal can easily be warped in whenever the loudspeaker is subjected to rough handling. Other materials such as molded plastic and damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common, especially for inexpensive, low-mass drivers. [...] Metallic chassis can {{play an important role in}} conducting <b>heat</b> <b>away</b> from the voice coil; heating during operation changes resistance, causes physical dimensional changes, and if extreme, may even demagnetize permanent magnets.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hydrophobic}} {{qualities of}} Thinsulate help prevent water absorption which helps {{to maintain the}} insulating airspace even {{in the presence of}} free water. [...] More recently, aerogel material is being added to conventional undergarments to increase the insulating properties of those garments. Polar fleece is a good insulator with good stretch, is lightweight, and dries quickly if it gets wet. It is also hypoallergenic and comfortable against the skin. Polyester liners can add to the insulation and will wick perspiration away from the skin. Cotton is not recommended as it absorbs moisture and saturates easily, and will then rapidly conduct <b>heat</b> <b>away</b> from the body.

2500|$|While {{the first}} Xbox's {{graphics}} processing unit was produced by Nvidia, the Xbox 360 had a chip designed by ATI called Xenos. The chip was developed under the name [...] "C1" [...] and [...] "R500" [...] was often {{used to refer to}} it. The GPU package contains two separate silicon dies, each built on a 90nm process with a clock speed of 500MHz; the GPU proper, manufactured by TSMC and a 10MB eDRAM daughter-die, manufactured by NEC. Thanks to the daughter die, the Xenos can do 4× MSAA, z-buffering, and alpha blending with no appreciable performance penalty on the GPU. The GPU also houses additional capabilities typically separated into a motherboard chipset in PC systems, effectively replacing the northbridge chip. It has a theoretical peak of 240 GFLOPS. Due to the GPU frequently overheating in early motherboard models, Microsoft revised the GPU heat sink in order to better move <b>heat</b> <b>away</b> from the GPU die though not completely.|$|E

The corner of this screen was turned towards the wind, and thus the fire was sheltered. A pole passed across from one of the posts to the other, and the kettle was hung upon the pole.|$|E

50|$|When wood {{is heated}} above 270 °C it begins {{a process of}} {{decomposition}} called carbonization. If air is absent the final product, {{since there is no}} oxygen present to react with the wood, is charcoal. If air, which contains oxygen, is present, the wood will catch fire and burn when it reaches a temperature of about 400-500 °C and the fuel product is wood ash. If wood is <b>heated</b> <b>away</b> from air, first the moisture is driven off and until this is complete, the wood temperature remains at about 100-110 °C. When the wood is dry its temperature rises and at about 270 °C it begins to spontaneously decompose and, at the same time, heat is evolved. This is the well known exothermic reaction which takes place in charcoal burning. At this stage evolution of the by-products of wood carbonization starts. These substances are given off gradually as the temperature rises and at about 450 °C the evolution is complete.|$|R
