5|$|Sir John Barbirolli, CH (2 December 189929 July 1970), né Giovanni Battista Barbirolli, was a British {{conductor}} and cellist. He {{is remembered}} above all as {{conductor of the}} Hallé Orchestra in Manchester, which he helped save from dissolution in 1943 and conducted {{for the rest of}} his life. Earlier in his career he was Arturo Toscanini's successor as music <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Philharmonic, serving from 1936 to 1943. He was also chief conductor of the Houston Symphony from 1961 to 1967, and was a guest conductor of many other orchestras, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonia, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic, with all of which he made recordings.|$|E
5|$|On November 24, 1922, Cather {{wrote to}} a friend, Edwin H. Anderson, <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Public Library, {{that she was the}} author of the entire book except for the first chapter. Burton J. Hendrick had written the first installment, but it had been based largely on rumor. McClure asked her to {{complete}} the series because she was regarded as impartial. For the rest of the installments, she told Anderson, no expense had been spared in verifying Milmine's material. McClure had promoted her to managing editor {{on the basis of the}} work. She ended the letter by asking Anderson to keep the information confidential; she added that had not told the truth about it to anyone before this, but felt that someone ought to know.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers {{and the house}} administration continued {{on and off for}} the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave. In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting in New York. At {{the end of the summer}} he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio, his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends—it was said that he treated his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered over the floor. After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.|$|E

25|$|While {{some public}} health officials, pediatricians, {{and social workers}} wanted to {{eliminate}} midwifery, others did not think this would solve the problem. In the 1910s and 1920s, S. Josephine Baker, <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City Bureau of Child Hygiene, advocated to keep midwives because many immigrants and African-Americans whom midwives have traditionally served could not afford the care of physicians. As such, {{the solution of the}} “midwife problem” was to train, license, and regulate them.|$|E
25|$|Allen {{was part}} of the first {{generation}} of black opera singers to achieve wide success and is viewed as part of an instrumental group of performers who helped break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world. She was greatly admired by Bernstein and the conductor notably chose her to be the featured soloist for his final performances as music <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Philharmonic in 1973. After her singing career ended, she became a lauded voice teacher and arts administrator.|$|E
25|$|From 1945 to 1947, Bernstein was the Music <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City Symphony, {{which had}} been founded the {{previous}} year by the conductor Leopold Stokowski. The orchestra (with support from the Mayor) was aimed at a different audience than the New York Philharmonic, with more modern programs and cheaper tickets. Also in regard to a different audience, in 1945 Bernstein discussed the possibility of acting in a film with Greta Garbo—playing Tchaikovsky opposite her starring role as the composer's patron Nadezhda von Meck.|$|E

In the 1990s, she served as health as CO-director of the Pacific Institute for Women's Health, a nonprofit research and advocacy group dedicated to improving women's well-being worldwide and focused on reproductive. Rodriguez-Trias was {{a founding member of}} both the Women's Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus of the American Public Health Association and the first Latina to serve {{as the president of the}} APHA.|$|E

During {{his time as}} <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> State Library (1888–1906) Dewey established a program of traveling libraries. From 1888 to 1900 Dewey served as secretary and {{executive officer of the}} University of the State of New York. In 1895 Dewey founded the Lake Placid Club with his wife Annie. He and his son Godfrey had been active in arranging the Winter Olympics which took place at Lake Placid—he chaired the New York State Winter Olympics Committee. In 1926 he went to Florida to establish a new branch of the Lake Placid Club.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the time}} he was {{appointed}} music <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Philharmonic, Bernstein composed the music for two shows. The first was for the operetta Candide, which was first performed in 1956 with a libretto by Lillian Hellman based on Voltaire's novella. The second was Bernstein's collaboration with the choreographer Jerome Robbins, the writer Arthur Laurents, and the lyricist Stephen Sondheim to produce the musical West Side Story. The first three had worked on it intermittently since Robbins first suggested the idea in 1949. Finally, with the addition of Sondheim to the team and a period of concentrated effort, it received its Broadway premiere in 1957 and has since proven to be Bernstein's most popular and enduring score.|$|E
25|$|Reviews of the 2000 census {{showed that}} African Americans have also left New York, but {{continued}} in-migration of young whites and immigrants has appeared {{to stabilize the}} white proportion of residents. Joseph J. Salvo, <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Department of City Planning's population division, noted the diversity within the white population, as older European Americans are replaced by new immigrants, including the many Hispanics who identify as white. Similarly, black out-migration from Boston since 2000 resulted in the city's becoming majority white again by 2006. In 1970 {{at the peak of}} African-American expansion in Washington, DC, blacks comprised 70% of the capital's population. The percentage of black population has decreased significantly - to 55.6% in 2007, down nearly 8% since 2000, and much more since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Bernstein {{was one of}} {{the major}} figures in orchestral {{conducting}} {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. He was held in high regard amongst many musicians, including the members of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, evidenced by his honorary membership; the London Symphony Orchestra, of which he was President; and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, with which he appeared regularly as guest conductor. He was probably the main conductor from the 1960s onwards who acquired a sort of superstar status similar to that of Herbert von Karajan, although unlike Karajan he conducted relatively little opera and part of Bernstein's fame was based on his role as a composer. As the first American-born music <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Philharmonic, his rise to prominence was a factor in overcoming the perception of the time that the top conductors were necessarily trained in Europe.|$|E
