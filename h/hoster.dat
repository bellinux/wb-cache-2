However, Lord Frey has sealed off the bridge and refuses to let the army cross, so Catelyn negotiates on her son Robb's behalf. After some hard bargaining, Frey agrees to allow the Stark army to cross through The Twins and to commit some of his troops to the conflict with the Lannisters, but, in return, he wants Robb and his sister Arya to marry two of his children, to which Robb reluctantly agrees.|$|E

25|$|Robb's forces dwindle further at the Battle of Duskendale, {{wherein the}} eastern half of the Stark's armies, under the command of Roose Bolton, are ambushed by a joint army under Gregor Clegane and Lord Randyll Tarly. More losses are taken as the army retreats. Meanwhile, the Greyjoys now hold the Neck, having taken Moat Cailin, thus barring Robb from {{returning}} to his homeland. To recapture Moat Cailin from the Greyjoys, Robb relies on the support of the Freys. When Lord <b>Hoster</b> Tully dies, Catelyn's brother Edmure becomes Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident. Robb gains renewed hope when he learns that Balon Greyjoy has died in a fall from a bridge, whereafter two of Balon's brothers, as well as his daughter Asha, vie to succeed him. The Freys propose a wedding between Edmure and Roslin Frey, one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters, to compensate for the loss of Robb's marriage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Piracy is a mass {{phenomenon}} on the Internet today. Various {{file sharing}} platforms offer {{free access to}} unau-thorised copies of copyrighted works such as media content and software. Copyright holders are using a range of legal and technical methods to protect their rights, and they are lobbying for legislation that would give them additional ways of enforcing their copyright online. However, {{little is known about}} how effective current forms of copyright enforcement are and how enduring the effect of proposed new measures can be. In this paper, we report on the results of a large-scale measurement study of the piracy ecosystem that has emerged around One-Click <b>Hosters</b> or “cyberlockers ” such as Rapidshare, Megaupload, Mediafire, and Hotfile. Our data shows that current anti-piracy efforts are visible, but their overall impact appears to be rather limited. Furthermore, our analysis of the file sharing ecosystem suggests that future anti-piracy measures that are currently under discussion may not be as successful as their proponents might expect. Ongoing legal proceedings and efforts by payment processors, however, may force <b>hosters</b> to increase their own anti-piracy efforts. I...|$|R

In this paper, we study how popular hardware virtualization approaches (OpenVZ, KVM, Xen v 4, VirtualBox, VMware ESXi) affect the network throughput of a virtualized system.

Our results provide an overview on the performance of popular hardware virtualization platforms on commodity hardware in terms of network throughput...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Service-oriented {{computing}} {{is increasingly}} assuming {{an important role}} in the research on distributed sys-tems and software engineering. It has also reached application and service <b>hosters</b> by now who need to be able to host off-the-shelf services as well as custom services. Thus, they are faced with a variety of service descriptions, service package formats and runtime demands. Each service technology usually requires a sep-arate execution platform which eventually leads to a high complexity for the administration and management of services. Similar to the unification of invocation of web services through protocol adapters, it is clearly needed to unify management aspects like monitoring and adaptation of services. We therefore propose an abstraction, a formalisation and a unification layer for hosting environments with the intent to pave the way for technology-agnostic, unified service hosting. ...|$|R

40|$|Archivists, {{journalists and}} content <b>hosters</b> often face {{the problem of}} dealing with vast amounts of {{audio-visual}} data.

40|$|Abstract. One-Click <b>Hosters</b> (OCHs) such as Rapidshare and {{now defunct}} Megaupload are popular {{services}} where users can upload and store large files. Uploaders can then share the files {{with friends or}} make them publicly available by publishing the download links in separate directories, so-called direct download or streaming sites. While OCHs have legitimate use cases, they are also frequently used to distribute pirated content. Many OCHs operate affiliate programmes to financially reward the uploaders of popular files. These affiliate programmes are controversial for allegedly financing piracy, and they were prominently cited in the criminal indictment {{that lead to the}} shutdown of Megaupload, once among the world’s 100 largest web sites. In this paper, we provide insights into how much money uploaders of pirated content could earn on a range of direct download and streaming sites. While the potential earnings of a few uploaders are non-negligible, for most uploaders these amounts are so low that they cannot rationally explain profit-oriented behaviour...|$|R
