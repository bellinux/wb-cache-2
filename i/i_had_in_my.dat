500|$|When Behan {{said he had}} {{disarmed}} them, Virgil {{attempted to}} avoid a fight. [...] "I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in my waist pants, and {{when he said he}} had disarmed them, I shoved it clean around to my left hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand." [...] Wyatt said I [...] "took my pistol, which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand, under my coat, and put it in my overcoat pocket." [...] The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot.|$|E
500|$|Chesnutt shopped {{the album}} around to record companies, but they mistook {{it for a}} demo and {{rejected}} it. They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals. He {{said in an interview}} for Vibe at the time, [...] "I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the experience <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bedroom? To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to it and you love it, then it's already done what it's supposed to do." [...] In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website, and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready, Set, Go! ...|$|E

I am almost too calm, a state {{that is necessary to}} paint all that." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Take My Life, Please" [...] {{was written}} by Don Payne and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It was the first episode of The Simpsons to air in 720p high-definition television, though {{not the first time}} The Simpsons appeared in high-definition, as The Simpsons Movie was rendered in HD. With the new broadcasting system came a new opening sequence. It was the first major permanent change to the show's introduction since the opening added in season 2; previous changes have included variations in the duration of the intro, and special one-shot introductions for the Treehouse of Horror Halloween episodes, as well as a handful of others. This new intro also includes some 3D animation when the camera pans over [...] The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told the New York Post: [...] "The clouds {{at the very beginning of}} the main title were always unsatisfying to me. My original direction to the animators was to make the clouds as realistic as possible, and as we go through the clouds we enter this cartoon universe of The Simpsons. Finally, after a couple of decades, they've gotten closer to what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind. Not perfect, but better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{like she}} did before on her {{previous}} projects Sugar & Spice and Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1, Harrison served as executive producer for K.I.S.S which entailed her scouting the producers, songwriters, arranging the album track listing, and {{keeping track of the}} accounting. Her fifth studio album Sugar & Spice was catered more to Japan's distinct sound and market, but approaching K.I.S.S., she wanted to make a classic Mýa album even if it meant digging deeper into her pockets. K.I.S.S. has a balance of mid-tempos, up-tempos, slow jams and great production. [...] "As fun as this album is, there's also lots of substance to be discovered lyrically, without getting bored or depressed", she described. In an interview with 4Eight Media, she said, [...] "The creative process was a combination of including songs that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> archive for years in addition to travelling across the U.S. and Jamaica to work with different producers and artists. She chose the songs that best worked together sonically & arranged the track listing of the album accordingly." [...] Harrison used a few songs on the album that have existed in her archive {{for a couple of years}} that finally found the appropriate place to reside. The entire album with the new material took her about 5 months to assemble & complete. Between October 2010 & February 2011.|$|E
