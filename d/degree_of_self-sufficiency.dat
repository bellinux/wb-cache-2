40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of European contract law {{in the field of}} consumer financial services gives rise to the question to what extent it is self-sufficient. A self-sufficient European contract law presupposes the existence of an EU-made and EU-enforced contract-related legal order which is largely distinct and independent from national private legal orders. In order to understand to what extent European contract law for consumer financial services reflects this pattern, the author explores the interaction between this supra-national regulatory legal order and traditional national private legal orders, and the consequences of this interplay for the extent of financial consumer protection. The author concludes that the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> European contract law is a matter <b>of</b> <b>degree</b> rather than an absolute; besides, a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> its <b>self-sufficiency</b> is not a must for ensuring a high level of consumer protection in financial services...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a dynamic, multisectoral {{model of a}} less developed economy in which investment and income distribution policies influence structural change and the pattern of trade. That is, the model considers a Keynesian 'socialised investment' function and distributional policies that, by their effect on demand, could be also described as Keynesian. The model is used to analyse the effects of different policy regimes in the Argentine economy. In an environment characterised by enduring stagnation, investment policies aimed at increasing the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> economic autonomy and self-sufficiency do not succeed in significantly changing output and trade patterns, and in reducing the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> openness of the economy. From a long term perspective, however, stagnation {{is not necessarily a}} permanent condition. A new environment of higher growth could evolve from the consolidation of a new technological paradigm and the emergence of new socioeconomic norms and mechanisms. In an environment of lower uncertainty and higher efficacy of the investment, model simulation shows that investment policy is quite successful in augmenting the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> autonomy and <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> the economy. Also, income redistribution has a positive impact on income and welfare growth. ...|$|R

An input oriented variable returns to scale frontier identified twelve efficient firms, and nine more that are technically efficient but not scale efficient. The top third’s overall efficiency score was 0. 999. For the bottom third the average efficiency score was just 0. 346, which indicates that there is substantial room for improvement amongst bottom third producers in this production system. Overall efficiency was correlated with stocking density, flock size, unit production cost and profitability, cumulative family experience of farming {{and the use of}} family labour, but not with farm size, breed choice or any proxy for individual experience or ability. Predation rates in particular were uncorrelated with productivity scores and reproductive performance was only weakly correlated with it. While most farms could theoretically improve their efficiency by intensifying their operations, a closer analysis of best practice firms revealed a spectrum of optimal intensities including the possibility of restoring rangelands by deliberate understocking. Grazing strategy and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>self-sufficiency</b> emerged as the key determinants of optimal intensity...|$|R

We sequenced its 2. 6 -Mb GC-rich chromosome and two plasmids (131 and 23 kb). Genome analysis {{suggests that it is}} adapted to cope with severe ammonia and heavy metal deficiencies that arise at high pH values. A high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> nutritional <b>self-sufficiency</b> was predicted and confirmed by growth in a minimal medium containing leucine but no other amino acids or vitamins. Genes for a complex III analog of the respiratory chain could not be identified in the N. pharaonis genome, but respiration and oxidative phosphorylation were experimentally proven. These studies identified protons as coupling ion between respiratory chain and ATP synthase, in contrast to other alkaliphiles using sodium instead. Secretome analysis predicts many extracellular proteins with alkaline-resistant lipid anchors, which are predominantly exported through the twin-arginine pathway. In addition, a variety of glycosylated cell surface proteins probably form a protective complex cell envelope. N. pharaonis is fully equipped with archaeal signal transduction and motility genes.

40|$|To reduce mission risk, long {{duration}} spaceflight {{and exploration}} activities will require greater <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> {{with regards to}} repair capability than have ever been employed before in space exploration. The current repair paradigm of replacing Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) of malfunctioning avionics and electronic hardware will be impractical, since carrying all of the spares that could possibly be needed for a long duration mission would require upmass and volume at unprecedented and unacceptable levels. A strategy of component-level repair for electronics, however, could significantly reduce the mass and volume necessary for spares and enhance mission safety via a generic contingency capability. This approach is already used to varying degrees by the U. S. Navy, where vessels at sea experience some similar constraints such {{as the need for}} self sufficiency for moderately long time periods, and restrictions on volume of repair spares and infrastructure. The concept of conducting component-level repairs of electronics in spacecraft requires the development of design guidelines for future avionics (to enable repair), development of diagnostic techniques to allow an astronaut to pinpoint the faulty component aboard a vastly complex vehicle, and development of tools and methodologies for dealing with the physical processes of replacing the component. This physical process includes tasks such as conformal coating removal and replacement, component removal, replacement, and alignment [...] all in the difficulty of a reduced gravity environment. Further, the gravitational effects on the soldering process must be characterized and accounted for to ensure reliability of the newly repaired components. The Component-Level Electronics-Assembly Repair (CLEAR) project under the NASA Supportability program was established to develop and demonstrate the practicality of this repair approach. CLEAR involves collaborative efforts between NASA s Glenn Research Center, Langley Research Center, Johnson Space Center, the National Center for Space Exploration Research, and the U. S. Navy. The project goals are 1) develop and demonstrate a manually-operated electronics repair capability to be conducted in a spacecraft environment; and 2) develop guidelines for designs of electronics that facilitates component-level repair for future space exploration efforts. This multi-faceted program utilizes a cross-disciplinary approach to examine pre- and post-repair diagnostics, conformal coating removal and replacement, component soldering, and electronics design for supportability. These areas are investigated by a combination of trade studies, ground based testing, reduced gravity aircraft testing, and actual spaceflight testing on the International Space Station (ISS) in multiple experiments. This paper details the efforts of this program, with emphasis on early trade study results, ground-based efforts, and two upcoming ISS experiments...|$|R

An affluent donor on rare occasions surprises us with a large donation, or the development office finds a lead and cultivates a relationship, bringing us in to clinch the deal for honors. But most endowment fundraising success results from hard work: developing a prospect list, working with development people who have different mindsets than ours, writing case statements, traveling to meet potential donors, and conversing with confidence, knowledge, respect, and discretion. This work is often fruitless and frustrating, but the reward is potentially so valuable—a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>self-sufficiency</b> for the program—that it justifies the time and effort.

However, Chinese organizations were weakened by inadequate resources and the diverse needs of different Chinese groups. Thus, the UK Chinese people were neither self-sufficient nor isolated from each other. The experiences of Chinese organizations further show that in spite of government expectations of community organizations, state input has been mainly in terms of regulations and control.
