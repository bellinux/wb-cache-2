5|$|As {{a result}} {{of the history of the}} {{formation}} of the United Kingdom, the cultures of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are diverse and have varying degrees of overlap and <b>distinctiveness.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{domestic}} {{cats are}} little altered from wildcats, they can readily interbreed. This hybridization poses {{a danger to}} the genetic <b>distinctiveness</b> of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary and possibly also the Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of osteopathic schools has increased, the debate over <b>distinctiveness</b> has often seen the {{leadership}} of the American Osteopathic Association at odds with the community of osteopathic physicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{molecular}} {{evidence suggests}} that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellariids and diving petrels splitting most recently. Many taxonomists used to retain the diving petrels in this family also, but today their <b>distinctiveness</b> is considered well supported.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, German {{settlers}} {{from the}} Barossa Valley travelled upstream {{to settle in}} the eastern Riverina. Because of their religious <b>distinctiveness</b> as Lutherans, they preferred to form clustered German settlements. In 1867 and 1868 several land parcels were taken up in the Jindera area. 56 German farmers, in 1869, took six weeks to travel six hundred miles in covered wagons to establish the town of Walla Walla.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Scotland {{made a major}} {{contribution}} to the British participation in {{the two world wars}} and suffered relative economic decline, which only began to be offset with the exploitation of North Sea Oil and Gas from the 1970s and the development of new technologies and service industries. This was mirrored by a growing sense of cultural and political <b>distinctiveness,</b> which {{towards the end of the}} century, culminated in the establishment of a separate Scottish Parliament within the confines of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Roy E. Halling {{designated}} a lectotype specimen in 1983 from Frost's original collections. Early molecular evidence {{suggested that the}} lilac-brown bolete was genetically distinct from the genera in which it had formerly been placed. In 2012, Halling and colleagues published molecular evidence indicating that the species did not belong in either Tylopilus or Leccinum as it does not share a recent common ancestor with either of those genera. Recognizing its genetic and morphological <b>distinctiveness,</b> they created the genus Sutorius, with S.eximius as the type species. As of 2015, the only other species in Sutorius is S.australiensis, found in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Coatbridge accent {{has been}} {{categorised}} as making less {{use of the}} Scots tongue and exhibiting a tendency to stress the 'a' vowel differently from general Scots usage. Examples of this are seen the pronunciation of the words stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) and chair (cherr). This different enunciation {{has been attributed to}} the impact of successive influxes of Ulster Catholic immigrants into Coatbridge. However, the <b>distinctiveness</b> of the Coatbridge accent and pronunciation has diminished as the various surrounding populations (especially Glasgow) have mingled with that of Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata), {{also known}} as the Puerto Rican parrot or iguaca, is the only extant bird endemic to the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico belonging to the Neotropical genus Amazona. Measuring , the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the <b>distinctiveness</b> of the form gracilipes from Culebra Island, extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the Cuban amazon (Amazona leucocephala) and the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis).|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctness}} of the Donegal tradition developed due to {{the close}} relations between Donegal and Scotland, and the Donegal repertoire and style has influences from Scottish fiddle music. For example, {{in addition to the}} standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the Donegal tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish Strathspey). The <b>distinctiveness</b> of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict between Donegal players and representatives of the mainstream tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the years}} of unification, German Jews played an {{important}} role in the intellectual underpinnings of the German professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere. Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their <b>distinctiveness</b> for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the American Medical Association (AMA) {{approved}} a measure allowing qualified osteopathic physicians as full and active {{members of the}} Association. The measure also allowed osteopathic physicians to participate in AMA-approved intern and residency programs. However, the American Osteopathic Association rejected this measure, claiming it {{was an attempt to}} eliminate the <b>distinctiveness</b> of osteopathic medicine. In 1970, AMA President Dwight L. Wilbur, M.D. sponsored a measure in the AMA's House of Delegates permitting the AMA Board of Trustees' plan for the merger of D.O. and M.D. professions. Today, a majority of osteopathic physicians are trained alongside MDs, in residency programs governed by the ACGME, an independent board of the AMA.|$|E
5|$|Hoagland and Davis (1987) {{subsequently}} {{completed a}} thorough analysis, based on electrophoresis, shell morphology, and internal anatomy, of the succineids at Chittenango Falls. They divided Succinea into two genera, keeping the Old World Succinea in the genus and elevating the New World Succinea, of the Section Novisuccinea including ovalis and chittenangoensis, to the genus level. They also {{determined that the}} Old World Succinea putris is probably a species complex and that the gray morph, although closely related to Succinea putris sensu lato, is a distinct species, which they designated Succinea sp. B. Based on these factors, the species designation Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is considered valid. Both species have been observed with red and gray morphs, bringing into question whether the earlier separation truly represented taxonomic <b>distinctiveness.</b> Currently, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, Succinea sp. B, and 3–4 Oxyloma spp. {{are considered to be}} the only succineid species present at Chittenango Falls. In 2003, the U.S. Geological Survey (T. King, unpublished data) amplified and sequenced the cytochrome oxidase I region of mitochondrial DNA and the ITS-1 region of nuclear DNA in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and Succinea sp. B. The results (sequence divergence of 10–15 percent) suggest large differences between the two species. No hybridization was observed.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the specimen was either a runt of either the yellow-breasted fruit dove or a Treron pigeon, or a hybrid instead of a unique species; however, these views are generally considered invalid {{due in part to the}} <b>distinctiveness</b> of the specimen, particularly in the bare skin around the eye, and no proper evidence has suggested that the Negros fruit dove is an invalid species. It is uncertain where the dove should be placed within the genus Ptilinopus as the male's plumage, a key feature used in organizing the Ptilinopus doves, is unknown. It has been suggested that the Negros fruit dove is either most closely related to the black-naped fruit dove or represents an early colonization of the Philippines by the genus that has left no surviving close relatives. It has no known subspecies and is also known as Ripley's fruit dove.|$|E
25|$|A genetic {{analysis}} of Irish Travellers found {{evidence to support}} the hypotheses of: (1) Irish ancestry; (2) several distinct subpopulations; and (3) the <b>distinctiveness</b> of the midland counties due to Viking influence.|$|E
25|$|The carving is {{so perfect}} {{that the overall}} {{impression}} is that of openwork lace. The <b>distinctiveness</b> and richness of the church’s decoration evidence the artistic taste and consummate skill of the craftsmen who created it.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} list {{presents the}} books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the <b>distinctiveness</b> of Sifrei Emet and Hamesh Megillot.|$|E
25|$|With the city's {{power over}} its own destiny reduced, Birmingham's {{lost most of}} its {{political}} <b>distinctiveness.</b> The General Election of 1945 was the first for 70 years in which no member of the Chamberlain family stood for Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|This {{film has}} {{impressed}} {{itself on the}} heart and mind and soul of anyone who has seen it, {{to the extent that}} filmmakers of great originality and <b>distinctiveness</b> like Robert Altman and Sam Peckinpah can be said to have remade it again and again... without compromising its uniqueness.|$|E
25|$|The {{private schools}} and colleges {{established}} by the mainline Protestant denominations, as a rule, {{still want to be}} known as places that foster values, but few will {{go so far as to}} identify those values as Christian.... Overall, the <b>distinctiveness</b> of mainline Protestant identity has largely dissolved since the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The {{decimation}} of {{its population}} {{and the loss of}} its independence meant that the cultural <b>distinctiveness</b> of Melos faded away as it was absorbed into mainstream Greek culture. Their coinage switched to the Rhodian standard (tetradrachms weighing 15.3 g) and ceased bearing the word ΜΑΛΙΟΝ. The production of its terracotta reliefs also ceased.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} a website can assume {{trademark}} quality as well, {{but only if the}} design is to a high degree remarkable. The court held that such a <b>distinctiveness</b> was not achieved by Facebook, where the logo is clearly located apart from the design, which is in its remaining parts mostly simple and functional.|$|E
25|$|Third, 2Thessalonians, like Colossians, is {{questioned}} by some on stylistic grounds, with some noting, among other peculiarities, a dependence on 1Thessalonians– yet a <b>distinctiveness</b> in language from the Pauline corpus. This, again, is explainable {{by the possibility}} that Paul requested one of his companions to write the letter for him under his dictation.|$|E
25|$|Demographers state that, due to new {{waves of}} immigration, the American {{people through the}} early 20th century were mostly {{multi-ethnic}} descendants of various immigrant nationalities, who maintained cultural <b>distinctiveness</b> until, over time, assimilation, migration and integration took place. The Civil Rights Movement through the 20th century gained passage of important legislation to enforce constitutional rights of minorities.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, however, Canada revived Third Option {{ideals of}} {{political}} and economic <b>distinctiveness</b> that was briefly lost to Joe Clark’s Progressive Conservatives from June 1979 to February 1980. Diversification and <b>distinctiveness</b> of Canadian policy were evident in Trudeau’s creation of the National Energy Program, the extension of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, and the formulation of specific Central American policy in 1982. Such advancements in Canadian policy were almost immediately contested by the United States. At any rate, Canada had good reason to be optimistic in the international sphere. Unfortunately, just as Trudeau’s policies of peace and diplomacy in Latin America began to peak the Latin American debt crisis retarded any potential growth beginning in 1982. In fact, in a four-year period between 1980 and 1984 Canadian exports to Latin America were cut in half. Despite this setback, Canadian investment in the region remained high and the government of Canada remained committed to the pursuit of mutually beneficial relations between the two regions.|$|E
25|$|The main {{expression}} of its confessional <b>distinctiveness</b> was a reformed liturgy that combined Latin and Czech languages, and practiced communion under both kinds for the laity of all ages, including little {{children as well}} as infants. Jan Hus was considered a saint and venerated as a martyr in the cause of a renewal of Christ’s Church. However better knowledge of Utraquist theology belongs among the major desiderata of historical scholarship.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of place also arises in Holden’s widely circulated updating, to Japan, of Goffman's classic “gender advertisements”. This Japanese study, Medcalf noted, demonstrates that discrepancies in the hetero-normative narrative are “not {{a result of}} post-modern, globalizing transformations, but, rather, of long standing internal cultural and historical processes and contradictions.” Such complex relationships between gender, media and local <b>distinctiveness</b> were further explored in a much-sampled 2005 article on masculinities in Japanese cooking shows.|$|E
25|$|During the 12th century, the Ottonian German {{kings and}} {{emperors}} re-established {{control over the}} mixed Slav-inhabited lands of present-day Brandenburg, although some Slavs like the Sorbs in Lusatia adapted to Germanization while retaining their <b>distinctiveness.</b> The Roman Catholic Church brought bishoprics which, with their walled towns, afforded protection from attacks for the townspeople. With the monks and bishops, {{the history of the}} town of Brandenburg an der Havel, which was the first center of the state of Brandenburg, began.|$|E
25|$|Canadian Aboriginal syllabic writing, {{or simply}} syllabics, {{is a family}} of abugidas (consonant-based alphabets) used to write a number of {{indigenous}} Canadian languages of the Algonquian, Inuit, and (formerly) Athabaskan language families. They are valued for their <b>distinctiveness</b> from the Latin script of the dominant languages and for {{the ease with which}} literacy can be achieved; indeed, by the late 19th century the Cree had achieved what may {{have been one of the}} highest rates of literacy in the world.|$|E
25|$|As the Soviet Union {{began to}} {{disintegrate}} {{at the end}} of the 1980s, ethnic tensions grew between the Abkhaz and Georgians over Georgia's moves towards independence. Many Abkhaz opposed this, fearing that an independent Georgia would lead to the elimination of their autonomy, and argued instead for the establishment of Abkhazia as a separate Soviet republic in its own right. In June 1988, a manifesto defending Abkhaz <b>distinctiveness</b> (known as the Abkhaz Letter) was sent to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.|$|E
25|$|The Malagasy {{language}} is the westernmost {{member of the}} Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. Its <b>distinctiveness</b> from nearby African languages was noted in 1708 by the Dutch scholar Adriaan Reland. It {{is related to the}} Malayo-Polynesian languages of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and more closely to the East Barito languages spoken in Borneo except for its Polynesian morphophonemics. According to Roger Blench (2010), the earliest form of language spoken on Madagascar could have had some non-Austronesian substrata.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Brittany {{was legally}} reconstituted as the Region of Brittany, {{although}} the region excluded the ducal capital of Nantes {{and the surrounding}} area. Nevertheless, Brittany retained its cultural <b>distinctiveness,</b> and a new cultural revival emerged during the 1960s and 1970s. Bilingual schools were opened, singers started to write songs in Breton, and ecological catastrophes such as the Amoco Cadiz oil spill or the Erika oil spill and water pollution because of intensive pig farming favoured new movements to protect the natural heritage.|$|E
25|$|Irish Travellers are {{recognised}} in British law as {{an ethnic}} group. In Irish law, their legal status {{was that of}} a social group, until 2017. In March 2017 they were designated an Irish indigenous ethnic group. An ethnic group is defined as one whose members identify with each other, usually {{on the basis of a}} presumed common genealogy or ancestry. Ethnic identity is also marked by the recognition from others of a group's <b>distinctiveness</b> and by common cultural, linguistic, religious, behavioural or biological traits.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} of the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) by Napoleon's French Empire and its subsequent dissolution brought about a German liberal nationalism as advocated primarily by the German middle-class bourgeoisie who advocated {{the creation of a}} modern German nation-state based upon liberal democracy, constitutionalism, representation, and popular sovereignty while opposing absolutism. Fichte in particular brought German nationalism forward {{as a response to the}} French occupation of German territories in his Addresses to the German Nation (1808), evoking a sense of German <b>distinctiveness</b> in language, tradition, and literature that composed a common identity.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{ideology}} of the EZLN reflects libertarian socialism, paralleling both anarchist and libertarian Marxist thought in many respects, the EZLN has rejected and defied political classification, retaining its <b>distinctiveness</b> {{due in part to the}} importance of indigenous Mayan beliefs to the Zapatistas. The EZLN aligns itself with the wider alter-globalization, anti-neoliberal social movement, seeking indigenous control over their local resources, especially land. Since their 1994 uprising was countered by the Mexican army, the EZLN has abstained from military offensives and adopted a new strategy that attempts to garner Mexican and international support.|$|E
25|$|East Timor {{owes its}} {{territorial}} <b>distinctiveness</b> {{from the rest}} of Timor, and the Indonesian archipelago as a whole, to being colonised by the Portuguese, rather than the Dutch; an agreement dividing the island between the two powers was signed in 1915. Colonial rule was replaced by the Japanese during World War II, whose occupation spawned a resistance movement that resulted in the deaths of 60,000 people, 13 percent of the population at the time. Following the war, the Dutch East Indies secured its independence as the Republic of Indonesia and the Portuguese, meanwhile, re-established control over East Timor.|$|E
