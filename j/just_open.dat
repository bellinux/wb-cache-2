500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "Gridlock" [...] an 8.4 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "the first great episode" [...] {{of the third}} series. He {{particularly}} praised the satire of a traffic jam, Tennant's acting, {{and the use of}} Martha as a companion to aid the Doctor's loss. Ian Berriman of SFX gave [...] "Gridlock" [...] four out of five stars. He praised the attention to detail of the props department, the appearance of the Macra, and the concept of the traffic jam, but felt there were many plot holes. He also called Travis Oliver, the actor who played Milo, [...] "wooden". Slant Magazine reviewer Ross Ruediger wrote that he did not like the episode much on first viewing because it was [...] "too busy and too chaotic to get a proper grip on" [...] but [...] "subsequent viewings proved those very qualities are the backbone of the story." [...] He initially wished {{to see more of the}} Macra. Mark Wright of The Stage was positive towards calling back to [...] "The End of the World" [...] and [...] "New Earth", and praised Agyeman and the visual look of the episode. Despite finding the ending [...] "life-affirming", he found a possible plot hole: [...] "one wonders why the Face of Boe didn't <b>just</b> <b>open</b> the roof in the first place".|$|E
2500|$|In 1913 {{the park}} was leased to the Auckland Rugby Union so it became both a summer and winter {{sporting}} venue, and in 1921 hosted the first international event, a NZ v South Africa Test. The Western part of the ground was <b>just</b> <b>open</b> space until 1950 when a temporary stand was erected for the British [...] Empire Games. In 1956 a permanent stand was built, but subsequently moved to North Harbour Stadium.|$|E
2500|$|Fifty years earlier, in an {{open the}} flap book titled See the Circus, {{published}} January 1, 1956, H. A. Rey illustrated a man who {{looks very much like}} the Man with the Yellow Hat, wearing a blue and white polka dotted kerchief. The caption for the page reads, [...] "Ted has a tricycle, so very small, He cannot ride it, because he's so tall. If {{you want to find out}} WHO the rider will be, <b>Just</b> <b>open</b> the flap, and then you will see." [...] Opening the flap reveals two monkeys riding a tricycle.|$|E

[...] "Wait 'till you see this...(door opening sound) <b>Just</b> <b>opened</b> the refrigerator...(bottle cap hits the ground) <b>just</b> <b>opened</b> one bottle...(another bottle cap hits the ground), <b>just</b> <b>opened</b> the other...(pouring sound), now he's pouring yours...(pouring sound), now he's pouring mine."

2500|$|By {{the year}} 2000, 40.7% {{of the total}} Japanese work force were female workers, with 56.9% of those women being married, {{indicating}} the path of career woman was not <b>just</b> <b>open</b> to the single women of Japan. [...] {{by the end of}} the 1990s, women were concentrated in light manufacturing work, such as food production, as well as tertiary industries, like retail business, restaurants, and financing companies. In Japan, the idea of a part-time worker is someone who works for a set period, with no bonuses or fringe benefits. Many employers used part-time women workers as supplementary labor with no chance of advancement and unstable job security.|$|E
2500|$|Orr has a {{bucktoothed}} {{smile and}} frequently puts crabapples or horse chestnuts in {{his cheeks and}} rubber balls in his hands. He constantly teases Yossarian asking him {{if he wants to}} know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd <b>just</b> <b>open</b> my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it's pretty tough to make people understand you when you're talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alamein {{itself was}} an inconsequential railway {{station on the}} coast. Some [...] to the south lay the Ruweisat Ridge, a low stony ridge that {{nonetheless}} gave excellent observation for many miles over the surrounding desert. [...] {{to the south of}} that lay the Qattara Depression. The line the British chose to defend stretched between the sea and the Qattara Depression, which meant that Rommel could outflank it only by taking a significant detour to the south and crossing the Sahara Desert. The British Army in Egypt recognised this before the war and had the Eighth Army begin construction of several [...] "boxes" [...] (localities with dug-outs and surrounded by minefields and barbed wire), the most developed being around the railway station at Alamein. Most of the [...] "line", however, was <b>just</b> <b>open,</b> empty desert. Lieutenant-General William Norrie (GOC XXX Corps) organised the position and started to construct three defended [...] "boxes". The first and strongest, at El Alamein on the coast, had been partly wired and mined by 1st South African Division. The Bab el Qattara box—some [...] from the coast and [...] south-west of the Ruweisat Ridge—had been dug but had not been wired or mined, while at the Naq Abu Dweis box (on the edge of the Qattara Depression), [...] from the coast, very little work had been done.|$|E

'Oh, marvellous! streaming in gold--flaming, like God's own ante-chamber.' ...|$|E

The {{light from}} four candles is falling on KATHERINE, {{who is sitting}} before the silver mirror of an old oak dressing-table, brushing her hair. A door, on the left, stands ajar. An oak chair against the wall close to a recessed window is all the other furniture. Through this window the blue night is seen, where a mist is rolled out flat amongst trees, so that only dark clumps of boughs show here and there, beneath a moonlit sky. As the curtain rises, KATHERINE, with brush arrested, is listening. She begins again brushing her hair, then stops, and taking a packet of letters from a drawer of her dressing-table, reads.
