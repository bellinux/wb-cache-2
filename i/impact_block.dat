50|$|From an army manual on {{pile driving}} hammers:The initial start {{up of the}} hammer {{requires}} the piston (ram) to be raised {{to a point where}} the trip automatically releases the piston, allowing it to fall by gravity. As the piston falls, it activates the fuel pump, which discharges a metered amount of fuel into the ball pan of the <b>impact</b> <b>block.</b> The falling piston also blocks the exhaust ports, and compression of fuel trapped in the cylinder begins. The compressed air exerts a pre-load force to hold the <b>impact</b> <b>block</b> firmly against the drive cap and pile. At the bottom of the compression stroke, the piston strikes the <b>impact</b> <b>block,</b> atomizing the fuel and starting the pile on its downward movement. In the instant after the piston strikes, the atomized fuel ignites, and the resulting explosion exerts an even greater force on the already moving pile, driving it further into the ground. The reaction of the explosion rebounding from the resistance of the pile drives the piston upward. As the piston rises, the exhaust ports open, releasing the gases and force of the explosion into the atmosphere. After the piston stops its upward movement, it again falls by gravity to start another cycle.|$|E

The residual kinetic energy in the sample is significantly small when the impact head and the sample separation are separated because the mass of the sample (approximately 0.7  g) is considerably smaller than that of the <b>impact</b> <b>block</b> (570  g).|$|E

When the tube was impacted by the plate, the impact contact force can be measured by the load sensor. The <b>impact</b> <b>block</b> was raised when the peak force was reached. Two types of lubrication conditions, namely, dry and water(deionized water), were obtained at room temperature.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} for river engineers is the design of hydraulic structures which can control rivers natural dynamics {{and at the same}} time assure their environmental sustainability. In fact, especially in the last few decades, ecological and biological hydraulic structure's impact has become more and more important. Thus the main problem is to design an eco-friendly structure which is able to conjugate the traditional hydraulic scopes with a minimization of the environmental <b>impact.</b> <b>Block</b> ramps can be one possible solution. Block ramps are hydraulic structures which are generally used in mountain river restoration projects. They consist of either loose or fixed rocks disposed on a sloping bed. They can be inserted in stream corridors and can also be used as fish passages, as they don't break river morphology. Block ramps are structures which dissipate a big amount of energy, both on the ramp bed and in the downstream stilling basin. The dissipation is due to the localized stream slope variations and the high roughness conditions. Generally, a hydraulic jump takes place downstream of the ramp toe, thus a scour depth is formed which has to be controlled in order to assure the structure stability. The scour control can both be done by using a particular stilling basin granulometry downstream of the ramp toe or inserting structures like sills in opportune spatial positions in the stilling basin, which consent to minimize the scour lengths...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a new breakaway connection-for use in large roadside sign structures-with improved performance characteristics relative to existing breakaway connection designs. By using a hybrid combination of steel and fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) structural components, a new system was designed to resist statically equivalent hurricane wind loading, but also breakaway under direct vehicle impact loading. By replacing the heavier steel sign posts that have been used in previous designs with lighter FRP posts, and simultaneously introducing the use of innovative steel cutting surfaces that are engaged only during direct vehicle impact loading, occupant risks associated with collisions were reduced in severity, thereby producing improving safety. Since the performance standard for the design of roadside breakaway connections is currently the AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH), the new connection system developed in this study was designed to meet the MASH requirements. However, since MASH is a relatively new standard, existing (i. e., previously-developed) designs of surrogate vehicles-used in impact testing of breakaway hardware-that meet the current MASH requirements were not available in the literature. Therefore, to facilitate physical testing of newly developed prototype connections, a MASH-compliant surrogate vehicle first had to be designed, fabricated, and validated. Hence, a secondary {{objective of this}} study was to develop a new 'small car' (1100 kg) surrogate vehicle for use in conjunction with the FDOT pendulum impact testing facility. In the course of pursuing this objective, several innovative and improved methods for designing surrogate impact vehicles were developed in this study [...] A key improvement was using tapered (trapezoidal) aluminum honeycomb cartridges, rather than the traditionally employed rectangular (constant cross-section) cartridges, to the reproduce the force-deformation behavior of the target production (market) vehicle (a 2006 Kia Rio in this study) [...] Additionally, the behavior of aluminum honeycomb at high levels of compressive stress (and deformation) was investigated using experimental testing and the findings were integrated into the surrogate vehicle design process. Validation crash-testing of the final surrogate vehicle (i. e., a combination of an <b>impact</b> <b>block</b> and a crushable nose constructed from aluminum honeycomb cartridges) demonstrated an acceptable match to the behavior of the target vehicle. Subsequently, the newly developed MASH-compliant surrogate vehicle was used to experimentally evaluate, using pendulum impact testing, multiple prototypes of a new hybrid (FRP and steel) breakaway connection design. The final design was demonstrated to meet the impact risk requirements stipulated in MASH as well as the hurricane wind resistance requirements specified by AASHTO and FDOT...|$|E

40|$|A {{rockfall}} is a mass instability event frequently {{observed in}} road cuts, open pit mines and quarries, steep slopes and cliffs. After its detachment, the rock mass may disaggregate and break {{due to the}} impact with the ground surface, thus producing new rock fragments. The consideration of the fragmentation of the rockfall mass is critical for the calculation of the trajectories of the <b>blocks</b> and the <b>impact</b> energies and {{for the assessment of}} the potential damage and the design of protective structures. In this paper, we present RockGIS, a GIS-based tool that simulates stochastically the fragmentation of the rockfall, based on a lumped mass approach. In RockGIS, the fragmentation is triggered by the disaggregation of the detached rock mass through the pre-existing discontinuities just before the impact with the ground. An energy threshold is defined in order to determine whether the <b>impacting</b> <b>blocks</b> break or not. The distribution of the initial mass between a set of newly generated rock fragments is carried out stochastically following a power law. The trajectories of the new rock fragments are distributed within a cone. The fragmentation model has been calibrated and tested with a 10, 000 m 3 rockfall that took place in 2011 near Vilanova de Banat, Eastern Pyrenees, Spain.

To date, {{there is still no}} comprehensive experimental data set investigating the underlying mechanisms of such effect. The bullet effect illustrates the fact that the capacity of a rockfall mesh depends on the size and speed of the <b>impacting</b> <b>block.</b> This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the effect of block size and mesh geometry (aperture and wire diameter) on the mesh performance. The results clearly show that the amount of energy required to perforate the mesh drops as the blocks get smaller. They also suggest that the mesh performance reaches a maximum and reduces to zero when the mesh cannot sustain the static load imposed by very large blocks. The outcome of the first series validates an analytical model for mesh perforation, making it the first simple model capturing the bullet effect. A second series of tests focused on the effect of mesh geometry and it was found that decreasing the mesh aperture by 19 % improves the performance by 50 % while only an extra 30 % could be gained by increasing the wire diameter by 33 %.
