5000|$|The famous nomadic battle {{tactic of}} the feigned retreat is easily {{recognizable}} [...] During this battle, the Hungarians applied every specific military maneuvres of the nomadic armies, presented very well by the Byzantine emperor Leo VI the Wise {{in his work}} Tactica: [...] "Hungarians love mostly to fight from the distance, to lay in ambush, to encircle the enemy, to feign retreat and to turn back, to use dispersing military maneuvres". As Aventinus points, the Hungarians used many tricks, fast movements, sudden attacks and disappearances from the battlefield, and these totally confused the enemy commanders, who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>knew</b> what to do, did not understand which is a decisive attack, or which is just for bluff. As a result, the Germans were demoralized and the unity had been loosened in the armies actions, and their battle order was compromised. In the end, when the decisive moment came, when, thanks to the relentless Hungarian attacks and misleading tactics and psychological warfare, the battle order and {{the control of the}} commanders was totally lost, and the soldiers were completely demoralized, tired, losing any hope, the Hungarians suddenly attacked them from front, back and sides, encircled and annihilated the southern corp led by Archbishop Dietmar. From this description one can suppose that the decisive moment of {{the first day of the}} battle was that the Hungarians, with the tactic of the feigned retreat, lured the army corp of Dietmar in a trap, which had to be a place which was near to a wood or a river bed or an accidented terrain, where a part of the Hungarian units were hidden, and when the German soldiers arrived there, chasing the feignly fleeing Magyar army, they suddenly came out, attacked from back and sides the Germans, and together with the main army, which turned back, encircled and annihilated Dietmar's forces. This was preceded by those attacks and retreats of the Hungarian archer troops, about which Aventinus writes, which resulted the loosening the enemies endurance, fighting spirit, and inflict in it desperation and uncertainty about what to do, which later easened their decision to attack with disintegrated battle order, which brought their destruction. All this time it seems that Luitpold, whose army was on the northern bank of the Danube, was unable to help Dietmar's forces, because he could not pass the river, although the fleet under the command of Prince Sieghard was still there, but it is not known why this did not happened. Perhaps the fleet by an unknown reason moved apart from the proximity of the land forces, and this moment was used by the Hungarian army to attack and destroy the southern army corps led by the archbishop. Nevertheless, this first day of the battle brought with it the slaughter of the southern corps of the attacking army, including Archbishop Dietmar, the bishops Utto of Freising and Zachariah of Säben-Brixen, the abbots Gumpold, Hartwich and Heimprecht.|$|E
5000|$|From 9 October Görgei {{is named}} colonel, than {{after the battle}} of Schwechat, at 1 November he is named Genaral and {{appointed}} commander of the Army of the Upper Danube, having the duty to watch the western frontier of Hungary against the imminent attack of the imperial army. In the meantime left until the attack (14 December 1848), Görgei reorganizes his army, sending home the national guards and the peasant militias (who {{were the first to}} flee from the battlefield after some enemy shootings, in the battle of Schwechat), which had a very low value in fighting against a highly professional army, like the imperial army, and multiply the number of the battalions of the Hungarian Honvéd army, training them for the future battles. He debates with Kossuth about how to organize an effective defense of the border, and is forced to accept Kossuth's idea of aligning his units along the border, although he thinks that grouping them further back from the border would be a much better choice. But when, from the middle of December the Austrian troops under Windisch-Grätz advanced across the Lajta (the border between Austria and Hungary), attacking Hungary in order to crush the revolution, Görgei slowly retreats, angering with this Kossuth, who thinks that he should fight for every toehold of Hungarian territory. Görgei understood that if he would had followed Kossuth's wishes, he would had been certainly crushed by the much more superior imperial army (he had 28 000 inexperienced soldiers against 55 000 imperial troops led by Windisch-Grätz). Kossuth urged every general to engage in fight with the enemy, so when Mór Perczel, before Görgei had arrived, entered in a battle with the imperial troops led by Josip Jelačić, suffered a heavy defeat at 30th December 1848 in the Battle of Mór, thus letting Görgei alone in the hopeless struggle against the hugely superior Austrian armies. [...] Görgei understood that with his inferior troops he could not stop the main Austrian army, and if he would accept a battle, he would had been suffered a decisive defeat from them, which would had sealed the fate of the Hungarian independence. In the war council held at 2 January 1849 Görgei convinced the other commanders that there is no other way, that to retreat from the capitals. In spite of the remonstrances of his political superior, Lajos Kossuth, who wanted him to accept a decisive battle before the Hungarian capitals, Görgei held to his resolution and retreated upon Vác, letting Buda and Pest in the hand of the enemy, who entered there in 5th January 1849, forcing the Hungarian government to retreat to Debrecen. This caused a negative effect among the officers of the Hungarian army of foreign origin, who left in great numbers the Hungarian army, which menaced with the total dissolution of the Hungarian army. In Vác, irritated by these events, and blaming his defeats on the interference with his strategy to defend Hungary, Görgei issued (5 January 1849) a proclamation (known as the Proclamation of Vác), throwing the blame for the recent defeats and the evacuation of the capitals upon the government (which at one moment was understood by Kossuth as a revolt against his authority), but also declaring that he with his army will not put down the weapons and will fight with all his energy and power against the imperials to defend the Hungarian revolution and the [...] "April laws". This proclamation stopped the dissolution of the army, convincing the majority of the foreign or wavering officers and soldiers to remain in the Hungarian army, and to defend Hungary with all determination. After the proclamation Görgei chose to retreat towards East through the Northern Gömör-Szepes Ore and Tátra Mountains and conducted operations on his own initiative, forcing the Austrian commander Windisch-Grätz, to send many troops to follow and encircle him, and to remain with the bulk of his army around Buda and Pest (because he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>knew</b> about the plans of Görgei, and he feared that the latter could turn towards West and attack Vienna), preventing them to attack Debrecen, where the Hungarian government had retreated, and providing time to the Hungarian troops East from Tisza to reorganize themselves. He also gathered the monetary and ore supplies from the so called Mining towns (Körmöcbánya, Selmecbánya, Besztercebánya, etc.) and sent them in Debrecen, providing the supplies which the military struggle of Hungary needed against the imperial armies. In the harsh winter, marching in the mountains, Görgei with his troops escaped several times the encirclement of the Austrian troops (at one point they escaped by opening a formerly closed mine tunnel, crossing it {{to the other side of}} the mountain), than in 5 February 1849 broke through the mountain pass of Branyiszkó, defeating General Deym in the Battle of Branyiszkó, and uniting with the Hungarian troops led by György Klapka in the Hungarian plains. The supreme command was conferred upon Henryk Dembiński by Kossuth, who did not wanted in any way to give the main commandment to Görgei. Many officers from Görgei's Army of the Upper Danube (György Kmety, Lajos Aulich), were astonished about the decision of Kossuth, of naming Dembiński as main commander, and wanted to protest against it, but Görgei ordered them to stop, and accept this decision. But when Dembiński, after making mistakes after mistakes, lost the Battle of Kápolna in 25-27 February 1849 (in which Görgei's VII. corps could not participate, because of Dembinski's wrong placement of the troops, the VII. corps arriving to the battlefield only after the battle ended), the Hungarian officers revolted against the Polish main commander, demanding the dismissal of Dembiński, and putting in charge of a Hungarian general. Among the generals which the Hungarian officers wanted to be main commander Görgei was the most popular, and in the officers meeting, held in Tiszafüred, in the presence of the governments chief commissary Bertalan Szemere, they elected Görgei as main commander, and this decision was signed also by Szemere. When he heard about this, Kossuth was angered and rushed to the military camp, declaring that he will put Görgei to be executed for this revolt, which he taught that Görgei was its organizer, but when he arrived to Tiszafüred, seeing that the majority of the officers support the latter, Kossuth was forced to accept the situation, but he declared that the final decision about who will be the main commander, will be given after he will present the events to the Parliament. In Debrecen Kossuth, and the politicians who were on his side, ignoring the wish of the Hungarian generals to name Görgei, designated Antal Vetter as main commander. But some weeks later, in the end of March 1849, Görgei was named as main commander (only temporarily) because Vetter got ill. Before this, Kossuth again hesitated, trying to find somebody else, thinking even to take the main command of the army, but when the generals, who were in charge of the Hungarian army corps of the main army (György Klapka, Lajos Aulich, János Damjanich), declared that Görgei is the most able commander for that job, he had to accept it. So Görgei became temporary high commander, only a few days before the start of the Spring Campaign.|$|E

40|$|Background: About 16 billion {{injections}} {{are administered}} each year worldwide, {{and at least}} half of them are unsafe. India contributes 25 - 30 % of the global injection load. A majority of curative injections are unnecessary. Estimates suggest that at least 50 % of the world’s injections administered each year are unsafe particularly in developing countries. Methods and materials: The Present study was a cross-sectional study done for 3 months in all the Civil Dispensaries to Assess the Knowledge, Skill and Practices of Health Care Providers working at Civil Dispensaries regarding “Safe Injection Practices” and also to compare the differences between the knowledge and actual practices among Health Care providers of District Gwalior. Result: A total of 35 Health Care Providers were taken in the study. All of them knew that the gloves should be worn during injection procedure but only 4 (11. 43 %) actually worked during the process. 10 (28. 57 %) knew that the gloves should be worn for both personal and patient safety. 5 (14. 29 %) <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>knew</b> anything about blood borne viral diseases i. e.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{differences in}} clinical and pre-clinical medical students' knowledge of nosocomial infections (NI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: Questionnaires were answered and returned by 352 of 453 student (77. 7 %). The {{results indicated that}} students knew the definition of NI (70. 1 % correct answers) and their reservoirs (86 %). The bacteria as etiological agents was the most frequent answer (76. 4 %), but 30. 9 % students <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>knew</b> at least one multidrug-resistant bacteria. About {{one half of the}} students (54. 4 %) knew that contact was the most frequent mode of NI transmission, but hand washing as preventive measure was cited by only 18. 8 % of students. Significantly statistical differences about NI in our country, etiology NI and preventive measures, and perception of risk for transmission of hepatitis B for health-care personnel were founded by year of training, by expectation that final-year medical students as more successfully, while pre-clinical students knew more about mode of NI transmission. Pre-clinical students who had previously finished nursing school knew more about multidrug-resistant bacteria than those who had finished some other secondary school, but showed a lower knowledge about definition and most important preventive measures of NI. Clinical students who had previously finished nursing school knew more about frequency NI in our country, reservoirs and preventive measures of NI than those who had finished some other secondary school.

40|$|The {{world of}} telecom is {{changing}} rapidly. Access to internet {{has changed the}} way customers use their phone. To differentiate itself from competitors, increase customer satisfaction and willingness to stay, Vodafone introduced Smart Life products. These products add value to the standard contract of the customer. The Consumer Services (CS) department {{is responsible for the}} Smart Life products. Within the department CS marketers are responsible for the communication about the Smart Life products to the customers. But the communication does not seem to meet the value and benefits for the customer and therefore the customer does not activate the products. The problem found in the CS department was that the current communication strategy was product focussed and did not stimulate the customer to activate and use the Smart Life products. The CS marketers said that they lacked insight in customer values, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>knew</b> who their customer was and that the communication strategy was not designed from a customer perspective. This resulted in the aim of the thesis: Make the CS marketers aware of a customer centric way of communicating towards a customer and support the CS marketer to design a customer centric communication strategy. To solve the problem two research questions were developed: 1, how to develop a more customer centric communication strategy. And 2, who is the Smart Life user? The research questions are answered by two qualitative researches: an internal research and an user research. The internal research investigated what factors influenced the current development process and what holds the CS marketer back from developing a customer centric communication strategy. The user research provided deep information about who the Smart Life user is and why the user uses a product. These insights of the researches are used to solve the problem in practice. The internal research obtained two focus areas where the communication strategy could be improved to be more customer centric: Understanding the customer Redesign of the development process of the communication strategy The user research led to three characteristics based on customer behaviour: • Willingness to pay (extra), • Level of consciousness on data spending • The attitude toward adopting a Smart Life product. To make use of a Smart Life product data is needed and a subscription need to be bought. To do so a customer needs a high or medium willingness to pay for data usage or a subscription. Moreover, the research showed that users who used the Smart Life products were less conscious on data spending and had a positive attitude toward adopting Smart life products. This is affected by knowledge based trust in the product and perception on what the attribute of the product can deliver to the customer. With this insights three customer profiles are found; • Enjoyer • Conscious enjoyer • Saver A saver has high level of consciousness on data spending, a low willingness to pay for a subscription or his data usage and a negative attitude toward new products. Because of this a saver will not use the Smart Life products but the enjoyer and conscious enjoyer will do. They have a higher willingness to pay and lower level of consciousness on data spending. Both profiles need a different way of communication. This results in messages with different benefits, context descriptions and characters. Character statements help to design a more personalised goal for a message and fit an enjoyer or conscious enjoyer. The following character statements were developed for the target groups: Enjoyer - An enjoyer must be approached in a enthusiastic, proactive way, the fact that the product provides comfort and takes less effort should be the main message. Conscious enjoyer - A conscious enjoyer must be approached with a cheerful message that is transparent on price and amount of data that the product will cost. Additional educating information will provide knowledge about the product and data spending which will help to get to know and trust the product and finally adopt it. The marketers needed to have more understanding of the customers and a redesign of the development process for a communication strategy was needed. As a result a workshop, consisting of 3 tools is designed. Every tool is used for another goal: • Tool 1 : Participant and facilitator guide: preparation for the workshop • Tool 2 : The customer canvas: get to know the customer & brainstorm about their needs. • Tool 3 : Communication strategy canvas: customer centric design of the strategy. The tools will enable the CS marketer and the involved stakeholders to be more aware of what type of customer they target and what should be communicated to them. The tools create a new development process to design a customer centric communication strategy. The customer insights from the participant and facilitator guides (tool 1) can be used to support brainstorms and decisions during the design of the strategy. Following the two other tools ensure that all stakeholders think from the customer perspective and that an overview is created of the all communication moments. Additionally the tools take care of understanding each others ideas and communicating these ideas. All together the designed solution meets the aim of this thesis. The design supports the CS marketer in creating a customer centric communication strategy. It makes the CS marketer more aware of the different kind of customers he is approaching. This transforms the product focused communication strategy into a customer focused one and results in a more personalised message towards customers.
