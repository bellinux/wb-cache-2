5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
5|$|Cameron and Comfort {{participated in}} a {{televised}} debate with atheists Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Conner of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church, in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate did not say that the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E

25|$|Hoops, {{also called}} krikoi, were {{probably}} made of bronze, iron, or copper, and were driven {{with a stick}} called the elater. The hoop was sized according to the player, as it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> {{to the level of}} the chest. Greek vases generally show the elater as a short, straight stick.

25|$|Like the Commission, the Council of Ministers has, relatively, {{lost power}} due to Treaty of Lisbon.

The Presidency of the Council, which continues to rotate among Member States every 6 months, has lost influence: the Prime minister of the country in question no longer chairs the European Council, its foreign minister no longer represents the EU externally (that is now done by the High Representative).|$|E

[...] Max stated that [...] "Inflikted" [...] {{was supposed to go}} towards Soulfly's sixth studio album Conquer, but he wanted to do the song with Igor. For legal reasons, they could not use Inflikted as the band name. According to Max, [...] "A lot of people had used it before, so he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with something else." [...] When trying to find a name, he [...] "blurted out" [...] Cavalera Conspiracy, and Igor liked it. Max added, [...] "I think I like it better than Inflikted.

500|$|As such, {{executive}} producer and writer Russell T Davies <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> {{with a story}} that had {{a good reason to}} keep the Doctor and Rose out. Davies was inspired by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "The Zeppo" [...] and the [...] episode [...] "Lower Decks", both of which focused on atypical characters. Davies described the episode, [...] "It's an experimental script. Not so experimental that people will run away screaming from Saturday-night BBC1, because you can experiment too much. People still want a bit of a monster and a bit of a thrill and a bit of the Doctor, so it still delivers as normal Doctor Who. But just as you think you know everything this programme can do, this puts a little bit of spin on it." [...] The episode had the working title of [...] "I Love the Doctor". The acronym [...] "LINDA" [...] was previously used on the British children's television programme Why Don't You?, which featured the [...] "Liverpool Investigation 'N' Detective Agency". Russell T Davies worked on the series for some years.|$|E
500|$|Scholastic Books {{published}} a novelization of Blaster Master, written by Peter Lerangis under the pen name [...] "A.L. Singer". The book {{was part of}} the Worlds of Power series – a collection of loose novelizations of various NES games. He wrote similar novelizations for Ninja Gaiden, Infiltrator, and [...] As with the other books in the series, all acts of violence portrayed in the games, including any death scenes, were removed. As a result, the bosses were portrayed in the book as [...] "holographic projections placed over formless blobs". Shawn Struck and Shawn Sharkey from 1UP.com said that Blaster Master was the hardest book for Lerangis to write {{because of the lack of}} a middle plot; he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with details that were not in the game to connect the game's actual opening and conclusion. Sunsoft would use Lerangis' novel as the plot for the game's sequel, Blaster Master: Blasting Again, making the novel the only one in the Worlds of Power series to be canonized in a video game series.|$|E
500|$|The first {{image the}} Coens and Raimi {{conceived}} was of Norville Barnes about {{to jump from}} the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came {{as a result of a}} plot device. Joel remembers, [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] was {{animated}} in a {{very complicated}} manner. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director MacMullan stated {{that a couple of}} sequences in the episode were [...] "reaching too far" [...] for the animation process to be [...] "reassembled correctly". One example, she mentioned, is the scene in which Marge remembers Ziff's assault from [...] "The Way We Was". Ziff's assault is shown as hands reaching for Marge, and was put together by MacMullan in post-production. Right after Marge's sisters Patty and Selma send an e-mail to Ziff, the e-mail's path is elaborately shown through a [...] "trip through the computer wires". MacMullan stated that, even though she found the scene [...] "illogical", she maintained that it was [...] "done with great effort". Because the characters at Ziff's prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe, the animators <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with new designs for the character's clothes. Several of the designs were pitched and drawn by Ron Hauge, a former Simpsons writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on the series for many years. The dance that Ziff performs at the prom was pitched by MacMullan, and the prom locale was drawn using a photo reference. A scene in the episode shows Homer and Lenny signing on to become oil workers. The manager who hands them a paper clip can be seen smoking, and originally, MacMullan suggested that the manager [...] "puts his lit cigarette out in the [...] can , and blows his other arm off." [...] She pitched the idea to Jean, who responded by writing [...] "I wouldn't." [...] The episode's complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led the Simpsons animators to start calling MacMullan [...] "Lauren MacMultiplane".|$|E
