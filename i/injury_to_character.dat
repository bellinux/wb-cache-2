This is in fact of the highest importance at all times, and is peculiarly so at the outset. A wound to the feelings is sometimes inflicted by a single transaction, which produces a lasting <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> the <b>character.</b> Children are very sensitive to ridicule or disgrace, and some are most acutely so. A cutting reproof administered in public, or a punishment which exposes the individual to the gaze of others, will often burn far more deeply into the heart than the teacher imagines.|$|R

Or to be told,--Sin is no more clever, politic, or successful here, than hereafter. The wrong-doing which looks to you so prudent is folly.
