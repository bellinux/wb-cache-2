The energy flow continues on its path if the frog is ingested by predators, parasites, or as a decaying carcass in soil. This energy flow diagram illustrates how {{energy is lost}} as it fuels the metabolic process that transform the energy and nutrients into biomass. Right: An expanded three link energy food chain (1. plants, 2. herbivores, 3. carnivores) illustrating the relationship between food <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> and energy transformity. The transformity of energy becomes degraded, dispersed, and diminished from higher quality to lesser quantity as the energy within a food chain flows from one trophic species into another.

25|$|Based on The ACS-Zachry Preliminary Financial Plan (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C) {{funding the}} TTC-35 Corridor awarded to ACS-Zachry showed that 22%(1) {{of the initial}} {{infrastructure}} costs were shown to be funded with equity provided by ACS-Zachry. The other 78% was to be provided by bank loans or bonds arranged by ACS-Zachry. Based on then-current federal regulations these bonds could have been tax-exempt. It was also noted in the financial plan that ACS-Zachry expected to have 12% return on investment for their equity partners. The 12% return was after taxes, {{which would have been}} approximately equivalent to 16% before taxes. The plan called for paying off the bank loans and the bonds prior to retiring the equity as shown in cash <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> of the Preliminary Financial Plan (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C). With usual bond financing there is a 3:1 ratio between total fees collected and value of capital infrastructure built. With TTC-35 the ratio was in the order of magnitude of 13:1. So while TTC-35 committed to construct $8 billion in infrastructure ACS-Zachry expected to collect $114 billion in toll revenues as shown in the preliminary plan. A report by the Texas State Auditor estimated the toll to be collected for TTC-35 to be $104 billion or more, confirming the order of magnitude of tolls collected.|$|E

A decennium later Alexander Hamilton Church (1908/10) would further develop this system by introducing the concept of production factors, and picturing the [...] "Principles of Organization by Production Factors" [...] around any organization.

40|$|The Department of Energy Office of Fissile Materials Disposition (DOE-MD) is {{planning}} a facility to disassemble pits and convert the plutonium in the pits into a form suitable for international inspection. The facility, called the Advanced Recovery and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) Facility, must handle much of the 38. 2 metric tons of plutonium declared excess to national security needs in ten years of operation. A process logic <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> for the ARIES Facility is presented here. This <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> is based on and supported by a library of fact sheets on topics that impact {{the design of the}} facility. Developing the <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> raised issues that significantly impact the design of the facility. These issues are discussed later in this document, and for some issues, discussed in greater detail in the appropriate fact sheets. The <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> is designed to show requirements that dictate the need for space and/or equipment. In physically designing the facility, the same space or equipment may be used to meet several requirements. The <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> merely shows the activities that need to occur to meet requirements for the facility. The <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> is not associated with any DOE site. The requirements shown on the <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> may be met by an existing facilities at a given site. The <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> and this write up do not contain a great deal of detail on how each step in the diagram is performed.

5000|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>diagram</b> is a {{collective}} {{term for a}} <b>diagram</b> representing a <b>flow</b> or set of dynamic relationships in a system. The term <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> is also used as a synonym for flowchart, and sometimes as a counterpart of the flowchart.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{the case}} that the biomass of each trophic level {{decreases}} {{from the base of the}} chain to the top. This is because energy is lost to the environment with each transfer as entropy increases. [...] About eighty to ninety percent of the energy is expended for the organism’s life processes or is lost as heat or waste. Only about ten to twenty percent of the organism’s energy is generally passed to the next organism. [...] The amount can be less than one percent in animals consuming less digestible plants, and it can be as high as forty percent in zooplankton consuming phytoplankton. [...] Graphic representations of the biomass or productivity at each tropic level are called ecological pyramids or trophic pyramids. [...] The transfer of energy from primary producers to top consumers can also be characterized by energy <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Biomass {{represents}} stored energy. However, {{concentration and}} quality of nutrients and energy is variable. Many plant fibers, for example, are indigestible to many herbivores leaving grazer community food webs more nutrient limited than detrital food webs where bacteria are able to access and release the nutrient and energy stores. [...] "Organisms usually extract {{energy in the form}} of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These polymers have a dual role as supplies of energy as well as building blocks; the part that functions as energy supply results in the production of nutrients (and carbon dioxide, water, and heat). Excretion of nutrients is, therefore, basic to metabolism." [...] The units in energy flow webs are typically a measure mass or energy per m2 per unit time. Different consumers are going to have different metabolic assimilation efficiencies in their diets. Each trophic level transforms energy into biomass. Energy <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> illustrate the rates and efficiency of transfer from one trophic level into another and up through the hierarchy.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} compactly representing {{a large number of}} state sequences, e. g., sequences of activities, as a <b>flow</b> <b>diagram.</b> We argue that the <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> representation gives an intuitive summary that allows the user to detect patterns among large sets of state sequences. Simplified, our aim is to generate a small <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> that models the flow of states of all the state sequences given as input. For a small number of state sequences we present efficient algorithms to compute a minimal <b>flow</b> <b>diagram.</b> For a large number of state sequences we show that it is unlikely that efficient algorithms exist. More specifically, the problem is W[1]-hard if the number of state sequences is taken as a parameter. We thus introduce several heuristics for this problem. We argue about the usefulness of the <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> by applying the algorithms to two problems in sports analysis. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms on a football data set and generated data. Comment: 18 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
