500|$|Steiger {{was offered}} the title role in Patton (1970), but turned it down {{because he did not}} want to glorify war. The role was then given to George C. Scott, who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance. Steiger called this refusal his [...] "dumbest career move", remarking, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> high horse. I thought I was a pacifist." [...] Instead, he chose to portray Napoleon Bonaparte {{opposite}} Christopher Plummer in Sergei Bondarchuk's Waterloo (1970), a co-production between the Soviet Union and Italy. One commentator wrote: [...] "I watched with extraordinary respect, no, that is not the right word, with enthusiasm, the acting of Rod Steiger in the role of Napoleon in Waterloo," [...] while literary critic Daniel S. Burt describes Steiger's Napoleon as an [...] "unusual interpretation", finding him less convincing than Plummer's Wellington.|$|E

2500|$|Warhol was gay. Interviewed in 1980, he {{indicated}} {{that he was still}} a virgin—biographer Bob Colacello who was present at the interview felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably [...] "a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use his [...] word abstract". Warhol's assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. It has also been contradicted by his lovers, including Warhol muse BillyBoy who has said they had sex to orgasm: [...] "When he wasn't being Andy Warhol and when you were just alone with him he was an incredibly generous and very kind person. What seduced me was the Andy Warhol who I saw alone. In fact when I was with him in public he kind of <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> nerves….I'd say: 'You're just obnoxious, I can't bear you." [...] Asked if Warhol was only a voyeur, Billy Name also denied it, saying: [...] "He was the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity….It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York." [...] "But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front." [...] Warhol's lovers included John Giorno, Billy Name, Charles Lisanby, and Jon Gould. His boyfriend of 12 years was Jed Johnson, whom he met in 1968, and who later achieved fame as an interior designer.|$|E
