5|$|Damaged <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> raid in August 1944, U-255 was {{decommissioned}} for repairs. She {{was transferred}} {{back to the}} 13th U-boat Flotilla on 1 March 1945, and recommissioned on 2 March with Oberleutnant zur See Helmuth Heinrich in command.

5|$|Following the Japanese raid on Ceylon of March–April 1942, the Eastern Fleet was {{transferred}} from its base at Trincomalee, {{to the other}} side of the Indian Ocean: Kilindi in Kenya. From there the fleet undertook local patrols, escorted convoys and occasionally despatched ships to operations in the Mediterranean. During Operation Vigorous, a convoy to Malta in June 1942, Nestor was serious damaged <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> raid and slowly sank.|$|E
50|$|On the {{situation}} comedy Family Ties, Elyse Keaton learns {{that she is}} pregnant <b>in</b> <b>an</b> episode <b>aired</b> <b>in</b> September 1984.

50|$|Another {{controversy}} {{took place}} in June 2011, when <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aired</b> report about the 15M movement were included images of riots between the protesters and the police that actually belonged to demonstrations in Greece, being clearly visible Greek flags and policemen.|$|R
40|$|The viable micropopulation found, at {{altitude}} over <b>a</b> city, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> land <b>air</b> {{mass was}} significantly higher than that found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> marine-influenced <b>air</b> mass. The percentage distribution of bacteria and fungi was approximately equal in both types of air masses. This indicates that, under the conditions of the experiment, the marine air mass was influenced by the land area over which it traveled during passage from its source to the sampling area. Activities taking place within the city significantly increased the micropopulation at altitude. This increase was quantitatively so small that it was not identifiable when the micropopulation moving into the city was high—as <b>in</b> <b>a</b> land <b>air</b> mass—but was recognizable when the micropopulation was low—as <b>in</b> <b>a</b> marine-influenced <b>air</b> mass. The modification of the micropopulation at altitude by temperature inversions was shown...|$|R
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Generalleutnant Walther Wever <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> crash, Kesselring became Chief of Staff of the Luftwaffe on 3 June 1936.

5|$|Next, Radford and his {{carriers}} {{took part}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> attack and cruiser bombardment of Wake Island on 5 to 6 October 1943.

5|$|Royal Air Force {{pressed into}} service two Yugoslav-built Do 17Ks which escaped Yugoslavia {{carrying}} King Peter and gold. The aircraft were given the serials AX706 and AX707. Both aircraft were destroyed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> attack on Ismaïlia airfield on 27 August 1941.|$|E

5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E
5|$|After {{three days}} and nights of this battle, C Company of the 35th Infantry and A Company of the 29th Infantry moved up astride the Komam-ni road during the morning of August 20 to bolster A and B Companies on Sibidang. A large {{concentration}} of North Koreans advanced to renew the attack. The US troops directed artillery fire on this force and called <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> strike. Observers estimated that the artillery fire and the air strike killed about 350 North Korean troops, half the attack group.|$|E
5|$|Created in {{the early}} 1930s, the salon {{was taken over by}} SS general Reinhard Heydrich and his {{subordinate}} Walter Schellenberg in 1939. The brothel was managed by original owner Kitty Schmidt throughout its entire existence. The plan was to seduce top German dignitaries, foreign visitors as well as diplomats with alcohol and women so they would disclose secrets or express their honest opinions on Nazi-related topics and individuals. Notable guests included Heydrich himself, Joseph Dietrich, Galeazzo Ciano and Joseph Goebbels. The building housing the salon was destroyed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> raid in 1942 and the project quickly lost its importance. Salon Kitty has been the inspiration or subject to many brothels featured in films involving Nazi espionage.|$|E

5|$|Following his death, Kalam's {{body was}} airlifted in an Indian Air Force {{helicopter}} from Shillong to Guwahati, {{from where it}} was flown to New Delhi {{on the morning of}} 28 July <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{primarily}} at Langley Field, Virginia, Olds virtually made daily {{contact with the}} small group of officers who would lead the US Army Air Forces in World War II (one neighbor was Major Carl Spaatz, destined to become the first Chief of Staff of the USAF), and as a result was imbued with an unusually strong dedication to the air service, and conversely, with a low tolerance for officers who did not exhibit the same. On November 10, 1925, his father appeared as a witness on behalf of Billy Mitchell during Mitchell's court-martial in Washington, D.C.. He brought three-year-old Robin with him to court, dressed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>Air</b> Service uniform, and posed with him for newspaper photographers before testifying.|$|E
5|$|Havock began escorting supply convoys in June to Tobruk, Libya {{until the}} ship was damaged in October. She was {{repaired}} in time to escort a convoy to Malta during the First Battle of Sirte in December and was badly damaged by the Italian battleship Littorio whilst protecting another convoy during the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942. Repairs were attempted in Malta, but {{the ship was}} further damaged <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> raid in early April. The Admiralty decided that further attempts to repair her at Malta were pointless and ordered her to Gibraltar for permanent repairs. On 6 April, while on passage to Gibraltar, Havock ran aground near Cape Bon, Tunisia, and her crew was interned by the Vichy French at Laghouat in the Sahara.|$|E

Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria's nephew (Ernest Louis's son), George Donatus of Hesse. They and their two young sons, Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie was pregnant {{at the time and}} the stillborn child was found among the wreckage. Cecilie's youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine but the little girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, the Polish government-in-exile led by Sikorski {{insisted on}} {{bringing}} {{the matter to}} the negotiation table with the Soviets and on opening {{an investigation by the}} International Red Cross. Stalin, in response, accused the Polish government of collaborating with Nazi Germany and broke off diplomatic relations with it. The Soviet Union also started a campaign to get the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet government-in-exile of the Union of Polish Patriots led by Wanda Wasilewska. Sikorski died <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> crash in July—an event that was convenient for the Allied leaders.|$|E
