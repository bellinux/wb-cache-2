40|$|Summary. The low {{molecular}} weight carbohydrates of Laurocerasus officinalis cv. Globigemmis were identified and quantified by gas chromatography (GC) as oxime-TMS derivatives during fruit developing. The sugars quantified were fructose, glucose, sucrose and sorbitol. Quantities of all sugars varied significantly during fruit development. Quantities of fructose, <b>glucose</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorbitol</b> increased by developing. Sucrose was present in minor quantities after 5 weeks of development. The level of fructose, <b>glucose</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorbitol</b> decreased rapidly after day 23 and then remained low until day 58 except sorbitol (day 51). The sugars increased rapidly after day 65 and remained high until harvesting time day 86.

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} water sorption and desorption {{characteristics of}} three pharmaceutical excipients, namely, glucose, citric acid, and sorbitol, were investigated at 25 degreesC using an electrodynamic balance (EDB). The mass fraction of solute (mfs), {{defined as the}} ratio of the dry solute mass to the solution mass, of the additives was measured as a function of relative humidity (RH) at equilibrium.

30|$|During yeast osmoadaptation against high sugar {{concentrations}} in fermentation, the biosynthesis of glycerol is promoted {{in order to}} balance osmotic pressure across the yeast plasma membrane (Gibson et al. 2007; Hohmann 2002). In addition, glycerol is also involved in protecting yeast cells against high temperature and oxidative stress (Pahlman et al. 2001; Siderius et al. 2000). To examine the abilities of these multiple stress-tolerant strains in accumulating glycerol in response to various environmental stresses, the intracellular glycerol contents in these strains were measured after stress exposures. The intracellular glycerol contents in all yeast strains tested were greatly increased only after treatments with high concentrations of <b>glucose</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorbitol,</b> which are known to induce osmotic stress (Fig.  3 c). Moreover, under these osmotic stress conditions, the multiple stress-tolerant strains accumulated higher levels of intracellular glycerol than the control strains (Fig.  3 c), suggesting {{the important role of}} glycerol in conferring enhanced osmotolerance to these strains. It should be noted that, in the C 3253 strain, the glycerol production was slightly induced after exposures to heat, oxidative, and cell wall stresses (Fig.  3 c), raising the possibility that glycerol may also be important for protecting the C 3253 strain against other environmental stresses.|$|E
30|$|Although the {{conventional}} ethanol fermentation {{is carried out}} under semi-anaerobic conditions, the ROS accumulation and oxidative damage to cell structures were observed in the S. cerevisiae wine strains during fermentation in high-sugar-containing media (Landolfo et al. 2008). In addition, SOD 1 gene encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, an important antioxidant enzyme, was required for tolerance to several stresses occurring during fermentation, including heat, ethanol, osmotic, and oxidative stresses (Auesukaree et al. 2009). Taken together, the ability to maintain intracellular redox balance may be necessary for yeast growth upon exposure to multiple stresses present during fermentation. To test this possibility, we measured the intracellular ROS levels after grown {{in the presence of}} ethanol, glucose, sorbitol, H 2 O 2, and CFW at 30  °C, or at 40  °C for heat stress. In the W 303 strain, the intracellular ROS levels were dramatically increased after being challenged with not only the oxidant H 2 O 2 but also ethanol, <b>glucose,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorbitol</b> (Fig.  3 b), suggesting the effects of ethanol and hyperosmolarity on inducing endogenous oxidative stress. On the other hand, the intracellular ROS levels in the other strains, which exhibited higher growth rates than the W 303 under these stress conditions, were not significantly increased after treatments (Fig.  3 b). These results suggest that these multiple stress-tolerant strains may have the ability to minimize the intracellular ROS levels.|$|E

The membranes of G. suboxydans subsp. alpha exhibited neither alcohol dehydrogenase, ethanol oxidase, nor glucose-ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity. Furthermore, the respiratory chain of the organism exhibited an extremely diminished amount of cytochrome c and an increased sensitivity of the respiratory activity for cyanide or azide when compared with G. suboxydans. The first-subunit quinohemoprotein and the second-subunit cytochrome c of alcohol dehydrogenase complex in the membranes of G. suboxydans subsp. alpha were shown to be reduced and deficient, respectively, by using heme-staining and immunoblotting methods. Ethanol oxidase activity, lacking in G. suboxydans subsp. alpha, was entirely restored by reconstituting alcohol dehydrogenase purified from G. suboxydans to the membranes of G. suboxydans subsp. alpha; this also led to restoration of the cyanide or azide insensitivity and the glucose-ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity in the respiratory chain without affecting other respiratory activities such as <b>glucose</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorbitol</b> oxidases.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the properties, {{development}} and applications of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and low-melting mixtures (LMMs). In the first part, novel binary and ternary DESs and LMMs are introduced. Mainly carnitine and betaine compounds were used amongst others. These ammonium compounds serve as alternative to choline, which is mostly used in DESs. Furthermore, sugar-based LMMs comprising choline chloride, urea as well as <b>glucose</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorbitol,</b> respectively, with varying molar ratios are presented. An important advantage of sugar-based LMMs is their biodegradability and non-toxicity. For that reason, eco-friendly chemistry can be carried out. In the second part, different DESs were calculated with the conductor-like screening model for realistic solvation (COSMO-RS). Thereby, {{the influence of the}} hydrogen bond acceptor was studied.

In order to improve the postharvest shelf-life of this variety, we evaluated the residual effects of heat pre-treatments at 50 °C/ 2 min, hydro-cooling and normal cooling as a control, on respiratory metabolism and quality of the fruit, including respiration rate, soluble sugars, organic acids, decay and quality parameters, during storage at 0 °C for 5 and 10 days plus 2 and 4 days at 20 °C. In comparison with other sweet cherry varieties, at 20 °C the >Ambrunés> cherries had low respiratory activity suggesting a high potential for postharvest storage. Storage at low temperatures resulted in high respiration rates in fruit transferred to 20 °C, this being greater with increasing time of storage at 0 °C.

Fructose, <b>glucose,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorbitol</b> were the only sugars detected in exudates of immature fruit. They occurred at low concentrations, but their concentration generally increased as fruit ripened. Sucrose was first detected during maturation. In nectarine, an increase in sugar concentration, especially sucrose, was pronounced during the period of rapid cell enlargement, which occurred approximately 2 weeks before harvest. Absorbance readings of culture media amended with sugar indicated that the hexose sugars (fructose and glucose) and sucrose did not markedly influence growth of B. cinema at concentrations below 0. 22 and 0. 12 mM, respectively. The hexose sugars caused a steady increase in growth when supplied at concentrations in excess of 0. 44 mM, and sucrose caused a steady increase in growth at 0. 23 mM. The stimulatory effect of fruit exudates on growth of B. cinema on glass slides coincided with the period of rapid sugar release from the fruit and the shift in susceptibility to decay. Only fructose (1. 72 mM) and glucose (0. 72 mM) were detected in nectarine pollen exudates. Pollen exudates from weeds stimulated fungal growth and significantly increased the aggressiveness of the pathogen on plum and nectarine fruit when added to conidia during the last 4 weeks prior to the picking-ripe stage.

40|$|Sorbitol is an {{important}} commercially available chemical with a broad application range and is typically made by the catalytic hydrogenation of glucose. Here we report a high-yield synthesis of sorbitol from levoglucosan (1, 6 -anhydro-beta-D-glucopyranose) and cellobiose, two sugars present in pyrolysis liquids, using a mesoporous carbon-supported Ru catalyst (Ru/CMK- 3). The hydrogenation reactions were performed in a batch autoclave setup under a hydrogen pressure of 50 bar and temperatures ranging from 120 to 180 degrees C in water. The hydrogenation of levoglucosan gave essentially quantitative yields of sugar alcohols, composed of 96. 2 wt % of sorbitol and 3. 8 wt % of mannitol (180 degrees C, 5 h). Ru/CMK- 3 shows superior catalytic performance compared to a commercial Ru/C catalyst. A reaction pathway involving glucose as an intermediate and subsequent (hydrogenolysis) reactions of the desired sorbitol is proposed. Reactions with <b>glucose</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorbitol</b> were performed to define the reaction pathways and to highlight the differences between Ru/C and Ru/CMK- 3. Disaccharides including cellobiose and sucrose were also tested, yielding up to 95 wt % of C 6 sugar alcohols at 180 degrees C in 5 h for both substrates. Detailed catalyst characterization studies (N- 2 physisorption, TEM, XRD, NH 3 -TPD, H- 2 -TPD) revealed that Ru/CMK- 3 contains considerable amounts of strong acid sites (NH 3 -TPD). Catalyst stability was tested by catalyst recycling experiments using levoglucosan in batch. After three successive runs, {{the rate of the}} hydrolysis reaction of LG to glucose was about constant, though the subsequent hydrogenation reaction to sorbitol/mannitol was slightly retarded as evidenced from a slight increase in the remaining amounts of glucose at the end of reaction...|$|E
40|$|A SUGAR model, {{which was}} {{established}} to predict the partitioning of carbon into sucrose, <b>glucose,</b> fructose <b>and</b> <b>sorbitol</b> in fruit mesocarp of peach cultivars (Prunus persica (L.) Batch) with normal glucose: fructose ratio (G:F) of 0 · 8 – 1 · 5, was evaluated and extended for peach cultivars with a high G:F ratio of 1 · 5 – 7 · 8. The extended model (SUGARb) is more generic and assumes a high G:F ratio {{to be due to}} preferential transformation of sorbitol into glucose, preferential utilization of fructose or preferential conversion of fructose into glucose. The simulated seasonal variations in sugars via the SUGARb-model-matched experimental data for three normal and three high G:F cultivars well, and accurately exhibited G:F ratio characteristics. The relative rates of sucrose transformation into <b>glucose</b> <b>and</b> fructose differed according to cultivar but not according to G:F status. Compared with hexosephosphate interconversion, a lower production rate of fructose than glucose from sorbitol, and/or a higher utilization rate of fructose than that of glucose might be preferential alternatives for forming high G:F ratios in the high G:F cultivars studied in the present study, which is discussed in the light of recent results on enzyme activitie...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} optimizing the location and size of buffers in semi-continuous manufacturing processes. This problem is formulated as a non-linear integer program that determines the optimal buffer size for individual stages and allocates tanks to those stages {{in order to minimize}} total tank inclusion, holding, quality, process overshoot and undershoot costs. We develop heuristics to solve the problem and derive bounds to evaluate the quality of the heuristics. This method is implemented at three <b>glucose</b> <b>and</b> three <b>sorbitol</b> production processes at a leading food-processing company. 1 This has resulted in total annual cost savings of around 6. 4 % or $ 9 million. In addition, this work has {{had a significant impact on}} several strategic operational decisions at this company. 1 For confidentiality reasons, the name of this company has not been revealed. However, verification of this work has been provided by this company to the Editor-in-Chief. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of Ascophyllum nodosum, an edible brown macroalga, on some haematologic parameters of dairy cows. Nineteen clinically healthy Holstein cows, an average 4. 3 years old, were divided into two groups for 49 days. Ten cows received control diet (roughages and concentrate) while the concentrate of 9 cows was additionally supplemented with 80 g A. nodosum /cow/day. Average daily milk production (controls 39. 6 kg/cow; A. nodosum 40. 2 kg/cow), milk protein and fat were not affected by the alga supplementation. Glucose, sorbitol dehydrogenase, haemoglobin, haematocrit and white/red blood cells were evaluated in weekly blood samples. It was seen that A. nodosum increased blood <b>glucose</b> <b>and</b> decreased <b>sorbitol</b> dehydrogenase compared to controls, without any adverse effects on the other examined parameters. Consequently, A. nodosum may be suggested as a functional ingredient in dairy cow nutrition, improving energy utilization and expressing hepatoprotective effect...|$|R
