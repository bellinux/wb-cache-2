30|$|PLCH is a {{rare disease}} whose <b>elementary</b> <b>lesion</b> is a bronchiolocentric-evolving granuloma. A history of {{cigarette}} smoking, coupled with suggestive findings at radiographic imaging, is key to suspect the disease. At diagnosis, symptoms and functional tests are non-specific, while CT may be distinctive, showing lesions corresponding to the various evolutionary aspects of the disease. Typical cases are characterised by the association of nodules, cavitary nodules and cystic lesions. However, differential diagnosis can be challenging when CT shows unique lesions that can mimic other diseases.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA new {{geometry}} of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) transducer is described {{to enlarge the}} coagulated volume and decrease treatments time. Eight transducer elements and their quarter-wave plate were diced out of a single toric piezocomposite element. Each transducer operates at a frequency of 3 MHz. The focal zone is conic and located at 70 mm from the transducer. A 7. 5 MHz ultrasound imaging probe {{is placed in the}} centre of the device for guiding the treatment. Optimal exposure parameters were determined from numerical simulations. This new geometry allows achieving a thermal ablation of 7. 5 cm 3 when each of the eight transducers has performed a 5 -s ultrasound exposure alternatively and consecutively. In vivo trials have been performed on five pigs to demonstrate this new principle. 33 elementary lesions have been performed. All lesions were reproducible and homogeneous.

40|$|Objectives. To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} inflammatory abnormalities of the hand, wrist and foot joints in SLE patients by US and to correlate them with clinical, laboratory and disease activity score parameters. Methods. Sixty-two consecutive SLE patients {{were enrolled in the}} present study and underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory tests and bilateral high-resolution US of the hand, wrist and foot joints. Joint effusion (JE), synovial hypertrophy (SH) and local pathological vascularization [power Doppler (PD) ] were evaluated according to both a dichotomous score and a semi-quantitative (0 - 3) grading system. In addition, a global US score was calculated by summing the values given to each <b>elementary</b> <b>lesion</b> for every single joint and every joint group. US findings were correlated with physical examination, serological parameters (CRP, ANA, anti-dsDNA, ENA, aPL, C 3 and C 4 serum levels) and disease activity indexes (SLEDAI- 2 K, ECLAM). Results. US detected inflammatory joint abnormalities in 54 / 62 patients (87. 1 %); 72. 6 % presented involvement of the MTP joints, 46. 7 % the MCP joints, 19. 3 % the PIP joints and 53 % the wrists. A total of 1984 joints were examined highlighting JE in 19. 1 % of cases, SH in 6. 9 % and positive PD in 1. 1 %. The global US inflammatory score had a mean value of 10. 9 (S. D. 15. 2). No correlations were found between US findings and SLE disease activity parameters. Conclusion. US demonstrated a high prevalence of inflammatory joint abnormalities in SLE that were also present in asymptomatic patients. Interestingly, the foot joints were the most frequently involved.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{classify}} <b>elementary</b> endoscopic <b>lesions</b> of portal hypertensive gastropathy, {{assess their}} reproducibility, prevalences, {{sensitivity and specificity}} in the diagnosis of cirrhosis of the liver. METHODS: 1) A classification of portal hypertensive gastropathy <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> was defined. 2) Thirty-two endoscopists evaluated videotapes of endoscopic examinations of patients with liver cirrhosis to assess beyond-chance agreement (kappa). 3) Fifteen centres enrolled consecutive patients with or without cirrhosis of the liver and recorded portal hypertensive gastropathy pattern according to its location. RESULTS: 1) Four <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> (Mosaic-Like Pattern, Red Point Lesions, Cherry Red Spots, Black-Brown Spots) were identified, and graded. 2) A fair to good beyond-chance agreement was obtained for all 4 lesions. 3) portal hypertensive gastropathy prevalence was higher in patients with cirrhosis of the liver (0. 63, sensitivity) than in controls (0. 17). Mosaic-like pattern was the most prevalent sign (0. 54). Specificity of portal hypertensive gastropathy was 0. 83. Portal hypertensive gastropathy was tentatively classified as mild or severe when mosaic-like pattern alone or red marks of any kind were present, respectively; this classification led to a further improvement in reproducibility.

However, some issues have still to be resolved, {{being one of the}} most important the heterogeneity of the criteria used for the identification of calcium pyrophosphate crystals (CPP) deposits. Objectives The aim of this study was to define the US <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> in CPPD Methods The panel of experts was compound by 18 members of the Omeract US group, especially interested in microcrystalline arthritides. The first step was a systematic literature review aimed to select the studies regarding US and CPPD in order to collect all the definitions about US elementary findings in CPPD. The definitions retrieved by the literature were used for drawing up a first group of propositions. The experts evaluated these definitions, adding any further preposition according to their experience that could improve the initial set. According to the systematic review, the propositions about US <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> were divided by anatomical structure: fibrocartilage, hyaline cartilage, tendons and synovial fluid. For each structure were defined: shape, echogenicity, localization and behaviour at dynamic scanning. In the next rounds, the experts voted their level of agreement for each proposition according to the Likert scale (1 strongly disagree 5 :strongly agree) with the possibility to add comments. After each round, a facilitator modified the prepositions according to the comments received.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: In this project, an {{interstitial}} ultrasound applicator {{was developed}} {{for the treatment of}} primary and secondary cancers of the liver. Experiments on animals were used to check the destructive capabilities of this probe within the hepatic parenchyma of the pig in vivo, with a study of the physical parameters of the ultrasound treatment. In parallel, the possibility of visualizing the lesions induced by means of ultrasound imaging was also studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen pigs were used in this project, which had received the prior approval of the ethics committee of Lyon Veterinary School. Ultrasound lesions were performed by varying the physical parameters of the treatment (acoustic intensity and shot time) with the aim of obtaining larger and larger areas of destruction. An operative device was developed to ensure precision in treatments. Two types of <b>lesions</b> were performed: <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> corresponding to single shots at 40 degrees to 50 degrees rotation intervals, and cylindrical lesions obtained by a continuous rotary deployment of the probe. The effect of hepatic pedicle clamping on the size of ultrasound lesions was studied. The aspect and dimension of the lesions were analyzed by means of operative ultrasound imaging and macroscopic examination. Histological analysis showed the impact of the treatment on the hepatic parenchyma. RESULTS: This work made it possible to study the <b>elementary</b> ultrasound <b>lesions</b> produced by our probe. Seventy <b>elementary</b> ultrasound <b>lesions</b> were analyzed. Treatments could be performed on all pigs without any difficulty. There were no operative incidents. The ultrasound-induced <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> showed complete necrosis, with lesion length of up to 37 mm obtained without resort to pedicle clamping; this must be considered as a radius of the final lesion obtained over a complete rotary deployment (360 degrees), then a diameter of 7 cm of thermal ablation can theoretically be obtained. The effect of pedicle clamping was studied and showed improvement of the lesion length. Results of continuous rotary deployment of the probe were encouraging. Operative ultrasound imaging proved to be a simple tool for directing and positioning the applicator in the target zone {{on the one hand and}} which, on the other hand, enabled accurate, real-time visualization of the ultrasound lesions. On histological analysis, the ultrasound-induced necrosis was complete and well defined. CONCLUSION: This work shows that it is feasible to treat cancers of the liver using interstitial ultrasound probe. Thermal damage obtained on the hepatic parenchyma of pigs in vivo is complete and can be monitored using simple diagnostic ultrasound.

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to collect the definitions for the US <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> and to summarize the available data about US diagnostic accuracy in CPPD. Methods: We systematically reviewed all the studies that considered US as the index test for CPPD diagnosis without restrictions about the reference test or that provided definitions about US identification of CPPD. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each study and definitions were extrapolated. Subgroup analyses were planned by anatomical site included in the index text and different reference standards. Results: Thirty-seven studies were included in this review. All the studies were eligible for the collection of US findings and all definitions were summarized. US description of <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> appeared heterogeneous among the studies. Regarding US accuracy, 13 articles entered in the meta-analysis. Considering each joint structure, the sensitivity ranged between 0. 77 (0. 63 - 0. 87) and 0. 34 (0. 16 - 0. 58) while the specificity varies between 1. 00 (0. 89 - 1. 00) and 0. 92 (0. 16 - 1. 00). Considering the reference standards used, the sensibility ranged between 0. 34 (0. 02 - 0. 65) and 0. 87 (0. 76 - 0. 99) while specificity ranged between 0. 84 (0. 52 - 1. 00) and 1. 00 (0. 99 - 1. 00).

40|$|International audienceIn the high-intensity focused {{ultrasound}} (US), or HIFU, field, it {{is well-known}} that the cavitation {{effect can be}} used to induce lesions of larger volume. The principle is based on the increase in the equivalent attenuation coefficient of the tissue {{in the presence of the}} bubbles created by cavitation. The <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> produced by combination of cavitation and thermal effects, using focused transducers, were spherical and developed upstream of the focal point. This paper presents a method that combines cavitation with a thermal effect to obtain deeper lesions using a plane transducer, rather than a focused one. The cavitation effect was produced by delivering intensities of 60 W/cm 2 at the face of the transducer for 0. 5 s. The applicator was then rotated through 90 degrees at a constant speed of between 0. 5 and 1. 5 degrees /s. During this rotation, ex vivo tissues were exposed continuously to an acoustic intensity of 14 W/cm 2 to combine the cavitation effect with a thermal effect. The necroses were, on average, twice as deep when the cavitation effect was used as those obtained with a thermal effect alone.

The following elementary pathological findings were considered: “epithelial lifting”, “epithelial shrinkage”, “epithelial swelling”, “pillar cells coarctation”, “pillar cells detachment”, “channels fusion”, “chloride cells swelling”, and “chloride cells invasion”. The relative spatial extension was determined according to exposure class and {{data were analyzed}} by means of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and canonical variates analysis (CVA). Histologically and ultrastructurally, cellular shrinkage/coarctation prevailed in cadmium exposed lamellae, whereas cellular swelling and epithelial lifting were predominant in terbuthylazine exposed lamellae compared to unexposed fish. Both CCA and CVA permit a good graphical data grouping according to exposure classes {{by means of the}} convex hull minimum polygons. This also reveals exposure dose and time gradients in CCA plot.

To identify pathophysiological events associated with the Y. pestis high degree of pathogenicity, we compared disease progression and evolution in mice after id inoculation of the two Yersinia species. Mortality studies showed that the id portal was not in itself sufficient to provide Y. pseudotuberculosis with the high virulence power of its descendant. Surprisingly, Y. pseudotuberculosis multiplied even more efficiently than Y. pestis in the dermis, and generated comparable histological lesions. Likewise, Y. pseudotuberculosis translocated to the draining lymph node (DLN) and similar numbers of the two bacterial species were found at 24 h post infection (pi) in this organ. However, on day 2 pi, bacterial loads were higher in Y. pestis-infected than in Y. pseudotuberculosis-infected DLNs. Clustering and multiple correspondence analyses showed that the DLN pathologies induced by the two species were statistically significantly different and identified the most discriminating <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions.</b> Y. pseudotuberculosis infection was accompanied by abscess-type polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates containing the infection, while Y. pestis-infected DLNs exhibited an altered tissue density and a vascular congestion, and were typified by an invasion of the tissue by free floating bacteria. Therefore, Y. pestis exceptional virulence is not due to its recently acquired portal of entry into the host, but {{is associated with a}} distinct ability to massively infiltrate the DLN, without inducing in this organ an organize...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{summarize}} the work {{performed by the}} Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) Ultrasound (US) Working Group on the validation of US as a potential outcome measure in gout. Methods: Based {{on the lack of}} definitions, highlighted in a recent literature review on US as an outcome tool in gout, a series of iterative exercises were carried out to obtain consensus-based definitions on US elementary components in gout using a Delphi exercise and subsequently testing these definitions in static images and in patients with proven gout. Cohen’s κ was used to test agreement, and values of 0 – 0. 20 were considered poor, 0. 20 – 0. 40 fair, 0. 40 – 0. 60 moderate, 0. 60 – 0. 80 good, and 0. 80 – 1 excellent. Results: With an agreement of > 80 %, consensus-based definitions were obtained for the 4 <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> highlighted in the literature review: tophi, aggregates, erosions, and double contour (DC). In static images interobserver reliability ranged from moderate to almost perfect, and similar results were found for the intrareader reliability. In patients the intraobserver agreement was good for all lesions except DC (moderate). The interobserver agreement was poor for aggregates and DC but moderate for the other components. Conclusion: These first steps in evaluating the validity of US as an outcome measure for gout show that the reliability of the definitions ranged from moderate to excellent in static images and somewhat lower in patients, indicating that a standardized scanning technique may be needed, before testing the responsiveness of those definitions in a composite US score...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} role of musculoskeletal US in patients suffering from PsA or psoriasis (Pso) in terms of prevalence, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring and treatment. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted through medical databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase) and the grey literature up to September 2015 to inform a new study of the Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Study Group of the Italian Society for Rheumatology. All articles reporting data on musculoskeletal US in PsA or Pso were included and extracted according to the underlying clinical question. Results: A total of 86 publications were included. The prevalence of US abnormalities showed a wide range for each examined feature (e. g. 37 - 95 % for entheses thickness of the lower limbs). The performance of US for diagnosis of disease or <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> was variable across studies, but no study evaluated the overall performance of US in addition to clinical findings for diagnosing PsA. Considering US in defining PsA and Pso prognosis, several works focused on US of entheses of lower limbs in Pso, while for the monitoring of PsA activity five different scoring systems were identified. Last, the results of {{the role of}} US in guiding intra-articular interventions were controversial for the clinical outcomes, but in favour of US for accuracy. Conclusion: despite the recognized importance of US in the management of PsA and Pso, this review clearly demonstrated the need of pivotal research in order to optimize the use of US in the diagnosis and monitoring of psoriatic disease...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare image quality (objective and subjective parameters) and confidence in lesion detection between 3 image reconstruction algorithms in computed tomographic (CT) examinations of the abdomen/pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective institutional review board-approved study included 65 patients (mean [SD] age, 71. 3 ± 9 years; mean [SD] body mass index, 24. 4 [4. 8] kg) who underwent routine CT examinations of the abdomen/pelvis followed immediately by 2 low-dose scans. Raw data sets were reconstructed by using filtered back projection (FBP), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR), and a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). Measurements of objective noise and CT numbers were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Six subjective image quality parameters were scored. Diagnostic confidence and accuracy in detection of various <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> were performed. RESULTS: Objectively, mean image noise for MBIR was significantly superior at all dose levels (P < 0. 001). Subjectively, standard-dose ASIR and low-dose MBIR scans were better than standard-dose FBP scan in all parameters assessed (P < 0. 05). Low-dose MBIR scans were comparable with standard-dose ASIR scans in all parameters except at noise index of 70 (approximately 85 % dose reduction), where, in this case, the detection of liver lesions less than 5 mm were rated inferior (P < 0. 05) with diagnostic accuracy reducing to 77. 4 %. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose MBIR scan shows superior objective noise reduction compared with standard-dose FBP and ASIR. Subjectively, low-dose MBIR scans at 76 % dose reduction were also superior compared with standard-dose FBP and ASIR. However, at dose reductions of 85 %, small liver lesions may be missed.

40|$|Introduction: An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} applied ultrasound to the evaluation of entheses in spondyloarthritis patients. However, no clear agreement exists on the definition of enthesitis, on the number and choice of entheses to examine and on ultrasound technique, which may all affect the results of the examination. The objectives of this study were to first determine the level of homogeneity in the ultrasound definitions for the principal lesions of enthesitis in the published literature and second, to evaluate the metric properties of ultrasound for detecting enthesitis according to the OMERACT filter. Methods: Search was performed in PUBMED and EMBASE. Both grey-scale and Doppler definitions of enthesitis, including describing features of enthesitis, were collected and metrological qualities of studies were assessed. Results: After selection, 48 articles were analyzed. The definition of ultrasound enthesitis and elementary features varied among authors. Grey-scale enthesitis was characterized by increasing thickness (94 % of studies), hypoechogenicity (83 %), enthesophytes (69 %), erosions (67 %), calcifications (52 %), associated bursitis (46 %) and cortical irregularities (29 %). Only 46 % of studies reported the use of Doppler. High discrepancies were observed on frequency, type of probe and Doppler mode used. Face and content validity were the most frequently evaluated criteria (43 %) followed by reliability (29 %) and responsiveness (19 %). Conclusions: Ultrasound has evidence to support face, content validity and reliability for the evaluation of enthesitis, though {{there is a lack of}} well-reported methodology in most of the studies. Consensus on <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> and standardization of exam is needed to determine the ultrasound definition of enthesitis in grey-scale and in Doppler for future applications. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Neonatal acute kidney injury (AKI), {{that becomes}} {{acute renal failure}} (when renal {{replacement}} is needed), represents a common clinical problem in critically ill infants admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) centers. This article is aimed at reviewing the most important histological renal changes generally considered typical of AKI, useful to confirm, at morphological level, the structural and cell lesions responsible for the clinical picture. In the first part a simple schematic approach to the <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> of the developing kidney will be proposed, aimed to decipher the renal lesions. In the second part, the typical lesions of AKI in the neonate will be presented and discussed. In the final part, we’ll prospect the necessity for a more accurate microscopic analysis of the kidney in every neonate undergoing asphyxia or sepsis, in order to reveal subtle renal changes that might allow a pathological diagnosis of AKI even in newborns in which the clinical and laboratory pictures were not representative of a severe kidney damage. Finally, {{the role of the}} clinical-pathological discussion between the pathologist and the neonatologist will be underlined, in order to reach a final diagnosis, based on the clinical history, the laboratory findings, and the histological lesions. In this article, the role of the pathologist in the evaluation of a neonatal kidney in a newborn with the clinical diagnosis of AKI is described, with particular attention to the differences existing between the preterm and the at term kidney, focusing on the differentiation between developmental changes occurring in the kidney in the perinatal period and the histological lesions induced by pathological events occurring around birth.   Proceedings of the International Course on Perinatal Pathology (part of the 10 th International Workshop on Neonatology · October 22 nd - 25 th, 2014)  · Cagliari (Italy) · October 25 th, 2014  ·  The role of the clinical pathological dialogue in problem solving Guest Editors: Gavino Faa, Vassilios Fanos, Peter Van Eyken </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} {{analized}} {{the persistence of}} ultrasound (US) abnormalities in patients (pts) with Psoriatic Artritis (PA) during the phase of minimal disease activity (MDA) Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of US alterations at enthesis, joint and tendon levels in pts with psoriatic arthritis (PA) during a phase of MDA. Methods: Pts treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) for at least 12 months and with at least 6 months duration of MDA were consecutively recruited at 6 Italian centers. In every center, the local rheumatologists provided PA pts to be examined by US. Personal history, demographic and clinical data were recorded. Each patient underwent the following US examinations: metacarpophalangeal (MCP), knee and tibio-tarsal (TT) joint, flexor and extensor tendon of hand digit, flexor and extensor tendon at carpal area, flexor and extensor tendon of foot, and enthesis of common extensor tendon insertion on the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, quadriceps tendon, patellar tendon, Achilles tendon and plantar fascia insertions on the calcaneus. Each examination were performed by rheumatologists expert in US, to assess synovitis (joint effusion, synovial proliferation, and power Doppler (PD) signal), and bone erosions, flexor tendon tenosynovitis, hand finger extensor tendon tenonitis, and enthesel involvement using an Esaote MyLabClass with a 5 – 13 or 6 – 18 MHz linear probe. The following <b>elementary</b> <b>lesions</b> were assessed at each enthesis: morphologic abnormalities (hypoechogenicity and/or thickening), entheseal calcific deposits, cortical abnormalities (bone erosion and/or proliferation), adjacent bursitis and intraenthesis and perienthesis (tendon body and/or bursa) PD signal. All US findings were scored using a 4 degree semiquantitative scoring system. US acute enthesitis was defined {{by the presence of}} entheseal edema or PD signal. US chronic entheseal alterations by the presence of calcifications, erosions, or enthesophytes. US peripheral active synovitis if synovial hypertrophy was associated with the presence of PD signal. US examinator were blind of clinical data of the pts. Results: Sixty-three pts were recruited (mean age 53 ± 13 y, mean PA duration 13 ± 8 y, mean MDA duration 21 ± 11 m).
