Two important results were found, first, the existence of a polarized growth either at the lowest or highest income levels that proves the existence of a twin-peak structure in the growth process and second a better performance of objective 1 regions than non-objective 1 regions during both periods of time, showing a tendency of objective 1 regions {{to catch up with the}} average EU 15 income. ...|$|R

40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the European Union (EU) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} fields of {{cooperation}} within the European Union. During the past decades the different Commissioners have made several proposals about changes in the CAP and many of them have not been passed but renegotiated. The present Commission has however published a report in 2011, which emphasizes that the CAP has three alternative ways to go in the future. This study aims to predict which one of these three alternative ways it is most likely that the CAP will take according to the historical institutionalist theory. When to be able to predict this text analysis is used. The analysis tools of the study are collected from the theory, which focuses on the conceptions: critical juncture, feedback effects, path dependency and sequencing. These tools as well as the theory are applied on the empirical material, which mainly consists of books about the earlier reforms and proposals from the Commission, academical journals and some reports. The analysis shows that the Luxembourg compromise can be seen as a critical juncture in the history of the CAP and this led to a path dependency, which is characterized by a decision-making procedure by consensus between the political institutions in the EU. The analysis also shows that most of the reforms regarding the CAP, are made with some sort of compromise or consensus (the <b>Delors</b> <b>I</b> budgetary <b>package,</b> the Mac Sharry reforms and so on). Therefore the conclusion of the study is that, from an historical institutionalist perspective, it is more or less possible for the CAP to go with any of the alternative ways that the Commission points out in the report. It is however most likely that the second way is the most prominent one. This is because that option emphasizes that major overhauls of the policy should be made, that the measures should be more targeted, and that the spending of the CAP should be more efficient. All of these changes have been made more or less during the history of the CAP and the institutional framework therefore allows this way...|$|R

40|$|The European Union {{regarded}} as an economic reenhancement force in Europe {{and in the world}} must fund the needs of 500 million citizens. To do that, it should possess an innovative budget adjusted to the new facts of globalization meant to meet present challenges and create various opportunities for the future. In order to improve budgetary procedures, the need to reform the community bugdet has emerged, namely to change the way it is designed and spent. The manner of setting and distributing the community budget has been changed several times whenever the context in member states has demanded. Thus, European institutions concluded in 1988 interinstitutional agreements which have been covering budgetary process and budget allocation ever since. Agreements are concluded for several years and bear the name of “financial prospects”. Other two agreements have been made (during 2007 - 2013 and, respectively, 2014 - 2020) in compliance with <b>Delors</b> <b>I</b> and <b>Delors</b> II <b>Packages.</b> The present paper focuses on approaching the progress of budgetary indicators {{in the context of the}} multiannual financial framework where the European Union budget is set...|$|R

40|$|Financial ceiling {{policy is}} one of the most {{important}} budgetary instruments. Ceiling was introdu- ced by the <b>Delors</b> <b>I</b> (1988) to manage the first financial perspective and EU budget stability. Paper is focused on financial ceiling policy of the EU budget expenditures. Financial ceiling is used for the total expenditure size (with relative indicators) and for the individual expenditure headings (with absolute indicators). We designed EU budget models using the methods of financial ceiling, which reflect different total expenditures size (total expenditure ceiling within the range of 2 % EU GNI, 5 % EU GNI, 20 % EU GNI, 1 % EU GNI, and 1, 24 % EU GNI), and new heading structure for total expenditure ceiling of 1, 24 % EU GNI. We tried to design the new budgetary structure to reflect the Lisbon Strategy better than actual EU budget. We strengthened following expenditure headings: 1 a Competitiveness for growth and employment, 3 Citizenship, freedom, security and justice, and 4 EU as a global player. The growth of these headings is compensated by an expenditure decre- ase of the following headings: 2 Preservation and management of natural resources, especially the section of the market-related expenditure and direct payment, and 1 b Cohesion for growth and employment. We made comparative analysis, which compare differences between received expenditures into agriculture and structural operations at individual member states in the case of present and new (our) structure of the EU budgetary expenditures. According to the results of this analysis we can say that new budgetary structure will likely be politically unacceptable...|$|R

We especially highlight the growing importance of packaging for the innovation chain from physics to applications, the importance of a close collaboration between front-end and back-end technology, and the importance of chip/package co-design. 1...|$|R
