5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc <b>herniation,</b> {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the <b>herniation</b> was.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc <b>herniation</b> {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or {{ruptures}} into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the <b>herniation</b> was.|$|E
5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia {{due to a}} sudden and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain <b>herniation</b> and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze {{clinical}} characteristics and surgical outcomes of the far lateral and the paramedian disc <b>herniations.</b> Methods: The 88 patients who underwent an operation for lumbar disc <b>herniations</b> were reviewed.

5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause <b>herniation</b> of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back.

5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{can also}} be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal brain <b>herniation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{complications}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain <b>herniation,</b> infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the brain is severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E
5|$|The Sussex Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in Sussex in southern England. It is a low, compact spaniel and {{is similar in}} appearance to the Clumber Spaniel.

40|$|Title: Natural {{history of}} {{degenerative}} disorders {{of the spine}}. Background: Not all patients with degenerative disorders of the spine need surgery to recover. The objective {{was to examine the}} outcomme of these patients and find the natural history of the degenerative disorders of the spine. I concentrated on cervical and lumbar disorders. Methods: Searches in the database PubMed was conducted using the terms spondylosis, intervertebral disk displacement, spinal osteophytosis and spinal stenosis combined with naural course and natural history. Results: The litterature concluded that in many cases cervical <b>herniations</b> do regress spontaniously. Cervical spinal stenosis is a static neurological compromise, with prologend periods of minimal changes in disability. However complete recovery is very rare, and the expected course is episodic worsening. For the lumbar disorders we can conclude that the natural history of lumbar <b>herniations</b> is bening, and the majority regress spontaniously. As for the cervical <b>herniations,</b> the larger and the sequestered <b>herniations</b> show a higher tendency to regress. The natural history of lumbar spinal stenosis is more poorly studied, but it seems that many patients do not progress for long periods of time, other experience improvement and yet others experience worsening. There seem to be a negative connection between high grade stenosis and a worse course...|$|R
5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by <b>herniation</b> of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain <b>herniation.</b> Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Neck {{stiffness}} usually presents {{six hours}} after initial onset of SAH. Isolated dilation of a pupil {{and loss of}} the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain <b>herniation</b> {{as a result of}} rising intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull). Intraocular hemorrhage (bleeding into the eyeball) may occur in response to the raised pressure: subhyaloid hemorrhage (bleeding under the hyaloid membrane, which envelops the vitreous body of the eye) and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy. This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease but rather a complaint that {{may be caused by}} a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause but {{is believed to be the}} result of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc <b>herniation,</b> broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E
40|$|SummaryFull-endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (FEILD) for <b>herniations</b> {{above the}} level of L 5 –S 1 {{has been the subject}} of few studies. FEILD was {{performed}} between July 2009 and September 2009 on three patients with symptomatic lumbar disc <b>herniations</b> above {{the level of}} L 5 –S 1. The patients were 29 years, 67 years, and 71 years of age, and had experienced symptoms for 2 months, 12 months, and 6 months, respectively. After the operation, the mean visual analog scale score decreased from 6. 6 to 1. 3 and the mean Oswestry Disability Index score decreased from 20. 3 to 3. In conclusion, FEILD is feasible for the treatment of disc <b>herniations</b> at L 3 – 4 and L 4 – 5 and offers good functional outcomes in terms of visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index. To achieve a good outcome, a beginner should first master open microscopic lumbar discectomy and then start with observing procedures, assisting at procedures, and practicing FEILD on cadavers...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Minimally {{invasive}} spinal {{techniques have}} been developed for years in an attempt to minimize trauma. However, most endoscopic techniques have been unable to address uncontained or large contained disc <b>herniations.</b> The aim of this prospective study was to compare the results of microendoscopic discectomy (MED) and microsurgical discectomy in the treatment of patients with uncontained or large contained disc <b>herniations.</b> METHODS: An independent observer reviewed the treatment of 28 patients. The study group included 14 consecutive patients who underwent MED and 14 consecutive patients who underwent microsurgical discectomy for radicular pain secondary to uncontained or large contained disc <b>herniations</b> during the same period. Patients were followed up for an average of 12 months. They were assessed by use of Oswestry disability questionnaire and low back pain outcome score. RESULTS: The average outcome score improvement was of clinical significance in both patient groups. No difference in the scores was found between the two groups. Patients in the MED group required less postoperative analgesia during their stay. One patient in the MED group had a dural tear. CONCLUSION: MED is at least as effective as microsurgical discectomy for treatment of uncontained or large contained disc <b>herniations,</b> although the advantages over the open technique are short lived and did not reach significance. Nonetheless, for the surgeon accustomed to endoscopic techniques, MED seems to be a safe procedure...|$|R
40|$|The authors report {{two cases}} of nodular calcium {{pyrophosphate}} dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition {{close to the}} thoracic neural foramen, which caused chronic radiculopathy. Preoperatively, the lesions were interpreted as calcified disc <b>herniations.</b> Both patients underwent surgery in which an extended transfacet pedicle-sparing approach was used. Incision of the posterior longitudinal ligament released soft degenerated material. In both cases, histological examination showed abundant degenerative debris along with CPPD crystals. Spinal CPPD deposition is a comparatively rare disease that almost invariably involves the posterior aspect of the spinal canal, typically the ligamentum flavum. The exceptional foraminal location of the lesions reported here, combined with the surgical findings, indicated that the CPPD crystals were deposited on a laterally herniated disc fragment. A distinctive feature in both cases was the soft consistency of the resected tissue. The consistency of the disc material {{and the location of}} the lesion in the axial plane (that is, median compared with lateral) are key factors in determining the optimal surgical approach to thoracic disc <b>herniations.</b> In describing consistency, terms such as "calcified" and "hard" have been used interchangeably in the literature. The authors' experience underscores that not all densely calcified herniated discs are hard. Although detection of this discrepancy would have left surgical planning for the lateral disc <b>herniations</b> unchanged, it could have altered planning for centrally or centrolaterally located disc <b>herniations...</b>|$|R
5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee, is located on one side (in the case of disc <b>herniation),</b> or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E
5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc <b>herniation.</b> Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or <b>herniation,</b> in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E
