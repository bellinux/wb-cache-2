40|$|Abstract Background The 30 -item disabilities of the arm, {{shoulder}} and hand (<b>DASH)</b> questionnaire is increasingly used in clinical research involving upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders. From the original <b>DASH</b> a shorter version, the 11 -item Quick <b>DASH,</b> has been developed. Little {{is known about}} the discriminant ability of score changes for the Quick <b>DASH</b> compared to the <b>DASH.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the performance of the Quick <b>DASH</b> and its cross-sectional and longitudinal validity and reliability. Methods The study was based on extracting Quick <b>DASH</b> item responses from the responses to the full-length <b>DASH</b> questionnaire completed by 105 patients with a variety of upper extremity disorders before surgery and at follow-up 6 to 21 months after surgery. The <b>DASH</b> and Quick <b>DASH</b> scores were compared for the whole population and for different diagnostic groups. For longitudinal construct validity the effect size and standardized response mean were calculated. Analyses with ROC curves were performed to compare the ability of the <b>DASH</b> and Quick <b>DASH</b> to discriminate among patients classified according to the magnitude of self-rated improvement. Cross-sectional and test-retest reliability was assessed. Results The mean <b>DASH</b> score was 34 (SD 22) and the mean Quick <b>DASH</b> score was 39 (SD 24) at baseline. For the different diagnostic groups the mean and median Quick <b>DASH</b> scores were higher than the corresponding <b>DASH</b> scores. For the whole population, the mean difference between the Quick <b>DASH</b> and <b>DASH</b> baseline scores was 4. 2 (95 % CI 3. 2 – 5. 3), follow-up scores was 2. 6 (1. 7 – 3. 4), and change scores was 1. 7 (0. 6 – 2. 8). The overall effect size and standardized response mean measured with the <b>DASH</b> and the Quick <b>DASH</b> were similar. In the ROC analysis of change scores among patients who rated their arm status as somewhat or much better and those who rated it as unchanged the difference in the area under the ROC curve for the <b>DASH</b> and Quick <b>DASH</b> was 0. 01 (95 % CI - 0. 05 – 0. 07) indicating similar discriminant ability. Cross-sectional and test-retest reliability of the <b>DASH</b> and Quick <b>DASH</b> were similar. Conclusion The results indicate that the Quick <b>DASH</b> can be used instead of the <b>DASH</b> with similar precision in upper extremity disorders. </p...|$|R

5|$|Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and {{his system}} was largely {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the <b>dashes</b> {{because they were too}} difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.|$|E

5|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{had been studying}} this problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, there was much interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role.

In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during high-power portions of flight—take-off and high-speed <b>dashes.</b>|$|E

5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} to control Pac-Man, navigating {{him through a}} maze of consumable <b>dashes</b> called Video Wafers,  opposed by a quartet of multi-colored ghosts. The goal of the game is to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed to the next one in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E

5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or <b>dashes,</b> and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E
