25|$|The Mercury Sable, {{a sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also {{redesigned}} for the 1996 model year. As with previous generations, the Sable used the same mechanical parts as the Taurus with a unique body. However, the 1996 Sable ditched the unique styling cues of the previous generations, specifically the <b>front</b> <b>light</b> bar, wrap-around rear glass and skirted rear fender, {{in favor of a}} design theme that more closely resembled that of the Taurus. For the first time, the Sable didn't get a unique interior design, instead sharing all of its interior components with the Taurus with the exception of branded parts and unique woodgrain trim. Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation: A base model GS and high-end LS, with a base G model briefly offered {{during the second half of}} the 1996 model year. The Sable had the same powertrains and most features as the Taurus, though no counterpart to the high performance SHO was offered. Prices increased, corresponding with the increase in price of the Taurus. While the design of the Taurus was polarizing, the more conservative design of the Sable was praised; Automobile Magazine selected the Sable as its 1996 design of the year.Unlike the Taurus, sales of the Sable stayed steady with the previous model, and styling revisions for 1998 were limited to a new grille and headlamps. The Taurus and Sable were produced concurrently through the 1999 model year.|$|E

Thirty anti-aircraft vehicles fired blanks at fighter planes overhead, assisted by anti-aircraft gunners on buildings downtown. The first mock casualty was reported at 8:00am.

2500|$|Red {{or yellow}} LEDs {{suitable}} for use as rear lights have been available for many years. Recently, white LEDs which satisfy the requirements for a <b>front</b> <b>light</b> have come on the market, and some jurisdictions have made or are considering making these legally acceptable. [...] Very high-power LEDs are sensitive to overheating and over-driving if the enclosure or driving electronics are poorly designed. Both of these conditions can significantly shorten the LED's lifespan, causing them to dim or completely burn out. Most LEDs have a higher luminous efficacy than halogen lights, but poorly designed driving electronics can negate the advantage. Electronics are needed for battery-powered LEDs to keep light high while battery voltage declines, and to provide flashing and dimming.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{handheld}} power routers {{were invented}} in 1915 and were Jet Motor Hand Routers, called Onsruters. The name derives {{from a combination}} of the inventor's last name [...] "Onsrud" [...] and the term [...] "router". The Onsruter married a router plane with an endmill to create the first handheld power router. The idea for the Onsruter started when a rail road company decided they wanted to power the <b>front</b> <b>light</b> on a Steam Locomotive using exhaust steam from the engine. Oscar Onsrud and his son Rudy came up with, and submitted, a design for a jet motor (air turbine) to generate the power for the light, however, they failed to win the contract. A few months later Rudy was talking with a friend about his frustrations making the groove {{in the bottom of a}} cane bottom chair using a router plane. A spark went off in Rudy's head that he could re-purpose the jet motor, which he had spent so much time developing, to run on compressed air and spin a modified endmill and make the routed groove easily. The modified endmills would have to spin at 30,000 RPM, instead of the 3,000 RPM of a milling machine, in order to cut wood and not burn it. These bits also needed a steeper rake and clearance angle to evacuate the chips than needed on a traditional endmill. These new bits became known as router bits or router cutters (UK).|$|E

60|$|XX. The {{method of}} {{decoration}} by shadow was, {{as far as}} we have hitherto traced it, common to the northern and southern Gothic. But in the carrying out of the system they instantly diverged. Having marble at his command, and classical decoration in his sight, the southern architect was able to carve the intermediate spaces with exquisite leafage, or to vary his wall surface with inlaid stones. The northern architect neither knew the ancient work, nor possessed the delicate material; and he had no resource but to cover his walls with holes, cut into foiled shapes like those of the windows. This he did, often with great clumsiness, but always with a vigorous sense of composition, and always, observe, depending on the shadows for effect. Where the wall was thick and could not be cut through, and the foilings were large, those shadows did not fill the entire space; but the form was, nevertheless, drawn on the eye by means of them, and when it was possible, they were cut clear through, as in raised screens of pediment, like those on the west front of Bayeux; cut so deep in every case, as to secure, in all but a direct low <b>front</b> <b>light,</b> great breadth of shadow.|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} {{questions}} respecting this faculty of conception of very great interest, {{such as the}} exact amount of aid that verbal knowledge renders so visible, (as, for instance, the verbal knowledge that a flower has five, or seven, or ten petals, or that a muscle is inserted at such and such a point of the bone, aids the conception of the flower or the limb;) and again, what amount of aid the visible knowledge renders to the verbal, as for instance, whether any one, being asked a question about some animal or thing, which instantly and from verbal knowledge he cannot answer, may have such power of summoning up {{the image of the}} animal or thing as to ascertain the fact, by actual beholding, (which I do not assert, but can conceive to be possible;) and again, what is that indefinite and subtile character of the conception itself in most men, which admits not of being by themselves traced or realized, and yet is a sure test of likeness in any representation of the thing; like an intaglio, with a <b>front</b> <b>light</b> on it, whose lines cannot be seen, and yet they will fit one definite form only, and that accurately; these and many other questions it is irrelevant at present to determine,[50] since to forward our present purpose, it will be well to suppose the conception, aided by verbal knowledge, to be absolutely perfect, and we will suppose a man to retain such clear image {{of a large number of}} the material things he has seen, as to be able to set down any of them on paper with perfect fidelity and absolute memory[51] of their most minute features.|$|E
