40|$|Abstract. Steel {{conveying}} rollers used in {{hot rolling}} mills must be exchanged very frequently at great cost because hot conveyed strips induce wear {{on the surface}} of roller in short periods. In this study, new roller structure is considered which has a ceramics sleeve connected with two short steel shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide longer life and reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, sometimes the steel shaft has to be pulled out for exchange. Simply, heating outside surface and cooling inside surface of the shaft are necessary for separation. However, attention should be paid to the maximum thermal stress of the ceramics sleeve in the process of separation. In this paper, finite element method analysis is applied to the structure and thermal stress has been calculated with the varying dimensions of the structure. Also several effects on thermal stress have been investigated, such as the effect of shrink fitting ratio, outside diameter, the <b>fitted</b> <b>length,</b> thickness of shaft, materials an so on. Finally the most appropriate thermal conditions to reduce maximum stress and make separation easy have been discussed, which is very useful for designing of new rollers...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{systematic}} study of xenon gas diffusion NMR in simple model porous media, random packs of mono-sized glass beads, {{and focus on}} three specific areas peculiar to gas-phase diffusion. These topics are: (i) diffusion of spins {{on the order of}} the pore dimensions during the application of the diffusion encoding gradient pulses in a PGSE experiment (breakdown of the narrow pulse approximation and imperfect background gradient cancellation), (ii) the ability to derive long length scale structural information, and (iii) effects of finite sample size. We find that the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, D(t), of the imbibed xenon gas at short diffusion times in small beads is significantly affected by the gas pressure. In particular, as expected, we find smaller deviations between measured D(t) and theoretical predictions as the gas pressure is increased, resulting from reduced diffusion during the application of the gradient pulse. The deviations are then completely removed when water D(t) is observed in the same samples. The use of gas also allows us to probe D(t) over a wide range of length scales and observe the long time asymptotic limit which is proportional to the inverse tortuosity of the sample, as well as the diffusion distance where this limit takes effect (approximately 1 - 1. 5 bead diameters). The Pade approximation {{can be used as a}} reference for expected xenon D(t) data between the short and the long time limits, allowing us to explore deviations from the expected behavior at intermediate times as a result of finite sample size effects. Finally, the application of the Pade interpolation between the long and the short time asymptotic limits yields a <b>fitted</b> <b>length</b> scale (the Pade length), which is found to be approximately 0. 13 b for all bead packs, where b is the bead diameter. c. 2002 Elsevier Sciences (USA) ...|$|E
