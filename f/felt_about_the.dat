5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E
5|$|Xenogears {{composer}} Yasunori Mitsuda {{announced plans}} to create an album of orchestral arrangements of music from that game on October 6, 2010, via his Twitter account. Mitsuda had previously released two albums of music from the game, both in 1998, the year the game was released—Xenogears Original Soundtrack, a soundtrack album for the game, and Creid, an album of arranged music inspired by Celtic folk music and Japanese rock. He {{has said that he}} decided to make the album due to the emotions that he and fans still <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game 13 years after its release, which led him to want to commemorate that. The music of Xenogears is particularly close to Mitsuda, as it was the last soundtrack that he worked on for Square Enix—the first video game company he worked for—and he knew that he would be leaving when he composed the soundtrack for the game. He has said that he had been considering the idea of a Xenogears orchestral album for six or seven years prior to starting on it, but until then did not have both the opportunity to work on the project and the confidence in his own abilities as an orchestrator to make the album sound as he wished.|$|E

25|$|In July 1985, {{residents}} of the Catholic district formed a group called People Against Injustice, later renamed the Drumcree Faith & Justice Group (DFJG). It quickly became the main group representing the residents. The DFJG sought to explain to Orangemen how residents <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> marches and to improve cross-community relations. It organized peaceful protests, issued newsletters and held talks with police. It also tried, unsuccessfully, to hold talks with the Orangemen.

Diệm recounted to <b>Felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Ngô family's achievements, then complained about American aid cuts in response to the pagoda raids. He blamed the generals, claiming they had attacked the Buddhists, not the special forces, and claimed Tung's men were now under the army's control and not used as a private army, which was false. Diệm also claimed that aid cutbacks had hindered the army and led to food shortages.|$|E

Television network executives and commentators responded with outrage. Julian Goodman, president of NBC, stated that Agnew had made an [...] "appeal to prejudice... it is regrettable that the Vice President of the United States should deny to TV freedom of the press". Frank Stanton, head of CBS, accused Agnew of trying to intimidate the news media, and his news anchor, Walter Cronkite, agreed. The speech was praised by conservatives from both parties, and gave Agnew a following among the right. Agnew deemed the Des Moines speech one of his finest moments.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{crossover}} with The Simpsons {{was first}} suggested while the thirteenth season of Family Guy was being planned out. Executive producer Richard Appel received Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's approval and input after brainstorming ideas. Appel then asked for permission from Simpsons executive producers Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Al Jean to use their characters. This was approved; Appel was previously a writer-producer on The Simpsons for four seasons, and retained his former colleagues' trust. Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith and Hank Azaria guest star as their Simpsons characters, but Harry Shearer, the final main cast member of The Simpsons, was unavailable. Asked how he <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> crossover, Shearer replied, [...] "Matter and anti-matter." ...|$|E

The trio revealed that they had seen her work on the Italian edition of Vogue and thought it was [...] "amazing", therefore, they picked her to film the visual. The group described the video treatment which Auleta wrote as having [...] "summed up how [...] <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song", and further revealed that they opted to film the video in Los Angeles as it was the city in which they wrote [...] "Flatline" [...] with Hynes.

To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that’s how everybody <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em.

500|$|U2's 1987 album The Joshua Tree and the {{supporting}} Joshua Tree Tour brought them critical acclaim and commercial success. However, their 1988 album and motion picture Rattle and Hum precipitated a critical backlash. Although the record sold 14million copies and performed well on music charts, critics were dismissive {{of it and}} the film. Hot Press editor Niall Stokes commented [...] "having started out as a band in the slipstream of punk, U2 remembered what they had <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> supergroups of the late '70s. Were they now about to become what they had despised?" [...] In the time leading up {{to the start of the}} Achtung Baby sessions, U2 listened to records which had a [...] "hard-edged industrial kind of sound", including works by KMFDM and Sonic Youth, as well as artists such as Roy Orbison and Jacques Brel. These influences led the band to seek the creation of songs which were harder musically than their previous work, while remaining personal lyrically.|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} {{was made by}} fashion film {{director}} Ruth Hogben in collaboration with West, who appears in a cameo in the video. The video was shot {{during the summer of}} 2011 during a two-day shoot. Hogben and West had brainstorming sessions deciding what the video was going to be conceptually, finally deciding something that would aesthetically fit the song the best. About collaborating with West, Hogben commented that the process was very organic and creative in nature, musing that the two went back and forth with ideas for visuals. The dancers in the video were not instructed to dance in any particular way by Yemi A.D. {{who was in charge of}} the dance choreography; and according to Ruth Hogben, they [...] "wanted an interpretation of how they <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song to be portrayed instead."

The Fugees also appeared at BET Awards 2005 during June 2005, where they opened the show with a 12-minute set. One track, [...] "Take It Easy", was leaked online and thereafter was released as an Internet single in late September. It peaked at number forty on the Billboard R Chart.

[...] When asked how she now <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> songs on 2.0, she stated [...] "a lot of the songs were transitional.

The first single off the album had intended to be [...] "Mulder and Scully", but the label insisted that [...] "I Am the Mob" [...] was released instead. As with previous works, this was delayed, and Catatonia performed at festivals during the summer of 1997 while they waited for the release. They were booked for the Glastonbury Festival, but upon arriving they were told their spot had been cancelled. Matthews continued to get the band mentioned in the gossip columns of newspapers due to her drunken behaviour.

Until the letter arrived, Toyah had been piecing her life back together by getting her job back at the Rovers and starting a romance with Sam. Of how Toyah <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> letter, Taylor told Adrian Lobb from Inside Soap, [...] "By the time Toyah gets the letter, she has grown a little stronger. But it comes as a complete surprise. Toyah doesn't trust Phil, obviously, and she thinks he's playing games. While part of her wants to confront him about the attack, there's another side of her that wants to let it go, and just leave it to the courts to deal with him." [...] Toyah agreed to Phil's request to visit him and Taylor said that Toyah believed that seeing Phil in person would help her {{to come to terms with}} what happened. When Toyah came face to face with Phil, her first thought was how pathetic he looked. When Phil tried to make excuses for what he had done, Toyah did not feel any pity and told him to plead guilty, which he agreed to do. Toyah left the prison feeling [...] "tearful, but triumphant" [...] and Taylor commented that while she would never fully recover from her ordeal, Toyah was determined to look towards the future.|$|E

The film was still a rough cut at this stage, missing completed titles and lacking special optical effects. It ran for four hours and twenty-five minutes, but would later be cut down to under four hours for its proper release. A double bill of Hawaiian Nights and Beau Geste was playing, and after the first feature {{it was announced that}} the theater would be screening a preview; the audience were informed they could leave but would not be readmitted once the film had begun, nor would phone calls be allowed once the theater had been sealed. When the title appeared on the screen the audience cheered, and after it had finished it received a standing ovation. In his biography of Selznick, David Thomson wrote that the audience's response before the film had even started [...] "was the greatest moment of [...] life, the greatest victory and redemption of all his failings", with Selznick describing the preview cards as [...] "probably the most amazing any picture has ever had." [...] When Selznick was asked by the press in early September how he <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film, he said: [...] "At noon I think it's divine, at midnight I think it's lousy.
