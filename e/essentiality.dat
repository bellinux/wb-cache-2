More than 1600 such organobromine compounds were identified by 1999. The most abundant is methyl bromide (CH3Br), of which an estimated 56,000 tonnes is produced by marine algae each year. The essential oil of the Hawaiian alga Asparagopsis taxiformis consists of 80% bromoform. Most of such organobromine compounds in the sea are made by the action of a unique algal enzyme, vanadium bromoperoxidase.|$|E

While discussing very much at random the <b>essentiality</b> {{of what we call}} Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration some few of those minor English or American poems which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most definite impression. By [...] "minor poems" [...] I mean, of course, poems of little length. And here, in the beginning, permit me {{to say a few words}} in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, [...] "a long poem," [...] is simply a flat contradiction in terms.|$|E

The Differentia, or specific difference, therefore, of man, as referred to the genus animal, is that outward form and the possession of reason. The Aristotelians said, the possession of reason, without the outward form. But if they adhered to this, {{they would have been}} obliged to call the Houyhnhnms men. The question never arose, and they were never called upon to decide how such a case would have affected their notion of <b>essentiality.</b> However this may be, they were satisfied with taking such a portion of the differentia as sufficed to distinguish the species from all other existing things, though by so doing they might not exhaust the connotation of the name.|$|E

Our present theme, however, has regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly {{on the topic of}} rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music, in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important an adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not now pause to maintain its absolute <b>essentiality.</b> It is in Music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty. It may be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and then, attained in fact. We are often made to feel, with a shivering delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus {{there can be little doubt}} that in the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers had advantages which we do not possess--and Thomas Moore, singing his own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.|$|E

60|$|Calling it, {{merely for}} the moment, electricity, {{we know that}} all {{experimental}} analysis of electricity has given, as an ultimate result, the principle, or seeming principle, heterogeneity. Only where things differ is electricity apparent; and it is presumable that they never differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent. Now, this result is in the fullest keeping with that which I have reached unempirically. The design of the repulsive influence I have maintained {{to be that of}} preventing immediate Unity among the diffused atoms; and these atoms are represented as different each from each. Difference is their character—their essentiality—just as no-difference was the <b>essentiality</b> of their source. When we say, then, that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, {{on the part of the}} repulsive influence, to prevent the contact, we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences will result in a development of electricity. All existing bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate contact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit, on bringing together any two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each:—an expression which, when reduced, is equivalent to this:—The amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies, is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are composed. That no two bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple corollary from all that has been here said. Electricity, therefore, existing always, is developed whenever any bodies, but manifested only when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into approximation.|$|E

Although implicitly advocating for switching partners based on the evidence of having variety, diversity, and nonredundancy of information accessed in relations, practise suggests otherwise. Firms have found to be interlinked over time and some do not even search for alternative partners. This study adds to prior research by examining how and why some organizations stick to the same partners in innovation processes. We report a qualitative study of organizations that have an agenda of sticking to partners in the development of innovations. We find using existing relationships had several important benefits for innovative performance possible to categorize as 1) effective use of indirect linkages, 2) better prerequisites for unspecified exchanges, 3) providing a fast lane to <b>essentialities</b> by known values and firm characteristics, 4) improved dialogue and surprises, and 5) enhanced enthusiasm guided by altruism.

40|$|Although many {{definitions}} of services {{have been proposed}} in Service Science and Service Engineering, <b>essentialities</b> {{of the notion of}} ``service" remain unclear. Especially, some existing {{definitions of}} service are similar to the definition of function of artifacts, and there is no clear distinction between them. Thus, aiming at an ontological conceptualization of service, we have made an ontological investigation into the distinction between service and artifact function. In this article, we reveal essential properties of service and propose a model and a definition of service. Firstly, we extract 42 properties of service from 15 articles in different disciplines in order to find out fundamental concepts of service. Then we show that the notion of function shares the extracted foundational concepts of service and thus point out the necessity of the distinction between them. Secondly, we propose a multi-layered model of services, which is based on the conceptualization of goal-oriented effects at the base-level and at the upper-level. Thirdly, based on the model, we clarify essential properties of service which can distinguish artifact function. The conceptualization of upper-effects (upper-service) enables us to show that upper-services include various effects such as sales and manufacturing. Lastly, we propose a definition of the notion of service based on the essential properties and show its validity using some examples...|$|R
