5|$|The capitol grounds cover three {{city blocks}} and include Willson and Capitol parks. Near the west {{entrance}} of the capitol is a replica of Philadelphia's Liberty Bell. This bell is one of 53 full-sized replicas made in France and donated by the United States government to each state. Oregon received its copy on July 4, 1950. Throughout the grounds are native trees and shrubs, including blue spruce, Oregon-grape (the state flower), giant sequoia, coast redwood, Japanese maple, dogwood species, Bradford pear, cherry tree species, <b>English</b> <b>holly,</b> rhododendron, and magnolia tree species. One Douglas-fir tree was grown using a seed that rode aboard Apollo 14 to the Moon in 1971 and was transplanted to the capitol in 1976 from Oregon State University.|$|E
500|$|About 37percent of the {{watershed}} is wooded. Dominant trees are red alder, bigleaf maple, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock. The forest understory in the Tryon Creek State Natural Area includes many trilliums; they are celebrated each spring during the park's Trillium Festival. More than 90species of wildflower such as fringecup {{are found in}} the park as well as plants such as sword fern. Invasive species found in many parts of {{the watershed}} include English ivy, Himalayan blackberry, <b>English</b> <b>holly,</b> garlic mustard, and western clematis.|$|E
500|$|Banksia ilicifolia, {{commonly}} known as holly-leaved banksia, is a tree in the family Proteaceae. Endemic to southwest Western Australia, it belongs to Banksia subg. Isostylis, a subgenus of three closely related Banksia species with inflorescences that are dome-shaped heads rather than characteristic Banksia flower spikes. It is generally a tree up to [...] tall with a columnar or irregular habit. Both the scientific and common names arise from the similarity of its foliage {{to that of the}} <b>English</b> <b>holly</b> Ilex aquifolium; the glossy green leaves generally have very prickly serrated margins, although some plants lack toothed leaves. The inflorescences are initially yellow but become red-tinged with maturity; this acts as a signal to alert birds that the flowers have opened and nectar is available.|$|E

60|$|So came on Christmas, {{with the}} anniversaries so sweet and so sad, and {{the eve of}} holly-dressing, when a bundle of bright sprays was left by some kind friend at No. 8, and Lance and Bobbie were vehement to {{introduce}} Fernando to <b>English</b> <b>holly</b> and English decking.|$|E
60|$|So, {{guests were}} bidden, and musicians were engaged, and tables spread, and floors {{prepared}} for active feet, and bountiful provision made, of every hospitable kind. Because {{it was the}} Christmas season, {{and his eyes were}} all unused to <b>English</b> <b>holly</b> and its sturdy green, the dancing-room was garlanded and hung with it; and the red berries gleamed an English welcome to him, peeping from among the leaves.|$|E
60|$|In the twining of <b>English</b> <b>holly</b> and Western pine {{upon the}} great English novelist's grave the poet expresses a happy thought. He calls East and West {{together}} in common appreciation of one whose influence {{was not merely}} local but worldwide. He invites the old world and the new to kneel together at the altar of sentiment, {{an appeal to the}} emotions which never fails to touch a responsive chord in the heart of humanity.|$|E
50|$|This Holme, {{unlike other}} places {{with the same}} name, is not from Old Norse holmr (island) but may be from Old <b>English</b> holegn (<b>holly</b> tree). The name of the place is often spelt as Holmewood; however, {{residents}} {{refer to it as}} Holme Wood.|$|R

50|$|Hollingworth was {{recorded}} Holisurde before 1059 and in 1086. Its name {{is derived from}} the Old <b>English</b> holegn, for <b>holly</b> and worð an enclosure. In 1059, Hollingworth was surrounded by dense forests.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, <b>English</b> teacher <b>Holly</b> Vance was demoted {{from her}} {{position}} as the adviser of the newspaper's production, due to the controversial penultimate issue on May 10, 2006, entitled [...] "The 'S' Word", which discussed sex amongst teenagers.

50|$|Grazing {{pressure}} by cattle and pigs {{has resulted in}} the replacement of Hawaiian plants by more competitive alien grasses and shrubs within the upper portions of Hakalau Forest. Below this pasture area, the native tree canopy is still intact, but the native understory has been replaced by alien grasses, blackberry (Rubus spp.), banana poka (Passiflora tarminiana), and <b>English</b> <b>holly</b> (Ilex aquifolium). The replacement process may have been accelerated by efforts to create more pasture land through bulldozing and burning, and by logging mature trees for timber and fence posts.|$|E
5000|$|Ilex aquifolium (holly, common holly, <b>English</b> <b>holly,</b> European holly, or {{occasionally}} Christmas holly), is {{a species}} of holly native to western and southern Europe, northwest Africa, and southwest Asia. I. aquifolium is the species familiar in Christmas decoration, and {{is regarded as the}} type species of the genus Ilex, which by association is also called [...] "holly". It is a evergreen tree or shrub found, for example, in shady areas of forests of oak and in beech hedges. It has a great capacity to adapt to different conditions and is a pioneer species that repopulates the margins of forests or clearcuts.|$|E
50|$|Banksia ilicifolia, {{commonly}} known as holly-leaved banksia, is a tree in the family Proteaceae. Endemic to southwest Western Australia, it belongs to Banksia subg.

50|$|Ongoing {{forestry}} activities pose {{threats to the}} integrity of the flora reserve through several processes. Of main concern is the invasion of Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) species that is utilised within the plantation. These species migrate into native forests and establish themselves in dense groups. Observed Radiata species has been noted and ongoing Landcare action in and around the flora reserve aims to remove these species. Lantana (Lantana camara) and <b>English</b> <b>holly</b> (Ilex aquifolium), whilst not currently found within SWFR, pose a direct threat to native species. Harvesting activities occur adjacent to and upslope from the SWFR and may alter hydraulic and geomorphic processes. Clear cutting of select areas upslope from SWFR may increase sediment loading within the waterways within the swamps.|$|E
5000|$|The small {{fruits of}} Ilex, {{although}} {{often referred to}} as berries, are technically drupes. They range in color from red to brown to black, and rarely green or yellow. The [...] "bones" [...] contain up to ten seeds each. Some species produce fruits parthenogenetically, such as the cultivar 'Nellie R. Stevens'. The fruits ripen in winter and thus provide winter colour contrast between the bright red of the fruits and the glossy green evergreen leaves. Hence the cut branches, especially of I. aquifolium, are widely used in Christmas decoration. The fruits are generally slightly toxic to humans, and can cause vomiting and diarrhea when ingested. However, they are an important food source for birds and other animals, which help disperse the seeds. Unfortunately this can have negative impacts as well. Along the west coast of North America, from California to British Columbia, <b>English</b> <b>Holly</b> (Ilex aquifolium), which is grown commercially, is quickly spreading into native forest habitat, where it thrives in shade and crowds out native species. It has been placed on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board's monitor list, and is a Class C invasive plant in Portland.|$|E
