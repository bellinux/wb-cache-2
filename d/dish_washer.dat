In 2002, an outbreak of systemic E. dermatitidis infection occurred in women who had received contaminated steroid injections at North Carolina hospitals.|$|R
40|$|Demand {{response}} (DR) is able {{to contribute}} to the secure and efficient operation of power systems. The implications of adopting the residential DR through smart appliances (SAs) were investigated from the perspective of three actors: customer, distribution network operator, and transmission system operator. The types of SAs considered in the investigation are: washing machines, <b>dish</b> <b>washers</b> and tumble dryers. A mathematical model was developed to describe the operation of SAs including load management features: start delay and cycle interruption. The optimal scheduling of SAs considering user behaviour and multiple-rates electricity tariffs was investigated using the optimisation software CPLEX. Further, the financial benefits for SA users subscribing to multiple-rates electricity tariffs were investigated. The savings are mainly a result of the appliances’ load shifting feature and are sensitive to user settings. The savings averaged at 7...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes and {{investigates the}} use of {{embedding}} sensors in products when designing and manufacturing them to improve the efficiency during their end-of-life (EOL) processing. First, separate design of experiments studies based on orthogonal arrays are carried out for conventional products (CPs) and sensor embedded products (SEPs). In order to calculate the response values for each experiment, detailed discrete event simulation models of both cases are developed considering the precedence relationships among the components together with the routing of different appliance types through the disassembly line. Then, pair-wise t-tests are conducted to compare the two cases based on different performance measures. The results showed that sensor embedded products improve revenue and profit while achieving significant reductions in backorder, disassembly, disposal, holding, testing and transportation costs. While the paper addresses the EOL processing of <b>dish</b> <b>washers</b> and dryers, the approach provided could be extended to any other industrial product...|$|R

40|$|Real-time demand {{response}} {{is an essential}} tool for handling the uncertainties associated with the increasing penetration of renewable generation. Traditionally, {{demand response}} {{has been focused on}} large industrial and commercial loads, however it is expected {{that a large number of}} small residential loads such as air conditioners, <b>dish</b> <b>washers,</b> and electric vehicles will also participate in the coming years. The electricity consumption of these smaller loads, which we call deferrable loads, can be shifted over time, and can thus be used (in aggregate) to compensate for the random fluctuations in renewable generation. In this paper, we propose a real-time distributed deferrable load control algorithm to reduce the variance of aggregate load (load minus renewable generation) by shifting the power consumption of deferrable loads to periods with high renewable generation. At every time step, the algorithm minimizes the expected aggregate load variance with updated predictions. We prove that the suboptimality of the algorithm vanishes quickly as time horizon expands. Further, we evaluate the algorithm via trace-based simulations...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a marked {{increase}} of interest in biodegradable materials for use in packaging, agriculture, medicine, and other areas. As a result, many researchers are investing time into modifying traditional materials to make them more environmental friendly, and into designing novel polymer composites out of naturally occurring materials. In order to overcome the environmental problems associated with natural and synthetic waste, biodegradation of materials holds good promise and a detailed and systematic study of the process are needed. Under ambient conditions, polymers are known to undergo deterioration in their properties characterized by change in their molecular weight and other physical properties. In this study biodegradable polymer based on natural products glucose and sorbitol were synthesized and were used in preparation of liquid and powder detergents, hand wash and <b>dish</b> <b>washers.</b> This investigation reveals that the polymers synthesized from raw materials of natural origin namely liquid glucose, glycerol, sorbitol etc. are susceptible to biodegradation...|$|R

Sources of grey water include water from sinks, showers, baths, washing machine or <b>dish</b> <b>washers.</b> As grey water contains fewer pathogens than domestic waste, it is generally safer to handle and easier to treat and reuse onsite for toilet flushing, landscape or crop irrigation. The removal of toxic content in grey water in this era {{is one of the}} most needed process by now. A constructed wetland (CW) is an artificial wetland created for the purpose of treating anthropogenic discharge such as domestic, industrial wastewater and storm water runoff. The treatment of grey water for the removal of toxic content using constructed wetland along with plant species is the most simple and widely accepted eco-friendly method for the better treatment of grey water. This paper addresses the treatment of grey water using constructed wetland with Canna Indica plant and reduces the toxic content in grey water. Grey water and treated water is tested for pH, Total dissolved solids, Turbidity, Chemical oxygen demand, Total hardness, Biochemical oxygen demand, Electronic conductivity and the removal efficiency is discussed with the results...|$|R

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to understand the simultaneous water demands for Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong in order to design an efficient water supply system at a balance of cost and engineering satisfactory. This study examines the probable maximum demands of water supply systems for Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong with the fixture unit approach, with on-site measurements of the demand patterns at some appliances in a typical Chinese restaurant in the region. Specifically, the demand patterns, the operating flow rates and the operating period of a demand, installed capacity of kitchen sinks, washbasins sink for tea urns and dishwashers were measured. The occupant load and its diurnal variations at the Chinese restaurant were also recorded. The ‘fixture units’ of kitchen sinks, washbasins sink for tea urns and <b>dish</b> <b>washers</b> of Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong were evaluated, and comparisons with the existing design values were performed. The estimates showed that, compared with the existing engineering designs, there were increased demands of plant capacity required for sinks of tea urn and dishwasher in Chinese restaurants.

40|$|This book {{provides}} both {{engineers and}} scientists with a competent and comprehensive survey {{on the different}} types of sensors currently applied in modern electronic household devices, their strengths, weaknesses and the reason for using them in which subsystem. More and more microelectronics are establishing themselves in all aspects of our daily life, and the use {{of a growing number of}} increasingly sophisticated, low-cost sensors is directly linked to this trend, and they are responsible for many of the technical achievements of the last decades. Their use in modern washing machines, <b>dish</b> <b>washers,</b> dryers, freezers as well as in cooking, domestic heating, air conditioning or small appliances results in reduction of electricity, water or detergent consumption, less noise emission, increased efficiency and higher user comfort. Market data is given, demonstrating the increasing demand for large quantities of suitable, reliable sensor systems, and the subsequent growing need for comprehensive information on their potentials and limitations. Exemplary products, new types of appliances and improved electronic control are presented. Chapters on thin film temperature sensors, Reed switches, gas sensors, UV sensors, acceleration and pressure sensors illustrate the utilization of modern device mass fabrication technologies.
