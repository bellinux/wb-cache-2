50|$|The National Giro was {{the first}} {{financial}} institution in Europe and possibly the world, to be established from the outset to be fully computerised. What's more, it broke new ground in Europe when it adopted optical character recognition for its transfer, <b>inpayment</b> and outpayment transaction documents, {{making it possible for}} the first time for utility companies and mail order companies to print their own personalised remittance slips and automate {{at least part of the}} complex accounting processes.|$|E
40|$|The study applies two {{approaches}} for {{the estimation of}} the social costs of main payment instruments (cash, debit card and credit card transactions, credit transfers, direct debits, business-to-business direct debits, postal <b>inpayment</b> money orders, postal outpayment money orders for pensions) used in Hungary in 2009. The first approach {{is based on the}} current payment structure, while the second approach is based on a more modern, hypothetical payment structure involving less cash, with no use of paper-based methods. In the first approach, the social cost amounts to HUF 388 billion, i. e. 1. 49 % of the GDP, while in the second approach, such cost amounts to HUF 285 billion, i. e. 1. 09 % of the GDP. In this context, social cost means the use of all resources (time, materials and money) necessary for the execution of payments, calculated as a net value (i. e. exclusive of fees paid for payment services). Thus, HUF 103 billion could be saved in social costs if the use of payment instruments were to be modified. private cost, social cost, net private cost, unit cost, social savings, cash transactions, debit card transactions, credit card transactions, paper-based credit transfers, electronic credit transfers, direct debits, business-to-business direct debits, postal <b>inpayment</b> money orders, postal outpayment money orders for pensions...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to assess the impact}} of {{currency}} depreciation on the trade balance, recent studies are employing disaggregated trade data to avoid aggregation bias. However, since import and export prices are not available at disaggregated level, recent studies are using export and import values rather than their volumes so that they can establish direct relation between <b>inpayments</b> and the exchange rate as well as between outpayments and the exchange rate. This study explores the experience of Malaysia. Bilateral <b>inpayments</b> and outpayments models are estimated between Malaysia and her 14 trading partners using quarterly data and bound testing approach to cointegration. The results show that while real depreciation of the ringgit has short-run effects, in the long-run it increases Malaysia's <b>inpayments</b> from only five trading partners. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies that}} {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} real depreciation of the rupee on Indian trade balance used aggregate trade data and provided no support for real depreciation {{to be effective in}} improving India's trade balance. In this article we disaggregate the Indian trade data by commodity and consider the sensitivity of each industry's <b>inpayments</b> (export value) and outpayments (import value) to real rupee-dollar exchange rate. Annual data over the period of 1962 to 2004 from 40 industries that trade between the two countries as well as bounds testing approach are used to show that while in half of the industries real depreciation of rupee has short-run effects on <b>inpayments</b> and outpayments, the short-run effects do not last into the long-run in majority of the cases. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – To avoid {{aggregation}} bias by using trade data at bilateral level {{so that we}} can determine how sensitive are Britain's <b>inpayments</b> and outpayments to the value of the British pound. Design/methodology/approach – The method is based on the bounds testing approach to cointegration and error-correction modeling. Findings – The main finding is that while UK <b>inpayments</b> are not sensitive to the exchange rate, her outpayments are. Research limitations/implications – Future research must concentrate on disaggregating data further, perhaps at commodity level. Practical implications – The results could be used to identify Britain's trading partners against which Britain can devalue the pound and improve her trade balance. Originality/value – No study has attempted to test the impact of real depreciation of the pound on Britain's payments and receipts with her major trading partners.

50|$|In 1978, National Giro renamed itself National Girobank {{to re-establish}} {{itself in the}} minds of the public as a bank, rather than some quasi non-bank. Its status as a bank had been fixed in law, but it had until now been {{reluctant}} to use the term. It also re-launched its ambition to be the People's Bank, and was the first bank to offer free banking to UK personal customers (provided the account was in credit. This included free postage for the remittance of documents to the Giro Centre as well as free cheques and deposits (the terms <b>inpayments</b> and outpayments were dropped).|$|R
50|$|The {{risks that}} arise {{are the same}} that Banks have always faced: First, the {{solvency}} of the SIV {{may be at risk}} if the value of the long-term security that the SIV has bought falls below that of the short-term securities that the SIV has sold. Banks typically avoid this risk by not marking to market their loan portfolios. Second, there is a liquidity risk, as the SIV borrows short term and invests long term; i.e., outpayments become due before the <b>inpayments</b> are due. Unless the borrower can refinance short-term at favorable rates, he may be forced to sell the asset into a depressed market.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies that}} have {{investigated}} the impact of real depreciation of the Thai baht on Thailand's trade flows have either used aggregate trade data between Thailand {{and the rest of}} the world, or between Thailand and its major trading partners. These studies have provided mixed results. In this paper, we disaggregate the trade flows between Thailand and its major trading partner, the US, by commodity and investigate the impact of currency depreciation on the export earnings of 118 American exporting industries and the outpayments of 42 American importing industries. While most industries are affected in the short run, the short-run results last into the long run in several small industries. The <b>inpayments</b> of large exporting industries and the outpayments of large importing industries are not affected. Economic activity seems to be the major long-run determinant of the performance of most industries. Thailand US Commodity trade Bounds testing...|$|R
40|$|The article {{determines that}} {{without regard to}} {{research}} and suggestions of many foreign and domestic scientists who study {{the issue of the}} size of the state sector and the national estate administration, in Ukraine the effective model of state sector is not formed. As a result the country has no valid system of control of estate administration. As the existing system of management shows, the regulative functions of the state in the field of property are performed by a number of different state institutions. Though the world experience demonstrates, that it is more reasonable to deal with such matters by a unique authorized body. The article determines a number of problems related to the development of the estate administration and gives suggestions for solving the problems. Having analysed the estate system of control it is possible to draw a conclusion, that the state pattern of ownership has low efficiency. In today's terms privatization exists not only as a process of changing the proprietor but also as a separate source of receipt of funds to the state budget which enables the state to conduct certain social programs. But lately the privatization process has been complicated by the legislative innovations, namely by the necessity of privatization of the premises together with the land. Taking into account the duration of land estimation, it prolongs the procedure of privatization considerably and in addition increases the cost of the object. It should be noticed that for some time past lease, which is also one of the sources of <b>inpayments</b> to the state budget, has come forward as a widespread method of estate administration. Although in terms of financial crisis the demand on the objects of lease of public domain diminishes and the tendency of decrease of the market property objects of lease grows. It is therefore necessary to pay attention to the market calls and stimulate subjects of leasing relations at legislative level. As a result of analysis the steps to perfection of the existing legislative base were determined, conducting the monitoring of estate administration, acceleration of passing of the acts that regulate the sphere of estate administration...|$|R
