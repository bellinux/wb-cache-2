60|$|First. I must touch {{a little}} upon the word GRACE, {{and show you}} how {{diversely}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken.</b> Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> for the goodwill and favour of men (Esth 2:17: Ruth 2:2: 1 Sam 1:18: 2 Sam 16:4). Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> for those sweet ornaments that a life according to the Word of God putteth about the neck 9 (Prov 1:9; 3:22).

5|$|The {{airfield}} {{was constructed}} with triangular runways in 1938. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> {{over by the}} Luftwaffe in 1940, who expanded it and laid down two wooden runways. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> over by the NoRAF in 1945, but abandoned in 1952. It opened in 1963 and was largely funded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Scandinavian Airlines operated out of the airport to the other primary airports in Finnmark and to Tromsø and Oslo. The runway was extended in 1968. From 1990, flights were taken over by SAS Commuter and the direct flights to Oslo were halted. From the mid-1990s there have been occasional charter flights out of Banak.

5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E

In 1933 the CLR was taken into public ownership along with the UERL.|$|E

As an alternative to demolition, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> into the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1937.|$|E

5|$|It was {{maintained}} throughout the 15th century, {{and played a}} role in Kett's Rebellion of 1549, when the rebels attacked Norwich, deploying artillery and damaging the tower's parapets. Repairs to the tower's walls in the late 19th century inadvertently caused long-term damage, and in 1953 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works, who stabilised its condition in a five-year conservation project. In the 21st century, Cow Tower is managed by English Heritage and Norwich City Council; the tower is now only a shell, however, as the floors and the roof of the building have been lost.|$|E
