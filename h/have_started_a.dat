5|$|As {{part of his}} {{strategy}} {{for dealing with the}} Marcher Lords, Llywelyn married his eldest son, Dafydd, to Isabella, the daughter of William de Braose, a powerful lord in Brecon, Builth and Abergavenny. The Marcher Lords had adopted a style of stone castle that included circular keeps and an integrated system of curtain walls. Following Dafydd's marriage, Llywelyn appears to <b>have</b> <b>started</b> <b>a</b> second phase of building at Dolbadarn, probably in the 1240s, adding these elements to the existing castle. The prince was probably aiming not only to incorporate the latest military technology, but also to create a castle of equal prestige to those of his new allies in the south. Traditionally the surrounding district of Is Gwyrfai had been run from the town of Llanbeblig; after the 1240s, this role was transferred to Dolbadarn.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus {{appear to be}} young, they must be {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would <b>have</b> <b>started</b> <b>a</b> collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km.|$|E
5|$|The falling trees downed {{power lines}} and poles, causing power outages and some {{property}} damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged by trees. Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to <b>have</b> <b>started</b> <b>a</b> fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging a mobile home in Bellwood. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in Camp Hill, a carport being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County.|$|E

Akşener subsequently began legal proceedings against two pro-government journalists whom she accused of starting the defamation campaign against her. One of these journalists, Latif Erdoğan, claimed that the Gülen Movement had obtained the recording to blackmail Akşener, though both Akşener and Gülen's lawyer denied the claims and accused them of being baseless.|$|E

25|$|Some {{characteristics}} of their goldwork were unique to these mountain people, but {{their work is}} closely related to that of the Zenúes from the rivers. Since many items come from the mountains of San Jacinto, it may have been an important production center. It is unknown when the production of goldwork started in this area, but given the similarity of themes and techniques with those of the goldwork found in river valleys that was already being produced by 200 BCE, it could <b>have</b> <b>started</b> <b>a</b> long time ago. Carbon dating has shown that the production of San Jacinto certainly continued until after the Spanish conquest.|$|E
25|$|The {{state-owned}} Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) acquired {{shares in}} oil fields {{in countries like}} Sudan, Syria, Iran, and Nigeria – investments {{that have led to}} diplomatic tensions with the United States. Because of political instability in the Middle East and increasing domestic demand for energy, India is keen on decreasing its dependency on OPEC to meet its oil demand, and increasing its energy security. Several Indian oil companies, primarily led by ONGC and Reliance Industries, <b>have</b> <b>started</b> <b>a</b> massive hunt for oil in several regions in India, including Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari Basin and north-eastern Himalayas. India is developing an offshore gas field in Mozambique. The proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline is a part of India's plan to meet its increasing energy demand.|$|E

25|$|The Frog Baby statue {{has been}} the center of legend and {{tradition}} since it was presented by Frank Ball in 1937. While initially {{on display in the}} David Owsley Museum of Art, students began a tradition of rubbing the statue's nose for good luck before taking exams. Over the years, the nose was worn away, and in 1993, the statue was sent overseas for refurbishment. Today, Frog Baby is situated in a fountain on University Green. Since its move and restoration, students <b>have</b> <b>started</b> <b>a</b> new tradition of dressing the statue to reflect weather patterns (scarves and hats in the winter) or current university events (jerseys and helmets for upcoming football games). Despite 24/7 surveillance, the statue has been a repeated target of vandals.|$|E
25|$|Jonathan Lewis {{was found}} {{and taken to}} jail, where he escaped a month later.

Word of Lewis's {{whereabouts}} reached Randolph County; the citizens demanded he be apprehended. Jonathan Lewis was found and placed in jail once more. His trial was moved from Randolph County to Guilford County in 1815. He was found not guilty, despite witnesses and evidence, and was free to return to Kentucky. Five years later, in 1820, Jonathan Lewis was said to have died of an illness, confessing to the murder of Naomi Wise on his deathbed.|$|E

According to historian Dr Dulari Qureshi Tipu Sultan was a fierce warrior king and was so quick in his movement {{that it seemed to}} the enemy that he was fighting on many fronts at the same time. Tipu managed to subdue all the petty kingdoms in the south. He defeated the Nizams and {{was also one of the}} few Indian rulers to have defeated British armies.

25|$|Brady and Joe Montana are {{the only}} players in NFL history to win {{multiple}} NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards.

He became the first quarterback to throw for 50 touchdowns in a season. In 2010, he was unanimously chosen as the NFL MVP, becoming the first player since 1986 to be unanimously chosen as MVP, and was ranked as the top player in the NFL Top 100, a poll of league players. He set the NFL record for consecutive passes without an interception (358), and broke his own record for the highest season touchdown to interception ratio, among players who <b>have</b> <b>started</b> <b>a</b> full season, at 9:1 (this is currently the third best TD:INT ratio for a single season by a quarterback).|$|E

500|$|Because {{indigenous}} languages {{were excluded}} from the education systems of Mexico and Guatemala after independence, Mayan peoples remained largely illiterate in their native languages, learning to read and write in Spanish, if at all. However, since the establishment of the Cordemex [...] and the Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages (1986), native language literacy has begun to spread and a number of indigenous writers <b>have</b> <b>started</b> <b>a</b> new tradition of writing in Mayan languages. Notable among this new generation is the K'iche' poet Humberto Ak'ab'al, whose works are often published in dual-language Spanish/K'iche' editions, as well as K'iche' scholar Luis Enrique Sam Colop (1955–2011) whose translations of the Popol Vuh into both Spanish and modern K'iche' achieved high acclaim.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Ramirez {{was limited}} to 118 games due to injuries, but {{recorded}} a career-high [...]351 batting average, along with 38 home runs and 122 RBIs. His return is believed to <b>have</b> <b>started</b> <b>a</b> major comeback that led the Indians to a final record of 90–72 and {{cut the number of}} games they were behind the leader of the AL Central, the Chicago White Sox, from 11.5 games down to 7.5 games in just a month. Because of his return, Roberto Alomar, Omar Vizquel, and Kenny Lofton all started getting better pitches to hit, which also significantly increased their batting averages. Despite the comeback, the Indians failed to make the postseason, finishing 5 games behind the White Sox in the AL Central. With free agency looming, Ramirez homered in what would be his final game and at-bat in an Indians uniform, on October 1 against Toronto in front of the home fans at Jacobs Field.|$|E
