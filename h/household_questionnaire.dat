30|$|The {{data for}} this paper are derived from National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 3) {{conducted}} by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai and ORC Macro International in 2005 – 06. It covers 99 percent of India’s population from 29 states of India. NFHS- 3 covers 1, 09, 041 households and 5, 15, 507 individuals enumerate throughout the country. Three types of questionnaires are used in NFHS- 3 as (i) the <b>Household</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> (ii) the Women questionnaire, and (iii) the Men’s questionnaire. The main domain of this data set covers {{a wide range of}} issues including fertility, mortality, family planning, HIV-related knowledge, nutrition, health and health care. In the <b>household</b> <b>questionnaire</b> about school activities, households were asked about children aged 6 – 14 years and the estimated percentage of schooling pattern in this research paper.

30|$|After wave 1, the <b>household</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was {{expanded}} to incorporate several blocks of questions intended to measure household welfare.

40|$|In {{this study}} we show that {{incentives}} (dog collars and owner wristbands) are effective at increasing owner participation in mass dog rabies vaccination clinics and we conclude that <b>household</b> <b>questionnaire</b> surveys and the mark-re-sight (transect survey) method for esti-mating post-vaccination coverage are accurate when all dogs, including puppies, are included. Incentives were distributed during central-point rabies vaccination clinics in north-ern Tanzania to quantify their effect on owner participation. In villages where incentives were handed out participation increased, {{with an average of}} 34 more dogs being vacci-nated. Through economies of scale, this represents a reduction in the cost-per-dog of $ 0. 47. This represents the price-threshold under which the cost of the incentive used must fall to be economically viable. Additionally, vaccination coverage levels were determined in ten villages through the gold-standard village-wide census technique, as well as through two cheaper and quicker methods (randomized <b>household</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and the transect survey). Cost data were also collected. Both non-gold standard methods were found to be accurate when puppies were included in the calculations, although the transect survey an...|$|E

40|$|Irrigation {{has been}} {{identified}} as an important tool to stimulate economic growth and rural development, and is considered as a cornerstone of food security in Tanzania. While a lot of efforts are being exerted towards irrigation development, a little attempt is being made towards the effectiveness of already constructed schemes. This study is an attempt to show whether already constructed scheme is effective or not, in the case of Uruila irrigation scheme in Nsimbo District Council, Katavi Region. The major concern {{of this study was to}} assess effectiveness of the irrigation scheme with specific objectives to determine its contribution to food productivity, assessing how extension officers influence farmers to increase productivity and to explore the challenges of the irrigation scheme. To realize these objectives, <b>household</b> <b>questionnaires,</b> focus group discussions, field visits, and field observations were used. For <b>household</b> survey <b>questionnaires</b> a total of 108 sampled households were randomly selected.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. In the four focus countries (Fiji, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Ghana), two case-study communities were selected. Two <b>household</b> <b>questionnaires</b> were designed: one on resilience, {{and one on}} quality of life (well-being). Within each community, 60 households were then randomly selected, making a total of 480 households across the four countries. The two questionnaires were administered to the same <b>households.</b> The resilience <b>questionnaire</b> included 4 main modules: - a household roster - a module on shocks and stressors experienced by the household {{in the last five}} years. - a module on the strategies adopted by households to respond to these different shocks, stressors and slow changes. - a module on resilience outcomes. The quality of life questionnaire elicited information on people’s perceptions about their quality of life. The framework identifies ten domains under two generic dimensions: ‘Material wellbeing’ and ‘Quality of life’. Project description: The overall aim of the project is to use the most recent progress in resilience thinking and wellbeing research to provide a policy-relevant analysis of the world fisheries crisis and its human consequences...|$|R

30|$|A {{field survey}} {{approach}} of face-to-face interview method of questionnaire administration was adopted {{to maximize the}} response rate (Denscombe 2010). A total of 466 <b>household</b> <b>questionnaires</b> were administered to farmers in the study area. To obtain reliable responses on climatic information, the questionnaire administration was conducted using appropriate local terms in the common local language (Frafra) spoken by {{the people in the}} study area. From a household of more than one farmer, only one farmer was interviewed to avoid bias as observed by Kemausuor et al. (2011). The farmers in the area include mainly those who practiced rain-fed only and those who practiced both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture. Interviews of farmers were conducted between August and September, 2013.

The key variables used in analysis include: life satisfaction to proxy utility, a binary variable indicating whether the individual used an accompanying procedure, and EQ 5 D health outcome measures, alongside control variables.
