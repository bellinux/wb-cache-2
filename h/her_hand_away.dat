60|$|The crimson flamed over Nancy's face again. She pulled <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|She pulled <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> quickly, wide-eyed, and {{for some}} moments was silent.|$|E
60|$|She drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> quickly, and {{the flush}} on her haggard face deepened.|$|E
60|$|She took <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from a {{face that}} looked just {{as if she were}} going to cry.|$|R
60|$|She {{wrenched}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from his. There was a bright, {{red spot}} of colour flaring on her cheeks. Her {{eyes were on}} fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, John," [...] she said, {{stretching}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> {{over the}} fair plain of the Guadalquivir, {{as soon as}} we stood against the parapet; [...] "is not that lovely?" ...|$|R
60|$|JULIA (snatching <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> in disgust). Oh, {{stop talking}} that nasty sneering stuff.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the swift}} revulsion came, and she drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> and sprang up.|$|E
60|$|She {{attempted}} to take <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> but he closed {{on it with}} a protecting, fatherly clasp.|$|E
60|$|She pulled <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> {{and flung}} {{them up to}} her face, her form shaken by stormy sobs. In {{distress}} {{he put his arm}} about her and drew her closer.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't know me, papa," [...] said Flora, drawing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from him, and tightly {{clenching}} {{them in one}} another, as thoughts far too {{terrible for}} words swept over her.|$|R
60|$|He disregarded her bidding to {{the extent}} of placing his arm around her waist. He made no attempt, however, to draw <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from <b>her</b> face, or stop her tears.|$|R
60|$|Miss Castro {{positively}} blushed as {{she drew}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> but her laughter indicated a mingling of pride with scorn.|$|E
60|$|But he put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> {{and turning}} his face, stared {{out of the}} window. And so they reached their home.|$|E
60|$|Slipping <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> {{she went}} back to the window. Harz stood, looking after her; then, taking up his palette, again began painting.|$|E
5000|$|Opening rein: {{does not}} pull back, {{but rather the}} rider moves his or <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from the horse's neck in the {{direction}} of the turn. This is especially useful if the rider wants to turn in the air when jumping a fence.|$|R
60|$|Kilmeny {{had listened}} with averted face. At first she had blushed painfully {{but now she}} had grown very pale. When he had {{finished}} speaking and {{was waiting for her}} answer, she suddenly pulled <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> and, putting them over her face, burst into tears and noiseless sobs.|$|R
60|$|Twice I knocked <b>her</b> <b>'and</b> <b>away,</b> and then, right afore my {{wife and}} the party next door, she put her arm round my waist. By the time I got to the 'ouse my legs was {{trembling}} so I could hardly stand, and when I got into the passage I 'ad to lean {{up against the wall}} for a bit.|$|R
6000|$|Unwittingly, I had {{hit upon}} a {{sovereign}} remedy for her tears. She sat up at once, drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> and said, with some asperity: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{only put}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from me, and advised her {{to return to}} her chair. This {{perfectly}} harmless proceeding seemed absolutely to frighten her.|$|E
60|$|Hetty {{glanced at}} him covertly. His face was compassionate, but there was rather toleration than concern in it, and she pulled <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from him.|$|E
60|$|About half-past ten, we led her out, {{and made}} her {{sit down in the}} rocking-chair. Mrs. Chipperton stood on one side of her, holding one of <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> while the neighbor-woman stood on the other side, and held the other hand. This arrangement, however, did not last long, for Poqua-dilla soon jerked <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> thinking, perhaps, that if {{anything}} was done that hurt, it might be better to be free for a jump.|$|R
60|$|I {{went to my}} mother. Presently {{she raised}} herself {{from the ground and}} sat up with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> over <b>her</b> face. The blood from the wound the stick had made ran down her face on to her breast, and I wiped it away with grass. She sat for a long while thus, while the child cried, the cow lowed to be milked, and I wiped up the blood with the grass. At last she took <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> and spoke to me.|$|R
50|$|The {{scene in}} which Marcie watches <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> fade <b>away</b> was {{inspired}} by a vivid dream that show creator Joss Whedon had as a child.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} she sat still, and then a pain shot through her, a pain as sharp as a dagger thrust. She drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed as}} though {{something}} in his tone might have grated upon her. Gently, but with a certain firmness, she drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from his.|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON. Pah! (He flings <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> with {{an exclamation}} of disgust, and {{turns his back}} on her with his hand in his breast and his brow lowering.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you have}} no right to think ..." [...] she continued, with a growing, nervous excitement, drawing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> hurriedly <b>away,</b> for he had tried to seize it.|$|R
6000|$|JUDITH. I {{may well}} be. I don't {{know what to}} do. I don't know what to do. (Tearing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away.)</b> I must save him. (Anderson rises in alarm as she runs wildly to the door. It is opened in her face by Essie, who hurries in, full of anxiety. The {{surprise}} is so disagreeable to Judith that it brings her to her senses. Her tone is sharp and angry as she demands) What do you want? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dr Mellon," [...] she said, drawing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> firmly <b>away,</b> [...] "I cannot, {{should not}} reply. You {{do not know}} all the--the {{circumstances}} of my life--my poverty, my solitary condition in the world--my--my--" ...|$|R
6000|$|She jerked <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> and, burying it {{with its}} mate in his curly mop, {{shook his head}} back and forth. [...] "What shall I do with him, father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She pulled <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away.</b> [...] "No, I {{shall not}} take any more medicine. You think {{everything}} is physical. Why don't you ask at once to see my tongue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care for}} myself," [...] she said, {{plucking}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away.</b> [...] "I'm young and strong, and I can bear it. But it's father I'm so anxious about." ...|$|E
60|$|Then with a {{grasp of}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> Appleby turned <b>away,</b> and Violet went on slowly down the dusky lane.|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS. Call everybody, my darling--everybody in London. Now I shall {{no longer}} have to be brutal--to defend myself--to go in fear of you. How I have looked forward to this day! You know now that I don't want you to marry me or to love me: Paramore can have all that. I only want to look on and rejoice disinterestedly in the {{happiness}} of (kissing <b>her</b> <b>hand)</b> my dear Julia (kissing the other), my beautiful Julia. (She tears <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> and raises them as if to strike him, as she did the night before at Cuthbertson's.) No use to threaten me now: I am not afraid of those hands--the loveliest hands in the world.|$|R
60|$|The woful countenance she saw {{made any}} other answer needless. Involuntarily <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> fell <b>away,</b> and she hid her own face, uttering the one reproach, which, tender and tearful though it was, seemed harder to be borne than the stern {{condemnation}} gone before.|$|R
