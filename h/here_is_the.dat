5|$|The {{owners of}} Belton are {{buried in the}} village of Belton's parish church close to the house. Their tombs are collectively one of the most {{complete}} sets of family memorials in England—continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years. The earliest Brownlow buried <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> founder of the family fortune the lawyer Richard Brownlow (1555–1638), {{and one of the most}} recent is the 6th Baron Brownlow (1899–1978).|$|E

60|$|A {{reader of}} the Arabian Nights felt quite at home. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> suffumigation; <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> muttering wizard; <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> desert place to which Aladdin <b>was</b> decoyed by <b>the</b> false uncle. But they manage these things better in fiction. <b>The</b> effect <b>was</b> marred by <b>the</b> levity of the magician, {{entertaining}} his patient with small talk like an affable dentist, and by the incongruous presence of Mr. Osbourne with a camera. As for my cold, it was neither better nor worse.|$|R
5|$|Control {{systems have}} a need for {{smoothing}} filters in their feedback loops with criteria to maximise the speed of movement of a mechanical system to the prescribed mark {{and at the same}} time minimise overshoot and noise induced motions. A key problem <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> extraction of Gaussian signals from a noisy background. An early paper on this was published during WWII by Norbert Wiener with the specific application to anti-aircraft fire control analogue computers. Rudy Kalman (Kalman filter) later reformulated this in terms of state-space smoothing and prediction where it is known as the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. Kalman started an interest in state-space solutions, but according to Darlington this approach can also be found in the work of Heaviside and earlier.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
5|$|Wagener County Park {{is located}} off M-25 in the {{community}} of Helena. M-25 begins to curve to the northwest in Sand Beach near the Rock Falls Cemetery. In the city of Harbor Beach, M-25 is called Huron Avenue and meets M-142 for the first of two occasions. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Harbor Beach Golf Course {{on the south side of}} town as M-25 moves inland through town. North of town, the trunkline parallels an old routing of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway as it is once again renamed Lakeshore Road. The highway moves farther inland north of Rubicon and Port Hope as it begins to round the tip of the Thumb. In Grindstone City, M-25 loses the Lakeshore Road name in favor of Grindstone Road all the way to Port Austin.|$|E

5|$|Leland {{is home to}} Fishtown, and the ferries to the Manitou Islands off {{the coast}} of the Leelanau Peninsula. Continuing northward, M-22 reaches its northernmost extent in Northport before turning south. It passes through the {{reservation}} of the Grand Traverse Band of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians in Peshawbestown, home to one of the tribe's two casinos. Further south is the community of Suttons Bay located on the small bay of the same name. From here south, the highway runs just off the shore of the Grand Traverse Bay south to Greilickville. Just south of Greilickville, M-22 enters a section of the city of Traverse City that's located in Leelanau County, Michigan formed by an acquisition of a neighborhood of Greilickville. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> eastern junction between M-22 and M-72. The two highways run concurrently along Grandview Parkway to Division Street. There they meet US31/M-37 and M-22 ends. A portion of this road has been designated a what is now called a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway by the state of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|The old Jewish Quarter (Mellah) is {{situated}} in the kasbah area of the city's medina, east of Place des Ferblantiers. It was created in 1558 by the Saadians at {{the site where the}} sultan's stables were previously located. At the time, the Jewish community consisted of {{a large portion of the}} city's bankers, jewelers, metalworkers, tailors and sugar traders. During the 16th century, the Mellah had its own fountains, gardens, synagogues and souks. Until the arrival of the French in 1912, Jews could not own property outside of the Mellah; all growth was consequently contained within the limits of the neighborhood, resulting in narrow streets, small shops and higher residential buildings. The Mellah, today reconfigured as a mainly residential zone renamed Hay Essalam, currently occupies an area smaller than its historic limits and has an almost entirely Muslim population. The Alzama Synagogue, built around a central courtyard, is located in the Mellah. The Jewish cemetery <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> largest of its kind in Morocco. Characterized by white-washed tombs and sandy graves, the cemetery is located within the Medina on land adjacent to the Mellah.|$|E
5|$|The old {{heritage}} monuments, {{which are}} palaces and temples {{are located in}} the old town (east of the Chaugans), on the lower slopes of Shah Madar hill. They were built in the lower valley where the two rivers and steep thickly forested hillsides provided a strong defense. Located <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 10th century Champavati Temple, said to have marked the birth of the town, the Lakshmi Narayan group of temples (built from 10th-19th century), the 10th century Sita Ram Temple, Bansi Gopal temple, Kharura Mohalla and Hari Rai temple, the 11th century Sui Mata Temple and Chamunda Devi Temple, and the Akhand Chandi palace, overlooking the Chaugan, which has since been converted into a college. Additions were made to the palace {{in the form of the}} Zenana Mahal and the Rang Mahal in the 18th century. The temples built in Chamba demonstrate a strong Kashmiri influence with their stone temple architecture and temple iconography. Given their age however, only their unicellular layout with fluted pillars has been retained.|$|E
