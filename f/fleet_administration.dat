500|$|Although naval {{themes were}} {{organized}} {{much the same}} way as their land counterparts, there is some confusion in the Byzantine sources as to the exact rank structure. The usual term for admiral was stratēgos, the same term used for the generals that governed the land themata. Under the stratēgos were two or three tourmarchai (sing. tourmarches, effectively [...] "Vice Admiral"), in turn overseeing a number of droungarioi (sing. droungarios, corresponding to [...] "Rear Admiral"). Until the mid-9th century, the governors of the themes of the Aegean and Samos are also recorded as droungarioi, since their commands were split off from the original Karabisianoi fleet, but they were then raised to the rank of stratēgos. As the thematic admirals also doubled as governors of their themes, they were assisted by a prōtonotarios ("chief secretary/notary") who headed the civilian administration of the theme. Further staff officers were the chartoularios in charge of the <b>fleet</b> <b>administration,</b> the prōtomandatōr ("chief messenger"), who acted as chief of staff, and a number of staff komētes ("counts", sing. komēs), including a komēs tēs hetaireias, who commanded the bodyguard (hetaireia) of the admiral.|$|E

50|$|This signal {{book was}} {{prepared}} for Franco-Spanish cooperation, as it begins with special signals for indicating Spanish and French squadrons, divisions, frigates, the reserve corps, etc. The 400 signals for use at anchor covered not only every feature of <b>fleet</b> <b>administration,</b> as {{in the manner of}} Morogues, but also shore bombardments and landings. Twenty special signals allowed for reporting the movements of ships, to be made by privateers. The signals for use under sail by day, made with a combination of 'cornets', which were swallow-tail flags, other flags, and flags from the table, included a series of battle signals. No-one studying this book could criticise the Spanish either for a lack of useful signals for battle and general purposes, or for over elaboration of signalling technique. Although still tied to the tabular system, their arrangement was brilliantly simple compard with that of the French.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was aimed at}} establishing aspects leading to adjusting the operational design of public transport fleet operation {{to make it more}} profitable for private investors. Data obtained from more than a year’s operation by the Alianza Sat S. A. was used (this being a bus- company alliance grouping about 100 buses from some of Bogotá’s collective transport companies) for carrying out the present investigation regarding <b>fleet</b> <b>administration</b> and operation. Simply implementing conventionally-designed routing plans is not enough for rationalising fleet operation, as most public collective transport is not directly operated by companies The Alianza Sat S. A. bus fleet was used for testing hypotheses demonstrating that current operational design for the company’s routes (in Bogotá’s current public transport market conditions) leads to reducing the company’s income. The investigation revealed that public pas-senger transport bus fleet revenue can be increased if aspects different to those considered in standard route design methodology are controlled. The investigation has determined alternative rationalisation for operational collective public passenger transport company design regarding adjusting aspects such as the demand pattern, operating scheme, route variability, etc. This will provide an innovative and useful tool for rationalising the operational design of bus routes operating in cities having weak public transport control and excess bus supply...|$|E

5000|$|In 1932, a basic {{plan was}} {{initiated}} {{to build a}} port terminal off {{the east coast of}} Bayonne into the bay to create additional industrial, maritime, and distribution space. After the plan was completed in 1939, dredging and filling began. At the outbreak of World War II, the United States Navy was looking for a location for a port on the East Coast and became interested in the site for a large dry-dock and supply center. The Bayonne military base was opened by the Navy in 1942 as a logistics and repair base, well connected to the transportation network of the Northeast Corridor. After the war MOTBY became port for part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet or the Mothball <b>Fleet.</b> The <b>administration</b> of Mayor James J. Donovan lobbied the Navy to locate the base in Bayonne and the trips by Washington officials, including the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, resulted in the base being located in Bayonne. Mayor Donovan's role was finally recognized in December, 2015 when the Bayonne City officials and VFW groups dedicated a park in his honor at the base. The ceremony featured the Mayor, Town Council, many Veteran groups, and Donovan family descendants, including his son and daughter.|$|R

5000|$|King John had {{developed}} a royal fleet of galleys.

King John and King Henry wanted a powerful and efficient administration for these vessels. Their efforts produced ones which were more informal and ad hoc. It was in Edward III's reign when a formal naval administration by lay people evolved. Initially, there were two clerks and then one. William de Clewre, Matthew de Torksey and John de Haytfield preceded Crull in the office, with Crull's tenure being the longest. Crull laid the foundations for the office and administration that would appear in subsequent centuries, such as the Council of the Marine and the Navy Board under Henry VIII and the Board of Admiralty under Charles I.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} Portuguese {{explorer}} Vasco da Gama at Calicut in 1498 opened a gateway of {{free access to}} Asia from Western Europe around the Cape of Good Hope; however, it also necessitated the founding and safeguarding of trade stations in the East. Very rapidly one European power followed another, all eager to trade along this route. The Portuguese landed in Mossel Bay in 1500, explored Table Bay two years later, and by 1510 had started raiding inland. Shortly afterwards the Dutch Republic sent merchant vessels to India, and in 1602 founded the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (Dutch East India Company; VOC). As the volume of traffic rounding the Cape increased, the Company recognised its natural harbour as an ideal watering point for the long voyage around Africa to the Orient and established a victualling station there in 1652. VOC officials did not favour the permanent settlement of Europeans in their trading empire, although during the 140 years of Dutch rule many VOC servants retired or were discharged and remained as private citizens. Furthermore, the exigencies of supplying local garrisons and passing <b>fleets</b> compelled the <b>administration</b> to confer free status upon employees and oblige them to become independent farmers.|$|R
40|$|Car sharing {{service is}} {{becoming}} {{popular in the}} large cities, with an high population density, since it seems to address the limits of both the private car and the public transport by offering {{the flexibility of the}} former combined with the reduced need of parking spaces of the latter. While in large cities the car sharing becomes a new element of a range of alternatives, and it appears especially suitable to public transport users who seldom use the private car, it appears interesting to investigate whether such service could be attractive or not even in smaller cities, where public transport is less frequent and parking might not be an issue. In this paper the elements to be evaluated when planning car sharing for small cities are presented and discussed, while an approach for designing it is introduced. First, the different ways of organizing and managing a car sharing service are presented, focusing on the use of electric vehicles and on the integration with the other modes, such as public transport and bike sharing. Moreover, the possibility of integration with the <b>fleets</b> of public <b>administration</b> is evaluated. The elements to design the service, i. e. the number of vehicles, the number of parking areas and infrastructure, pricing policies, are estimated considering the cities of Gorizia and Nova Gorica...|$|R
