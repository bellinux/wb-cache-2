40|$|MBA thesisDuring the 1990 s, South Africa {{experienced}} <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Masterbond group <b>of</b> companies which attracted {{approximately a}} billion rand by promising investors secured investment in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> debentures. A public outcry led to <b>the</b> appointment <b>of</b> a {{commission of inquiry}} led by Justice Nel. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nel report pointed {{to the need to}} update the security laws existing at the time and to regulate intermediaries who are usually seen as a vital link between the public and investment companies offering securities, including instances where fraud is being perpetrated on the public. Following the Nel inquiry, a number of steps were taken. A major step was <b>the</b> enactment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act (Act No. 37 of 2002, known as the FAIS Act). The FAIS Act brought with it the relief {{that for the first time}} in South Africa, financial intermediaries would be regulated. Its main objective is to protect consumers and strengthen <b>the</b> integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial services industry. In <b>furtherance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above mentioned <b>objectives,</b> <b>the</b> FAIS Act provides for strict requirements for those who apply for licences to render financial services to the public; as well as codes of conduct for intermediaries. The FAIS Act only came into full operation on 30 September 2004. South Africa has come a long way since <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Masterbond; however, a number of financial services providers continue to fail. In the process consumers have been left with nothing but empty promises. The question is whether there are any regulatory factors that could possibly be influencing <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> financial services providers. Elsewhere in the world, regulatory fragmentation, capture 1 and lack of capacity and information sharing amongst regulators have been 1 Regulatory capture refers to a situation where regulators take on <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> management in <b>the</b> firms they regulate, thereby possibly losing sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ultimate <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> regulation (Benink, H.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{two women}} who were religiously active either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Schism (1378 – 1417), a period <b>of</b> intensification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excesses <b>of</b> personal pride and political ambition that divided the western Church and caused distress to devoted, thoughtful laity and clerics alike. Devout laity sought new expressions of piety in these stressful times and through examining <b>the</b> written legacies <b>of</b> two non-enclosed religious women, Caterina Benincasa and Margery Kempe, I explore not only the contemplative/devotional practices that characterise them, but also the clerics upon whom they relied for protection, support and guidance in male-dominated, strife-ridden medieval Europe. The two women, a northern Italian lifelong virgin for Christ and an East Anglian mother of fourteen children, prima facie, appear to {{have little in common}} except claimed illiteracy, a diversity of influences and acknowledging Bridget of Sweden as a fundamental inspirational source. However, both of their personal and literary management teams included members of several religious orders and their written productions were mostly dictated to and edited by men. They both negotiated their ecclesiastical acceptance from <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> institutionally inferior women through the exclusively female rôles of mother/sister/daughter in exerting influence over their father/brother/son managers through confronting them with their male self-images. Although the management practices applied in each case were very different in terms of structure and hierarchical level, the women‘s negotiations with the men followed similar lines, albeit through different written media. Caterina‘s negotiating techniques are found in <b>the</b> immediate medium <b>of</b> her letters and they involve persuasion and instruction as she tries to create situations that she can control in <b>furtherance</b> <b>of</b> her <b>objectives.</b> <b>The</b> study includes a selection of twelve letters that I have translated in full and analysed from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> register <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dialogues, the style and the imagery contained therein. Evidence of Margery Kempe‘s influence over her managers, including her husband, comes solely from <b>the</b> medium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retrospective narrative <b>of</b> her Book in which she chooses the events that illustrate how she reacts to and manipulates people and situations to her advantage. The clerical managers were responsible for keeping their head-strong charges compliant with ever-changing contemporary views of orthodoxy within parameters negotiated between the women and the institutional church. Although there are clear, identifiable parallels between the managers in their styles and techniques, there are also differences rooted in <b>the</b> managers‘ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two women‘s respective contributions to <b>the</b> <b>furtherance</b> <b>of</b> institutional aims. Caterina‘s situation was that of a woman whose institutional support was considered necessary at <b>the</b> highest levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church‘s management structure. In Margery Kempe‘s case the management seemed to use her to develop aspects of their local inter-institutional competition for status and alms in Lynn. Despite this difference in influential level there is <b>the</b> strong probability <b>of</b> personal contact and shared theological academic backgrounds among the clerics that draws the teams together. This study concentrates primarily on comparing and contrasting <b>the</b> subtleties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negotiations between each woman and her managers, negotiations which are often influenced by <b>the</b> women‘s introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transcendental force <b>of</b> God‘s will as revealed only to them, and secondarily on the possible connections between the managers that link England to Italy, Lynn to Siena and Margery to Caterina. The management techniques revealed are independent of any connections between the managers and there is little by way of common techniques apart from <b>the</b> complexities <b>of</b> reciprocal management and <b>the</b> women‘s exploitation <b>of</b> male conceptions of what is appropriate to themselves (the managers) and to women in the Church.
