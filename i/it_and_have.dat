25|$|The axis of {{symmetry}} of a two-dimensional figure is a line such that, if a perpendicular is constructed, any two points lying on the perpendicular at equal distances from the {{axis of symmetry}} are identical. Another {{way to think about}} it is that if the shape were to be folded in half over the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror image. Thus a square has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to fold <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> the edges all match. A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry passing through its center, for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|The 2002–03 season, was a {{disaster}} for Grimsby Town; Mariners boss Paul Groves attempted to bolster his side {{as well as he}} could, veteran footballers Darren Barnard and Steve Chettle amongst others were brought to the club, and such players as Steve Kabba, Richard Hughes and returning hero John Oster all played some part in the season. The club couldn't avoid relegation and Grimsby finished bottom of Division One and were relegated after five successive seasons at this level. Indeed, only one of their previous 12 seasons had been spent outside <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> never returned to this level.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the art of Devnimori in Gujarat, dated to the 4th century CE, represented a Western Indian artistic tradition, based on the influence of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, that was anterior to the rise of Gupta Empire art, and that it may have influenced <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> influenced the art of the Ajanta Caves, Sarnath and other places from the 5th century onward.

25|$|Let's Plays {{can also}} be seen harming a game's {{distribution}} particularly for short, linear, narrative-driven games, since viewers can witness the entire game from a Let's Play recording without purchasing <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> no incentive to purchase the title. For the art game That Dragon, Cancer, its developer Ryan Green noted that while there were Let's Plays of the game, several which commented emotionally on the game's topic, some of these playthroughs had simply played through the game without added commentary, and provided no links to where players could learn more about the title. Green and his team at Numinous Games had used YouTube's ContentID to have some of these videos taken down, a result that brought some complaints and which Green admitted later was not the right approach to address the issue. Green requested that with games such as That Dragon, Cancer, that those creating Let's Play use the playthrough of the game to initiation conversations with their viewers, and that viewers could show their appreciation of the game by tipping the developers in lieu of purchasing the full title.|$|E

500|$|In {{a country}} where nearly 90 percent of the {{population}} are Muslims, the ethnic Chinese Muslims form a small minority of the ethnic Chinese population. The 2010 census recked that 3.6% of Chinese Indonesians were followers of Islam. Associations such as the Organization of Chinese Muslims of Indonesia ( [...] , PITI) had been in existence in the late 19th century. PITI was re-established in 1963 as a modern organization, but occasionally experienced periods of inactivity. The Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia ( [...] , MATAKIN) estimated that 95 percent of Confucians are ethnic Chinese; most of the remaining 5 percent are ethnic Javanese converts. Although the government has restored Confucianism's status as a recognized religion, many local authorities do not abide by <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> refused to allow ethnic Chinese from listing it as a religion on their identity cards. Local officials remained largely unaware that the civil registration law legally allowed citizens to leave the religion section on their identity cards blank.|$|E
500|$|... 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as {{the first}} film of a new X-Men trilogy. Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E
