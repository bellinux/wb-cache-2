500|$|Visually, {{the film}} uses many golden motifs to {{parallel}} the gold's symbolic {{treatment in the}} novel. All of Goldfinger's female henchwomen in the film except his private jet's co-pilot (black hair) and stewardess (who is Korean) are red-blonde, or blonde, including Pussy Galore and her Flying Circus crew (both the characters Tilly Masterson and Pussy specifically have black hair in the novel). Goldfinger has a yellow-painted Rolls-Royce with number plate [...] "AU1" [...] ("Au" [...] being the chemical symbol for gold), and also sports yellow or golden items or clothing in every film scene, including a golden pistol, when disguised as a colonel. Bond is bound to a cutting bench with a sheet of gold on it (as Goldfinger points out to him) before nearly being lasered. Goldfinger's factory henchmen in the <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> yellow sashes, Pussy Galore twice wears a metallic gold vest, and Pussy's pilots all wear yellow sunburst insignia on their uniforms. Goldfinger's Jetstar hostess, Mei-Lei, wears a golden bottice and gold-accented sarong. [...] The concept of the recurring gold theme running through the film was a design aspect conceived and executed by Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton.|$|E

50|$|All these {{machines}} employ a rotating prism {{rather than the}} Geneva drive intermittent mechanism first used by the American upright Moviola. The rotating prism allows the editor to move the film smoothly and continuously, reducing mechanical noise and <b>film</b> <b>wear.</b> It also makes high-speed operation feasible, and some machines can move the film at up to ten times standard speed. The K-E-M Universal, which has a modular construction, supports up to three picture heads and up to three sound tracks.|$|E
5000|$|When {{handling}} film, {{the user}} should always have clean hands and wear gloves (cotton or nitrile) to avoid fingerprints or scratches. Always handle the film by the edge to avoid touching the image surface. Users {{must be careful}} when removing film from enclosures to avoid scratches or abrasions. Never force rolled film flat if it is brittle, as it can snap or break. Always work in an uncluttered and clean environment that is well-lit and ventilated. [...] It's also beneficial to avoid wearing jewelry, such as long necklaces, that can accidentally scratch the film when being examined. Food and drinks {{should be kept in}} a separate room or a safe distance from the film materials. It is also advisable to limit exposure times to celluloid <b>film,</b> <b>wear</b> googles and a respirator.|$|E
50|$|DTS and Dolby Digital (AC-3), DTS's chief {{competitor}} in the cinema theatre and home theatre markets, are often compared {{because of their}} similarity in product goals, though Dolby believed that the surround channels should be diffused and DTS said they should be directional. In theatrical installations, AC-3 audio is placed between sprocket holes on the 35 mm film itself, leaving the audio content susceptible to physical damage from <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> and mishandling. DTS audio is stored on a separate set of CD-ROM media, whose greater storage capacity affords the potential to deliver better audio fidelity and {{is not subject to}} the usual wear and damage suffered by the film print during the normal course of the movie's theatrical screening. Disregarding the separate CD-ROM assembly as a potential point of failure, the DTS audiopath is comparatively impervious to film degradation, unless the film-printed timecode is completely destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{exposure}} experiments at 315 and 350 C {{were conducted}} on seven different types of polyimide films to determine which was the most thermally stable and adherent. The polyimides were ranked according to {{the rate at which}} they lost weight and how well they adhere to the metallic substrate. Friction and wear experiments were conducted at 25 C (room temperature) on films bonded to 440 C HT stainless steel. Friction, <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> rates, wear mechanisms, and transfer films of the seven films were investigated and compared. The polyimides were found to fall into two groups as far as friction and wear properties were concerned. Group one had lower friction but an order of magnitude higher <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> rate than did group two. The wear mechanism was predominately adhesive, but the size of the wear particles were larger for group one polyimides...|$|E
40|$|Friction, wear life, rider wear, and <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> for a 440 C high-temperature-stainless-steel, hemispherically tipped rider sliding against polyimide-bonded {{graphite}} fluoride {{films were}} evaluated in a moist-air atmosphere at 25 C. Optical microscope and surface profilometry observations {{were made at}} various sliding intervals to determine how film thickness affected the lubricating and failure mechanisms of the films. Two lubrication regimes operated for the same load. In the first, the film supported the load and the lubricating mechanism consisted of the shear (plastic flow) of {{a thin layer of}} the lubricant between the metallic rider and the film surface. In the second, the film did not support the load (it was worn away) and the lubricating mechanism consisted of the shear of very thin lubricant films between flat areas generated on the rider and on sandblasted metallic asperities in the <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> track. Lubricant was supplied from the valleys between the asperities or from the sides of the wear track. With thicker films, wear life increased since a greater lubricant supply was available from the sides of the wear track...|$|E

40|$|Over the years, {{the author}} has {{evaluated}} and compared hundreds of solid lubricant films using a pin-on-disk tribometer. The intent {{of this paper is}} to describe to the reader experimental techniques and some of parameters that have been observed to be important for the evaluation and development of new solid lubricant films. Pin-on-disk tribometers will be described and discussed as will experimental methods for evaluating solid lubricant materials. Methods of preparing surfaces for the coating of the thin films and different methods for applying the films will be reviewed. Factors that affect solid lubricant performance will also be discussed. Two different macroscopic mechanisms of solid lubricant <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> exist. These will be characterized schematically, and methods of measuring wear will be examined...|$|E
40|$|Friction {{and wear}} {{experiments}} conducted on polyimide films bonded to 440 C stainless steel disks {{indicated that a}} wear transition (from high wear to low wear) accompanied a friction transition (from high friction to low friction). In dry argon or dry air (less than 20 ppm H 2 O), the transition was found to occur at 40 plus or minus 10 C; when H 20 was present in air (10, 000 ppm H 2 O), the transition {{was found to be}} elevated to a temperature between 100 and 200 C. Wear rate calculations made at 25, 100, and 200 C indicated that <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> was relatively constant for particular experimental conditions; however, the rate was strongly dependent on temperature and atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The belt-finishing {{process is}} a recent {{manufacturing}} technique in industry, the mechanisms and characteristics of which {{have not yet been}} fully explained. This paper attempts to make a contribution {{to the understanding of the}} consequences of the process on the surface roughness of surfaces prepared by hard turning. Abrasive <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> and contact parameters between grains and surfaces are analysed. The effects and significant interactions of the most influential belt-finishing parameters on the surface roughness are then investigated. It was shown that the applied force and the hardness of the roller have a great influence on the surface roughness. Furthermore, the film feed rate influences considerably the wear of grains and, as a consequence, this parameter has an important impact on the material removal mode and on the surface roughness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{adhesion}} {{and mechanical}} stability of thin film coatings on substrates is increasingly becoming {{a key issue}} in device reliability as magnetic and storage technology driven products demand smaller, thinner and more complex functional coatings. In the present study, chemical vapor deposited Co and Co 3 O 4 thin films on SiO 2 and Si substrates are produced, respectively. Chemical vapor deposition is {{the most widely used}} deposition technique which produces thin films well adherent to the substrate. Co and Co 3 O 4 thin films can be used in innovative applications such as magnetic sensors, data storage devices and protective layers. The produced thin films are characterized using nanoindentation technique and their nanomechanical properties (hardness and elastic modulus) are obtained. Finally, an evaluation of the reliability of each thin <b>film</b> (<b>wear</b> analysis) is performed using the hardness to elastic modulus ratio in correlation to the ratio of irreversible work to total work for a complete loading-unloading procedure. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications...|$|E

40|$|To {{obtain a}} better {{understanding}} of how bonded solid lubricant films lubricate and wear (in general), the tribological properties of polyimide-bonded graphite fluoride films were studied (in specific). A pin-on-disk type of testing apparatus was used; but in addition to sliding a hemispherically tipped rider, a rider with a 0. 95 mm diameter flat area was slid against the film. This was done so that a lower, less variable contact stress could be achieved. Two stages of lubrication occurred. In the first, the film supported the load. The lubricating mechanism consisted of the shear of a thin surface layer (of the film) between the rider and the bulk of the film.

40|$|A pin on disk type of {{friction}} and wear apparatus {{was used to}} study the effect of load, contact stress and rider area of contact on the friction and wear properties of polyimide bonded graphite fluoride films. Different rider area contacts were obtained by initially generating flats (with areas of 0. 0035, 0. 0071, 0. 0145, and 0. 0240 cm) on 0. 476 -cm radius hemispherically tipped riders. Different projected contact stresses were obtained by applying loads of 2. 5 - to 58. 8 -N to the flats. Two <b>film</b> <b>wear</b> mechanisms were observed. The first {{was found to be}} a linear function of contact stress and was independent of rider area of contact. The second was found to increase exponentially as the stress increased. The second also appeared to be a function of rider contact area. Wear equations for each mechanism were empirically derived from the experimental data. In general, friction coefficients increased with increasing rider contact area and with sliding duration. This was related to the build up of thick rider transfer films...|$|E
