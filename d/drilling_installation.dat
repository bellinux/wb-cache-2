And, the effect of cofferdam which is representative inner structure inside moonpool was examined. Model test results showed that Molin's theoretical formula can predict moonpool resonance on fixed condition quite accurately. However, motion free condition has higher resonance frequency when it is compared with that of motion fixed. The installation of cofferdam moves resonance frequency to higher region and also generates secondary resonance at lower frequency. Furthermore, it was found that cofferdam was the cause of generating waves in the longitudinal direction when the vessel was in beam sea...|$|E

Due {{to heavy}} industrialization, mining activities and poor sewage system {{in the recent past}} this system has been grossly contaminated. Both chemical and biological contaminants have reached alarming values, causing health hazards environmental problems. Interdisciplinary investigational techniques (hydrogeological reconnaissance, geophysical survey, testhole <b>drilling,</b> <b>installation</b> of tubewells and capacity test) have been used for elaboration of subsurface hydrogeology in the Wah cantonment area. An ancient valley fill deposit has been discovered and proven with the help of geoelectrical soundings testholes and dugwells. A multilayered aquifer system, identified can be significantly used to exploit groundwater. Estimation of groundwater contaminants (major ions, trace elements and bacteria) have been estimated by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer and multiple tube method. Water samples were collected from a large number of dugwells and testholes(from deep layers). The results have been compared with World Health Organization guideline values and united States Environmental protection Agency recommended levels. An increase of more than 100 milligram litre in total dissolved solids have been found from 1981 to 1995 due to heavy industrialization and other anthropogenic activities. There is a sharp rise in few contaminants such as Ca, Mg, Na, and Cl. The estimation of trace elements indicate that the average values of Cr, Pb and Cd have crossed the recommended level of world health Organization and United States Environmental protection Agency while the Cu, Zn, Fe and Ni are below the recommended limits.

40|$|Degradation of {{pressurized}} topside static mud {{equipment is}} a very complex process. Inspection is a helpful tool to monitor degradation and helps reduce the number of critical failures. If it is left undetected and unchecked, it can lead to leakage resulting in accidents. To set up an effective inspection program, the concepts of Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) can be utilized. RBI helps to develop an optimum inspection program by evaluating the probability of failure (PoF) and consequence of failure (CoF), and combining them to estimate risk. The parts that have risk higher than the acceptable limit are then prioritized for inspection. This thesis studies the probability of failure in static equipment in pressurized mud systems on an offshore <b>drilling</b> <b>installation,</b> due to different degradation mechanisms and its influencing factors. Det Norske Veritas (DNV), suggests a number of models to estimate internal and external degradation. By analyzing inspection data from the industry, it is observed that the models can at times be inconvenient to use when the degradation process is complex. For example, it is difficult to develop a simple, yet reliable, model that can accurately predict rate of degradation in situations where corrosion and erosion are simultaneously taking place. In static equipment in high pressurized mud systems, inspection have shown that the main reason for internal degradation is high amounts of solids in the fluid, high velocity, presence of seawater, and corrosive chemicals. DNV-RP-G 101 does not present any model for this situation. For external corrosion, the current models presented in DNV-RP-G 101 can be used to analyze inspection data. In an old installation, the accurate quantitative records are often not available due to a number of reasons, like difficulty in measuring, old data management system, unsystematic inspections or lost records. Thus, it often becomes difficult to develop any qualitative model. On the other hand, the inspection and maintenance engineers have extensive experience that may be utilized for developing effective subjective models. In this thesis, based on some simplified parameters, a methodology for evaluating probability of failure is established. The methodology is divided into external and internal degradation, where the subjective judgments are more evident for internal degradation. Simplified flowcharts and tables are developed to easily evaluate probability of failure...|$|E

40|$|Research {{in the top}} few metres of {{the ground}} beneath our feet has {{traditionally}} been split between soil science, geology and several sub-disciplines. This has lead to different working practices, classifications and boundaries as well as inconsistent approaches to databasing and modelling. A significant uncertainty lies within the “transition zone” between the pedosphere and geosphere. The British Geological Survey (BGS) set out to investigate this zone through multidisciplinary field surveys at both a site specific and catchment scale in representative soil-geoscapes across the UK. The spatial 3 D soil-geology model is developed by the combination of spatial soil and geoscientific findings. Whilst undertaking these studies the BGS were particularly interested in investigating whether technologies developed to map geology in 3 D {{can be used to}} routinely develop spatial models of the soil-geology environment, and if technologies used in digital soil mapping can assist in reducing uncertainties associated with such models at a variety of scales. The presented soil-geology model is an example of recent work carried out on an area of approximately 2 km 2 near Shelford, Nottinghamshire, UK. The site lies on the River Trent floodplain and an adjacent gentle slope of Triassic mudstone. The whole site is underlain by typical red mudstones of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group with some interbedded greenish grey siltstones and sandstones. This is overlain by up to 5 m of Pleistocene and Holocene river terrace deposits, varying from sand to coarse gravels and Holocene alluvial and colluvial deposits. Fieldwork was orientated along several parallel traverses running from the hilltop, downslope towards the River Trent. The study of the survey area comprised of two main stages. Firstly a field survey which included techniques such as a detailed soil and geological survey, pitting and <b>drilling,</b> <b>installation</b> of piezometres, soil moisture tests, high-resolution electrical mapping, electrical resistivity tomography, ground penetrating radar, magnetic susceptibility, gamma spectrometry, remote sensing and terrain analysis. The second stage involved the digital assembly of data, processing, and the development of the 3 D soil-geology model. Each survey delivered its own results in form of maps, tables and property models which were collated into one software package (GSI 3 D by INSIGHT GmbH). Developing a solid 3 D soil-geology model in GSI 3 D utilizes a Digital Terrain Model, mapped geological and soil line work, downhole borehole and augerhole data, and geophysical data. This enables the geoscientist to construct regularly spaced intersecting cross-sections by correlating boreholes and the outcrops-subcrops of units to produce a fence diagram of the area. Mathematical interpolation between the nodes along the sections and the limits of the units or horizons produces a solid model comprising of a series of stacked triangulated volume objects. The final 3 D model shows several top- and subsoil horizons in conjunction with the underlying Holocene, Pleistocene and red Triassic Mercia Mudstone parent materials. These models can aid studies of near surface processes including the movement of water, dissolved agricultural nutrients and associated eroded soil particles...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} by ENGEO Limited and KiwiRail Holdings Limited {{to assess the}} stability of Slovens Creek Viaduct (specifically its western abutment) and a 3 km section of rail corridor between Slovens Creek Viaduct and Avoca on the Midland Line (MDL). Commonly known as the scenic TranzAlpine rail journey (through Arthurs Pass National Park) the MDL connects Greymouth to Christchurch via Rolleston, where the MDL meets the Main South Line into Christchurch. The project area is approximately 40 km southeast of Arthurs Pass Township, in the eastern extension of the Castle Hill Basin {{which is part of}} the Waimakariri Catchment and Canterbury Foothills. The field area is underlain by Rakaia Terrane, {{which is part of the}} Torlesse Composite Terrane forming the basement rock unit for the field area. Cretaceous-Tertiary rocks of the Castle Hill Basin overlie the basement strata and record a transgression-regression sequence, as well as mid-Oligocene submarine volcanism. The stratigraphic sequence in the Castle Hill Basin, and its eastern extension to Avoca, comprises two formations of the Eyre group, the older Broken River Formation and the younger Iron Creek Formation. Deep marine Porter Group limestones, marls, and tuffs of Oligocene age succeed the Iron Creek Formation of the Eyre Group, and probably records the maximum of the transgression. The Enys Formation lies disconformably on the Porter Group and is overlain unconformably by Late Pleistocene glacifluvial and glacial deposits. The Tertiary strata in the Slovens-Avoca rail corridor are weak, and the clay-rich tuff derived from mid-Oligocene volcanism is particularly prone to slaking. Extensive mapping carried out for this project has identified that some 90 percent of the surface along the length of the Slovens-Avoca corridor has been subject to mass movement. The landslides of the Slovens-Avoca rail corridor are clearly younger than the Last Glaciation, and Slovens Creek has been downcutting, with associated faulting and uplift, to form the present day geomorphology of the rail corridor. Deep-seated landslides in the rail corridor extend to Slovens Creek, locally deflecting the stream course, and a generic ground failure model for the rail corridor has been developed. Exploratory geotechnical investigations, including core <b>drilling,</b> <b>installation</b> of an inclinometer and a piezometer, enabled the construction of a simple ground model and cross section for the Slovens Creek Viaduct western abutment. Limit-equilibrium and pseudo-static slope stability analyses using both circular and block critical slip surface search methods were applied to the ground model for the western abutment of Slovens Creek Viaduct. Piezometric and strength data obtained during laboratory testing of core material have been used to constrain the western abutment stability assessment for one representative section line (C-C’). Prior to pseudo-static sensitivity analyses peak ground acceleration (PGA) for various Ultimate Limit State (ULS) design return periods, defined by an equation given in NZS 1170. 5 : 2004, were calculated and have been used as a calibration technique to find and compare specific PGA values for pseudo-static analyses in the Slovens Creek Viaduct area. The main purpose has been to provide an indication of how railway infrastructure could be affected by seismic events of various return periods defined by ULS design standards for the area. Limit equilibrium circular slip surface search methods, both grid search and auto refine search, indicated the slope is stable with a FoS greater than 1. 0 returned from each, although one particular surface returned the lowest FoS in each. This surface is in the lower portion of the slope, adjacent to Slovens Stream and northeast of the MDL. As expected, pseudo-static analyses returned a lower FoS overall when compared to limit equilibrium analyses. The PGA analyses suggest that partial ground failure at the Slovens Creek Viaduct western abutment could occur in a 1 in 25 -year return period event within materials on the slower slope beyond the immediate rail corridor. A ULS (1 in 500 -year) event in the Slovens Creek Viaduct area would likely produce a PGA of ~ 0. 9 g, and the effects on the western abutment and rail infrastructure would most likely be catastrophic. Observed ground conditions for the western abutment of the Slovens Creek Viaduct suggest there is no movement within the landslide at depth within the monitoring timeframe of this project (22 May 2015 – 4 August 2015). Slope stability monitoring is recommended to be continued in two parts: (1) the inclinometer in BH 1 is to be monitored on a six monthly basis for one year following completion of this thesis, and then annually unless ground movements become evident; and (2) surface movement monitoring should be installed using a fixed datum on the stable eastern abutment. Long-term stability management strategies for the Slovens Creek Viaduct western abutment are dependent upon future observed changes and ongoing monitoring. Hazard and risk assessment using the KiwiRail Qualitative Risk Assessment Framework (QRA) is recommended, and if slope stability becomes problematic for operation of the Midland Line consideration should be given to deep slope drainage. In the event of a large magnitude or high PGA earthquake all monitoring should be reviewed...|$|E

To have a critical incident, multiple barriers need to be broken, and that is what drill crews prevent on a daily basis. Critical incidents on an offshore installation, like a semisubmersible rig, can have disastrous outcomes to personnel, equipment and environment. We only have to look at the Piper Alpha, 1988 (Northsea). Alexander L. Kielland, 1980 (Northsea).

40|$|Abstract: The {{preferred}} {{case when}} designing a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) {{system for a}} single-family house in Sweden is to drill a single borehole to the depth required for the desired energy extraction. There are however situations when the local geological, hydrological or other conditions prohibit drilling to the required depth, and therefore two shorter boreholes are drilled. This paper analyses the thermal and economic consequences of drilling two shorter boreholes instead of one deeper borehole for a typical Swedish single family house. A series of simulation-based analyses are presented; the first accounts only for the first order effects- the shorter borehole length and thermal interaction between the two boreholes. Then, second order effects – the geothermal gradient, extra horizontal piping {{in the case of}} two vertical boreholes, and different hydraulic resistances – are analyzed. The analyses look at the thermal performance of the ground heat exchangers, the resulting heat pump and circulating pump energy consumption, electrical energy costs, and different first costs due to differences in material usage, upper casing requirements and costs required for <b>drilling</b> and <b>installation...</b>|$|R

Driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy {{in the same way}} a nail is hammered.

Drop hammers simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth. Similarly, hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces. Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice. Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and concrete. Drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete. Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile.
