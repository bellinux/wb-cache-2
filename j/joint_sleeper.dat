25|$|The {{gauge of}} the new iron railway line {{was the same as}} the wooden railway and it was 4.6 miles in length, falling {{continuously}} from Lady Anne pit 440 feet above the track on the pier at St David's. The rails were 28lbs per yard fish-bellied, procured from the Bedlington Iron Company. They were held in 9lb iron chairs secure to whinstone block sleepers by two iron pegs. The <b>joint</b> <b>sleeper</b> blocks were double width and there were no fishplates.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} five <b>Joint</b> Stock <b>sleepers,</b> Acheron, Coliban, Inman, Pekina and Loddon (ex Melbourne) {{became part}} of the Victorian Railways fleet on 27th June 1969. They had names removed and replaced with numbers, as Sleeping cars No.6 through 10 following on from No.5 ex Wando.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the work}} of {{maintaining}} the track was at the joints, especially as the stiff rails became dipped, and the <b>joint</b> <b>sleepers</b> took a hammering. Pre-war experiments with long welded rail lengths were built upon, and in the years from 1960 long rail lengths were installed, at first on hardwood sleepers but soon on concrete sleepers. For example, the first long welded rail (almost 1 mi) on the UK's East Coast Main Line was laid in 1957, just south of Carlton-on-Trent, resting on rubber pads to resist rail creep. In this pioneering stage, some catastrophic mistakes in detailed design were made, but from about 1968 continuous welded rail became a reliable standard for universal installation on main and secondary routes. The form adopted used pre-stressed concrete sleepers and a 110A rail section - a slight improvement on the 109 rails previously used - the A was to distinguish it from the British Standard 110 lb/yd rail section, which was unsuitable. Rail fastenings eventually converged onto a proprietary spring clip made by the Pandrol company which was the exclusive form of fastening in Britain for about 30 years.|$|R
50|$|The Engineer William Stuart {{engaged in}} a dispute with the Committee over {{responsibility}} for the route selection, and was dismissed in October 1821. The contractor McIntosh was also dismissed amidst controversy over construction standards in June 1822, and Johnson Brothers (as successor to Johnson & Bryse) took over the work. Hopkins was now in charge as sole Engineer, he modified the specification for the later batch of rails; {{they were to be}} 3 ft 10 in (1,168 mm) long, with lapped <b>joints</b> at the <b>sleeper</b> blocks.|$|R
40|$|A {{formulation}} of three-dimensional model of articulated train-bridge dynamic interaction {{has been made}} for the Korean eXpress Train (KTX). Semi-periodic profiles of rail irregularities consisting of elevation, alignment, cross and gauge irregularities have also been proposed using FRA maximum tolerable rail deviations. The effects of rail <b>joints</b> and <b>sleeper</b> step were also included. The resulting system matrices of train and bridge are very sparse, and, thus, are stored in one-dimensional arrays, yielding a time-efficient solution. A numerical algorithm for computing bridge-train response including an iterative scheme is also formulated. A program simulating train-bridge interaction and solving this problem using the new algorithm is implemented as new modules for the finite element analysis software named XFINAS. Computed results using the new program are then checked by that of the validated 2 -D bridge-train interaction model. This new 3 D analysis provides more detailed train responses such as swaying, bouncing, rolling, pitching and yawing accelerations, which are useful inevaluating passenger riding comfort. Train operation safety and derailment could also be directly investigated by relative wheel displacements computed from this program...|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{numerical}} simulation {{is carried out}} to determine the stress distribution on railhead {{in the vicinity of}} an insulated rail <b>joint</b> suspended between <b>sleepers.</b> The dynamic wheel load due to rail end discontinuity is considered in the simulation. The dynamic loads are treated as Hertzian pressure modified for plasticity of the railhead and discontinuity of the rail section near endpost. Submodelling is considered in this simulation to present stress distribution on the railhead. Von Mises stresses in loading and unloading (residual), vertical stresses and equivalent plastic strains are presented. Shakedown theorem is considered to apply a peak pressure load on the rail which is below the shakedown limit. As a result, a non-progressive damage of the railhead material is anticipated. Residual longitudinal stress is critical for damage of the railhead top surface and von-Mises along with vertical stresses is significant for subsurface damage of the railhead in the vicinity of rail joint...|$|R
40|$|Rail joints have {{a shorter}} service life {{than most other}} railway track components. The {{discontinuity}} between rail ends turns the rail joint into a weak spot, and consequently, into a track component demanding more frequent maintenance measures, which result in high maintenance costs. Moreover, difficulties are often found when assessing the damage condition of rail joints since damage conditions like cracks in the rail web or loose bolts cannot be detected by visual inspection. A {{better understanding of the}} damage mechanisms and degradation process of rail joints may help to develop adapted maintenance measures and to improve rail joint design. In this paper, a 3 D Finite Element model is presented as base for rail joint study. The model represents accurately the main components (rail, <b>sleeper,</b> <b>joint</b> bars and wheel) and the interaction between them (contact). The model is validated between 150 and 800 Hz with measured axle box accelerations of resilient wheels. Higher frequencies may be reached with an improved model of the rubber. In the paper, the influence of the bolt tightness is studied. The results showed that contact force, specially its variation, is strongly affected by the bolt tightness; loose bolts cause higher contact forces. The effect of vehicle speed on wheel/rail contact is also significant mainly due to the interaction between rail and sleepers {{in the vicinity of the}} rail joint. Apart from bolt tightness conditions and vehicle speed, the validated model has the potential to study the influence of other track parameters and damage condition...|$|R
