By the end of his stint in December 1968, he was overseeing the work of 175others. As a result of his experience there, Romney developed a lifelong affection for France and its people and has also remained fluent in French.|$|E

5|$|On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up {{with the}} Italians at Vrbovsko, closing the ring around the {{remnants}} of the 7th Army, which surrendered, and the 1st Mountain Division pushed through Novo Mesto and Črnomelj without facing resistance, reaching Vinice {{by the end of the}} day. At Celje, Lanz received a delegation led by Natlačen which included Andrej Gosar. The meeting was very formal and cold, as Lanz had already received orders regarding the break-up of Slovenia into Italian and German-controlled territories, and the council and <b>its</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> an independent Slovenia were superfluous from a German perspective.|$|E

5|$|The last {{experimental}} {{flight was}} flown in 1971, {{due to a}} lack of candidate storms and a changeover in NOAA's fleet. More than a decade after the last modification experiment, Project Stormfury was officially canceled.

The observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by Stormfury helped improve meteorologists' ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party at {{one point}} had agreed to join as well, seeing that the ARF's {{political}} ideology was socialism. However, the Hunchakians claimed the new party was not Marxist enough and withdrew from the union. The original aim of the ARF was to gain autonomy for the Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire. The party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s and held its first major meeting in Tiflis, Russian Empire, in 1892. At that meeting, the party adopted a decentralized modus operandi according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere. The party set <b>its</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> a society based on the democratic principles of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and agrarian reform.|$|E
5|$|Operation Summer '95 {{failed to}} achieve <b>its</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> {{relieving}} Bihać by drawing substantial RSK forces and the VRS {{away from the city}} to contain the HV/HVO advance. The RSK 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to move from Bihać to Bosansko Grahovo, and it remained in the Knin area until the beginning of the following HV offensive, Operation Storm, on 4 August. The capture of Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč by the HV and the HVO, their achievement of favourable positions to attack Knin and a large-scale HV mobilization in preparation for Operation Storm caused the RSK to shift its focus from Bihać. On 30 July, RSK civilian and military leaders, Milan Martić and General Mile Mrkšić, met with a personal representative of Secretary-General of the United Nations Yasushi Akashi and agreed upon a plan to withdraw from Bihać to prevent the expected Croatian offensive. Days later, the area captured in Operation Summer '95 was used as a staging area for the 4th and the 7th Guards Brigades' advance into Knin in Operation Storm. The VRS 2nd Krajina Corps tried to retake Bosansko Grahovo on the night of 1112 August. Their advance from the direction of Drvar broke through the HV's reserve infantry left to garrison the area and reached the outskirts of the town, but was beaten back by two HV Guards battalions.|$|E
