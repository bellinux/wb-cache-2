5|$|A {{week later}} Kujau met <b>Jäckel</b> and Alex Kuhn in {{connection}} with the poems he had forged and sold to Stiefel. These had been published by <b>Jäckel</b> and Kuhn in 1980, but one historian pointed out that one of the poems could not have been produced by Hitler as it had been written by the poet Herybert Menzel. <b>Jäckel</b> was concerned that the poem in question had been accompanied by a letter on Nazi party stationery guaranteeing it as a genuine work by Hitler. Many of the other pieces in Stiefel's collection were similarly verified, so doubts began to surface over these, too. Kujau claimed ignorance, saying he was only the middleman, but told them that Heidemann, a reputed journalist, had seen the crash site from which the papers originated; <b>Jäckel</b> advised Stiefel to have his collection forensically examined, and passed 26 suspect poems to the Hamburg district attorney for investigation. Gruner + Jahr also knew about the problems with the poems, and that the source had been Kujau, but he assured them that this source had been elsewhere in East Germany, unconnected to the diaries, and they continued with their deal.|$|E

500|$|According to <b>Jäckel,</b> An Unforgettable Summer has a prophetic {{role to play}} {{within the}} Balkan context, one she equates with that of Jean-Luc Godard's La Chinoise, which is {{credited}} by others with having offered {{a glimpse into the}} French revolutionary environment that was to be responsible for the May 1968 events. Writing shortly after the film's release, John Simon specifically linked the plot with the 1992–95 civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, proposing that [...] "it may even explain" [...] what had sparked this conflict; likewise, American critic J.

500|$|In June 1979 Stiefel asked {{a former}} Nazi Party archivist, August Priesack, {{to verify the}} {{authenticity}} of the diary, which he subsequently did. Priesack showed the diary to Eberhard <b>Jäckel</b> of the University of Stuttgart, who also thought the diary to be genuine, and wanted to edit it for publication. News of the diary's existence soon began to filter through to collectors of Hitler memorabilia. At the end of 1979 Tiefenthaeler contacted Heidemann to say that Stiefel had shown him around his collection, which included a Hitler diary—the only one Kujau had forged to that point. According to Hamilton [...] "the discovery inflamed Heidemann almost to madness", and he aggressively pressed for what would be a journalistic scoop.|$|E
500|$|Film {{historian}} Anne <b>Jäckel</b> {{describes the}} story as dealing with [...] "the slow descent into Hell of two honest, liberal people." [...] The two persons are the short and monocled Captain Dumitriu and his sophisticated wife. Confronted with the general's spiteful decision, they find themselves isolated to a garrison in a land frequently raided by Macedonian komitadji, in rebellion against Romanian rule. Initially shocked by the cultural clash, Von Debretsy, a mother of three, attempts to adapt her aristocratic lifestyle to the new requirements, but manages to make herself stand out when she continues to seek a life of luxury. French critic Sylvie Rollet argues that this attempt to [...] "tame the world" [...] by erecting [...] "frontiers" [...] is a central aspect of An Unforgettable Summer.|$|E

50|$|Born in Rapid City, South Dakota, on April 13, 1954, <b>Jackels</b> {{frequently}} {{moved as}} a child of a military family from Wyoming to Spain to California before settling in Nebraska to complete his secondary studies. As a young man he fell away from his faith becoming more of a Buddhist than anything else, but while working as dishwasher in a country club, a sincere Protestant gave him {{a copy of the}} New Testament, the reading of which reportedly brought him back to the Catholic faith. Prior to joining Kentucky's St. Pius X Seminary in 1975, <b>Jackels</b> attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. <b>Jackels</b> earned his B.A. in philosophy from St. Pius X in 1977.

500|$|Ten {{days after}} the meeting with <b>Jäckel</b> and Kuhn, Kujau had {{prepared}} three further diaries. The contents were copied {{from a range of}} books, newspapers and magazines covering Hitler's life. Primary among them was the two-volume work by the historian Max Domarus, [...] (Hitler: Speeches and Proclamations, 1932–45), which presents Hitler's day-to-day activities. Many of the diary's entries were lists of Nazi party promotions and official engagements. Although Kujau created some personal information about Hitler in the diaries, this was, in the opinion of both Harris and Hamilton, trivia. He began working to a schedule of producing three diaries a month. He later stated that he managed to produce one of the volumes in three hours; on a separate occasion he wrote three diaries in three days.|$|E
500|$|Like Balanţa, An Unforgettable Summer is {{also seen}} as a comment on Romanian history: while the former deals with Communist Romania and post-1989 events, the latter is an {{investigation}} into the legacy of nationalism and anti-liberalism in Romanian society. <b>Jäckel</b> writes: [...] "Pintilie is convinced that nothing can change until fundamental questions are asked, and that it is only when a nation starts facing its past, that it can move into adulthood." [...] She believes this focus on revisiting past events is also evident in other Romanian cinema productions of the 1990s, in particular films by Radu Mihăileanu. Caryn James argues that, through its references to the Hungarian Soviet Republic and its impact in Romania, the film can serve as a guide to the start of communism, just as Balanţa is a depiction of its outcome. Through the means of dialogues in the film, the viewer is informed that communism has had an actual impact on Marie-Thérèse: her father allowed the Hungarian revolutionaries to split up his estate, but, for all his generosity, was killed by them.|$|E
500|$|On 22 April 1983 a {{press release}} from Stern {{announced}} {{the existence of the}} diaries and their forthcoming publication; a press conference was announced for 25 April. On hearing the news from Stern, <b>Jäckel</b> stated that he was [...] "extremely sceptical" [...] about the diaries, while his fellow historian, Karl Dietrich Bracher of the University of Bonn also thought their legitimacy unlikely. Irving was receiving calls from international news companies—the BBC, The Observer, Newsweek, Bild Zeitung—and he was informing them all that the diaries were fakes. The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, also said that he could not believe the diaries were genuine. The following day The Times published the news that their Sunday sister paper had the serialisation rights for the UK; the edition also carried an extensive piece by Trevor-Roper with his opinion on the authenticity and importance of the discovery. By this stage the historian had growing doubts over the diaries, which he passed on to the editor of The Times, Charles Douglas-Home. The Times editor presumed that Trevor-Roper would also contact Giles at The Sunday Times, while Trevor-Roper thought that Douglas-Home would do so; neither did. The Sunday paper thus remained oblivious of the growing concerns that the diaries might not be genuine.|$|E

2500|$|The German {{historian}} Eberhard <b>Jäckel</b> wrote {{a series}} of newspaper articles later turned into the book David Irving's Hitler: A Faulty History Dissected, attacking Irving and maintaining that Hitler was {{very much aware of}} and approved of the Holocaust. <b>Jäckel</b> attacked Irving for claiming that a note from Heinrich Himmler's notebook – [...] "Jewish transport from Berlin, not to be liquidated", dated 30 November 1941 – proved that Hitler {{did not want to see}} the Holocaust happen. <b>Jäckel</b> maintained that the order referred only to that train, and argued that if Hitler had ordered the people on that train to be spared, it must stand to reason that he was aware of the Holocaust. <b>Jäckel</b> went on to argue that because the [...] "Final Solution" [...] was secret, it is not surprising that Hitler's servants were ignorant of the Holocaust, and that anyhow, five of Hitler's servants interviewed by Irving later claimed that they believed that Hitler was aware of the Holocaust. <b>Jäckel</b> argued on the basis of Hitler's statements in Mein Kampf that the Führer was always committed to genocide of the Jews, and that because Hitler later attempted to execute the foreign policy he outlined in Mein Kampf, it is a reasonable assumption that Hitler was always committed to genocide, which in Jäckel's opinion disproves Irving's claim that Hitler was unaware of the Shoah. <b>Jäckel</b> used Hitler's tendency to involve himself in minutiae to argue that it is simply inconceivable that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust. As evidence against Irving, <b>Jäckel</b> used Hitler's [...] "Prophecy Speech" [...] of 30 January 1939, where Hitler declared: ...|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, <b>Jäckel</b> used Himmler's Posen {{speeches of}} 1943 and certain other {{statements}} {{on his part}} in 1944 referring to an [...] "order" [...] from an unnamed higher authority as proof that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust. In the same way, <b>Jäckel</b> used Hitler's order of 13 March 1941, ordering that the Einsatzgruppen be reestablished for Operation Barbarossa, as proof of the Führer's involvement in the Holocaust. <b>Jäckel</b> also cited the entry in Joseph Goebbels's diary on 27 March 1942 – mentioning that the Führer's [...] "Prophecy" [...] of 1939 was coming true – {{as a sign that}} Hitler had ordered the Holocaust, and accused Irving of dishonesty in claiming that there was no sign in the Goebbels's diary that Hitler knew of the Holocaust. Finally, <b>Jäckel</b> noted the frequent references to the [...] "Prophecy Speech" [...] in Hitler's wartime speeches as a sign that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust, thereby disproving Irving's claim that Hitler was ignorant of the [...] "Final Solution".|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Jäckel's first article, Irving {{announced that he}} had seen a document from 1942 proving that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust not to occur, but that the document was now [...] "lost". <b>Jäckel</b> wrote that he had [...] "easily" [...] discovered the [...] "lost" [...] document, in which the head of the Reich Chancellery, Hans Lammers, wrote to the Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger that Hitler ordered him to put the [...] "Jewish Question" [...] on the [...] "back-burner" [...] until after the war. <b>Jäckel</b> noted the document concerned {{was the result of a}} meeting between Lammers and Schlegelberger on 10 April 1942 concerning amendments to the divorce law concerning German Jews and Mischlinge <b>Jäckel</b> commented that in 1942, there was a division of labour between the representatives of the Rechtsstaat (Law State) and the Polizeistaat (Police State) in Nazi Germany <b>Jäckel</b> argued that for the representatives of the Rechtsstaat like the Ministry of Justice, the [...] "Final Solution" [...] was a bureaucratic process to deprive Jews of their civil rights and to isolate them, whereas for representatives of Polizeistaat like the SS, the [...] "Final Solution" [...] was genocide. <b>Jäckel</b> argued that Hitler's order to Lammers to tell Schlegelberger to wait until after the war before concerning him about the [...] "impracticable" [...] details of the divorce laws between German Jews and [...] "Aryans" [...] was simply Hitler's way of putting Schlegelberger off. <b>Jäckel</b> maintained that since Hitler expected to win the war, and to complete the [...] "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" [...] by killing every single Jew in the world, Hitler would have had no interest in amending the divorce law to make it easier for those in mixed marriages to divorce their Jewish or Mischlinge spouses. Moreover, <b>Jäckel</b> noted that Hitler disliked dealing with the officials of the Justice Ministry, and Schlegelberger in particular. Hitler was to sack him as Justice Minister later in 1942, so it was understandable that Hitler would not want to see Schlegelberger. <b>Jäckel</b> ended his essay arguing that the [...] "lost" [...] document in no way proved that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust, and accused Irving of deceitfulness in claiming otherwise.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historian}} Eberhard <b>Jäckel,</b> in {{an essay}} first published in the Die Zeit newspaper on September 12, 1986, argued that Nolte's theory was ahistorical {{on the grounds that}} Hitler held the Soviet Union in contempt and could not have felt threatened as Nolte claimed. <b>Jäckel</b> later described Nolte's methods as a [...] "game of confusion", comprising dressing hypotheses up as questions and then attacking critics demanding evidence for his assertions as seeking to block one from asking questions.|$|E
2500|$|Völkisch mysticism, pseudoscience and ethnonationalism were combined, writes David Bloxham, [...] "in {{a terrifying}} agenda for unmixing the peoples under German {{dominion}} and breeding a race 'worthy' of European mastery". While {{groups such as}} the Roma and disabled were viewed as inferior and targeted by Nazi euthanasia and sterilization policies, the Nazis saw the Jews as an [...] "anti-race", writes Bloxham, [...] "a parasitical, polluting people". Eberhard <b>Jäckel</b> writes that {{it was the first time}} a state had thrown its power behind the idea that an entire people should be wiped out.

Writing in the Sunday Times, Sereny called Irving's work [...] "closer to theology or mythology" [...] than history, while Broszat labelled Irving a [...] "Hitler partisan wearing blinkers". Lance Morrow wrote in Time that Irving's picture of the [...] "Führer as a somewhat harried business executive too preoccupied {{to know exactly what}} was happening in his branch offices at Auschwitz and Treblinka" [...] was hard to accept. In an article published in the Sunday Times under the title [...] "The £1,000 Question" [...] on 10 July 1977, Sereny and the journalist Lewis Chester examined Irving's sources and found significant differences from what Irving published in Hitler's War.
