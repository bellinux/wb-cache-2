25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E
500|$|In early January 1942, the Dinara Division {{was formed}} after Đujić was {{contacted}} by the Chetnik supreme commander Mihailović, via a courier. The Chetnik commander Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin {{played a central role}} in organizing the units of Chetnik leaders in western Bosnia, Lika, and northern Dalmatia into the Dinara Division and dispatched former Royal Yugoslav Army officers to help. Đujić was designated the commander of the division with a goal of the [...] "establishment of a Serb national state" [...] in which [...] "an exclusively Orthodox population is to live". Đujić says the Dinara Division was [...] "under Draža's command, but we received news and supplies for our struggle from Ljotić and [...] Nedić. [...] Nedić's couriers reached me in Dinara and mine reached him in Belgrade. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> military uniforms for the guardists of the Dinara Chetnik Division; <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> ten million dinars to obtain for the fighters whatever was needed and whatever could be obtained." ...|$|E
500|$|To me it wasn't a {{song about}} romance, it was about me and Jim Steinman. We'd had a load of {{problems}} with managers in the early '80s {{and all of a}} sudden after five years we started to communicate. After I'd been to his house, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the song, and it was [...] "It's All Coming Back To Me Now". Not the line 'When you kiss me like that', but the emotional connection. It doesn't have to be literal.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{considered}} {{the writing of}} Blood to be harder compared to previous OSI albums. Previously, Matheos would send Moore guitar parts to work with, allowing Moore to [...] "work with editing them, pitching them, and fucking about them different ways, and then programming drums and keyboards." [...] When working on Blood, Matheos also provided programming, keyboard and drum parts. [...] "If <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> stuff that already had drums and keyboard parts, and it wasn't a complete idea, I {{had to figure out}} a way to elaborate on it without having that same equipment that he has there," [...] Moore said. Overall, he {{considered the}} writing process to be [...] "smoother because we got on a roll and we're more fluid together".|$|E
500|$|In the 1897 season, Peel was {{suspended}} by Yorkshire for drunkenness. Alcohol was popular with many professional cricketers, and {{the careers of}} several Yorkshire players in this period, including Peate, had been ended for this reason. Peel was always {{known to be a}} heavy drinker, but his behaviour had been tolerated. His fame, brought about by his performances, made the problem worse. Derek Hodgson, in the official Yorkshire club history, writes: [...] "A cheerful, gregarious man, [...] took to hospitality and entertaining with alacrity and moved in such society, particularly in London, that when one of the foremost journalists of the day asked to see him he was fobbed off by a man who announced himself as 'Peel's secretary', adding: 'He does not like interviews and has little to say. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to take his place.'" [...] Hodgson observes: [...] "It is not impossible, of course, that Bobby was either shy, or 'indisposed' at that particular moment", and suggests that Peel's downfall, like Peate's before him, was because he [...] "was too often the toast of the town".|$|E
500|$|Spencer Stone {{was born}} in 1992 in Sacramento, California, United States to Brian Stone and Joyce Eskel. He has an older brother named Everett, a California Highway Patrolman in Redwood City, California, and younger sister named Kelly. Growing up in Carmichael, California, Stone met his now-best friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler while {{attending}} Freedom Christian School in Fair Oaks, California, continuing their friendship into adulthood. All three men are described as sharing [...] "a deeply religious background and a belief in service to their community" [...] His mom stated {{that he wanted to}} become a soldier, watching countless Navy Seal videos with him. Stone later attended Del Campo High School where he played football, lacrosse, and other contact sports. Del Campo High School teacher and basketball coach Dave Nobis, remembers Stone as he played basketball in junior year through to senior year when he was also in Nobis' psychology class. Nobis said that Stone was always looking out for family and friends, [...] ""His blue-collar attitude and how he cared about others, he would have been the one to step up rather than curl into a ball." [...] and that [...] "He was always trying to pick up his teammates, giving them a high five. After he graduated, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a link to a motivational speech to use in my psychology class," ...|$|E

RZA later recollected [...] "I met John Woo that same year. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a letter. He was honored that we did it. I felt confident we could settle anything that came up. You can usually settle that shit. It's part of the budget, man. But John Woo didn't want nothing, never no money for that. We actually became friends. He took me and Ghost to lunch and dinner many times. He gave {{me a lot of}} mentoring in film." ...|$|E
2500|$|June: Speaking to al Jazeera, Taliban leader Mullah Bakht Mohammed {{stated that}} [...] "Sheikh Osama bin Laden {{is alive and}} active. He's {{carrying}} out his duties.

[...] Mohammed's brother Dadullah had led military operations for the Taliban {{until his death in}} May 2007. Mohammed stated that [...] "Sheikh Osama prefers not to be seen or meet anyone because if he makes himself available to the media maybe he will be facing danger." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2012 after further {{discussions about}} collaborating for a tour, Finn and Kelly {{announced}} {{the first ten}} dates of their Australia-wide Goin' Your Way Tour for February and March in the following year. Kelly told a press conference that [...] "I sent Neil a list of his songs I wanted us to do, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a list, the same for me. We also went through tracks songs we could do good harmony singing on". They also indicated the support act for those dates would be Lisa Mitchell. The tour was organised by Finn and Kelly with Live Nation Australasia by arrangement with Artist Voice. By January 2013 additional dates had {{been added to the}} tour without Mitchell supporting.|$|E
2500|$|When I had {{attained}} {{the age of}} twenty, I {{began to}} study the book Zohar {{and some of the}} Lurianic writings. [...] he who wants to purify himself receives the aid of Heaven; and thus <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> some of His holy angels and blessed spirits who revealed to me many of the mysteries of the Torah. In that same year, my force having been stimulated by the visions of the angels and the blessed souls, I was undergoing a prolonged fast in the week before the feast of Purim. Having locked myself in a separate room in holiness and purity…the spirit came over me, my hair stood on end and my knees shook and I beheld the merkabah, and I saw visions of God all day long and all night… ...|$|E
2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{arrived at}} Pingyuan, he told Liu Bei, [...] "I, (Taishi) Ci, am a {{commoner}} from Donglai. I am neither a relative nor {{an acquaintance of}} Kong Rong. But I have heard of him and we not only share similar beliefs, but also experienced difficult times together. Now, Guan Hai and the rebels have besieged Kong Rong; he is desperately in need of help. You are known for your kindness, righteousness, and willingness to help those in need. Kong Rong admires you and has placed his hopes in you, hence <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to fight {{my way out of}} the siege to seek help from you. Only you can save him." [...] Liu Bei's facial expression turned serious and he said, [...] "So Kong Rong knows that Liu Bei exists in this world!" [...] He then sent 3,000 troops to follow Taishi Ci back to Duchang. When the rebels heard that reinforcements had arrived, they fled and the siege of Duchang was automatically lifted. Kong Rong regarded Taishi Ci even more highly after this event. He told Taishi Ci, [...] "You are a young friend of mine." [...] When Taishi Ci returned home and told his mother about it, she said, [...] "I am very happy that you can repay Kong Rong's kindness in this way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Gaozu was sailing {{on a lake}} {{inside the}} Palace City {{during the time of}} the coup. [...] speculates that the emperor was alarmed by the {{impending}} crisis, thus he withdrew himself from the situation. He also surrounded himself with senior officials who were friendly to Li Shimin, because he possibly realized that Li Shimin was the cause of this and had better military connections that provided him with the advantage. The officials were Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, Chen Shuda, Feng Lun, Yan Shigu, Dou Dan (竇誕), and Yuwen Shiji. During the ongoing battle, Li Shimin sent Yuchi Jingde—who was still fully armed—into the Palace City to announce the news of the situation to Emperor Gaozu. Emperor Gaozu asked what was disturbing the peace and why he came. Yuchi Jingde replied: [...] "The Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi committed treason. The Prince of Qin mobilized his troops and executed them. He feared that Your Imperial Majesty would be shocked and <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to protect you." [...] Emperor Gaozu accepted the answer that he received from Yuchi Jingde. Subsequently, as the Zizhi Tongjian states, Emperor Gaozu turned to his officials and asked them: [...] "I did not anticipate that today I should see such a thing as this. What ought to be done about it?" [...] Two of them spoke highly meritoriously of Li Shimin and said that the killings of the two princely brothers served as a punishment. They also recommended Emperor Gaozu to appoint Li Shimin as the heir apparent.|$|E
