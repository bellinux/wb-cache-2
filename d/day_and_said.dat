500|$|Robertson {{was finally}} breveted as a {{lieutenant}} colonel in June 1936. The rank became substantive in July 1937. Like other regular officers, Robertson {{was opposed to}} the [...] "Singapore strategy", and therefore to the defence policy {{of the government of}} the <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> so publicly in the British Army Quarterly. Robertson argued for a local defence of Australia by land and air units. The naval theorist, Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond, responding to Robertson's arguments in an editorial, pointed out that local defence would fragment the British Empire's defence effort and could not secure the sea lanes. However, in view of the weakness of the Royal Navy, Richmond was forced to concede that Robertson's approach was not unreasonable.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days before}} the season's premiere, Mel B made {{comments}} about the other judges, labelling them dishonest and boring. She said, [...] "I don't care much for the other judges...Ronan thinks he knows it all [...] Natalie is just too nice and really dishonest. Guy could just be boring, like 'get on with it. Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – I hope so otherwise she deserves a slap." [...] Mel B appeared on the same radio show the following <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "They're all scared of me and I love it, there's got to be one bitch on the show so I might as well take that bloody crown." ...|$|E

5000|$|John Wesley, {{the founder}} of Methodism, {{believed}} that there was much to learn from studying renowned saints, but he discouraged the 'worship' of them. He {{expressed concern about the}} Church of England's focus on saints' <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "most of the holy days were at present answering no valuable end." [...] As such, Methodism does not have any system whereby people are canonised.|$|R
500|$|Prior to Carey signing {{her record}} deal with Columbia, she and Margulies had written and {{produced}} fourteen songs {{over a three-year}} period, seven of which made the final track listing of her self-titled debut studio album (1990), including [...] "Someday". [...] "Someday" [...] {{was one of the}} four songs which were on the demo tape handed to Mottola prior to her signing the contract. Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that [...] "Someday" [...] was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'I'd love to do it {{if you want to do}} it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me." ...|$|E
500|$|When Carey {{worked with}} Walden on [...] "I Don't Wanna Cry", {{they worked on}} several other songs. Together, they decided to [...] "slow down the tempo" [...] and create a [...] "crying type of ballad," [...] one which {{according}} to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres. After they completed the song, Lawrence noted {{how much of a}} perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct [...] "one line" [...] that troubled her. As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, [...] "Someday" [...] became Wake's favorite from the start, [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'I'd love to do it {{if you want to do}} it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me." [...] During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio. As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody. In [...] "All in Your Mind", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing staccatos up to F7. According to the artist, her voice [...] "split" [...] while doing those ornaments. While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the interview, Kirby Robinson attempted to contact host Dave Schrader {{and was told that}} Michelle and Chip effectively denied that a [...] "feud" [...] ever took place between anybody that <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that Kelli [...] "would have her day in court" [...] if she had [...] "a legal leg to stand on".|$|E
2500|$|The {{architect}} {{came into}} Wood's office one <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{it was time}} to select the color for the hospital.

2500|$|Severin {{grew up in}} {{an artistic}} {{household}} where her father, a World War I veteran, eventually became a designer for the fashion company Elizabeth Arden during the 1930s. In her teens, Severin took [...] "a couple of months" [...] of cartooning and illustration classes, and attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn [...] "for one <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'This is a college', and I wanted to draw and make money". Her first job was doing clerical work for an insurance company in downtown Manhattan [...] "for a couple of years" [...] while still living at home. She continued living there after her father died.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, Ukrainian {{government}} {{officials said that}} the Armed Forces had intended to retake the city of Sloviansk, but that an increased threat of [...] "Russian invasion" [...] halted these operations. Russian forces had mobilised within [...] of the Ukrainian border. The officials said that seven troops were killed during the day's operations. President Turchynov issued a statement later in the <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that the [...] "anti-terrorist" [...] operation would be resumed, citing the ongoing hostage crisis in Sloviansk as a reason. By 6 May, fourteen Ukrainian troops had died and sixty-six had been injured in the fighting.|$|E
2500|$|While {{out walking}} on New Years Day 1987, Drummond {{formulated}} {{a plan to}} make a hip-hop record. However, [...] "I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself", he said.

And, I thought, I knew Jimmy , I {{knew he was a}} like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things.

2500|$|Merman's {{fourth and}} final {{marriage}} was to actor Ernest Borgnine. They were married in Beverly Hills on June 27, 1964. They separated on August 7 and Borgnine filed for divorce on October 21. Merman filed a cross-complaint shortly thereafter charging Borgnine with extreme cruelty. She was granted a divorce on November 18, 1964. Borgnine later told fellow actor Frank Wilson that {{he spent most of}} his short marriage arguing with Merman. By the end, he recounted how she came back from a film one <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The director said I looked sensational. He said I had the face of a 20-year-old, and the body and legs of a 30-year-old!" [...] Borgnine replied, [...] "Did he say anything about your old cunt?" [...] "No," [...] replied Merman, [...] "he didn't mention you at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our {{critical}} attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who {{was the head of}} The WB at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [...] wait so long to give Angel a pick-up [...] a lot of us [...] turn down jobs hoping that Angel will continue– he [...] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [...] just asked Jordan, [...] "Like, make your decision now whether you're going to pick us up or not," [...] and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Okay, we're cancelling you." [...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel Angel. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [...] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [...] made the decision to cancel us.|$|E
2500|$|Ullman {{contends that}} her impersonations are played with great admiration and affection. [...] "I hope {{they take it}} in the right spirit!" [...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, {{for a second or}} two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant. [...] "But I get into trouble now if I go into a shop with a bag over my arm [...] A man came up to me in M the other <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'I've got my eye on you'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Lapham, in {{the proud}} bitterness which his isolation brought, [...] "you couldn't do any good." [...] He {{went in and}} shut the door, and by and by his wife heard him begin walking up and down; {{and then the rest}} of the night she lay awake and listened to him walking up and down. But when the first light whitened the window, the words of the Scripture came into her mind: [...] "And there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the <b>day....</b> <b>And</b> he <b>said,</b> Let me go, for the <b>day</b> breaketh. <b>And</b> he <b>said,</b> I will not let thee go, except thou bless me." ...|$|R

2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of the servant's travels in [...] the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that from Kiriat Arba to Haran was a journey of 17 days, but Abraham's servant came to Haran in three hours. The servant was {{astonished}} that he had arrived on the same <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> (as reported in [...] ), [...] "And I came this day to the fountain." [...] Rabbi Abbahu taught that God wished to show loving-kindness to Isaac, and he sent an angel before Eliezer to shorten the way for him, so that the servant came to Haran in three hours. Similarly, Rabbi Berekiah taught in Rabbi Isaac's name that the words of [...] "And I came this day to the fountain," [...] mean that Abraham's servant set out that day and miraculously arrived the same day. The Midrash thus counted Abraham's servant along with Jacob and Abishai the son of Zeruiah as men who miraculously traveled long distances in a short time when the earth trembled, closing gaps and thereby speeding them along.–16. And similarly, the Rabbis read the words [...] "And I came this day to the well" [...] in [...] to imply that Eliezer had set out that day from Abraham's household and arrived on the same day in Aram-Naharaim. The Rabbis thus taught that the earth shrank to speed Eliezer's journey, as it would again for Jacob (as implied in [...] ) and Abishai the son of Zeruiah.|$|E

However, he remains {{on death row}} and has long been considered ineligible for execution due to mental illness. In 2008, Roe Wilson, a Harris County assistant district attorney, dismissed concerns that death row prisoners have limited access to mental health services. [...] "That really is not a factor in this case," [...] said Wilson. [...] "What the factor is, is that (Riles) was competent when he was tried and given a legal sentence. His confinement is still legal and he simply has a condition right now that makes him not eligible for execution. But that could change." ...|$|R
