40|$|<b>Epizootic</b> hemorrhagic <b>disease</b> (EHD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} diseases of deer in North America. The <b>epizootic</b> hemorrhagic <b>disease</b> viruses (EHDV) are widespread in white-tailed deer and periodically cause serious epidemics in wild populations. Some of these viruses can also cause disease in cattle. In the U. S., EHD in cattle is uncommon, rarely fatal, and usually associated with an epidemic in deer. However, an EHDV serogroup virus called the Ibaraki virus causes serious epidemics in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan that may affect as many as 39, 000 cattle. The disease caused by the Ibaraki virus is known as Ibaraki disease; some authorities consider it to be a synonym for <b>epizootic</b> hemorrhagic <b>disease</b> in cattle. Etiology The <b>epizootic</b> hemorrhagic <b>disease</b> viruses belong to the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. Ten serotypes of EHDV are known worldwide. The Ibaraki virus is closely related to EHDV. According to some authors, it is a distinct virus belonging to the EHDV serogroup. According to others, the Ibaraki virus and the Australian (but not the American) EHDV serotype 2 are nearly identical topotypes. There is more than one strain of the Ibaraki virus. Species Affected The <b>epizootic</b> hemorrhagic <b>disease</b> viruses can infect most wild and domestic ruminants. Clinical signs are seen mainly in white tailed deer, with mule deer and pronghorn antelope affected to a lesser extent. Other wild animals found to be seropositive include black-tailed deer, red deer, wapiti, fallow deer, and roe deer. Rare outbreaks of EHD have been reported in cattle. Sheep can be infected experimentally but rarely develop clinical signs, and goats do not seem to be susceptible to infection. Ibaraki disease is seen in cattle.

30|$|A {{parameter}} {{describing the}} precipitation {{in the early}} pupal stage, prec_pupa, was selected.

According to Schwenke (1978, p. 228), the main reasons for pupal mortality are dehydration, flooding and predators. As flooding can be largely excluded at the monitoring stands, the mortality by dehydration offers a plausible explanation for the described covariate’s effect. Influence by predatory enemies and <b>epizootic</b> <b>disease</b> could not be investigated in this study, but they can reduce the population of MUWM considerably, especially in pupal stage (Dempster 1983; Berryman 1996; Hunter 1998).|$|E
