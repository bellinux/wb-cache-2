She was appointed as the head of ZANU-PF's women's league, and was involved in a number of charitable operations, although was widely regarded as corrupt in these dealings. During Mugabe's premiership she suffered from renal failure, and initially had to travel to Britain for dialysis until Soames arranged for a <b>dialysis</b> <b>machine</b> to be sent to Zimbabwe.|$|E
500|$|In December 1954, a {{memorial}} service for Robey was held at St Paul's Cathedral. The diverse congregation consisted of royalty, actors, hospital workers, stage personnel, students and taxi drivers, among others. The Bishop of Stepney, Joost de Blank, said: [...] "We have lost a great English music hall artist, one of the greatest this country has known {{in the late nineteenth and}} twentieth centuries." [...] Performers gave readings at the service, including the comedian Leslie Henson, who called Robey [...] "that great obstinate bullock of variety". In his lifetime, Robey helped to earn more than £2,000,000 for charitable causes, with £500,000 of that figure being raised during the First World War. In recognition of his efforts, the Merchant Seaman's Convalescent Home in Limpsfield, Surrey, named a ward after him, and managerial staff at the Royal Sussex Hospital later bought a new <b>dialysis</b> <b>machine</b> in his memory. In the 1960s, a public house in Finsbury Park, North London, was named [...] "The George Robey".|$|E

40|$|The {{disinfection}} of <b>dialysis</b> <b>machines</b> {{is performed}} after each session in some units {{but only at}} the end of the day in other ones. In a multicentre study, in 15 units (five with and ten without disinfection after each session), the incidence of sero-conversion for HCV was reduced to zero, after reinforcement of general hygiene precautions only, without changing the above-mentioned machine disinfection policies. Recently reported episodes of blood contamination of <b>dialysis</b> <b>machines</b> beyond pressure transducers demonstrate that pressure isolator inspection and care should be added to the general hygiene precautions. In a second investigation, no difference was found in dialysate bacterial and endotoxin characteristics between <b>dialysis</b> <b>machines,</b> disinfected after each dialysis (n = 2) and those disinfected {{at the end of the}} day only (n = 2). In conclusion, the systematic disinfection of all <b>dialysis</b> <b>machines</b> after each session does not appear to help prevent HCV infection nor to have a detectable impact on optimal dialysate bacterial and endotoxin characteristics...|$|R

He was diagnosed as having Goodpasture's syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the kidneys and lungs. Merritt was struggling with his health and finances, so his manager, Wal Bishop, along with Australian music industry friends, organised a Concert for Max held at the Palais Theatre, St Kilda, Victoria, on 21 October 2007, and raised $200,000. He is currently on a <b>dialysis</b> <b>machine</b> awaiting a kidney transplant and is unable to tour extensively. On 1 July 2008, Merritt was inducted by Glenn A. Baker into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

2500|$|An {{argument}} first {{presented by}} Judith Jarvis Thomson states {{that even if}} the fetus is a person and has a right to life, abortion is morally permissible because a woman has a right to control her own body and its life-support functions. Thomson's variant of this argument draws an analogy between forcing a woman to continue an unwanted pregnancy and forcing a person to allow his body to be used to maintain blood homeostasis (as a <b>dialysis</b> <b>machine</b> is used) for another person suffering from kidney failure. [...] It is argued that just as it would be permissible to [...] "unplug" [...] and thereby cause the death of the person who is using one's kidneys, so it is permissible to abort the fetus (who similarly, it is said, has no right to use one's body's life-support functions against one's will).|$|E

2500|$|Still uneasy {{after his}} second diagnosis, Dr. Bertinot {{consulted}} a colleague, Dr. Frank Lanza, who believed Joan {{to be in}} septic shock. The doctors ordered blood cultures, which would take 72 hours to process. [...] Joan had been a patient at Sharpstown General for six hours when her kidneys began to fail; she was not passing any urine and had edema. Her intravenous fluids were increased {{with the hope of}} being able to prompt her kidneys into producing urine. [...] By 8 p.m., Joan Robinson Hill's kidneys had failed to respond and her condition was considered to be [...] "grave". [...] Dr. Bernard Hicks, a kidney specialist, was called in to consult. Dr. Hicks determined Joan was in severe kidney failure. [...] Since Sharpstown General had no <b>dialysis</b> <b>machine,</b> the medical team debated about transferring Joan to Houston Methodist Hospital, where such equipment was available, but Dr. Hicks believed she was too ill to be transferred. [...] The option for treating her at the hospital was to begin peritoneal dialysis. [...] Dr. Hicks wanted the consent of John Hill before beginning this procedure and phoned him at the Kirby Drive home at 9:15p.m. [...] Hill left the house after taking the telephone call but did not arrive at Sharpstown General to give his consent until 11 p.m. His wife was conscious and begged him to stay with her, saying that she was frightened.|$|E
