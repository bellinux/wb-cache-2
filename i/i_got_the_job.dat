He was impressed with the fact I could pronounce Rimsky-Korsakov. That's how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> I spent three years with the United States Army Band.

5000|$|On 17 June 2007, Angela Cuming of The Sun-Herald {{reported}} Lewis {{had joined}} the cast of Home and Away. The actor had previously auditioned for a role on the show for two years, before finally impressing the producers. During an interview published in Inside Soap, Lewis revealed that he had auditioned for Ric Dalby in 2004, making {{it down to the}} final three, before Mark Furze <b>got</b> <b>the</b> part. Then in 2007, Lewis auditioned for Drew Curtis and made it to the final two - only for Bobby Morley to be given the role. Of the moment he learned he had secured a role in Home and Away, Lewis said [...] "I was in a furniture shop with my mum and aunty when producers called to say <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> <b>I</b> started screaming and running around.

Lewis relocated to Sydney, where Home and Away is shot, and he had to cut his long hair short for the part. Lewis made his screen debut as Geoff on 20 June 2007.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2011, {{during the}} Eurobasket 2011 preparations, Maljković opened a public row with the Serbian Olympic Committee (OKS) {{president}} Vlade Divac, calling the former player a [...] "fraudster and a liar" [...] in Croatian sports daily newspaper Sportske novosti {{as a response}} to Divac's remark in Slovenian media that Slovenia would've been better off keeping Jure Zdovc as head coach instead of hiring Maljković. The coach expanded on his insults by saying: [...] "Divac isn't even aware that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> Slovenia <b>job</b> after Memi Bečirović, not after Zdovc. The journalist talking to Divac wasn't kind to him, ringing him up before noon. Considering Divac usually wakes up around 3pm, he was probably still delirious". When told of Maljković's comments, Divac refused to be drawn into name calling through the media, refusing to say anything more on the subject. However, Maljković wasn't done, responding to Divac's non-response with more insults and veiled accusations: [...] "Divac crossed a line. Every so often he's got excesses like this one in the media. We're two different worlds. It's up to him now whether he wants to start in with me because <b>I</b> <b>got</b> an elaborate file showing what he's all about. I'd only like to add one more thing to my original statement. Divac is a huge fraudster and a huge liar". The row even prompted 86-year-old Bora Stanković, the Serbian basketball's elder statesman, to register his displeasure publicly, scolding both sides.|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} returned on 19 July 2016 with New Zealand actor Benedict Wall {{cast in the}} role. Wall originally {{auditioned for}} the role of Justin Morgan, but the part went to James Stewart. Wall was in New Zealand when the role of Duncan became available. He sent an audition tape to the producers and they offered him the part. Of his casting, Wall said [...] "It wasn't lost on me that I wasn't from the right part of the world when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> But you know what's funny is when I'm with Ray, I'm always surprised at how much we do seem alike." [...] Wall worked on his Australian accent, but as the character has been living in the United States, it {{did not need to be}} too thick.|$|E
5000|$|Out of {{high school}} in 1980, Carroll moved to New Liskeard, Ontario. [...] "My first job was as news {{director}} for the station CJTT.

[...] "I hadn't formally studied journalism, so once <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> I bought every book on broadcast journalism I could find. At night I would study to be a broadcast journalist, and practice during the day." [...] Bill was the co-host of MuchMusic's game show spoof Test Pattern, along with Dan Gallagher.

5000|$|Originating {{the role}} in 1980, The Edge of Night's Colin stayed {{for two years}} (eventually marrying her {{on-screen}} love interest Justin Deas). In 1983, Bailey took over the role and admitted Deas didn't agree {{with the idea of}} the character being recast. [...] "Because he and Margaret (Colin), they were not yet together. This was his way of interacting with her at work, he didn’t like the idea that she wasn’t there anymore. I think I handled him the best and that’s why <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Subsequently we became really good friends." [...] In 1989, after six years with the show, Bailey Smith quit the role, admitting she was burned out after her time on As the World Turns. [...] "I wanted {{to spend more time with}} my kids. I felt I had taken Margo to the length I could take her. I needed to do something else.

500|$|Zeta-Jones {{participated in}} school stage shows {{from a young}} age and gained local media {{attention}} when her rendition of a Shirley Bassey song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre. At the age of nine, she was selected to play one of the orphan girls in a West End production of the musical Annie, and in her early teens, she became a national tap-dancing champion. In 1981 she played the lead role of Annie in a Swansea production of the musical, which was staged at the Swansea Grand Theatre. Two years later, she played the lead role of Tallulah in a West End production of Bugsy Malone. When she was 15, Zeta-Jones {{dropped out of school}} without obtaining O-levels and decided to live in London to pursue a full-time acting career; she was also engaged to perform in a touring production of The Pajama Game. Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, [...] "I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. It might take me two tries, but <b>I</b> always <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> <b>I</b> figured out what they wanted". She went on to attend the independent Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick, London, for a three-year course in musical theatre.|$|R

A good thesaurus can suggest alternate wordings and enrich the vocabulary of the translation. Not only will a dictionary make a profound impact on a project, but in many cases it is the most important single contribution we can make to the linguistic world. Dictionaries are also the only linguistic descriptions that are popular with the general public. Up until now the time and effort involved in compiling a dictionary was so great that progress was agonizingly slow. Most of us translate with a small dictionary of very limited usefulness. Others give it up as not worth the bother. Some wait to produce a dictionary until after the translation is done, when it is too late to be of help! But now it is possible to produce a massive, semantically classified dictionary at the beginning of the project, so that it can be used throughout the project. Since...|$|R

I said, 'No, not really, because I have a pretty bad Philadelphia accent and I don't know what to say.' And he said, 'Why don't you take a shot at it?' So I did; I took an audition, and he evidently passed me. I think he was either an angel or the Lord put him there, because he was 'the man in the middle' who was really standing there at the time I was wavering. He talked to the program director even though I didn't have the greatest record at the school, so they put me on six months' probation. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> and stayed for 25 years." ...|$|E

40|$|To lead {{a project}} effectively, {{one has to}} {{establish}} and maintain the flexibility to take appropriate actions when needed. Overconstrained situations should be avoided. To get on top of matters and stay there, a manager needs to anticipate what it will take to successfully complete the job. Physical and financial resources, personnel, and management structure are all important considerations. Carving out the necessary turf up front can make a world of difference to the project's outcome. After the "what," "where," and "when" of a project are nailed down, the next question is "how" to do the job.
