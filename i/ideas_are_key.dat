40|$|What are {{the main}} {{elements}} underlying political attitudes towards armed conflict issues? And to what extent does their role vary in shaping the opinions held by those who live closer to the conflict than others? This article answers these questions hinging upon the notion that self-interest and <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> <b>key</b> determinants of attitudes. It uses a theoretical framework {{to suggest that there}} is a consistent association between ideas and attitudes towards policy issues, and that the less directly linked self-interests are to a given issue, the stronger the ideas-attitudes association will be. It then uses quantitative data collected {{in the context of the}} 2012 - 2016 Colombian peace talks to explore the attitudes of individuals who live in the vicinity of the armed conflict as compared with those who do not.

To detect the most promising from this mass of ideas, we identify online behavioural characteristics of successful ideators, i. e. those who suggest ideas that are implemented. Our study is based on binary logistic regression analyses of a dataset from a call for ideas crowdsourced {{by the city of}} Munich. We found that characteristics linked to suggesting possible solutions and to showing positive attention towards other <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> <b>key</b> features of how successful ideators behave online. We also found that the first is a characteristic of ideators who are likely to suggest an idea that is implemented but not novel. The latter is a characteristic of ideators who are likely to suggest an idea that is implemented and novel. Paying attention to other ideas before suggesting one's own and providing constructive input to other ideas are not found to be characteristic for successful ideators. The findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} successful ideators' online behaviour and thereby open up new opportunities for the detection of ideas that the idea-seeker wants to implement...|$|E
40|$|The basic goal of {{education}} within a discipline is to transform a novice into an expert. This entails moving the novice toward the "semantic space " that the expert inhabits—the space of concepts, meanings, vocabularies, and other intellectual constructs {{that comprise the}} discipline. Metadata is significant to this goal in digitally mediated education environments. Encoding the experts ’ semantic space not only enables the sharing of semantics among discipline scientists, but also creates an environment that bridges the semantic gap between the common vocabulary of the novice and the granular descriptive language of the seasoned scientist (Greenberg, et al, 2005). Developments underlying the Semantic Web, where vocabularies are formalized in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and Web 2. 0 approaches of user-generated folksonomies provide an infrastructure for linking vocabulary systems and promoting group learning via metadata literacy. Group learning is a pedagogical approach to teaching that harnesses the phenomenon of “collective intelligence ” to increase learning by means of collaboration.

40|$|Back in 2009, while {{finishing}} my Computer Science degree, I {{woke up in}} {{the middle}} of the night with an idea. The idea that semantics, that true semantics, could only be found in the relations among entities. Indeed, for me a book is defined by concepts like page, reading, paper, word, author, library, burn, “I, Robot”, and many others. And the removal of any of those concepts from my mind would change what a book actually means. The simplicity and clarity of this <b>idea</b> (the semantics <b>are</b> in the relations!) has haunted me for six years.

30|$|The {{processes}} {{described above}} show that two main types of mechanisms {{are used in}} the financial innovation governance process—namely, statutory regulation (e.g. using legal sanctions) and self-regulation (e.g. using corporate governance structures and private exchanges) (Stefanadis, 2003; Awrey, 2011). Nevertheless, these mechanisms appear to focus more on financial sector governance than on governing financial innovation. Germain (2010): 27 defines financial sector governance as ‘publicly sanctioned decision-making directed towards establishing the framework of rules by which and through which financial institutions undertake and organise financial transactions within and across borders’. This definition emphasises law and order in financial activity; however, it does not touch upon how financial sector innovations and the associated stakeholders are monitored from ideation to commercialisation (Asante et al., 2014). According to Asante et al. (2014), the latter is likely to include mechanisms such as ‘stage gating’, where challenging and approving <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> <b>key,</b> as well as test-before-market principles and the use of new-product-development committees that debate the risks and impacts of innovation. However, the literature suggests that use of those mechanisms is limited in financial innovation, with its introduction, approval, elaboration, and diffusion appearing to occur under governance constraints.|$|R

40|$|In high-stakes {{resource}} use struggles currently playing {{out across the}} world, different beliefs about economics and "growth-first" regional development underpin decisions and dynamics that have far-reaching consequences. Neoliberalizing political economies rely on the maintenance of particular beliefs associated with these themes, and work to delegitimize and silence alternatives. Thus understanding the beliefs of actors concerning these themes, especially with respect to neoliberal <b>ideas,</b> <b>is</b> <b>key</b> to understanding these socio-political struggles. This article uses a combination of literature review, critical discourse analysis and selected fieldwork data to explore the recent debate about coal seam gas (CSG) in Eastern Australia. In particular, it examines the ideas that underlie texts produced by CSG production companies, the Queensland Government, and Lock the Gate (a key group opposed to rapid CSG industry expansion). The analysis indicates that {{with respect to the}} above themes, Lock the Gate expresses their opposition to CSG through perspectives that mostly depart from those with a key role in maintaining neoliberalizing political economies. In contrast, the Queensland government and CSG companies, despite each encompassing significant internal diversity, have expressed relatively similar and consistent positions, aligned with neoliberalizing ideas. The article problematizes descriptions of the state government as a neutral arbitrator that can restore balance between the beliefs of gas companies and groups like Lock the Gate, and advances consideration of deeper differences...|$|R
