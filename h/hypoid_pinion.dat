50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel gear is normally conical. The hypoid gear places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The <b>hypoid</b> <b>pinion</b> is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|E
40|$|In general, a {{hypoid gear}} and a {{spiral bevel gear}} for cars {{are made up of}} a formate gear and a {{generated}} pinion. The tooth shape is tapered tooth. Much practice is required to obtain excellent tooth bearing of the tapered tooth. If we convert a tapered tooth to an equi-depth tooth, it is thought that we could easily obtain practical tooth bearing. To date, however, there is no paper that theoretically analyzes tooth bearing of the equi-depth tooth and actually demonstrates it. Therefore the tapered tooth is still used in cars. Thus, we have studied the gear cutting method of the equi-depth tooth hypoid gear. The tooth surface of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>pinion</b> is generated by the 3 rd gear member. In such a case, it is useful to apply the cutting pitch cone instead of the pitch cone and to change the generating shaft angle to the tooth bearing development of a hypoid gear. In this report, we present the relationships between the cutting pitch angle or the generating shaft angle and the tooth bearing pattern compared with a tapered tooth...|$|E
40|$|The tooth {{surfaces}} of <b>hypoid</b> <b>pinions</b> are {{generated by the}} 3 rd gear members which are composed of the cutters and their positions or tilting angles on the pinion generators. In such cases, it is useful in the gear factories to apply the cutting pitch cones instead of the pitch cones to the tooth bearing development of hypoid gears. This paper presents relationships between the cutting pitch angles and the tooth bearing patterns introducing the small increment effects of the pinion offset...|$|R
50|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} {{automobiles}} the central drive shaft (or prop shaft) engages the differential through a <b>hypoid</b> gear(ring and <b>pinion).</b> The ring gear {{is mounted on}} the carrier of the planetary chain that forms the differential. This hypoid gear is a bevel gear that changes {{the direction of the}} drive rotation.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{servicing}} of the Queerbox {{was undertaken}} by Graham Hill, then a mechanic at Lotus. It was {{soon discovered that}} the final drive was reliably unreliable, with all examples having the <b>hypoid</b> crown wheel <b>pinion</b> of their final drives fail at around fifty miles, much less than a single race. When improved oils meant that they lasted barely long enough to compete, it was then found that the gearbox section was also unreliable, with a worn box becoming unable to select a gear and leaving drivers with 'a box full of neutrals'.|$|R
40|$|The {{deviations}} of a gear's real tooth surface from the theoretical surface {{are determined by}} coordinate measurements at the grid of the surface. A method was developed to transform the deviations from Cartesian coordinates to those along the normal at the measurement locations. Equations are derived that relate the first order deviations with the adjustment to the manufacturing machine-tool settings. The {{deviations of}} the entire surface are minimized. The minimization is achieved by application of the least-square method for an overdetermined system of linear equations. The proposed method is illustrated with a numerical example for <b>hypoid</b> gear and <b>pinion...</b>|$|R
