500|$|Rhodes {{described}} Martha Logan's debut {{scene as}} [...] "perhaps {{the most memorable}} character debut in 24 history." [...] In the debut scene, she proclaimed, [...] "I look like a wedding cake" [...] just before dunking <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the bathroom sink. Her marriage to President Logan was described by producer Howard Gordon as [...] "one {{of the highlights of}} this year." [...] Smart was also nominated for an Emmy for her performance, Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Category, but lost the award to Blythe Danner.|$|E
500|$|Although being {{praised by}} media outlets, [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] sparked {{controversy}} for its lyrics referencing domestic violence. On the song, Jay-Z rapped the lyrics [...] "I'm Ike, Turner, turn up / Baby no I don't play / Now eat the cake, Anna Mae / I said eat the cake, Anna Mae" [...] which alludes to Tina Turner's abusive {{relationship with her}} former husband, Ike Turner. The lyric specifically refers to a scene from Tina Turner's biopic in which Ike Turner forced Tina to eat cake by pushing <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the cake; the film is based on Tina Turner's real-life experience with a jealous and violent husband. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield described the reference as [...] "tasteless" [...] in his review of the song and The Guardian writer Tshepo Mokoena called the song's lyrics [...] "disturbing" [...] and [...] "distasteful". British radio station Bang Radio aired an edited version of the song excluding the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|The creators wanted Phineas, like Ferb, to be a {{character}} who would never [...] " [...] anything with any ," [...] or to agitate his sister or outsmart his mother purposely. Instead, the character {{was supposed to be}} motivated only by enjoyment and free from mean spiritedness. He is generous, kind, and optimistic, and several of his plots involve helping someone out. He tries to please his sister Candace, carving <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> Mount Rushmore for her birthday in one episode and helping her retrieve a tape detailing his summer adventures even though she intended on using the footage as evidence to [...] "bust" [...] him and Ferb. Another episode has him throwing an extravaganza for his mother's birthday, and yet another has him (along with Ferb and Candace) recreating their parent's most romantic moment for their wedding anniversary. He has also been shown helping his grandparents, reenacting his grandfather Reginald's daredevil stunt from his youth and setting up a roller derby for a rematch race with his grandmother Betty Jo's old rival. In the episodes [...] "One Good Scare Ought to Do It!" [...] and [...] "Hail Doofania!", Phineas goes to great lengths to help his friend Isabella. [...] Other episodes, like [...] "Unfair Science Fair," [...] "Oil on Candace," [...] "The Bully Code," [...] and [...] "Voyage To The Bottom of Buford," [...] further explore Phineas's generosity toward all of his friends. He even has plans at the beginning of [...] "The Bully Code" [...] for a jellybean currency system for emerging nations.|$|E
2500|$|Art is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a young female figure wearing a floor-length tunic underneath an intricately tied outer garment, which is pinned at her proper left shoulder with a fibula. The outer garment is belted at the sculpture's upper and lower waist and is approximately two inches shorter than the tunic. The skirts of both the tunic and outer garment fall towards {{the floor in a}} multitude of folds. It is crossed diagonally over her shoulder blades and loosely gathered on her proper right chest, exposing her neck and breastbone. The statue's hair is parted in the middle and pulled back from <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> a twisted bun, and a crown of laurel leaves is nestled atop her head. Her gaze is directed forwards and her features are idealized, like the other female figures of the sculpture group with the exception of Justice. In her proper left hand, she carries a round palette held down at her side, and in her proper right hand, a paintbrush held in front of her at waist height. She stands with her weight on both feet, with her proper right foot extended slightly forward of her proper left. There are several dots of an unknown black substance on the marble base underneath her feet, in front of her proper left foot. There is no discernible foundry mark or signature, but the statue is identified by the black label attached to the cement pedestal underneath her feet, which reads [...] "ART" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E
60|$|He stooped; Molly {{inserted}} part of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> {{the circular}} hole, and a smack resounded in the helmet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear," [...] said Mary, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{breaking}} <b>into</b> merriment as {{she seemed}} to consider a moment, [...] "I don't like their neckcloths." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{it was too}} miserable!' {{cried the}} girl, {{pressing}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> again <b>into</b> <b>her</b> companion's kerchief. 'I was all, all mistaken; he had never thought!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's the matter?' he said again, {{when she}} was quieter. But she only pressed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> further <b>into</b> his shoulder, in pain, like a child that cannot tell.|$|R
60|$|The small servant screwed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> an {{expression}} of the very uttermost entanglement of slyness, and shook her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "But couldn't you SEE," [...] {{the girl}} reproached her, {{and she began}} to cry, and turned <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the pillow again and lay sobbing.|$|E
60|$|In {{doing so}} she {{revealed}} the fact that, besides having contorted <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> an unrecognisable shape, she had soiled it {{in several places}} with streaks of charcoal and earth.|$|E
25|$|Before Regan {{grabs the}} psychiatrist's crotch, a new digital effect of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{morphing}} <b>into</b> the devil (which {{is seen in}} subliminal cuts throughout) including a new growl has been added.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted the}} hem of her apron to <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and broke <b>into</b> {{discordant}} weeping.|$|R
60|$|Her laugh {{suddenly}} ceased, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> changed <b>into</b> a {{more nervous}} activity as {{she rose and}} went toward the window. She had {{heard the sound of}} wheels outside--the coach had just arrived.|$|R
60|$|The little {{model was}} lying on the {{dismantled}} bed, pressing <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the blue and white ticking of the bolster. Her shoulders shook, and a sound of smothered sobbing came from her. The landlady stood staring silently.|$|E
60|$|I knelt within half a yard of her. She {{stirred the}} fire, {{so that a}} ripple of light broke from the {{disturbed}} coal: the glare, however, as she sat, only threw <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.|$|E
6000|$|Sylvia {{spoke in}} a {{paroxysm}} of remorseful sorrow. Moor listened with a sinking heart, and when she dropped <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> her hands again, unable to endure the pale expectancy of his, he turned away, saying with an accent of quiet despair-- ...|$|E
5000|$|You can {{recognize}} without difficulty ... that Metzinger sat {{a woman with}} an umbrella in a boat, a woman with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> cut <b>into</b> sections that we could reassemble easily enough, and which is not of unpleasant colors.|$|R
60|$|She turned quickly, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> flashed <b>into</b> a smile--a smile different, somehow, {{from that}} {{with which she}} had greeted the others, and they saw it. It warmed his melancholy soul like a sudden ray of June sunlight.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> faded <b>into</b> {{an aspect}} of deep {{distress}} when she saw what had happened. [...] "Oh no, Giles," [...] she said, with extreme pathos; [...] "certainly not. Why do you--say that when you know better? You EVER will misunderstand me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brook turned impatiently away. [...] "You've certainly--with your {{talk about}} 'warning'--the happiest expressions!" [...] She put <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the flowers {{as he had}} done just before; then as she raised it: [...] "What kind of a monster are you trying to make me out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She bent <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> her hands, {{covering}} {{it over with}} them, and so remained a minute; then she continued a little differently, though as if she hadn't heard my question: [...] "I hoped you were too disgusted with us--after the way we left you planted." ...|$|E
6000|$|She got {{the letters}} open, and holding {{one of them}} up in each hand she read them impartially and simultaneously; then she flung them both down, and turned <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> her pillow with an impulse of her {{inalienable}} girlishness. [...] "Well, it is too silly." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> {{stiffened}} <b>into</b> rigidity; she dashed {{the tears}} from her eyes. [...] "No," [...] she said quickly. Then {{after a moment she}} added, with a faint laugh, [...] "You see we haven't seen each other for so long--it's all so sudden--so unexpected." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{took them}} and stood shyly for a moment, {{and then the}} watchful gravity of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> broke <b>into</b> soft emotion. [...] "Oh!" [...] she cried and seized his <b>face</b> between <b>her</b> hands in a passion of triumphant love and kissed him.|$|R
6000|$|Pansy {{reflected}} a moment, turning gravely {{from one of}} the persons mentioned to the other. Then <b>her</b> <b>face</b> broke <b>into</b> its perfect smile. [...] "I have a pretty dress, but even that one's very simple. Why should I expose it beside your beautiful things?" ...|$|R
60|$|Fanny dropped <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> her hands, with {{a little}} shiver, as she said that; then got up, looking as pale and {{resolute}} as if going to meet some dreadful doom, and putting on her things, went away to Polly's as fast as her dignity would allow.|$|E
60|$|Therese fetched another deep {{sigh and}} raising her eyes {{looked at me}} with great attention. I {{preserved}} an inscrutable expression, for I wanted to hear all she had to tell me of Rita. I watched her with the greatest anxiety composing <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> a cheerful expression.|$|E
60|$|It was not necessary. The girl's mind, {{perhaps because}} it was imbued already with the subject, had possessed itself of what filled her mother's. She dropped from the elbow on which she had lifted herself, and turned <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the pillow, with a long wail of shame.|$|E
60|$|She sat on {{the stairs}} until she fell asleep herself, her head pillowed on her arm. Judith found her there when she came in, severe and triumphant, from her bout with the {{henhouse}} door. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> softened <b>into</b> marvelous tenderness {{as she looked at}} Salome.|$|R
50|$|Minutes later, Laura shows {{heightened}} senses {{when the}} police arrive, telling Bridger that she can smell vodka on his breath. The final scene is a close-up of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> fading <b>into</b> dark, wolf eyes, and a close up of Will completing his transformation into a full werewolf.|$|R
5000|$|Marie slowdances with Abe {{by candlelight}} to a {{saxophone}} version of [...] "When I Fall in Love" [...] {{and the scene}} abruptly cuts {{to a shot of}} Marie sitting at work with a faraway, daydream look on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> casting <b>into</b> doubt the source of the story.|$|R
