40|$|The green lumber {{products}} tend {{towards a}} state of equilibrium with the surrounding environment. The final target is the equilibrium moisture content (EMC). Whether is natural convection in the lumberyard or forced convection in the <b>kiln</b> <b>drier,</b> the road towards the final EMC consumes time and energy. The air drying operations (natural convection) are {{not an easy task}} for the drying management. This is valid {{especially when it comes to}} prove that in doing so, these operations will increase the overall drying process efficiency. A break-even analysis was conducted to understand and find if the air-drying practices (natural convection) are acceptable from accounting and drying management point of view.

40|$|The {{performance}} of Acacia melanoxylon R. Br. (Australian blackwood) boards 25 mm and 50 mm thick was assessed {{in terms of}} drying time, shrinkage, collapse, and degrade from warping and cheeking after either air drying, dehumidification <b>drying,</b> conventional <b>kiln</b> <b>drying,</b> or high temperature <b>kiln</b> <b>drying.</b> Even <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> at a dry bulb temperature of 70 °C, wet bulb 60 °C, did not cause undue surface checking. The major problem encountered was the extreme variability of drying rate; quarter-sawn heartwood took twice as long to dry as flat-sawn heartwood. Accelerated drying methods increased this difference {{and for this reason}} it is recommended that all material, particularly 50 mm and thicker, be air dried to about 30 % moisture content before <b>kiln</b> <b>drying.</b> Air drying of 25 -mm boards can be achieved in 12 - 20 weeks in Rotorua with final <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> taking 4 - 5 days. Blackwood is a medium density hardwood which has a low shrinkage with only a slight tendency to collapse when dried at elevated temperatures. Prelimin-ary air drying will minimise collapse, making final reconditioning unnecessary. Spring and twist were a problem in the material studied but this could largely be attributed to poor tree form. Warp should be low to minimal in material from silvicultural ^ tended trees...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{aimed to}} analyze the <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> quality of Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus saligna and Eucalyptus dunnii woods with respect to volume loss. Wood from the three species was <b>kiln</b> <b>dried</b> {{together}} with the same drying schedule and conditions in a conventional-temperature pilot kiln. Three kinds of volume loss were evaluated: total - from saturated (initial) to machined (final) condition; shrinkage - from saturated to 10 % moisture content; and machining - from 10 % moisture content to machined condition. Eucalyptus grandis wood was the most dimensionally stable and presented the smallest volume loss due to shrinkage. Although they had different shrinkage behaviors, Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus saligna woods presented the same drying quality regarding machining and total volume losses.

40|$|Sugi round timbers {{injected}} with preservative {{are useful for}} outdoor playing and construction materials. To dry the Sugi round timbers for preservative injection, three drying methods including microwave <b>drying,</b> <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> and air drying were compared in this study. Using microwave drying, the timbers were dried within one day, but the other two drying methods required a much longer time. During most of the microwave drying process, the wood temperature appeared to be higher in the inner layer than in the outer layer. As a result, the inner layer moisture contents were significantly reduced by microwave <b>drying,</b> while <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> produced almost no decline in the inner layer moisture contents. In addition, although significant surface checks often occurred in timbers <b>dried</b> by <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> and air drying, microwave drying caused few surface checks. In contrast, internal checks were only observed in timbers treated by microwave drying. These results suggested that the microwave drying technique can improve the effectiveness of preservative injection in Sugi round timbers...|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in the case}} of {{products}} from Europe, the CFP in the process of transportation accounted for 50 % of the total. Regarding the production stage, the CFP in the processes of lumbering, <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> and finishing accounted for 11, 7 and 3 % of the total, respectively. Energy consumption volumes in the processes of lumbering and finishing of “certified wood in Kyoto Prefecture” and other products were based on Table  4. The differences in energy consumption were attributed to CO 2 emission factor from electricity. It is difficult for lumber mills and local governments to improve this point. Differences in the CFP in the process of <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> were caused by the kind of heat source. A shift from kerosene to woodchips is an improvement that can be made by lumber mills and local governments. In the following chapter, we examine and compare the CFPs in the process of <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> using different heat sources to develop a method for reducing the CFP of “certified wood in Kyoto Prefecture”.|$|R
40|$|After {{experimental}} {{validation of}} a kiln-wide drying model, a single board drying model and a stress model for <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> of softwood timber, these models are integrated {{and used to}} investigate benefits of airflow reversals in smoothing moisture content distribution and in reducing drying stresses for commercial <b>kiln</b> <b>drying.</b> In the current study, a high temperature drying schedule (DB/WB of 120 / 70 °C and air velocity of 5 m/s) was simulated and 5 strategies for airflow reversal were evaluated. These strategies are: airflow reversal every hour; airflow reversal every 2 hours; airflow reversal every 3 hours and airflow reversal after 2 and 10 hours of drying. The results are compared to ‘Control’ in which airflow is unidirectional (no reversal). It has been found that, for the moisture content distribution, the first reversal is critical and frequencies of subsequent flow reversals can be varied depending on the drying temperature used.
