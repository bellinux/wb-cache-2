40|$|ABSTRACT To {{estimate}} the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of red cabbage sprouts (stored at 4 and 10 °C), {{the numbers of}} total aerobic bacteria were determined during storage. Parameters for the Gompertz model were determined and the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> was predicted using a modified Gompertz equation. The estimated shelf lives of red cabbage sprouts packed with polyolefin film and polyamide/polyamide/polyethylene (PA/PA/PE) film at 4 °C were 49. 4 and 52. 3 h, respectively, whereas those of red cabbage sprouts packed with polyolefin film and PA/PA/PE film at 10 °C were 19. 7 and 22. 6, respectively. The <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> prediction equation was appropriate, based on the statistical analysis of the accuracy factor, bias factor, and mean square error. On the other hand, for red cabbage sprouts treated with aqueous ClO 2 /fumaric acid and UV-C then packed with polyolefin film or PA/PA/PE <b>film,</b> the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> was predicted to be longer than 168 h.

40|$|The wider {{utilization}} of Indian jujube (Zizyphus maurtiana) is hindered by the rapid {{deterioration of the}} fresh fruits and results in the striking decline in quality. Aloe vera gel which {{has been known for}} its therapeutic, antibacterial and antifungal properties is used as an edible coating to prolong the storage life of tropical and sub tropical fruits, which would be an innovative and interesting means for commercial application as a means of preservation. An attempt has been made to optimize the post harvest dip treatment for <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> extension and maintaining physico chemical and organo leptic characteristics of Jujube. Aloe vera gel of 1 : 3 ratios with a dipping period of 5 minutes effectively inhibited the undesirable physicochemical and physiological changes during storage of Jujube packaged in LDPE <b>film,</b> extending its <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> to 45 days under refrigerated temperature conditions of 5 ± 2 ℃ while the control fruits were tend to lose its physical and chemical characteristics after 21 days. Interestingly, this edible coating along with surface cleaning of fruit with potassium Meta bisulphate was able to reduce the initial microbial counts for both bacteria and fungi, which significantly increased the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of edible coated jujube fruits to 45 days over storage.

40|$|The <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of a {{fresh meat}} product can be {{measured}} by a total bacterial enumeration method, which is time-consuming, expensive, and destructive to conduct. Due to these issues, there is interest in developing a <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> model from an instrument measurement, which has the capability to be less time-consuming, less expensive, and non-destructive. One instrument measurement {{that could be used}} to estimate <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> is dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2). There are few studies published that investigate dissolved CO 2 concentrations in the context of <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> or its relationship to the microbial population. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the dissolved CO 2 and O 2 concentrations in the purge of vacuum-packaged pork chops during storage, and to determine the relationship between dissolved CO 2 and O 2 concentrations to the microbial populations and <b>shelf</b> <b>life.</b> Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were also taken of the packaging film in contact with the meat product to investigate how the biofilm develops on the packaging <b>film</b> throughout the <b>shelf</b> <b>life.</b> These objectives were completed by taking sixty pork loin chops and placing them into twenty vacuum-packages. In each vacuum-package, a set of purge collection tubes were placed into each bag to collect the purge for the dissolved gas measurements. These packages were stored at 4 °C for 60 days, and the packages were sampled randomly on days 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60. On the sample days, the dissolved gases were measured and microbiological analysis conducted. The results of the experiment demonstrated that the spoilage bacteria increased the dissolved CO 2 and decreased the dissolved O 2 concentrations during the 60 day storage period by cellular respiration. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) dominated the spoilage microflora, followed by Enterobacteriaceae and Brochothrix thermosphacta. Since the dissolved CO 2 concentrations increased due to the increase in microbial populations, this information was used to develop mathematical models. These mathematical models estimate microbial populations and <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> based upon dissolved CO 2 concentrations in the purge of vacuum-packaged pork chops. The SEM images revealed a two-layer biofilm on the packaging film that was the result of a tri-phase growth environment...|$|R

O experimento foi conduzido no laboratório de Pós-colheita da Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido (UFERSA). Utilizou-se um esquema fatorial 3 x 6 com 3 repetições de três frutos por parcela, constituindo na combinação de 3 tipos de atmosferas (cera, filme de polietileno e controle) com 6 tempos de armazenamento (0; 7; 14; 21; 28; 35). Os frutos dos distintos tratamentos foram armazenados em câmaras frias a 10 ± 2 ºC e UR 90 ± 5 %, analisados em intervalos de sete dias. As características avaliadas foram: aparência externa, perda de massa, firmeza da polpa, sólidos solúveis, acidez titulável e vitamina C. Constatou-se ser o filme plástico o mais eficiente em manter a qualidade externa e reduzir a perda de massa dos frutos. A cera de carnaúba, na concentração utilizada, mostrou eficiência relativa na conservação de mamão quando comparada ao filme plástico.

This experiment produced active packaging of antimicrobial (AM) film in which an antimicrobial (AM) agent was added into the film (instead of food) and then used it to coat the food product. The AM agents slowly release into the product surrounds, inhibit the growth of microbes thus packing and preserving were done in a single step. Carragenan was chosen as a matrix film with garlic extract as an AM agent. Fish balls were chosen as a product to be coated by this AM film.

40|$|The {{advantage}} of being “First to Market” is tremendous, but keeping a high and consistent level of quality is determinant as well {{for the success of}} a food company. Low quality products cause damage to the brand and monetary loses in the long run. Quality is strongly influenced by a correct estimation of <b>shelf</b> <b>life,</b> but full length <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> tests demands large inputs of time and money. The need for a more efficient method of estimating <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> is therefore required, and the use of accelerated storage tests has gained in popularity in recent years. “Accelerated <b>Shelf</b> <b>Life</b> Tests” is by definition a method that allows the estimation of <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> through short term storage tests. This is done by converting the accelerated storage results mathematically to represent normal storage conditions, often using different kinetic models. This project intends to evaluate the potential of using accelerated <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> as a method for <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> estimation for wet sauces. Two sauces was evaluated in this study; Pizza topping and Taco sauce with previously known <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of nine months and 18 months respectively. The <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> was estimated by exposing the samples to high temperatures and light during a time period of eight weeks in Climate Chambers (Sanyo Gallenkamp Prime Incubator, INC- 000 - MA 1. 9). The light source was a LED lamp that emitted light around 680 to 770 lux and the samples was stored at 22 ° C, 30 ° C and 40 ° C. The samples were then evaluated by sensory analysis and by measuring pigment degradation. The result showed some inconsistencies with the theoretical aspects of the study. The Pizza topping was estimated to have a <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of eight months, and the Taco sauce was predicted to maintain quality for about 17 months. These values correspond well to the current estimated <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> used. However, the results yielded different estimations depending on how the results were calculated. Q 10 – modelling, a method that deduces a conversion factor that allows for direct translation of accelerated storage test results into normal storage condition yielded considerably shorter estimated <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> values while the use of the Arrhenius equation seemed to results in more realistic values. In addition, the colour analysis resulted in different results when compared to the sensory analysis. The recommendation is that accelerated <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> tests have {{the potential to be a}} valuable tool when predicting product <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> in a fast-paced innovation environment. However, due to the inconsistencies of the results it is recommended to perform further investigations before adopting accelerated <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> tests as a standard method for <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> estimation...|$|R

Appearance, texture, flavor and overall quality of cakes stored at six different storage times were evaluated by 102 consumers. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance and linear regression. For both flavors, the texture presented a greater loss in acceptance during the storage period, showing an acceptance mean close to indifference on the hedonic scale at 120 days. Nevertheless, appearance, flavor and overall quality stayed acceptable up to 150 days. The end of <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> was estimated at about 161 days for chocolate cakes and 150 days for carrot cakes. This study showed that the current 120 days of <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> can be extended to 150 days for carrot cake and to 160 days for chocolate cake. However, the 180 days of <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> desired by the company were not achieved. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This research shows the adequacy of using sensory acceptance tests to determine the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of two food products (chocolate and carrot cupcakes). This practical application is useful because the precise determination of the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of a food product is of vital importance for its commercial success.

40|$|Introduction Reusable {{medical devices}} are sterilized and stored before {{their use in}} {{hospital}} settings. The length of time the sterilized item can be stored (<b>shelf</b> <b>life)</b> to maintain sterility has been discussed in the literature {{over the last four}} decades, with a shift to an event rather than time-related determination of <b>shelf</b> <b>life.</b> This paper reviews the evidence and provides a summary of some key issues for consideration when adopting event-related or time-based <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> recommendations for packaged sterile items in Australian hospitals. Discussion Australian and international standards provide guidelines for procedures to be used for sterilization of reusable medical devices and storage conditions following sterilization. Reusable medical devices are sterilized by commercial manufacturers or sterilizing departments located in hospitals. Commercial manufacturers allocate expiry dates on sterilized items which should be respected, unless sterility is compromised by an event. The <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of items sterilized in hospital is debated, with growing support for event-rather than time-related sterility. Many factors determine whether event-or time-related <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> should be followed. Well designed experimental studies into <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of sterilized items are lacking, with some small studies indicating that items can remain sterile for 12 to 24 months. Factors for consideration by hospitals are outlined and an algorithm to assist in implementation of event-related or time-based <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> for reprocessed reusable medical devices is provided. Conclusion The method of determining <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> in hospitals is dependent on adequacy of processes for sterilization, monitoring of sterility over time and storage conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to determine the}} <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> end-point of various food items by means of actual measurement or mathematical projection. The primary goal of the Advanced Food Technology Project in these long duration exploratory missions is to provide the crew with a palatable, nutritious and safe food system while minimizing volume, mass, and waste. The Mars missions could be as long as 2. 5 years with the potential of the food being positioned prior to the crew arrival. Therefore, it is anticipated that foods that are used during the Mars missions will require a 5 year <b>shelf</b> <b>life.</b> <b>Shelf</b> <b>life</b> criteria are safety, nutrition, and acceptability. Any of these criteria can be the limiting factor in determining the food's <b>shelf</b> <b>life.</b> Due to the heat sterilization process used for the thermostabilized food items, safety will be preserved as long as the integrity of the package is maintained. Nutrition and acceptability will change over time. Since the food can be the sole source of nutrition to the crew, a significant loss in nutrition may determine when the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> endpoint has occurred. <b>Shelf</b> <b>life</b> can be defined when the food item is no longer acceptable. Acceptability can be defined in terms of appearance, flavor, texture, or aroma. Results from <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> studies of the thermostabilized food items suggest that the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of the foods range from 0 months to 8 years, depending on formulation...|$|R

Every product has definite <b>shelf</b> <b>life,</b> which depends on various physical, chemical, environmental, and biological factors. Ancient seers have clarified <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of various compound formulations. However, {{there is a need}} to revalidate and ascertain the <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of individual formulations by following parameters prevalent in respective scenario. Aim: To evaluate <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of Shirishavaleha prepared in the presence of water (SW) and Kanji (SK) as liquid media through accelerated stability study. Subjects and Methods: Physicochemical parameters were measured at 40 °C ± 2 °C temperature and 75 % ± 5 % relative humidity. Analysis was repeated at intervals of 1, 3, and 6 months, and average 10 % degradation of both the test drug samples was calculated and extrapolated to find the <b>shelf</b> <b>life.</b> Results: The sample prepared in the presence of Kanji (SK) showed more extractive values and sugar contents and found to have longer <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> (2. 6 years) than SW (1. 4 years).

40|$|The <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of {{pasteurized milk}} is {{traditionally}} {{estimated by the}} counts of both total and psychrotrophic microbial load. However, the values reported to date for both microbial populations {{at the end of}} the sensory <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of milk vary, and are not consistent. The present study examined the relation between the total and psychrotophic microbial growth in milk and its sensory <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> as measured using the Weibull hazard method. Milk was stored at 5 constant temperatures (2, 5, 7, 12, and 15 C) and both total and psychrotrophic microbial counts were used to obtain the lag time and the growth rate values. The lag time of the total and psychrotrophic growth responded to temperature following the Arrhenius equation. The loss of sensory quality of the milk followed a log <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> vs. temperature dependency. It was found that there was no correlation between the microbial count at the end of <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> and the sensory quality of the milk. It is therefore suggested that microbial counts should not be used to determine the sensory <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> of milk. The Weibull method gave end of <b>shelf</b> <b>life</b> values fairly similar to that of prior work using the ADSA scoring method. (milk, shelf-life, weibull-hazard) ...|$|R
