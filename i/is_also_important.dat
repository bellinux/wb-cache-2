5|$|If an anaphylactoid {{reaction}} occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or {{slowed and}} antihistamines and other supportive care is administered. For example, a nebulised beta-agonist like salbutamol may be {{indicated in the}} event of significant bronchospasm (or prophylactically in patients with a history of bronchospasm secondary to acetylcysteine). It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, this {{metabolic}} pathway {{is important in}} beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in the metabolic responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness.|$|E

5|$|Manganese <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in {{photosynthetic}} oxygen {{evolution in}} chloroplasts in plants. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) {{is a part}} of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis, and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese. To fulfill this requirement, most broad-spectrum plant fertilizers contain manganese.|$|E
5|$|The {{area near}} the volcano has been {{inhabited}} for centuries by Hawaiian natives, dating back to before recorded history. The coast west of Hualālai in particular had several royal complexes. The volcano <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> ecologically, is home to many rare species and several nature reserves near the summit, and is a popular hiking attraction. Today the coast near Hualālai is dotted by vacation resorts, some built on historic flows, and a National Historical Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} {{a set of}} binoculars. While it is {{generally}} ignored during infantry-limited gameplay, {{it is vital to}} the long-range use of the Crusader tanks and one of the missions in which the player must direct artillery fire to defend a town. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> for scouting, though most of the game takes place in personal, close combat situations reducing the importance of this tactic.|$|E

5|$|The {{river is}} {{important}} for its dragonfly communities, with a strong population of Scarce Chaser (found in only six other areas in England), together with a strong population of White-legged Damselfly. Red-eyed Damselfly is also found. The river <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> for aquatic plants, including Loddon Pondweed.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} suicide <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> {{in several of}} his earlier films. He shows how the desire to self-harm is often counteracted by {{humanity}} {{and the need to}} help others in the face of death. This illustrates the ongoing life force and the power of life over death.|$|E
5|$|Tourism <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> to {{the local}} economy. In 2011, {{domestic}} and overseas visitors made more than 5.6 million trips to the town and spent over £460 million between them. The equivalent of 8,531 full-time jobs exist as a result which accounts for 15% of all employment in the town. Bournemouth seafront {{is one of the}} UK's biggest attractions with 4.5 million visitors in 2011. RNLI lifeguards provide seasonal coverage of Bournemouth's beaches.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{the absence}} of crystal flaws is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} quality of a diamond. Purity and high crystalline perfection make diamonds transparent and clear, whereas its hardness, optical dispersion (luster) and chemical stability (combined with marketing), make it a popular gemstone. High thermal conductivity <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> for technical applications. Whereas high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties vary depending on how the diamond was created.|$|E
5|$|Voiced {{calls or}} shouts called kakegoe and kiai are also common in taiko performance. They {{are used as}} {{encouragement}} to other players or cues for transition or change in dynamics such as an increase in tempo. In contrast, the philosophical concept of ma, which superficially describes the space between drum strikes, <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in shaping rhythmic phrases and creating appropriate contrast.|$|E
5|$|Examples of biologically {{important}} {{fatty acids}} include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in biological systems, particularly {{with respect to}} sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E

5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> {{to some of the}} local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E
5|$|Gaze {{becomes more}} complex {{with age and}} practice. As gaze {{increases}} in complexity, individuals {{are better able to}} discriminate what others are referring to. Joint attention <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E
5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth. The field of geology encompasses {{the study of the}} composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic discipline, and <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E

5|$|Miking a Leslie <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in a {{recording}} studio, as the choice and positioning of microphones determines the overall recorded sound. A popular recommendation is two Shure SM57s {{on the horn}} and a Sennheiser MD421 on the drum. Recording Magazine's Dave Martin suggests a similar setup, with various microphone models used as stereo pairs on the horn but using an Electro-Voice RE20 on the drum instead. Keith Emerson recorded his Leslie using a single mic each on the horn and the drum, but with the covers removed.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair as it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in Islam to have clear {{differences}} (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage {{women to have}} long hair and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although {{this would be a}} direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E
