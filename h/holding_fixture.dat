The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E

The experiment consisted of placing a heated aluminum billet (to represent heat-generating nuclear material) inside curved- and flat-bottom canisters with and without <b>holding</b> plate <b>fixtures</b> and/or extended fin surfaces. Surface temperatures were measured at several locations on the aluminum billet, inner and outer canisters, and the <b>holding</b> plate <b>fixture</b> to assess the effectiveness of the various configurations in removing and distributing the heat from the aluminum billet. Results indicated that the curved-bottom canisters, with or without <b>holding</b> <b>fixtures,</b> were extremely ineffective in extracting heat from the aluminum billet. The larger thermal contact area provided by the flat-bottom canisters compared with the curved-bottom design, greatly enhanced the heat removal process and lowered the temperature of the aluminum billet considerably. The addition of the fixture plates to the flat-bottom canister geometry greatly enhances the heat removal rates and lowers the canister operating temperatures considerably. The addition of the fixture plates to the flat-bottom canister geometry greatly enhances the heat removal rates and lowers the canister operating temperatures considerably. Finally, the addition of extended fin surfaces to the outer flat-bottom canister positioned on a fixture plate, reduced the canister temperatures still further...|$|R
50|$|Before {{the winding}} starts, the Toroidal / Magnetic core is mounted into a <b>holding</b> <b>fixture</b> that can {{initiate}} a slow rotary {{movement of the}} core with mostly three rubberized points of contact. A wire storage ring (orbital wheel) arranged 90Â° to the toroidal core will now be opened at the circumference and introduced {{into the center of}} the toroidal core. The wire is then coiled around the wire storage ring that was closed again. When the required amount is present on the wire accumulator, the end of the wire from the wire accumulator is fixed to the toroidal core that needs to be wound. By simultaneous rotation of the toroidal core and the wire accumulator ring, a winding develops that is distributed along the circumference of the toroidal core. Upon completion, the wire accumulator has to be opened again in order to be able to remove the ready wound toroidal core. Since the start and end wire are often not fixable to the toroidal core, toroidal winding machines can only be partly automated.|$|E
50|$|A radius grinder (or {{radius tool}} grinder) {{is a special}} grinder used for {{grinding}} the most complex tool forms, and is the historical predecessor to the CNC tool and cutter grinder. Like the CNC grinder, it {{may be used for}} other tasks where grinding spherical surfaces is necessary. The tool itself consists of three parts: The grinder head, work table, and <b>holding</b> <b>fixture.</b> The grinder head has three degrees of freedom. Vertical movement, movement into the workpeice, and tilt. These are generally set statically, and left fixed throughout operations. The work table is a T-slotted X-axis table mounted on top of a radial fixture. Mounting the X axis on top of the radius table, as opposed to the other way around, allows for complex and accurate radius grinds. The holding fixtures can be anything one can mount on a slotted table, but most commonly used is a collet or chuck fixture that indexes and has a separate Y movement to allow accurate depth setting and endmill sharpening. The dressers used on these grinders are usually quite expensive, and can dress the grinding wheel itself with a particular radius.|$|E
5000|$|The X-31 {{design was}} {{essentially}} an all-new airframe design, although it borrowed heavily on design elements and sometimes actual parts of previous production, prototype, and conceptual aircraft designs, including the British Aerospace Experimental Airplane Programme (choice of wing type with canards, plus underfuselage intake), the German TKF-90 (wing planform concepts and underfuselage intake), F/A-18 Hornet (forebody, including cockpit, ejection seat, and canopy; electrical generators), F-16 Fighting Falcon (landing gear, fuel pump, rudder pedals, nosewheel tires, and emergency power unit), F-16XL (leading-edge flap drives), V-22 Osprey (control surface actuators), Cessna Citation (main landing gear's wheels and brakes), F-20 Tigershark (hydrazine emergency air-start system, later replaced) and B-1 Lancer (spindles from its control vanes {{used for the}} canards). This was done on purpose, so that development time and risk would be reduced by using flight-qualified components. To {{reduce the cost of}} tooling for a production run of only two aircraft, Rockwell developed the [...] "fly-away tooling" [...] concept (perhaps the most successful spinoff of the program), whereby 15 fuselage frames were manufactured via CNC, tied together with a <b>holding</b> <b>fixture,</b> and attached to the factory floor with survey equipment.

In spacecraft applications, the microgravity environment precludes {{the use of}} gravitational forces to retain the tools in <b>holding</b> <b>fixture.</b> As a result of this, a retention mechanism which forms a part of the tool storage container is required. A unique approach to this problem has resulted in the development of an end effector exchange mechanism that meets the requirements for spaceflight applications while avoiding the complexity usually involved. This mechanism uses multiple latching cams both on the manipulator and in the tool storage container, combined with a system of catch rings to provide retention in both locations and the required failure tolerance. Because of the cam configuration the mechanism operates passively, requiring no electrical commands except those needed to move the manipulator into position. Similarly, it inherently provides interlocks to prevent the release of one cam before its opposite number is engaged...|$|E
40|$|A phenomenological {{model of}} the bulk force exerted by a lithium ion cell during various charge, discharge, and {{temperature}} operating conditions is developed. The measured and modeled force resembles the carbon expansion behavior associated with the phase changes during intercalation, as there are ranges of state of charge (SOC) with a gradual force increase and ranges of SOC with very small change in force. The model includes the influence of temperature on the observed force capturing the underlying thermal expansion phenomena. Moreover the model is capable of describing the changes in force during thermal transients, when internal battery heating due to high C-rates or rapid changes in the ambient temperature, which create a mismatch in {{the temperature of the}} cell and the <b>holding</b> <b>fixture.</b> It is finally shown that the bulk force model can be very useful for a more accurate and robust SOC estimation based on fusing information from voltage and force (or pressure) measurements.

40|$|Spray forming is an {{effective}} way to process many tool steels into near-net-shape molds, dies and related tooling. The general approach involves depositing atomized droplets onto a refractory pattern in order to image the patternâs features. The pattern is removed and the die is fitted into a standard <b>holding</b> <b>fixture.</b> This approach results in significant cost and lead-time savings compared to conventional machining, Spray-formed dies perform well in many industrial forming operations, oftentimes exhibiting extended die life over conventional dies. Care must be exercised when spray forming tool steel dies to minimize porosity and control the nature and distribution of phases and residual stresses. Selection of post-deposition heat treatment is important to tailor the dieâs properties (hardness, strength, impact energy, etc.) for a particular application.
