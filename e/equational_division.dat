5000|$|Meiotic {{chromosomal}} crossover (CO) recombination {{facilitates the}} proper segregation of homologous chromosomes. This is because, {{at the end}} of meiotic prophase I, CO recombination provides a physical link that holds homologous chromosome pairs together. These linkages are established by chiasmata, which are the cytological manifestations of CO recombination. Together with cohesion linkage between sister chromatids, CO recombination may help ensure the orderly segregation of the paired homologous chromosomes to opposite poles. In support of this, a study of aneuploidy in single spermatozoa by whole genome sequencing found that, on average, human sperm cells with aneuploid autosomes exhibit significantly fewer crossovers than normal cells. [...] After the first chromosome segregation in meiosis I is complete, there is further chromosome segregation during the second <b>equational</b> <b>division</b> of meiosis II. Both proper initial segregation of chromosomes in prophase I and the next chromosome segregation during <b>equational</b> <b>division</b> in meiosis II are required to generate gametes with the correct number of chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Meiosis I segregates {{homologous}} chromosomes, {{which are}} joined as tetrads (2n, 4c), producing two haploid cells (n chromosomes, 23 in humans) which each contain chromatid pairs (1n, 2c). Because the ploidy is reduced from diploid to haploid, meiosis I {{is referred to}} as a reductional division. Meiosis II is an <b>equational</b> <b>division</b> analogous to mitosis, in which the sister chromatids are segregated, creating four haploid daughter cells (1n, 1c).|$|E
40|$|Most daphnid species adopt {{parthenogenesis}} {{and sexual}} reproduction differentially {{in response to}} varied environmental cues, resulting {{in the production of}} diploid progenies in both cases. Previous studies have reportedly suggested that daphnids produce their parthenogenetic eggs via apomixis; the nuclear division of mature oocytes should be an <b>equational</b> <b>division</b> similar to somatic mitosis. However, it seems premature to conclude that this has been unequivocally established in any daphnids. Therefore, the objective of our research was to precisely reveal the process and mechanism of parthenogenetic oogenesis and maintenance of diploidy in Daphnia pulex through histology, karyology and immunohistochemistry. We found that when a parthenogenetic egg entered the first meiosis, division was arrested in the early first anaphase. Then, two half-bivalents, which were dismembered from each bivalent, move...|$|E
40|$|Certain of {{the colonies}} that arise when spores from a mixed culture of two {{complementary}} auxotrophic strains of Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2) are plated on a selective medium {{give rise to}} a mixture of spores with parental and recombinant genotypes. These heterogeneous colonies (heteroclones) probably develop from spores containing heterozygous nuclei which segregate during the development of the colonies. The hetero-zygous nuclei probably undergo a number of <b>equational</b> <b>divisions</b> before segregating. The markers in two linkage groups segregate independently. Large imbalances in the allele ratios and in the frequencies of complemen-tary genotypes have been attributed to terminal chromosome deletions which affect both chromosome pairs. Absence (or homozygosity of the markers) of one whole chromosome is observed very often in heteroclones selected on media which make one chromosome dispensable. The hetero-clones provide an efficient system for studying the genetics of the organism without recourse to selective methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Previous {{efforts have}} shown that {{mutations}} in the Drosophila zwlO gene cause massive chromosome missegregation during mitotic divisions in several tissues. Here we demonstrate that mutations in zwlO also disrupt chromosome behavior in male meiosis I and meiosis II, indicating that ZW 10 function is common to both <b>equational</b> and reductional <b>divisions.</b> Divisions are apparently normal before anaphase onset, but ZW 10 mutants exhibit lagging chromosomes and irregular chromosome segregation at anaphase. Chromosome missegregation during meiosis I of these mutants is not caused by precocious separation of sister chromatids, but rather the nondisjunction of homologs.

40|$|We have {{utilized}} the single <b>equational</b> meiotic <b>division</b> conferred by the spo 13 - 1 mutation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. Klapholtz and R. E. Esposito, Genetics 96 : 589 - 611, 1980) as {{a technique to}} study the genetic control of meiotic recombination and to analyze the meiotic effects of several radiation-sensitive mutations (rad 6 - 1, rad 50 - 1, and rad 52 - 1) which {{have been reported to}} reduce meiotic recombination (Game et al., Genetics 94 : 51 - 68, 1980); Prakash et al., Genetics 94 : 31 - 50, 1980). The spo 13 - 1 mutation eliminates the meiosis I reductional segregation, but does not significantly affect other meiotic events (including recombination). Because of the unique meiosis it confers, the spo 13 - 1 mutation provides an opportunity to recover viable meiotic products in a Rec- background. In contrast to the single rad 50 - 1 mutant, we found that the double rad 50 - 1 spo 13 - 1 mutant produced viable ascospores after meiosis and sporulation. These spores were nonrecombinant: meiotic crossing-over was reduced at least 150 -fold, and no increase in meiotic gene conversion was observed over mitotic background levels. The rad 50 - 1 mutation did not, however, confer a Rec- phenotype in mitosis; rather, it increased both spontaneous crossing-over and gene conversion. The spore inviability conferred by the single rad 6 - 1 and rad 52 - 1 mutations was not eliminated by the presence of the spo 13 - 1 mutation. Thus, only the rad 50 gene has been unambiguously identified by analysis of viable meiotic ascospores as a component of the meiotic recombination system...|$|R
40|$|Persistent lethal sectoring in a {{homothallic}} {{strain of}} yeast has been ascribed to tetrasomy for chromosome I. Such aneuploids can appear many generations after irradiation. The data thus indicate that an induced predisposition towards aneuploidy can be prolonged through successive post-irradiation cell divisions. Sporadic cell death in tetrasomics for chromosome I {{was found to}} result from a metabolic imbalance and not from a genetic instability conseqent to aneuploidy. This imbalance {{may be due to}} a dosage effect involving cistrons for ribosomal RNA since many of these are known to be located on chromosome I. Tetrasomy is not the only cause of persistent lethal sectoring; the phenomenon has been initiated through genetic recombination involving normal diploids. It has also been concluded that, in trisomics, <b>equational</b> <b>division</b> of the supernumerary chromosome sometimes occurs at the first meiotic division...|$|E
40|$|Meiosis is a {{specialized}} cell division in sexually reproducing organisms before gamete formation. Following DNA replication, the canonical sequence in species with monocentric chromosomes {{is characterized by}} reductional segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first and equational segregation of sister chromatids during the second meiotic division. Species with holocentric chromosomes employ specific adaptations to ensure regular disjunction during meiosis. Here we present the analysis of two closely related plant species with holocentric chromosomes that display an inversion of the canonical meiotic sequence, with the <b>equational</b> <b>division</b> preceding the reductional. In-depth analysis of the meiotic divisions of Rhynchospora pubera and R. tenuis reveals that during meiosis I sister chromatids are bi-oriented, display amphitelic attachment to the spindle and are subsequently separated. During prophase II, chromatids are connected by thin chromatin threads that appear instrumental for the regular disjunction of homologous non-sister chromatids in meiosis II...|$|E

40|$|Haploid yeast cells {{normally}} contain {{either the}} MATa or MATα mating-type allele and cannot undergo meiosis and spore formation. If both mating-type alleles are present {{as a consequence}} of chromosome III disomy (MATa/MATα), haploids initiate meiosis but do not successfully form spores, probably because the haploid chromosome complement is irregularly partitioned during meiotic nuclear division. We have demonstrated that the ochre-suppressible mutation spo 13 - 1 enables haploid yeast cells disomic for chromosome III and heterozygous at the mating-type locus to complete meiosis and spore formation, yielding two haploid spores. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} absence of the wild-type SPO 13 gene function permits diploid cells to bypass homologous chromosome segregation at meiosis I and proceed directly to meiosis II. During spo 13 - 1 haploid meiosis, cells enter prophase of meiosis I. Genetic recombination, monitored on the chromosome III disome, occurs at levels similar to those seen in diploids, indicating that the level of exchange between homologs is an autonomous property of individual chromosomes and not dependent on exchange elsewhere in the genome. Exchange is then followed by a single meiosis II <b>equational</b> chromosome <b>division.</b> Recombination in spo 13 - 1 haploids is blocked by the spo 11 - 1 mutation, which also eliminates recombination between homologous chromosomes during conventional diploid meiosis. We conclude that Spo+ haploids expressing both a and α mating-type information attempt a SPO 13 -dependent meiosis I division, and that this division, in the absence of paired homologous chromosomes, is responsible for the failure of such haploids to complete normal gametogenesis. Our observations support the conclusion that initiation and completion of meiosis II and spore formation are not dependent on either completion of meiosis I or the presence of a diploid chromosome complement...|$|R

ZW 10 is first visible during prometaphase, where it localizes to the kinetochores of the bivalent chromosomes (during meiosis I) or to the sister kinetochores of dyads (during meiosis II). During metaphase of both divisions, ZW 10 appears {{to move from the}} kinetochores and to spread toward the poles along what appear to be kinetochore microtubules. Redistributions of ZW 10 at metaphase require bipolar attachments of individual chromosomes or paired bivalents to the spindle. At the onset of anaphase I or anaphase II, ZW 10 rapidly relocalizes to the kinetochore regions of the separating chromosomes, In other mutant backgrounds in which chromosomes lag during anaphase, {{the presence or absence of}} ZW 10 at a particular kinetochore predicts whether or not the chromosome moves appropriately to the spindle poles. We propose that ZW 10 acts as part of, or immediately downstream of, a tension-sensing mechanism that regulates chromosome separation or movement at anaphase onset...|$|R
40|$|Vertically {{transmitted}} endosymbiotic bacteria, such as Wolbachia, Cardinium and Rickettsia, modify host reproduction {{in several}} ways to facilitate their own spread. One such modification results in parthenogenesis induction, where males, which are unable to transmit the bacteria, are not produced. In Hymenoptera, the mechanism of diploidization due to Wolbachia infection, known as gamete duplication, is a post-meiotic modification. During gamete duplication, the meiotic mechanism is normal, but in the first mitosis the anaphase is aborted. The two haploid sets of chromosomes do not separate and thus result in a single nucleus containing two identical sets of haploid chromosomes. Here, we outline an alternative cytogenetic mechanism for bacterial endosymbiont-induced parthenogenesis in Hymenoptera. During female gamete formation in Rickettsia-infected Neochrysocharis formosa (Westwood) parasitoids, meiotic cells undergo only a single <b>equational</b> <b>division</b> followed by the expulsion of a single polar body. This absence of meiotic recombination and reduction corresponds well with a non-segregation pattern in the offspring of heterozygous females. We conclude that diploidy in N. formosa is maintained through a functionally apomictic cloning mechanism that differs entirely from the mechanism induced by Wolbachia...|$|E
40|$|In Hymenoptera, {{complete}} parthenogenesis, that is thelytoky, is {{a common}} phenomenon where virgin females produce only daughters. Thelytoky is often induced by bacteria of the genus Wolbachia, but can also be genetically determined by the insect itself, as in the genus Trichogramma where both forms exist. In order to compare these two forms of thelytoky, chromosome behaviour analysis in young eggs and genetic analysis of microsatellite markers were {{carried out in the}} wasp Trichogramma cacoeciae, where thelytoky is genetically determined. Microscopic studies revealed that during female gamete formation meiotic cells undergo only a single <b>equational</b> <b>division</b> followed by the expulsion of a single polar body. This absence of meiotic recombination and reduction corresponds well with the high levels of heterozygosity observed in females collected from the field and a nonsegregation pattern in the offspring of heterozygous females. We therefore concluded that diploidy in T. cacoeciae is maintained through an apomictic cloning mechanism and that the incidence of thelytoky under genetic control of the wasp differs entirely from the mechanism induced by Wolbachia infection, where thelytoky is restored through gamete duplication...|$|E
40|$|Several {{complementary}} experimental approaches {{were used}} {{to demonstrate that the}} SPO 11 gene is specifically required for meiotic recombination. First, sporulating cultures of spo 11 - 1 mutant diploids were examined for landmark biochemical, cytological and genetic events of meiosis and ascosporogenesis. Cells entered sporulation with high efficiency and showed a near-doubling of DNA content. Synaptonemal complexes, hallmarks of intimate homologous pairing, and polycomplex structures appeared during meiotic prophase. Although spontaneous mitotic intra- and intergenic recombination occurred at normal levels, no meiotic recombination was observed. Whereas greater than 50 % of cells completed both meiotic divisions, packaging of the four meiotic products into mature ascospores took place in only a small subset of asci. Haploidization occurred in less than 1 % of viable colony-forming units. Second, the Rec- meiotic defect conferred by spo 11 - 1 was confirmed by dyad analysis of spores derived from spo 13 - 1 single-division meiosis in which recombination is not a requirement for viable ascospore production. Diploids homozygous for the spo 13 - 1 mutation undergo meiotic levels of exchange followed by a single predominantly <b>equational</b> <b>division</b> and form asci containing two near-diploid spores. With the introduction of the spo 11 - 1 mutation, high spore viability was retained, whereas intergenic recombination was reduced by more than 100 -fold...|$|E
40|$|A {{screen was}} {{designed}} to identify Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that were defective in meiosis yet proficient for meiotic ectopic recombination in the return-to-growth protocol. Seven mutants alleles were isolated; two are important for chromosome synapsis (RED 1, MEK 1) and five function independently of recombination (SPO 14, GSG 1, SPOT 8 /MUM 2, 3, 4). Similar to the spoT 8 - 1 mutant, mum 2 deletion strains do not undergo premeiotic DNA synthesis, arrest prior to the first meiotic division and fail to sporulate. Surprisingly, although DNA replication does not occur, mum 2 mutants are induced for high levels of ectopic recombination. gsg 1 diploids are reduced {{in their ability to}} complete premeiotic DNA synthesis and the meiotic divisions, and a small percentage of cells produce spores. mum 3 mutants sporulate poorly and the spores produced are inviable. Finally, mum 4 - 1 mutants produce inviable spores. The meiotic/sporulation defects of gsg 1, mum 2, and mum 3 are not relieved by spo 11 or spo 13 mutations, indicating that the mutant defects are not dependent on the initiation of recombination or completion of both meiotic divisions. In contrast, the spore inviability of the mum 4 - 1 mutant is rescued by the spo 13 mutation. The mum 4 - 1 spo 13 mutant undergoes a single, predominantly <b>equational</b> <b>division,</b> suggesting that MUM 4 functions at or prior to the first meiotic division. Although recombination is variably affected in the gsg 1 and mum mutants, we hypothesize that these mutants define genes important for aspects of meiosis not directly related to recombination...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{life cycle}} of most {{eukaryotic}} organisms includes a meiotic phase, in which diploid parental cells produce haploid gametes. During meiosis a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation. In the first, or reductional, division (meiosis I), which is unique to meiotic cells, homologous chromosomes segregate from one another, whereas in the second, or <b>equational,</b> <b>division</b> (Meiosis II) sister centromeres disjoin. Meiotic DNA replication precedes the initiation of recombination by programmed Spo 11 -dependent DNA double-strand breaks. Recent reports that meiosis-specific cohesion is established during meiotic S phase and that the length of S phase is modified by recombination factors (Spo 11 and Rec 8) raise the possibility that replication plays {{a fundamental role in}} the recombination process. Results: To address how replication influences the initiation of recombination, we have used mutations in the B-type cyclin genes CLB 5 and CLB 6, which specifically prevent premeiotic replication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that clb 5 and clb 5 clb 6 but not clb 6 mutants are defective in DSB induction and prior associated changes in chromatin accessibility, heteroallelic recombination, and SC formation. The severity of these phenotypes in each mutant reflects the extent of replication impairment. Conclusions: This assemblage of phenotypes reveals roles for CLB 5 and CLB 6 not only in DNA replication but also in other key events of meiotic prophase. Links between the function of CLB 5 and CLB 6 in activating meiotic DNA replication and their effects on subsequent events are discussed...|$|E
40|$|During mitosis, sister kinetochores {{attach to}} microtubules that extend to {{opposite}} spindle poles (bipolar attachment) {{and pull the}} chromatids apart at anaphase (equational segregation). A multisubunit complex called cohesin, including Rad 21 /Scc 1, {{plays a crucial role}} in sister chromatid cohesion and equational segregation at mitosis. Meiosis I differs from mitosis in having a reductional pattern of chromosome segregation, in which sister kinetochores are attached to the same spindle (monopolar attachment). During meiosis, Rad 21 /Scc 1 is largely replaced by its meiotic counterpart, Rec 8. If Rec 8 is inactivated in fission yeast, meiosis I is shifted from reductional to <b>equational</b> <b>division.</b> However, the reason rec 8 Δ cells undergo equational rather than random division has not been clarified; therefore, it has been unclear whether equational segregation is due to a loss of cohesin in general or to a loss of a specific requirement for Rec 8. We report here that the equational segregation at meiosis I depends on substitutive Rad 21, which relocates to the centromeres if Rec 8 is absent. Moreover, we demonstrate that even if sufficient amounts of Rad 21 are transferred to the centromeres at meiosis I, thereby establishing cohesion at the centromeres, rec 8 Δ cells never recover monopolar attachment but instead secure bipolar attachment. Thus, Rec 8 and Rad 21 define monopolar and bipolar attachment, respectively, at meiosis I. We conclude that cohesin is a crucial determinant of the attachment manner of kinetochores to the spindle microtubules at meiosis I in fission yeast...|$|E
40|$|Meiosis is {{the process}} by which diploid cells undergo DNA synthesis, {{homologous}} recombination and pairing, followed by the reductional division then the <b>equational</b> <b>division.</b> I present work in this PhD thesis which furthers the understanding of the coordination of the initiation of meiotic recombination and the reductional division. Ten genes are required to initiate recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of a subset of recombination initiation proteins creates a Recombination Initiation Signal (RIS) that delays the start of MI in wild type cells. I present experiments demonstrating the first division kinetics of the two remaining recombination initiation genes that our lab had not yet studied. Rec 107 is part of the RIS, while Ski 8 is not. The RIS is conserved in a divergent Saccharomyces strain background. rec 102 and rec 104 SK 1 strains both start the first division earlier that wildtype SK 1 strains. I present evidence that suggests that the RIS acts independently of the pathway that controls securin (PDS 1) degradation. The work in this thesis expands our knowledge of the mechanism by which the RIS delays the reductional division. In this thesis I present experiments showing that the DNA damage, spindle and S phase checkpoints do not transduce the RIS. I establish the meiosis-specific candidate Mek 1 as a candidate for relaying the RIS. Lastly, experiments described in these chapters show that the transcriptional activator of Middle Meiosis, NDT 80, is the target of the RIS. NDT 80 transcription and activity are both necessary and sufficient to affect an earlier reductional division, similar to the early MI seen in RIS mutants...|$|E
40|$|Faithful {{transmission}} of the genome through sexual reproduction requires reduction of genome copy number during meiosis to produce haploid sperm and eggs. Meiosis entails steps absent from mitosis to achieve this goal. When meiosis begins, sisters are held together by sister chromatid cohesion (SCC), mediated by the cohesin complex. Homologs then become linked through crossover recombination. SCC subsequently holds both sisters and homologs together. Separation of homologs and then sisters requires two successive rounds of chromosome segregation and the stepwise removal of Rec 8, a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit. We show that HTP- 3, a known component of the C. elegans axial element (AE), molecularly links these meiotic innovations. We identified HTP- 3 in a genetic screen for factors necessary to maintain SCC until meiosis II. Our data show that interdependent loading of HTP- 3 and cohesin is a principal step in assembling the meiotic chromosomal axis and in establishing SCC. HTP- 3 recruits all known AE components to meiotic chromosomes and promotes cohesin loading, the first known involvement of an AE protein in this process. Furthermore, REC- 8 and two paralogs, called COH- 3 and COH- 4, together mediate meiotic SCC, but they perform specialized functions. REC- 8 alone is necessary and sufficient for the persistence of SCC after meiosis I. In htp- 3 and rec- 8 mutants, sister chromatids segregate away from one another in meiosis I (<b>equational</b> <b>division),</b> rather than segregating randomly, as expected if SCC were completely eliminated. AE assembly fails only when REC- 8, COH- 3, and COH- 4 are simultaneously disrupted. Premature equational sister separation in rec 8 mutants of other organisms suggests the involvement of multiple REC- 8 paralogs, which may have masked a conserved requirement for cohesin in AE assembly...|$|E
