5|$|After the {{successful}} {{assault on the}} northern wall, the <b>defenders</b> fled to the Temple Mount, pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the <b>defenders</b> could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the <b>defenders,</b> with the remainder taking refuge in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Tancred then called {{a halt to the}} slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection. When the <b>defenders</b> on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Provençals to enter the city. Iftikhar al-Dawla, the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to Ascalon.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish fleet arrived off Roatán at 6am on March 13, {{and after}} its <b>defenders</b> fired several ineffectual cannon shots, the Santa Maltilda {{and the other}} ships {{anchored}} out of range. At 8am Gálvez sent his second-in-command on the 'Santa Matilda' Enrique MacDonell, who spoke English, in to request the surrender of the island's <b>defenders.</b> The <b>defenders</b> asked for six hours to consider their options, which Gálvez granted. After that time had elapsed MacDonell came back with word that the <b>defenders</b> refused to surrender and were prepared to stand their ground 'to the death'. The Spanish were not surprised as their sailors had noticed the English appeared to be preparing defenses during grace period. An Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas, so Gálvez then held council of his eleven officers, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E
5|$|The Turks {{took the}} castle {{and most of}} the <b>defenders</b> were slain. A few of the {{captured}} <b>defenders</b> were spared by Janissaries who had admired their courage, with only seven <b>defenders</b> managing to escape through the Ottoman lines.

5|$|After several false {{starts in}} early September, the Continental Army {{established}} a siege around Fort St. Jean. Beset by illness, bad weather, and logistical problems, they established mortar batteries that {{were able to}} penetrate into the interior the fort, but the <b>defenders,</b> who were well-supplied with munitions, but not food and other supplies, persisted in their defence, believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton. On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly fell, and on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted. When word of this {{made its way to}} St. Jean's <b>defenders,</b> combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort, the fort's <b>defenders</b> capitulated, surrendering on November 3.|$|E
5|$|Dedaković's second-in-command, Branko Borković, {{was another}} former JNA {{officer who had}} volunteered for service in Vukovar. The two men {{established}} a unified command structure, organised the <b>defenders</b> into a single brigade and implemented an integrated defence system. A defensive ring of six sectors was established, each assigned to one unit within the 204th Brigade. The <b>defenders</b> used a network of cellars, canals, ditches and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed.|$|E

5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking its toll on the <b>defenders.</b> The <b>defenders</b> were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E

50|$|When {{the first}} <b>defender</b> {{decides not to}} whist against a {{contract}} for 6 or 7 tricks, the other <b>defender</b> has a third option besides passing and whisting. In this case the second <b>defender</b> may half-whist, in which case trick-play does not take place and the declarer and the second <b>defender</b> each score as if both sides had won their required number of tricks and the defenders' tricks had been shared equally between both. The first <b>defender</b> does not score. However, if the second <b>defender</b> wants to half-whist, the first <b>defender</b> gets {{a second chance to}} whist, in which case trick-play and scoring are done normally.|$|R

50|$|The <b>defender</b> {{at the top}} of the key {{picks up}} the dribbler {{advancing}} up the court. The <b>defender</b> at the free throw line then sprints out and picks up the entry pass.

If the ball handler begins to dribble the <b>defender</b> just below the elbow on the same side as the ball would then double team the ball handler with the <b>defender</b> already defending the ball. The <b>defender</b> below the opposite elbow then drops under the basket while the <b>defender</b> that was previously under the basket fronts the offensive player on the post.

Although the besiegers outnumbered the <b>defenders,</b> John repelled all attacks on the town's walls. Mouskes compared him to Hector, Roland, Ogier the Dane and Judas Maccabeus in his Rhymed Chronicle, emphasizing his bravery.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{benefits}} of more defensible forts are evident: they could act as temporary refuges for overwhelmed local troops during barbarian incursions, while they waited for reinforcements. The forts were difficult for the barbarians to take by assault, as they generally lacked the necessary equipment. The forts could store sufficient supplies to enable the <b>defenders</b> to hold {{out for a few}} weeks, and to supply relieving troops. They could also act as bases from which <b>defenders</b> could make sorties against isolated groups of barbarians and to cooperate with relieving forces.|$|E
