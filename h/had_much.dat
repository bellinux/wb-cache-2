5|$|Along with Charles Madigan, Keogh {{withdrew from}} playing Manchester on 11 March after tour manager James Scott refused to lend them money.

Philippus claimed descent from Alexander the Great, and was elected consul in 56BC. Philippus never <b>had</b> <b>much</b> of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother, Julia, the sister of Julius Caesar.|$|E

5|$|The CCF was {{a socialist}} party, which <b>had</b> <b>much</b> of its {{strength}} in Saskatchewan, though it ran candidates {{in several other}} provinces. At Parliament's dissolution in April 1957, it had 23 MPs, from five different provinces. Aside from the Liberals and the Tories, {{it was the only}} party to nominate a candidate in a majority of the ridings. In 1957, the party was led by Saskatchewan MP M.J. Coldwell.|$|E

5|$|The Liberal {{government}} introduced five-member block voting constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in 1921, {{and briefly}} made Medicine Hat a double-member district. Because each voter {{in the cities}} was given five votes, the Liberal party was defeated despite winning a higher total number of votes than the United Farmers, who <b>had</b> <b>much</b> higher support in the rural single-member districts.|$|E
5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several {{significant improvements}} over earlier designs, including {{a more effective}} bow shape that improved seakeeping and a cut-down quarterdeck that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. Perhaps most importantly, a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the new ships. They also <b>had</b> <b>much</b> more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E

Joan became pregnant soon after the wedding, and in July 1937 a baby boy was delivered; he was stillborn.|$|E
5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have <b>had</b> <b>much</b> more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E

5|$|Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes {{bright enough}} to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, <b>had</b> <b>much</b> lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Usama was {{the second}} of four boys and raised by his nurse, Lu'lu'a, who had also raised his father and would later raise Usama's own children.

He {{spent much of his}} youth hunting with his family, partly as recreation and certainly as warrior (faris) training for battle as part of furusiyya.
