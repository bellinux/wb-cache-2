[...] In the year 2016, the levelized tariff in US$ for solar PV electricity has fallen below 2.42 cents/kWh. Also the <b>international</b> <b>tariff</b> of solar thermal storage power plants has fallen to US$ 6.3 cents/kWh which is cheaper than fossil fuel plants. [...] The cheaper hybrid solar power (mix of solar PV and solar thermal storage power) need not depend on costly and polluting coal/gas fired power generation for ensuring stable grid operation. Solar electricity price is going to become the benchmark price for deciding the other fuel prices (Petroleum products, LNG, CNG, LPG, coal, lignite, biomass, etc.) based on their ultimate use and advantages.|$|E

40|$|The {{multilateral}} {{trading system}} (the WTO) and most regional trade initiatives incorporate a dispute settlement procedure (DSP) {{as part of the}} broad set of agreements. The most signiÞcant perhaps is the Dispute and Appellate Panel at the WTO; NAFTA has a DSP, as will the FTAA; MERCOSUR has plans for one. Under a DSP a country may Þle a dispute if it believes that another member has violated its obligations under the treaty. The DSP produces a Þnding to which the member country is obliged to respond either by rescinding the offending measure or by ”compensating ” the affected country (with trade or other concessions). Why develop an institution such as the DSP within a trade agreement with adjudicative, but not enforcement powers? What could explain the apparent willingness of countries to delegate (and pool) authority over trade policy to such a supranational adjudicative institution? More fundamentally, is international cooperation enhanced by adopting aDSP? In a model of repeated bilateral <b>international</b> <b>tariff</b> setting in the face of domestic, two-sided political uncertainty, we show that a) any agreement with a DSP is more stable than an agreemen...|$|E
40|$|The Technical Note {{provides}} an overview of the trends in Belize's tariff structure over recent years, in particular its trade policy, commitments and obligations, the tax revenue implications, and the scope for policy implementation. Specifically, it assesses the country's level of compliance with CARICOM commitments, such as the application of the common external tariff, and outlines and analyzes Belize's trade agreement obligations and their timing and impact with respect to fiscal incentives. It provides policy recommendations and alternatives for compliance with Belize's international trade commitments, for example with the World Trade Organization (WTO), from legislative and policy changes to further trade liberalization and fiscal measures to ensure compliance with its existing <b>international</b> <b>tariff</b> and nontariff commitments. The study considers the solution to eliminate the use of revenue replacement duties, lower all tariffs on excisable goods, and then levy an excise tax on each of the goods up to the current level imposed by import and revenue replacement duties. The study argues in favor of the elimination of the Environmental Tax, as it violates the principle of WTO national treatment in its current form, and takes into account that the export incentive programs will have to be reformed to comply with the rules of the WTO before the end of 2015. Finally, the study proposes a transformation or rationalization of the import license regime to make it more predictable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory. ...|$|E

40|$|Can the rise, collapse, revival and {{maintenance}} of liberal trade {{in the world economy}} from 1860 - 1995 be explained in a single institutionalist logic? This study is a historical institutionalist challenge to the public good theoretical and British hegemony empirical foundations of the dominant traditions in international political economy [...] -hegemonic stability theory (HST) and neoliberal institutionalism [...] -and their common hegemonic explanation for the rise of liberal trade in the West. I argue that liberal commerce is not a public good, and did not emerge due to British economic hegemony in the nineteenth century or principally because of American hegemony in the twentieth century. Liberal trade, in both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, is instead a highly excludable good that is principally the institutional outcome of <b>international</b> <b>tariff</b> bargains conducted within a distinctive set of reciprocally reinforcing international and domestic institutions known as the conventional tariff system (CTS) : the organizing principle of multilateralism incarnate and institutionalized. ^ My central claim is new. The tariff stability, international constraints, and institutional infrastructure provided by the CTS were the principal reasons for the rise of liberal trade in the world economy during the both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The rise, collapse, revival, {{and maintenance}} of liberal trade in the world economy from 1860 - 1995 all have an institutional foundation, a single institutional foundation: {{the presence or absence of}} the CTS. The CTS was not initiated and led by laissez-faire-incapacitated Britain. The regime was instead established in 1860 and led until 1892 by Saint-Simonian/statist France. The German Empire then assumed leadership of the regime with the inauguration of the Caprivi treaty-network on February 1, 1892 until the outbreak of World War I. The prewar regime was destroyed at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The CTS, however, was reestablished when America adopted the institution with the passage of the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act. In 1947 the CTS was expanded into the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade and into the World Trade Organization in 1995. ...|$|E

Similarly, exports of machinery parts are negatively associated with not only the importer's tariff rates on machinery parts but also the exporter's tariff rates on finished machinery products.

5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist <b>international</b> <b>tariffs</b> on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|R

On the other hand, a tariff can prompt inefficient organizational choices if it discriminates in favor of less productive firms or if integration costs are low.
