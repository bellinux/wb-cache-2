5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid <b>integrates</b> <b>into</b> the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E

500|$|Clarke's book is {{identified}} as distinctively English {{not only because of}} its style but also because of its themes of [...] "vigorous common sense", [...] "firm ethical fiber", [...] "serene reason and self-confidence", which are drawn from its Augustan literary roots. The [...] "muddy, bloody, instinctual spirit of the fairies" [...] is equally a part of its Englishness, along with [...] "arrogance, provincialism and class prejudice". The fairy tradition that Clarke draws on is particularly English; she alludes to tales from children's literature and others which date back to the medieval period. As Feeley notes, [...] "The idea of fairies forming a hidden supernatural aristocracy certainly predates Spenser and Shakespeare, and seems to distinguish the English tales of wee folk from those of Scotland and Ireland." [...] In these medieval English stories, the fairies are depicted as [...] "capricious, inconsistent in their attitude toward humankind, [...] finally unknowable", characteristics which Clarke <b>integrates</b> <b>into</b> her own fairies. Clarke notes in an interview that she drew the idea of unpredictable, amoral fairies from the works of Neil Gaiman.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the field}} of {{genomics}} {{takes into account the}} entire genome of an organism and not simply its individual genes, the study [...] of latent viral infection falls into this realm.
