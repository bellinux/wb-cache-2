500|$|Caesar became Consul in 59 BC, but his colleague, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, was {{an extreme}} aristocrat. Caesar {{submitted}} {{the laws that}} he had promised Pompey to the Roman Senate, but the senate rejected these laws, and so he then submitted them to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent (and thus <b>illegal)</b> <b>means</b> to ensure their passage. Caesar was then given command of four legions, and promised the governorship of three provinces (Cisalpine Gaul, Transalpine Gaul, and Illyricum). This appointment was to begin on March 1, 59 BC, {{while he was still}} Consul. Caesar did not wish to leave the senate in the hands of such unskillful politicians as Pompey and Crassus before he had crushed the spirit of the senate and deprived it of its two most dangerous leaders, Cato and Cicero. Therefore, he sent Cato on a mission to Cyprus, which was likely to ruin his reputation, and then facilitated the election of the former Patrician Clodius to the Tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius, a dangerous demagogue, secured the passage of several laws for his coming attack on Cicero. One law banned the use of omens (auspices) as an obstructive device in the Plebeian Council, while the second law made certain [...] "clubs" [...] of a [...] "semi-political nature" [...] (i.e. armed gangs) lawful. Clodius then passed two laws which banished Cicero, on the grounds that he had deprived several of Catiline's conspirators of their due process (provocatio) rights when he had them executed upon a mere decree of the senate.|$|E

Nayyouf was released into house arrest at first, but on 20 June was seized by security agents outside a clinic where he was receiving treatment. International outcry ensued in response to the incident, which had occurred just as Nayyouf was planning to release information detailing Syrian human rights abuses, but the government denied involvement. However, Nayyouf was granted a full release and his travel ban was lifted, hours before President Bashar al-Assad was due to visit Paris. Nayyouf moved to France and then the UK, as he applied for political asylum, while he sought medical treatment for the injuries he suffered from torture during his confinement, which left him partially paralysed. In 2002, Nayyouf was granted political asylum in France. According to Nayyouf's attorney, lawyers for the ruling Ba'ath Party accused Nayyouf of [...] "attempting to change the constitution by <b>illegal</b> <b>means,</b> creating sectarian strife, and publishing reports harmful for the state", and ordered him to appear in Syria for an investigation in September 1992. After his release, Nayyouf has continued to speak out against human rights violations in Syria, targeting torture, deaths in detention, and executions including the Tadmor Prison massacre on 27 June 1980, in which over 1,000 accused Islamists were executed at Palmyra prison.

A week later, the fuel lines on heavy equipment were slashed. On the night of April 26, several vehicles at a Creek Turnpike worksite belonging to M.J. Lee were vandalized; the vandals smashed windshields and headlights, stole fuel caps, and dumped mud into the fuel tanks. Messages reading [...] "Death to OTA", [...] "Death to [...] Bellmon" [...] and [...] "Death to Bartlett" [...] (who had recently also become a Tulsa city councilman) were written in mud {{on the side of a}} water truck at the site. The vice president of the firm emphasized that the company alone bore the brunt of the estimated $10,000 ($17,900 in [...] dollars) financial loss, not OTA, and offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the prosecution of the responsible party. Construction signage was also removed or covered up with Tulsans Against Turnpikes signs, and survey markers were relocated. Tulsans Against Turnpikes publicly condemned the vandalism, offering an additional $500 reward for information. A member of the group's board stated [...] "We deplore this kind of cowardly, illegal action. There is no reason for some sick person to take out frustrations on the contractor."

2500|$|The third {{match of}} the night, a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match between Rey Cometa and Japanese wrestler Namajague, was built upon a {{conflict}} that started during the previous year. The original conflict was between Namajague and his partner Okumua (collectively known as La Fiebre Amarilla) and the tecnico wrestler Stuka, Jr.. In late 2012 the two began facing off {{on opposite sides of}} Six-man tag team matches on various weekly Super Viernes shows, CMLL's main weekly show. In November Stuka, Jr. often teamed with Rey Cometa to take on the Japanese team and Puma King, initially as a continuation of the storyline between Rey Cometa and Puma King, who had unmasked Rey Cometa at the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show, but began to morph into focusing on the escalating issues between Stuka, Jr./Rey Cometa and Fiebre Amarilla. On the November 23 Super Viernes La Fiebre was {{on the opposite side of}} Rey Cometa once again and Namajague tried once again to win the match by <b>illegal</b> <b>means,</b> only to be caught by the referee and disqualified as a result of his actions. On the last Super Viernes of 2012 La Fiebre teamed up with Vangelis to defeat the team of Fuego, Rey Cometa and Stuka, Jr. Over the next coulple of weeks Stuka, Jr. and Namajague found themselves on opposite sides of six-man tag team matches, teaming with a number of different partners which did not always include Rey Cometa or Okumura. Both Rey Cometa and Namajague took part in the 2013 CMLL Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on February 2 but due to their interaction and a mistimed move Namajague ended up landing wrong during a dive to the floor and had to be taken to the hospital, while moments later Rey Cometa also ended up hurt. Both accidents looked so bad that it put their participation in the follow week's Super Viernes in question, but in the end Rey Cometa teamed with Stuka, Jr. and El Hijo del Fantasma to take on and defeat Namajague, Okumura and Misterioso, Jr.. Following the February 8 match Stuka, Jr. challenged Namajague to put his mask on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, an offer that Okumura [...] "in his role as leader of Fiebre Amarilla" [...] declined the challenge, wanting to face Stuka, Jr. himself. Rey Cometa responded to that challenge by issuing a team challenge, with himself and Stuka, Jr. against La Fiebre Amarilla for the team's mask and hair to be on the line. On Thursday February 21, 2013 CMLL held a press conference announcing, among other things, that the match between the two teams would officially take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas as the main event of the show. The match was won by Rey Cometa and Stuka, Jr. with Cometa securing the victory by pinning Namajague in the third and final fall. The storyline between Namajague and Rey Cometa did not end after the unmasking, instead it switched to an individual storyline between the two, that included Namajague breaking a pane of glass over Rey Cometa's head during a one-on-one match. The conflict led to CMLL signing a one-on-one Lucha de Apuestas between with Cometa and Namajague's hair on the line as part of the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main event}} for the 2013 Dos Leyenda show was {{a direct result of}} a long-running slowly {{building}} storyline between the Japanese duo of Namajague and Okumura, collectively known as La Fiebre Amarilla ("The Yellow Fever") and Mexican high-fliers Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa. Namajague, the masked identity of New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) rookie Kyosuke Mikami, made his debut in CMLL a few weeks prior to the 2012 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show as part of CMLL's working arrangement with NJPW. He was immediately teamed up with Okumura, CMLL's resident Japanese wrestler who often acts both as a tag team partner and a mentor for Japanese wrestlers touring with CMLL. In the year since Namajague's debut La Fievre Amarilla had several unsuccessful title matches against Stuka Jr. and Fuego for the latter's CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. Through the series of Arena Coliseo Tag Team matches Namajague began targeting Stuka Jr. specifically, more intent on hurting and humiliating him including tearing Stuka Jr.'s mask open during the match. In late 2012 the two began facing off on opposite sides of Six-man tag team matches on various weekly Super Viernes shows, CMLL's main weekly show. In November Stuka Jr. often teamed with Rey Cometa to take on the Japanese team and Puma King, initially as a continuation of the storyline between Rey Cometa and Puma King, who had unmasked Rey Cometa at the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show, but began to morph into focusing on the escalating issues between Stuka Jr./Rey Cometa and Fiebre Amarilla. On the November 2, 2012 Super Viernes the match started out with Rey Cometa and Puma King being {{the focal point of the}} match, but Okumura won the third and deciding fall for his team when he took advantage of a distracted referee to land an illegal low blow on Stuka Jr. A few weeks later, on the November 23 Super Viernes La Fiebre was on the opposite side of Rey Cometa once again and Namajague tried once again to win the match by <b>illegal</b> <b>means,</b> only to be caught by the referee and disqualified as a result of his actions. On the last Super Viernes of 2012 La Fiebre teamed up with Vangelis to defeat the team of Fuego, Rey Cometa and Stuka Jr. The victory earned La Fiebre another match against the CMLL Arena Coloseo Tag Team Champions. During the title match Namajague, Namajague tried to trick Stuka Jr. into getting disqualified by pulling his own mask off and throwing it to Stuka Jr. to make it look like it was pulled off, which is a disqualification offense in Lucha Libre. Stuka Jr. reacted quickly before the referee noticed and put the mask back on Namajague and then pinned his surprised opponent. The January 4, 2013 Super Viernes saw the rivalry continue as Stuka Jr. and Okumura was on opposite sides of a six-man tag team match, won by Stuka Jr.'s team, while Rey Cometa defeated Namajague by disqualification when Namajague tried to use a low blow on his opponent. Over the next coulple of weeks Stuka Jr. and Namajague found themselves on opposite sides of six-man tag team matches, teaming with a number of different partners which did not always include Rey Cometa or Okumura. Both Rey Cometa and Namajague took part in the 2013 CMLL Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on February 2, 2013 but due to their interaction and a mistimed move Namajague ended up landing wrong during a dive to the floor and had to be taken to the hospital, while moments later Rey Cometa also ended up hurt.

Rey Cometa responded to that challenge by issuing a team challenge, with himself and Stuka Jr. against La Fiebre Amarilla for the team's mask and hair to be on the line. During the introductions to a six-man tag team match on February 15, 2013 Stuka Jr. and Namajague started to argue while still in the aisle to the ring, only for Stuka Jr. to be attacked from behind by another Namajague. The first Namajague was revealed as Okumura as the two beat Stuka Jr. down. The Japanese team lost the match by disqualification after unmasking Stuka Jr. in the second fall. Following the match Okumura said they accepted the tag team challenge. On Thursday February 21, 2013 CMLL held a press conference announcing, among other things, that the match between the two teams would officially take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas as the main event of the show. On March 3, 2013 La Ola Amarilla defeated Stuka Jr. and Fuego to win the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship in a match that ended in controversy as Stuka Jr.'s shoulder was not on the mat during the count of three, something the referee did not see.|$|E

40|$|Illegal {{migrants}} {{supply a}} valuable productive input: effort. But {{their status as}} <b>illegals</b> <b>means</b> that these migrants face a strictly positive probability of expulsion. A return to {{their country of origin}} entails reduced earnings when the wage at origin is lower than the wage at destination. This prospect induces illegal migrants to exert more work effort than comparable workers who face no such prospect. The lower the probable, alternative earnings, the harsher the penalty that illegal migrants will be subjected to upon their return, for a given probability of expulsion, and the higher the level of effort they will exert at destination. While the home-country wage that awaits the illegal migrants upon their return is exogenous to the host country, the probability of their return is not. Given the home-country wage, a higher probability of expulsion will induce illegal migrants to supply more effort. Hence, different combinations of probabilities of expulsion and home-country wages yield the same level of effort. Thus, variation in the extent to which receiving countries undertake measures aimed at apprehending and expelling illegal migrants can be attributed not to characteristics of the illegal migrants themselves but to a feature that pertains to the illegal migrants' country of origin.

Not put in a more complying humour by this, they impeached the King's favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, as the cause (which he undoubtedly was) of many great public grievances and wrongs.

60|$|It becomes {{manifest}} to us, as we {{read the}} history of the time, that the Dictator of the future was gradually entertaining the idea that the old forms of the Republic were rotten, and that any man who intended to exercise power in Rome or within the Roman Empire must obtain it and keep it by <b>illegal</b> <b>means.</b> He had probably adhered to Catiline's first conspiracy, but only with such moderate adhesion as enabled him to withdraw when he found that his companions were not fit for the work. It is manifest that he sympathized with the later conspiracy, though it may be doubted whether he himself had ever been a party to it. When the conspiracy had been crushed by Cicero, he had given his full assent to the crushing of it. We have seen how loudly he condemned the wickedness of the conspirators in his endeavor to save their lives. But, through it all, there was a well-grounded conviction in his mind that Cicero, with all his virtues, was not practical. Not that Cicero was to him the same as Cato, who with his Stoic grandiloquence must, to his thinking, have been altogether useless. Cicero, though too virtuous for supreme rule, too virtuous to seize power and hold it, too virtuous to despise as effete the institutions of the Republic, was still a man so gifted, and capable in so many things, as to be very great as an assistant, if he would only condescend to assist. It is in this light that Cæsar seems to have regarded Cicero as time went on; admiring him, liking him, willing to act with him if it might be possible, but not the less determined to put down all the attempts at patriotic republican virtue in which the orator delighted to indulge. Mr. Forsyth expresses an opinion that Cæsar, till he crossed the Rubicon after his ten years' fighting in Gaul, had entertained no settled plan of overthrowing the Constitution. Probably not; nor even then. It may be doubted whether Cæsar ever spoke to himself of overthrowing the Constitution. He came gradually to see that power and wealth were to be obtained by violent action, and only by violent action. He had before him the examples of Marius and Sulla, both of whom had enjoyed power and had died in their beds. There was the example, also, of others who, walking unwarily in those perilous times, had been banished as was Verres, or killed as was Catiline. We can easily understand that he, with his great genius, should have acknowledged the need both of courage and caution.

Burevestnik generally adhered to the political line from the Kropotkinite Khleb i Volia group, although anti-syndicalist viewpoints were also expressed in some of its articles (through the participation of Abram Grossman). Between 1906 and 1907, Grossman used the signature [...] "A -" [...] in Burevestnik.
