50|$|The third <b>Emissaries</b> <b>of</b> Evil were {{recruited}} by Kingpin (who was briefly active in France). This {{group consisted of}} La Concierge, Stilt-Man and Synapse. Daredevil (whose memories were reprogrammed by S.H.I.E.L.D. to pose as undercover agent Laurent Levasseur) ended up fighting the <b>Emissaries</b> <b>of</b> Evil while undercover. During a battle with Kingpin and his henchmen, Laurent regains his memories of being Matt Murdock and Daredevil. S.H.I.E.L.D. and Foggy Nelson finally catch up with Matt Murdock and he loses his temporary eyesight {{as he prepares to}} return to his normal life. When Kingpin and the <b>Emissaries</b> <b>of</b> Evil try to frame a Middle Eastern man for terrorism so that Kingpin can get his hands on a shipment of weapons, Matt Murdock defends the patsy and wins in court. Daredevil takes on the <b>Emissaries</b> <b>of</b> Evil in order to foil Kingpin's scheme. Daredevil manages to defeat the <b>Emissaries</b> <b>of</b> Evil.|$|R
40|$|Banks’ {{valuation}} <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> {{has been}} questioned by analysts and the media. Analysts suggest that bank management as of {{the inception of the}} financial crisis have exploited the unverifiable fair value goodwill accounting opportunistically. This suggestion implicitly implies that bank management was more likely than management of other industries to exploit goodwill accounting during the financial turmoil. In this thesis, I test whether the value relevance of banks’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> was affected differently than other industries during the financial turmoil. To do so, I use the value relevance of the pharmaceutical industry’s valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> as a control group for banks. Further, I hypothesize that (1) banks’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> was value irrelevant since investors should have impounded the information of the analysts in the stock price; (2) pharmaceutical industry’s valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> was value relevant since the financial turmoil did not severely affect its core business. The empirical result of the study suggests that the <b>goodwill</b> valuation <b>of</b> both banks and pharmaceuticals was value relevant. Moreover, the empirical result indicates that banks’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> was not less value relevant than the pharmaceuticals’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> In summary, banks’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> seems to have been value relevant during the financial turmoil.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the topic <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> {{and the possibility}} of achieving a synthesis between its legal and accounting concepts. The genesis for this topic was the assertion by the High Court in FCT v. Murry that the legal and accounting concepts <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> were different to the extent that a synthesis between the concepts could not be achieved. The approach taken involves an examination of the evolution, nature and treatment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> in both the legal and accounting contexts. The major focus is on the legal concept, but significant attention is also given to the accounting concept to enable an examination of the possibility of a synthesis between the two. Thus chapters 2 - 12 deal largely with the legal concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and chapters 13 - 14 deal with the accounting concept. Chapter 15 contains the final analysis and conclusions. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and addresses a range <b>of</b> definitions <b>of</b> <b>goodwill,</b> both legal and accounting definitions. Chapter 2 examines the evolution <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> as a commercial legal concept dating back to early references in the sixteenth century. Chapter 3 carries on the examination of the legal concept {{from the point of view}} of it major elements and sources. Chapter 4 deals with important issues which go to the heart of our understanding <b>of</b> legal <b>goodwill.</b> The essential issues concern the concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> as one whole item of property, inseparably attached to a business but separate from its sources. Chapters 5 - 12 examine the concept in a range of specific legal contexts in order to determine what they add to our understanding and also to determine how the essential nature <b>of</b> legal <b>goodwill</b> holds up in these various contexts. Chapter 5 deals with goodwill in the context of partnerships. Much of the case law involving goodwill in this context arose in the nineteenth century in relation to the termination of partnerships. Chapter 6 examines goodwill in relation to restrictive covenants designed to protect the <b>goodwill</b> <b>of</b> a business. The history of the law of restrictive covenants can be traced back to the fifteenth century, where an incipient notion <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> may be seen to be emerging. Chapter 7 examines goodwill in the context of stamp duties, a tax with a long pedigree stretching back to the late seventeenth century. Chapter 8 examines the authorities concerning the nature and treatment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> in the contexts of licensing, leasing and franchising. In chapter 9 the legal concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> is examined in the broad-ranging context of the tort <b>of</b> passing-off. <b>Goodwill</b> plays a central part in the modern tort as the element of business to be protected from damage by the act of passing-off. As discussed in chapter 10, the field of compensation law presents certain treatments <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> which strictly run counter to its legal nature, particularly in respect <b>of</b> counting <b>goodwill</b> as part <b>of</b> land in calculating an amount of compensation. However, as explained in this chapter, this is no more than a deeming device for the specific purposes of calculating compensation and thus should not be taken to deviate from the normal concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> Chapter 11 deals with goodwill in a number of tax contexts not covered elsewhere in this paper. The relationship between tax and goodwill has been an uneasy one with a degree of friction between the concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and its tax treatment. The last of the chapters focussing on legal goodwill, chapter 12, addresses issues concerning valuation in the legal context. Chapters 13 and 14 deal with the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> Chapter 13 examines the origin and development <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> It plots the evolution <b>of</b> accounting <b>goodwill</b> from its recognizable beginnings in the 1880 s to WWII. Chapter 14 carries on with the examination <b>of</b> accounting <b>goodwill</b> in the modern period, identified as the period after WWII with an emphasis on the time from the early 1980 s. As noted in the conclusion to that chapter, the definition, valuation and treatment <b>of</b> accounting <b>goodwill</b> have changed little in substance from the earlier periods pre-WWII. The conclusion in chapter 15 is that goodwill is essentially the same concept in both law and accounting, but a compound concept comprising different facets which apply in different contexts. Therefore, the need strictly to determine a synthesis is rendered redundant by this concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the Australian {{approach to}} taxation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and related intangibles. It asks the questions: 'Is the current Australian approach to taxation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> coherent?'; and 'Could {{a different approach}} minimise any distortions?' The thesis identifies the increasing importance <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and other intangible property in a modern information-based economy. It identifies benchmarks for a 'good' tax system  such as efficiency, simplicity, and equity. It emphasises the criteria of simplicity and efficiency but includes other criteria and specifically considers the issue of alignment of accounting and legal concepts. It concludes that the current misalignment {{makes it difficult for}} the tax system to deal with goodwill coherently. The thesis criticises the treatment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> under various Australian taxes, including stamp duty; Goods and Services Tax; taxation of capital gains; and income tax. It specifically considers the treatment of intangible sources <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and their relationship with goodwill itself. The discussion of income tax pays particular attention to the role <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and other intangibles in international transfer pricing. The thesis draws conclusions about the treatment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> in Australia and whether the Australian approach meets the benchmarks established at the outset. The thesis demonstrates that the current Australian approach leads, inter alia, to tax avoidance. The current approach also offends a number of other criteria of a 'good' system. The thesis considers the UK tax treatment of intangibles held by resident companies and considers this model for Australia. It also considers the abandoned 'Tax Value Method' previously proposed for Australia. From this and other material, it suggests possible new directions and an alternative approach to taxing goodwill in Australia. These include a consistent and coherent definition <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> for tax that is compatible with law and accounting. The thesis also urges the development of a consistent approach to taxing goodwill at both the state and federal levels; and suggests greater reliance on the existence <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> as a means to establish jurisdiction to impose tax in international tax situations...|$|R
