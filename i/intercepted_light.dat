In cereals, most of experimental effort {{has focused on}} leaf elongation, with essentially hydraulic effects. We have tested if evaporative demand and light could have distinct effects on leaf elongation and widening, and if short term effects could translate into final leaf dimensions. For that, we have monitored leaf widening and elongation in a field experiment with temporary shading, and in a platform experiment with 15 -min temporal resolution and contrasting evaporative demands. Leaf widening showed a strong (positive) sensitivity to whole-plant <b>intercepted</b> <b>light</b> and no response to evaporative demand. Leaf elongation was (negatively) sensitive to evaporative demand, without effect of <b>intercepted</b> <b>light</b> per se. We have successfully tested resulting equations to predict leaf length and width in an external dataset of 15 field and 6 platform experiments. These effects also applied to a panel of 251 maize hybrids. Leaf length and width presented quantitative trait loci (QTLs) whose allelic effects largely differed between both dimensions but were consistent {{in the field and}} the platform, with high QTLxEnvironment interaction.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate if CO values of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.)

To achieve this, CO was evaluated for 136 yellow birches, 109 sugar maples, and 68 hemlocks from different regions of western Quebec, southern Ontario, and northern Michigan.

The {{study was conducted}} during 2001 and 2002 in a 6 -year old drip-irrigated vineyard located in southern Italy. Vine density was 1, 600 vines per ha. Three crop load treatments were imposed at fruit set: UT – unthinned control with approximately 70 clusters per vine (~ two clusters per shoot), T 50 – in which 50 % of the clusters were removed (~ one cluster per shoot) and T 75 – in which 75 % of the clusters were removed (~ one cluster every two shoots). Vegetative and reproductive growth was evaluated by measuring leaf area development, leaf gas exchange and water potential, canopy light interception and shoot and cluster growth. Leaf area development was measured by collecting shoots from mature vines on a monthly basis, beginning 15 days after budbreak until the end of September. Transmitted photon flux density (PFDt), on a 0. 10 m by 0. 20 m grid at the soil surface, and incident PFD (PFDi) above the canopy were measured with a Ceptometer (Decagon D., Accupar) to calculate the <b>intercepted</b> <b>light</b> (PFDin). Gas exchange parameters were measured on both shaded and sun-exposed leaves. Preliminary results indicate that vines trained to the Tendone system have a high capacity to produce vegetation and fruit. <b>Intercepted</b> <b>light</b> reached a maximum value of about 80 % at maximum leaf area index (LAI).

40|$|Summary In some conifers, shoot {{geometry}} and needle mor-phology vary significantly {{in response to}} the light conditions under which they develop. We measured shoot length, silhou-ette area, total projected needle area, total needle weight and needle thickness on current shoots developed under a wide range of light conditions in a 36 -year-old Abies amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes stand. Current light was quantified by evalu-ating percent openness from hemispherical photographs taken before the growing season. Unweighted total openness was correlated with shoot {{geometry and}} needle morphology better than any weighted indices tested. Needle thickness and leaf mass/area were both closely correlated with total openness (R 2 = 0. 86 and 0. 82, respectively). The most exposed needles were 2. 5 times thicker and had 3 [...] 4 times more leaf mass/area than the most shaded needles. Total projected leaf area/shoot silhou-ette area was also correlated with openness (R 2 = 0. 74) and was about twice as high in sun shoots as in shaded shoots. As a result of greater leaf mass/leaf area and greater leaf area/shoot sil-houette area, a unit of <b>intercepted</b> <b>light</b> was dispersed over about 6 times as much leaf mass in a sun shoot as in a shade shoot, which presumably permits more efficient utilization of the <b>intercepted</b> <b>light</b> under high illumination with less energy wastage to light saturation. Moreover, leaf mass per unit of silhouette area was almost exactly proportional to canopy openness, as predicted by resource optimization theory if ni-trogen concentration and photosynthetic capacity per unit mass are constant in new leaves. The close correlation of needle thickness and leaf mass/area with openness suggests that either parameter could be used as an index of the distribution of light or light-driven processes in an A. amabilis canopy...|$|E

The current recommended chickpea population density of 44 plants m- 2 is based on preliminary studies and a narrow range of 20 to 50 plants m- 2. The aims {{of this study were}} to i) determine optimum population density of varying chickpea canopy types, i. e., leaf type and growth habit, by investigating seed yield responses at 30 to 85 plants m- 2 and ii) identify desirable parental traits for breeding programs by assessing growth and yield parameter responses to varying leaf types and growth habits at a range of population densities. Field experiments were conducted from 2002 to 2005. Canopy measurements and calculated variables included light interception, biomass, growth rate, seed yield, harvest index, ascochyta blight severity and radiation- and water use efficiencies. The plant density which produced the highest seed yield when averaged over years for each location for each treatment revealed that a plant density of at least 55 plants m- 2 produced a 23 % to 49 % seed yield increase above that of the currently recommended plant density. This indicates that a higher seed yield average over the long term in spite of periodic low seed yield episodes will be more profitable to producers. Increasing plant density increased lowest pod height significantly in all except one location-year but did not explicitly increase ascochyta blight severity or decrease individual seed size. This suggests that increasing the recommended chickpea plant density on the Canadian Prairies will increase seed yield but would neither negatively impact individual seed size nor ascochyta blight severity, especially, when combined with good agronomic practices. Fern-leaved cultivars had significantly higher maximum <b>intercepted</b> <b>light</b> (62 to 91 %), seed yield (136 to 369 g m- 2), harvest index (0. 33 to 0. 53), yield-based water use efficiency (0. 56 to 1. 06 g m- 2 mm- 1) and lower ascochyta blight severity (3 to 27 %) than the unifoliate cultivars in all location-years. The fern-leaved cultivars also tended to show significantly higher cumulative intercepted radiation (221 to 419 MJ m- 2) and biomass (306 to 824 g m- 2) but leaf type showed no consistent effect on radiation use efficiency. Cultivars with bushy growth habit generally performed better regarding maximum <b>intercepted</b> <b>light</b> (62 to 90 %), cumulative intercepted radiation (233 to 421 MJ m- 2), biomass (314 to 854 MJ m- 2), seed yield (120 to 370 g m- 2), harvest index (0. 37 to 0. 50), yield-based water use efficiency (0. 56 to 1. 06 g m- 2 mm- 1) and ascochyta blight severity (7 to 36 %) than the erect cultivars. The overall performance of the spreading cultivar was generally intermediate between the bushy and erect cultivars except for ascochyta blight severity where the spreading cultivar exhibited significantly lower disease severity (3 to 36 %). Radiation use efficiency was generally not influenced by growth habit. Increasing plant population density generally increased <b>intercepted</b> <b>light,</b> biomass and cumulative intercepted radiation on each sampling day after seeding resulting in a general increase in seed yield. Harvest index, however, remained constant and ascochyta blight severity was generally stable but radiation use efficiency decreased with increasing population density.

Vines, with four canes and about 10 - 12 buds per cane, were spaced 2. 50 x 2. 50 m and trained to a ‘Tendone’ system. The vineyard was managed according to the ordinary techniques of the area. Three levels of crop load were imposed at fruit set: treatment 1 (UT) or unthinned control, with about 70 clusters per vine; treatment 2 (T 50), in which 50 % of the clusters were thinned and 1 cluster per shoot was retained; treatment 3 (T 75) - in which 75 % of the clusters were thinned and 1 cluster every two shoots was retained. Leaf area evolution was evaluated by collecting shoots from mature vines. Six or eight shoots, randomly chosen from 5 vines, were sampled monthly from 15 days after bud break to the end of September. The following measurements were performed on each shoot: number of stem leaves and lateral leaves, leaf area of stem and lateral leaves, stem and lateral length. Leaf area was measured using a photometric area-integrating meter (LI-COR Model LI- 3100, manufactured by Lambda Instruments Corporation). Transmitted photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFDt) at the base of the canopy (0. 2 - 0. 3 m above the ground surface) was determined using a linear PAR Ceptometer (Accupar - Decagon Device, Inc., Pullman, Wash.). Measurements were taken on three different vines per treatment over the single vine spacing area on a grid of 0. 2 x 0. 1 m. Incident PPFD (PPFDi) was measured outside of the trees every five minutes. Measurements were taken around noon of sunny days from May to September. Intercepted PPFD (PPFDin) was calculated for each point of the grid as the difference between PPFDi and PPFDt; diffused and reflected components of PPFD were not considered.

Here, PARP-plants showed a more pronounced decrease of F-v/F-m than C 24, which {{can be interpreted as}} a more efficient strategy for survival in mild chilling stress. Finally, the reaction of Nicotiana tabacum L. to altered spectral composition of the <b>intercepted</b> <b>light</b> was monitored {{as an example of a}} moderate stress situation that affects chlorophyll-fluorescence related, but not growth-related parameters. The examples investigated in this study show the capacity for improved plant phenotyping based on an automated and simultaneous evaluation of growth and photosynthesis at high throughput...|$|E
40|$|An eight band {{spectral}} radiometer {{was used}} to measure the spectral composition of a solar radiation reflected from a sugar cane crop The fraction of <b>light</b> <b>intercepted</b> by the crop was measured with a ceptometer. The fraction of <b>light</b> <b>intercepted</b> by the crop was measured with a ceptometer. The ration of energy reflected in various wavebands was linearly correlated to the fractional light interception, one of the main determinants of crop growth. Thus, the measurement of spectral reflectance provides a useful way to predict dry matter production in crops...|$|R
40|$|Development {{and growth}} of leaves in cereals {{significantly}} affects grain yield since dry matter accumulation depends on the leaf area that <b>intercepts</b> <b>light.</b> Phyllochron (PHY) is defined as time interval between the emergences of successive leaves on the main stem. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of year and cultivar on phyllochron in winter barley. Twelve cultivars of winter barley differing in origin and time of anthesis were tested during six growing seasons (GS), from 2002 / 03 to 2007 / 08. The highest PHY across GSs was determined in the two-rowed cultivar Cordoba (81. 6 °Cd) and the lowest in the two-rowed cultivar Novosadski 581 (71. 0 °Cd). The early cultivars had fast leaf development, the medium cultivars medium and the late cultivars slow development, 72. 5 °Cd, 75. 6 °Cd and 78. 9 °Cd, respectively. The tested cultivars showed significant variability in the PHY, which can be used for selecting most adaptable genotypes for specific growing conditions...|$|R
40|$|Regulated deficit {{irrigation}} (RDI) during stage II {{of fruit}} development and summer pruning (watersprout removal, WSR) {{can be used}} to control excessive vegetative growth in high-density peach orchards. The dynamics of tree-light interception after the application of RDI (no irrigation during stage II) and WSR in summer were evaluated during two consecutive years. RDI and WSR treatments produced similar reductions in the percentage of <b>light</b> <b>intercepted</b> by the tree {{at the end of the}} 2 -year experiment. However, it was not possible to produce the same seasonal dynamics in the percentage of <b>light</b> <b>intercepted</b> by the tree using the RDI and the WSR techniques; RDI trees showed a gradual reduction in the amount of <b>light</b> <b>intercepted</b> as the productive cycle progressed, while WSR trees showed an immediate reduction in the amount of <b>light</b> <b>intercepted.</b> Moreover, the mechanisms responsible for vegetative growth reduction were different in the RDI and the WSR techniques. The RDI technique was associated with reductions in tree water status and decreases in gravimetric soil water (θg) and fruit growth capacity. RDI may have reduced θg below the threshold required for optimum fruit growth, whereas WSR reduced water consumption, improved water status and therefore could have benefited fruit growth. Therefore, RDI and WSR greatly differ when the mechanisms responsible for vegetative growth reduction are taken into consideration.
