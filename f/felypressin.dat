Study Design: A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted on 45 hypertensive patients who were divided equally into 3 parallel groups according to LA received. Group 1 : Lidociane 2 % with epinephrine 1 : 80, 000. Group 2 : Prilocaine 3 % with <b>Felypressin</b> 0. 03 IU/ml. Group 3 : Mepivacaine 3 % plain. Inclusion criteria: hypertensive patients, under medical management with blood pressure = 159 / 99. Exclusion criteria: Blood pressure = 160 / 100 and patients receiving ß blockers. Negative aspiration was mandatory before the injection of 2 cartridges of LA. Blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated by Electronic Sphygmomanometer and Pulse Oximeters in 3 different time-points; 3 minutes before LA, three minutes after LA and three minutes after extraction. Results: The mean of systolic blood pressure (SBP) had increased after LA injection, and then decreased after ex - traction in the 3 groups of patients.

40|$|Vasoconstrictors, such as {{epinephrine}} and norepinephrine, {{are commonly}} contained in local anesthetics to decrease systemic toxicity and prolong {{the duration of}} action by retarding anesthetic absorption. These catecholamines have varying degrees of α and β adrenergic effects, resulting in cardiac and hemodynamic changes. On the other hand, several investigators have reported that clinical doses of these drugs have little effects on cardiovascular system, {{as far as they}} are evaluated with such conventional parameters as heart rate and blood pressure. Thus, the problems about the permissible doses of catecholamines contained in local anesthetics in dentistry have been still in controversy. In recent years, however, detailed studies have clarified that catecholamines, even if in clinical doses, cause marked circulatory changes beyond expectation. Our date using echocardiography dernonstrated that 45 μg of epinephrine contained in lidocaine caused significant increases in heart rate and stroke volume with a resultant increase in cardiac output. Tachycardia was due to the action of epinephrine on β_ 1 receptors of the pacemaker cells. The increase in stroke volume was caused by an augmentation of myocardial contractility and a decrease in afterload. Mean blood pressure was relatively stabilized because of a reduction in total peripheral resistance in spite of the increase in cardiac output. In contrast to epinephrine, more than 72 μg of norepinephrine contained in lidocaine produced a remarkable increase in total peripheral resistance and corresponding elevation in mean blood pressure. The reason for this was that norepinephrine stimulated α_ 1 receptors of vessels in skeletal muscle, thus leading to vasoconstriction. The elevation in mean blood pressure brought about the negative chronotropic and inotropic changes of the heart through the baroreceptor reflex. <b>Felypressin,</b> non-adrenergic vasoconstrictor, has been believed to have no direct effects on the heart, although it is less effective than epinephrine in prevention of bleeding and anesthetic potency. For that reason, anesthetics containing <b>felypressin</b> are usually used by choice in dental patients with cardiovascular disease. However, a large dose of <b>felypressin</b> has been reported to constrict coronary artery. Recent investigations indicate that <b>felypressin</b> has distinct effects on circulation and a depressant effect on cardiac function in ischemic heart. Consequently, the doses of epinephrine and norepinephrine contained in local anesthetics should be less than 45 and 72 μg, respectively. In cardiac patients, the administration of low concentration of epinephrine might be necessary according to the degree of severity of the disease. ...|$|E
40|$|Brief {{precipitate}} {{heart rate}} rises {{of up to}} 40 beats/min were observed in nineteen of twenty-seven dental patients receiving local anaesthesia with 2 per cent lignocaine with adrenaline (1 : 80, 000). No such rises were seen after 3 per cent prilocaine with <b>felypressin</b> (0. 03 i. u. /ml) which therefore may be preferable for patients with cardio-vascular disease. In {{the course of a}} study of the effect of tranquil-lizing drugs on patients undergoing dental surgery (O'Neil et al., 1969) the heart rate was recorded during the whole procedure. The first few patients showed a "gradual rise " in heart rate (slow, steady increase) after the injection of the local anaesthetic (lignocaine 2 per cent with adrenaline 1 : 80, 000) and in most of them there were also "brief precipitate rises " (steep, brief increase) during or immediately after the injection (fig. 1). The question was raised whether these changes were due to the painful stimulus of the needle and the mucoperiosteal distension produced by the volume of liquid injected or whether it could be due to the adrenaline itself. It was therefore decided to compare the effects of local anaesthesia given with adrenaline with those of local anaes-thesia given with a vasoconstrictor without beta-adrenergic stimulant effect on the heart. METHODS Fifty-five patients in good general health (36 female, 19 male) {{with a mean age of}} 26 years (range 19 - 62) were studied. They were under-going oral surgery, mostly excision of impacted molars under diazepam sedation. Local anaes-thesia was obtained with 2 per cent lignocaine with adrenaline (1 : 80, 000) in 27 patients and with 3 per cent prilocaine with <b>felypressin</b> (0. 03 i. u. /ml) in 28 patients.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether infiltration of the upper eyelid skin is less painful with prilocaine than with lidocaine. Methods: In 40 consecutive patients scheduled for bilateral upper blepharoplasty, one upper eyelid was anaesthetised with lidocaine with epinephrine and the other with prilocaine with <b>felypressin.</b> After injection of each upper eyelid, the patient scored the pain experienced on infiltration using a visual analogue scale (0 - 10). In addition, the surgeon scored the need for reinjection during the operation; differences in perioperative bleeding; and degree of oedema, erythema and haematoma before discharge on a four-point rating scale (no, minimal, moderate or severe). Results: Pain scores were significantly lower in upper eyelids injected with lidocaine than in those injected with prilocaine (p = 0. 036). In addition, scores for oedema, erythema and haematoma were significantly lower in upper eyelids anaesthetised with lidocaine than in those anaesthetised with prilocaine (respectively, p = 0. 001, p = 0. 004 and p = 0. 000). Conclusions: Compared with prilocaine with <b>felypressin,</b> lidocaine with epinephrine is significantly less painful in anaesthetising the upper eyelids; gives significantly less postoperative oedema, erythema and haematoma; and provides better haemostasis during upper blepharoplasty.

40|$|O presente trabalho teve como objetivo analisar e comparar o efeito de agentes vasoconstrictores presentes nas soluções anestésicas locais, injetados por via intravenosa nas doses de 80, 160, 320, 640 e 1280 ng (adrenalina) ou 0. 5, 1, 2, 3 e 4 UI (felipressina), sobre a pressão {{arterial}} de ratos, hipertensos renais um-rim, um clip (1 R- 1 C) e 1 R- 1 C tratados com atenolol, comparando com animais nomotensos de mesmo peso e lote. Ratos Wistar machos pesando 150 g, foram anestesiados com mistura de igual quantidade de quetamina e xilazina (1 mL da mistura/kg), tiveram seu abdômen aberto e receberam um clip de prata com abertura 0, 25 mm na artéria renal esquerda, removendo-se cirurgicamente o rim direito (ratos 1 R- 1 C). Alguns desses animais, depois de 14 dias, tiveram sua pressão sistólica indireta registrada pela pletsmografia de cauda e começaram a receber tratamento com atenolol (90 mg/kg/dia) por gavage (1 R- 1 C tratados). Após 28 dias da implantação do clip, todos os grupos foram novamente anestesiados e implantaram-se cânulas de polietileno (PE- 50) na artéria carótida esquerda e veia jugular direita, para registro direto da pressão arterial e injeção de drogas, respectivamente. Animais de mesmo lote e peso serviram como controle (normotensos). O catéter arterial foi então conectadas ao sistema de registro computadorizado (PowerLab®) utilizando software específico (Chart 5 Pro ®). A pressão arterial (PA) e frequência cardíaca (FC) registradas durante os primeiros 5 minutos, foram consideradas como valores basais. Analisaram-se: a menor resposta hipotensora, maior resposta hipertensora, freqüência cardíaca média e duração da resposta, nos três grupos de animais, para cada dose injetada dos dois vasoconstrictores. Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância de medidas repetidas (ANOVA), seguida do teste de Holm-Sidak ou de Mann-Whitney, quando apropriado, a um nível de significância de 5 %. A felipressina, ao contrário da adrenalina, não apresentou ação hipotensora; por outro lado, ambas apresentaram respostas hipertensoras de magnitude semelhante nos 3 grupos de animais, notando-se tendência para menores respostas nos animais tratados com atenolol. A felipressina provocou queda de FC significativa (p< 0, 01) nos animais normotensos e tratados, causando aumento de FC nos hipertensos apenas com as maiores doses, enquanto que a adrenalina provocou aumento de FC dose-dependente nos normotensos e hipertensos, sem promover alteração da FC nos ratos tratados. A duração da resposta hipertensora provocada pela felipressina foi significativamente maior que a provocada pela adrenalina (p< 0, 01) em todos os grupos de animais, indicando possível efeito vasoconstrictor prolongado. Os resultados permitem afirmar que a felipressina apresenta ações semelhantes à adrenalina, com resposta hipertensora mais prolongada, nas populações de animais analisadas. Em função das doses e da via empregada nesse estudo, pode-se sugerir que a felipressina é bastante segura para populações hipertensas ou que estejam recebendo atenolol. The {{present study}} was designed to analyze and compare the effects of some vasoconstrictors, injected by intravenous route in the doses of 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1280 ng (epinephrine) or 0. 5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 IU (<b>felypressin)</b> upon the arterial pressure of normotensive, 1 K- 1 C hypertensive and 1 K- 1 C rats treated with atenolol. Male Wistar rats weighting 150 g were anesthetized with a mixture of equal proportion of ketamine and xylazine by intraperitonial injection (1 mL/kg) and 1 K 1 C hypertension was surgically induced by means of partial constriction of the main left renal artery with a silver clip with a 0. 25 -mm gap. The right kidney was surgically removed. Fourteen days after surgical procedures arterial pressure (AP) was indirectly measured (tail cuff method) to monitor the development of hypertension. Only 1 K 1 C rats with AP more than 150 mm Hg were included in the protocol and received by gavage (1 mL/d), for the next 14 days, atenolol (90 mg/kg/day). The treatments were carried out always between 8 and 9 AM. Four weeks after the surgical procedure all rats were anesthetized again with the same mixture and a catheter (PE 50) was inserted into the left carotid artery and right jugular vein, respectively to obtain a AP register and to inject drugs. The arterial catheter was then connect to the transducer and to computer register system (PowerLab®) using a Chart 5 Pro® software. The AP and heart rate (HR) registered in the first five minutes were considered basal values. The following parameters were registered: minimal hypotensive response, maximal hypertensive response, mean HR and response lenght (duration), in all animals groups, to every injected dose of epinephrine and <b>felypressin.</b> The data were analyzed by two ways repeated measures ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak or Mann-Whitney test, when appropriated. The significance level was 5 %. Epinephrine, but not <b>felypressin,</b> presents some hypotensive action with the lowest doses. However, both of them present hypertensive responses of same magnitudes in all groups, with non-significant reduced responses noted in the 1 K- 1 C atenolol group. The HR was significantly lowered by <b>felypressin</b> in the normotensive and 1 K- 1 C atenolol group; this vasoconstrictor agent produced elevated HR in hypertensive rats only with the greatest doses. Epinephrine caused dose-dependent increases in HR in normotensive and 1 K- 1 C without modifying the HR of 1 K- 1 C atenolol treated rats. The <b>felypressin</b> response length were significantly longer than that produced by epinephrine in all groups (p< 0, 01), indicating a prolonged vasoconstrictor effect. Our results suggest that <b>felypressin</b> has equipotent pressure responses when compared with epinephrine, showing greater extent of action. Considering the administration route, the doses used in this study and the concentration in local anesthetics cartridges, we suggest that <b>felypressin</b> was safe enough {{to be one of the}} vasoconstrictors of choice in hypertensive subjects and in those who received atenolol as a medication to lower their pressure...|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of {{the combination of}} vasoconstrictors to local anaesthetic solutions has been debated since its first use {{in the beginning of}} this century.

The epinephrine-containing local anesthetic significantly reduced the plasma potassium concentration 10 min after injection, by 0. 16 +/- 0. 20 mmol/L (mean +/- SD), and increased the blood glucose concentration at 10, 20, and 30 min (by 0. 46 +/- 0. 37, 0. 63 +/- 0. 45, and 0. 56 +/- 0. 28 mmol/L, respectively). Conversely, plasma potassium increased and blood glucose decreased 10, 20, and 30 min following the administration of the epinephrine-free solution. At 30 min potassium was increased by 0. 24 +/- 0. 16 mmol/L, and glucose was decreased by 0. 23 +/- 0. 16 mmol/L. It is concluded that epinephrine-free and epinephrine-containing local anesthetics differ in their metabolic effects during oral surgery with midazolam sedation...|$|E
40|$|FUNDAMENTO: A utilização de anestésicos locais associados a vasoconstritores para tratamento odontológico de rotina de pacientes cardiopatas ainda gera controvérsia, em razão do risco de efeitos cardiovasculares adversos. OBJETIVO: Avaliar e comparar os efeitos hemodinâmicos do uso de anestésico local com vasoconstritor não-adrenérgico em pacientes portadores de arritmias ventriculares, em relação ao uso de anestésico sem vasoconstritor. MÉTODOS: Um estudo prospectivo randomizado avaliou 33 pacientes com sorologia positiva para doença de Chagas' e 32 pacientes com doença {{arterial}} coronariana, portadores de arritmia ventricular complexa ao Holter (> 10 EV/h e TVNS), 21 do sexo feminino, idade de 54, 73 + 7, 94 anos, submetidos a tratamento odontológico de rotina com anestesia pterigomandibular. Esses pacientes foram divididos em dois grupos: no grupo I, utilizou-se prilocaína a 3 % associada a felipressina 0, 03 UI/ml, e no grupo II, lidocaína a 2 % sem vasoconstritor. Avaliaram-se o número e a complexidade de extra-sístoles, a freqüência cardíaca e a pressão arterial sistêmica dos pacientes no dia anterior, uma hora antes, durante o procedimento odontológico e uma hora após. RESULTADOS: Não foram observadas alterações hemodinâmicas, nem aumento do número e da complexidade da arritmia ventricular, relacionados ao anestésico utilizado, em ambos os grupos. CONCLUSÃO: Os resultados sugerem que prilocaína a 3 % associada a felipressina 0, 03 UI/ml pode ser utilizada com segurança em pacientes chagásicos e coronarianos, com arritmia ventricular complexa. BACKGROUND: The routine use {{of local}} anesthetics associated to vasoconstrictors for the dental treatment {{of patients with}} cardiopathies is still controversial, due {{to the risk of}} adverse cardiovascular effects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the hemodynamic effects of the use of local anesthetics with a non-adrenergic vasoconstrictor in patients with ventricular arrhythmia, when compared to the use of anesthetics without vasoconstrictor. METHODS: A prospective randomized study evaluated 33 patients with positive serology for Chagas' disease and 32 patients with coronary artery disease that presented complex ventricular arrhythmia at Holter monitoring (> 10 EV/h and NSVT), of which 21 were females, aged 54. 73 + 7. 94 years, submitted to routine dental treatment with pterygomandibular anesthesia. These patients were divided in two groups: group I received prilocaine 3 % associated with <b>felypressin</b> 0. 03 IU/ml and group II received lidocaine 2 % without vasoconstrictor. The number and complexity of extrasystoles were analyzed, as well as the heart rate and systemic arterial pressure of the patients on the day before, one hour before, during the procedure and one hour after the dental procedure. RESULTS: No hemodynamic alterations or increase in the number and complexity of the ventricular arrhythmia related to the anesthetic used in the dental procedure were observed in either group. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that prilocaine 3 % associated to a <b>felypressin</b> 0. 03 IU/ml can be safely used in patients with Chagas' disease or coronariopathy with complex ventricular arrhythmia...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} hypertension is increasingly common. Hypertensives are a problem because they exhibit a great lability of a blood pressure. The anticipation of dental treatment causes an initial elevation of the blood pressure which may be heightened by the stimulus of an injection or dental treatment. However, probably the underlying causes is endogenous adrenaline. Adrenaline is the most potent and efficient of vasoconstricting drug used in dental anesthetic solution. Lidocaine causes vasodilation, without adrenaline lidocaine is rapidly absorbed from the administration site. Vasoconstrictors are important additions to local anesthetic solutions. They {{improve the quality of}} pain control and its duration while decreasing the potential toxicity of the local anesthetic. Observation of dental clinic patients at Loma Linda University confirm the fact that the blood pressure is not elevated by the small amount of vasocontrictor (1 : 100, 000) contained in the most commonly employed dental anesthetic solution. All of the adrenergic amines can produce potentially dangerous cardiovascular effect and elicit disturbing subjactive response when high blood concentration are obtrained. For these reasons <b>Felypressin</b> a nonsymphatomimetic amine alternative for vasoconstriction has been used. An aspirating syringe should be used to avoid the risk of intra vascular injection when administering a local anesthetic solution and it is considered advisable to avoid adrenaline if the hypertension is not controlled...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{this study}} {{evaluated}} hemodynamic variations of normotensive and hypertensive patients undergoing dental extraction under local anesthesia with 3 % prilocaine with <b>felypressin</b> 0. 03 UI/ml. Material and Methods: 49 patients of the Department of Surgery and Maxillo-facial Traumatology ambulatory were evaluated, 30 normotensive and 19 hypertensive, presenting initial {{systolic blood pressure}} lower then 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure lower then 100 mmHg, besides being under medical supervision. Patients underwent molar or premolar extraction, typically deployed with maximum degree of mobility 2, according to Miller’s classification. The parameters evaluated were systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate, using an automatic digital pulse device, in the following periods: T 1 - initial (5 minutes {{before the beginning of}} surgery, T 2 – post-anesthesia (2 minutes after anesthetic administration); T 3 – trans-operatory (each 5 minutes after T 2 until 20 minutes completition, totalyzing 4 trans-operatory  mensurations); T 4 – post-surgery (5 minutes after surgery). Results: statistical analysis showed that for the parameters systolic blood pressure (P = 0. 959) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0. 754) no statistically significant difference for these parameters in different evaluation periods. The analysis of heart rate values showed no statistical difference (p < 0. 05) between the values obtained in T 1 in hypertensive and normotensive patients in T 3. 3. Conclusion: it was concluded that the evaluated hemodynamic parameters varied in different periods evaluated in the group of normotensive and hypertensive patients, but did not differ significantly...|$|E
40|$|Upper {{blepharoplasty}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly performed procedures by (oculo) plastic surgeons and it is generally recognized as a relatively easy technical procedure. However, seemingly minor aspects before, during and after surgery can be identified that significantly contribute to surgical outcome and patient satisfaction. Expansion of the knowledge of these aspects, followed by incorporation in clinical practice of novel findings, may allow plastic surgeons to further enhance the upper blepharoplasty outcome with concomitant low patient discomfort and high patient satisfaction. With our investigations we have attempted to clarify some of the prevailing uncertainties and ambiguities in upper blepharoplasty care. First of all, we have addressed two technical aspects of the procedure: the use of an alternative anesthetic agent to reduce pain during injection and a suture technique to reduce suture abscess formation. We have demonstrated that lidocaine with epinephrine is less painful; causes less postoperative edema, erythema and hematoma; and provides better hemostasis during upper blepharoplasty than prilocaine with <b>felypressin.</b> Furthermore, starting the suture within the wound reduces wound inflammation and suture abscess formation. Two (potential) consequences of upper blepharoplasty are addressed next, namely the sensory disturbances and the asymmetry that can occur or aggravate. We have demonstrated that sensibility fully recovers and that asymmetry is reduced after the blepharoplasty procedure. Last but not least, we have focused on to two widely applied rituals in upper blepharoplasty care and have confirmed that postoperative cooling and the use of arnica do not avert or reduce postoperative swelling, bruising and/or pain...|$|E
40|$|Summary After patient’s {{informed}} consent, the novice’s {{ability to}} learn three different nerve block techniques and their efficacy were studied. The first stage of learning was the performance of Gow-Gates and Akinosi-Vazirani mandibular nerve blocks, and Mariuzzi inferior alveolar nerve block, on three groups of patients scheduled for oral surgery. Then, the blocks were performed again on 25 (Gow-Gates), 20 (Akinosi-Vazirani) and 20 (Mariuzzi) patients. In this second stage of study the necessity for further infiltrations, the pain due to the block, the intra and postoperative pain, the number of positive aspirations, the pulp test on ipsilateral first premolar and central incisive were studied. In all patients prilocaine 3 % with <b>felypressin,</b> 1. 8 ml, were used. The learning stage was over after 13 patients treated with the Gow-Gates block, 14 with Akinosi-Vazirani block and 10 with Mariuzzi block. The variations of the first premolar sensitivity, were evaluated with the pulp test only when, an anaesthesia delay of the central incisive was observed. During {{the second stage of}} study, anaesthesia after Gow-Gates block, resulted earlier on first premolar than on central incisive. The patients treated with the Gow-Gates technique did not need further blocks of buccinator nerve, whereas the other patients needed it, (Akinosi-Vazirani 9 infiltrations, p< 0, 01; Mariuzzi 7 infiltrations, p< 0, 01). From results it appears that pain was light during block execution and absent during surgery, postoperative analgesia was prolonged and there were three positive aspirations during Gow-Gates blocks execution. The anaesthesia delay regarding the central incisive, observed after Gow-Gates block, may be explained by several factors: accessory innervations, peripheral nerve fibres located in the core of mandibular nerve, local anaesthetic dilution in tissues, etc...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{awareness}} of dentists in Riyadh city about treatment alternatives available for pregnant patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among 500 dentists practicing in Riyadh city. The questionnaire included data on dentists socio-demographic and practice characteristics in addition to management choices of the pregnant dental patient such as dental treatment practices and selected therapeutic choices. RESULTS: Out of the questionnaires distributed, 212 questionnaires were collected (42. 5 % response rate). Most of the participants were general practitioners, with less than 5 years clinical experience, who obtained their degree from local institutes and practiced in the government sectors. Over half of the participants stated that they would radiograph a pregnant patient who was suffering from pain from a tooth with doubtful diagnosis or would extract a non-restorable painful tooth. Two-thirds of the participating dentists would not replace a missing molar with a fixed partial denture during pregnancy. The majority of the participants (86 %) would give oral hygiene instructions, prescribe a mouthwash and do scaling and/or root planing for a pregnant patient with gingival bleeding and calculus deposits. In respect to antibiotics, the majority of the dentists (96 %) would prescribe amoxicillin to a pregnant patient. Of the four analgesic agents surveyed, paracetamol was the most popular analgesic agent (96. 7 %). On the use of local anesthetics, the majority of the dentists (75 %) would use lidocaine without vasoconstrictor and would not use prilocaine with <b>felypressin</b> vasoconstrictor. CONCLUSION: The study showed that there was a lack of knowledge about the clinical management of the pregnant dental patients among the surveyed dentists regardless of their socio-demographic and practice characteristics necessitating continuous dental education programs on the dental management of pregnant dental patients.

40|$|Objective: The use {{of local}} anesthetics {{associated}} to vasoconstrictor agents in dentistry is thoroughly justified and is widely extended, but we cannot {{ignore the fact}} that anesthetic infiltration poses risk of complications throughout the dental treatment period. The objective of the present review is to document the reported effects the use of the local anesthetics most widely employed in dentistry, with or without association to vasoconstrictor agents may have in patients with any sort of cardiopathy. Study Design: We have searched for randomized clinical trials on the assessment of the cardiovascular effects of local anesthetics used in dentistry, without limits as regards age or sex, conducted in patients with any type of cardiopathy which were published during the last decade and were index-linked in Cochrane, Embase and Medline. Results: We have found six randomized clinical trials index-linked in Medline and Cochrane in the past ten years. These trials compare different types of anesthetics: lidocaine 2 %, mepivacaine 2 %, prilocaine 2 %, associated or not to different vasoconstrictor concentrations such as adrenaline or <b>felypressin.</b> The cardiopathies affecting the patients included in the different trials range from hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrythmias, chronic coronary disease to heart transplantation. Conclusions: The use of anesthetics associated to vasoconstrictor agents is justified in the case of patients with cardiopathies (once we get over the period in which any type of dental manipulation is contraindicated) and in controlled hypertensive patients. In any case, we must be very careful with the choice and execution of the anesthetic technique, being it possible to use a dose between 1. 8 and 3. 6 ml, on a general basis. Further studies are necessary to establish the effects of these drugs on severe hypertensive patients or in patients with other more advanced cardiopathies...|$|E
40|$|Background HIV-associated lipoatrophy in {{a common}} and stigmatizing side effect of HIV infection, is aggravated by {{antiretroviral}} therapy; its presence causes distress and compromises adherence to therapy. PMMA filling {{is often associated with}} pain and discomfort. Objective To evaluate outpatient intervention using local dentistry anesthesia. Methods Patients complaining of facial lipoatrophy, from 10 / 2007 to 11 / 2011, were offered the filling with PMMA. Cases with bleeding potential, acute or decompensated chronic diseases or use of immunosuppressors or chemotherapy were excluded. Inclusion criteria: perception of distressing malar lipoatrophy and both the assisting physician and the applicant agreeing with potential benefit. After informed consent, patients were infused with 30 mg prilocaine/ 0. 03 IU <b>felypressin</b> in 1. 8 ml, using a carpule type syringe aiming to block the posterior superior alveolar nerve. This was followed by PMMA infiltration in different points at the malar region. At first return a simple questionnaire evaluating pain, satisfaction, grading 0 to 10 and if would repeat the procedure. Results All 64 eligible patients were included. Mean age 46 (13 to 73) years, mostly white (71. 87 %), males (68. 75 %), 37. 5 % of them MSM. Arterial hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (17 %), 78 % with viral load &# 60; 50 c/mL, with a median 585 CD 4 cells/mL (95 &#x 2013; 2063). On a median of 8 years on treatment, 1 / 3 had been exposed to three classes (NRTI/ NNRTI/PI), one antiretroviral-na&#x 00 EF;ve. Of the 12 patients who had detectable viral load in the first procedure, seven were suppressed to below 50 copies/mL during follow up. Two of the five patients remaining with detectable viremia died from other causes, 2 transferred and 1 remained na&#x 00 EF;ve. 127 procedures were made in 64 patients, a median of 2 (1 &#x 2013; 6) per patient. After a mean follow-up of 33 weeks, no infection or late complications were observed. Mean dispensed volume was 9 mL (1. 5 to 22). Pain grade was documented in 105 procedures; grade &# 60; 4 reported by 46 %, 4 &#x 2013; 6 by 34 %; 7 &#x 2013; 8 by 16 %, 9 by 2 %. All reported that the pain would not hamper future procedures; 94 % refer an overall satisfaction from 8 to 10. Conclusion The use of local anesthesia in dental facial filling with PMMA in patients with HIV lipoatrophy of the face is safe, decreases pain to tolerable levels and allows high levels of satisfaction with the procedure. The procedure may improve patient adherence to ARV...|$|E
