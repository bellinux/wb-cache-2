This <b>financial</b> <b>union</b> of the States was reprobated {{not only on the}} floor of Congress, but {{in different parts of the}} Union, as fraught with political evil.

50|$|After the Red Army {{invasion}} of Georgia, Abkhazia, hitherto an autonomous province within the Democratic Republic of Georgia, was declared a Soviet Republic, the SSR of Abkhazia, in March 1921 by the Abkhaz Revolutionary committee. However the republic's relations with Georgia and Russia were not formally settled. On December 16, 1921, Abkhazia signed a {{treaty of alliance}} with the Georgian SSR, which defined {{its status as a}} treaty republic (Russian: договорная республика) and established a military, political and <b>financial</b> <b>union</b> between the two Soviet republics, subordinating the SSR of Abkhazia to the Georgian SSR. Thus, through Georgia, Abkhazia joined the TSFSR and was initially on an equal footing with the other republics of the federation. On February 19, 1931, Abkhazia’s republican status was downgraded, on the orders of Joseph Stalin, to that of an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Georgian SSR.|$|E

40|$|European Banking Union has set {{new rules}} on {{monetary}} market especially for credit institutions and for financial banking groups in general. Economic and monetary union requires accomplishment {{of political and}} monetary union and democratic control of the European institutions on a single financial market. In this respect through its management organisms, EU has designed a series of unique mechanisms of <b>financial</b> <b>union</b> {{and called for a}} fiscal union. Union of European financial market is possible through a new regulation of the markets. In this project, monetary union of the EU member countries is possible by implementing single mechanism of supervision (Single Supervisory Mechanism) and single mechanism of resolution (Single Resolution Mechanism). European Banking Union may be made by monitoring of a single banking supervisor based on a common system for managing and resolving banking crises and a uniform system of protecting people's savings. Romania opted for these unique mechanisms of macro-prudential supervision of the financial system. And by performing the real convergence criteria of integration, Romania will have all conditions of integration in the,,euro area,,. ...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{union and}} {{monetary}} union are deeply connected: two {{dimensions of the}} third stage of European integration.

While banking union has advanced quite fast in the last two years, capital markets union is only a project, also the fiscal union, which is the basic foundation of a true political union. A complete <b>financial</b> <b>union</b> {{will take a long time}} to accomplish due to many political, financial and bureaucratic obstacles facing such an ambitious project. Energy Union is another important project meant to remove market fragmentation, to enhance energy security and to reduce environmental impact of energy sector.

40|$|The {{last year}} Report of the Five Presidents {{highlighted}} {{the necessity of}} progress in the EU in four directions: achieving “a genuine Economic Union, (…) a <b>Financial</b> <b>Union,</b> (…) a Fiscal Union, (and) a Political Union”. The associated roadmap for completing the EMU includes a greater focus on employment, a better implementation of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure, a better assessment of fiscal stance and fiscal sustainability, {{the completion of the}} Banking Union and the launch of a Capital Markets Union. They thus pointed to a very large set of ambitions which renewed the debate about the consistency of existing 6 -pack, 2 -pack and Fiscal compact, which were mainly related to fiscal and competitiveness issues. This roadmap raises an important question: is it possible within the given institutional setting to close the unemployment gap (the difference between actual and natural rates of unemployment), that is to say increase the “well-being of the peoples” (Art. 3 TEU) in a sustainable way, achieve public finance sustainability, reduce macro imbalances, and ensure the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and other objectives at the same moment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{euro area}} faces three {{interlocking}} crises that together challenge {{the viability of}} the currency union. There is a banking crisis: banks are undercapitalized and have faced liquidity problems. There is a sovereign debt crisis: a number of countries have faced rising bond yields and challenges funding themselves. Lastly, there is a growth crisis: economic growth is slow in the euro area overall and unequally distributed across countries. These crises connect with one another in several ways: the problems of weak banks and high sovereign debt are mutually reinforcing, and both are exacerbated by weak growth but also in turn constrain growth. This paper details the three crises, their interconnections, and possible policy solutions. Policy responses that fail {{to take into account the}} interdependent nature of the problems will likely be incomplete or even counterproductive. A broader point also becomes clear: a currency union may not need a fiscal union, but it does likely need both a <b>financial</b> <b>union</b> and some way to adjust for unbalanced economic conditions across countries. Considered almost unthinkable just a few years ago, a breakup of the euro area is today viewed as possible. Prices on the online betting market Intrade in March 2012 suggested that the probability that at least one country currently using the euro would leave the euro area by the end of 2013 was roughly 40 percent; these odds peaked at over 65 percent as recently as November 2011 (figure 1). The head of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, has acknowledged the possibility of countries ceasing to use the euro. Although he argued that leaving the euro would have serious negative consequences, his admission of the possibility was a shift in rhetoric from earlier statements, which had dismissed it as absurd. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a European Index of Regional Institutional Integration (EURII), which maps developments in European integration from 1958 to 2014 {{on the basis}} of a monthly dataset. EURII captures what we call: (i) the 2 ̆ 01 cCommon Market Era 2 ̆ 01 d, which lasted from 1958 until 1993; and (ii) the first twenty years of the 2 ̆ 01 cUnion Era 2 ̆ 01 d that started in 1994, but gained new impetus in response to the euro area crisis. The paper complements the economic narratives of the crisis with an institutional approach highlighting the remedies to the flaws in the initial design of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In fact, since 2010, EMU 2 ̆ 019 s institutional framework has been substantially reformed. While work on EMU 2 ̆ 019 s new governance is still in progress, the broad contours of a 2 ̆ 01 cgenuine union 2 ̆ 01 d have been outlined in the Four Presidents 2 ̆ 019 Report of December 2012. The report envisages a more effective economic union, a fiscal union, a <b>financial</b> <b>union,</b> and a commensurate political union. The aim of the EURII index is threefold: (i) to provide a tool to synthesise and monitor the process of European institutional integration since 1958 and, in particular, track institutional reforms since 2010; (ii) to expand a previous integration index by showing that monetary unification 2 ̆ 013 which was initially understood as 2 ̆ 01 cthe cherry on the Internal Market pie 2 ̆ 01 d 2 ̆ 013 implied a major discontinuity in the process and nature of European integration, that is, a new 2 ̆ 01 cpie on the cherry 2 ̆ 01 d; and (iii) to offer a tool for further research, policy analysis and communication...|$|E

The first part of my work deals with the negotiations about creation of the united Germany and about consequent results, primarily those of economic, social and <b>financial</b> <b>union.</b> I mention briefly the role of the EG in the whole process. In the second chapter I describe the state of economy of the former DDR and the after-unification measures that where drawn to improve the situation.

In the final part of this part I introduce the reader with the German way of privatization helped by the Treuhandanstalt privatization agency. In the third chapter I deal individually with the areas where the East is behind the West [...] structural insufficiencies, questionable innovative industry, low intensity of establishing of new companies and low inflow of investments, demographic progression, unemployment, salary conditions and indebtedness. In the fourth chapter I compare the New Länder with other problematic regions in Europe and with the countries of CEE. In the fifth chapter the differences among individual Länder are introduced by the macro-economic data.
