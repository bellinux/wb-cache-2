40|$|JWST will {{be tested}} {{incrementally}} during its construction, starting with individual mirrors and instruments (including cameras and spectrometers) and building up to the full observatory. JWST's mirrors and the telescope structure are first each tested individually, including optical testing of the mirrors and alignment testing of the structure inside a cold thermal-vacuum chamber. The mirrors are then installed on the telescope structure in a clean room at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). In parallel to the telescope assembly and alignment, the instruments are being built and tested, again first individually, and then {{as part of an}} <b>integrated</b> <b>instrument</b> assembly. The <b>integrated</b> <b>instrument</b> assembly {{will be tested}} in a thermal-vacuum chamber at GSFC using an optical simulator of the telescope. This testing makes sure the instruments are properly aligned relative to each other and also provides an independent check of the individual tests. After both the telescope and the <b>integrated</b> <b>instrument</b> module are successfully assembled, the <b>integrated</b> <b>instrument</b> module will be installed onto the telescope, and the combined system will be sent to Johnson Space Flight Center (JSC) where it will be optically tested in one of the JSC chambers. The process includes testing the 18 primary mirror segments acting as a single primary mirror, and testing the end-to-end system. The final system test will assure that the combined telescope and instruments are focused and aligned properly, and that the alignment, once in space, will be within the range of the actively controlled optics. In general, the individual optical tests of instruments and mirrors are the most accurate. The final system tests provide a cost-effective check that no major problem has occurred during assembly. In addition, independent optical checks of earlier tests will be made as the full system is assembled, providing confidence that there are no major problems...|$|R

40|$|Present econometric {{methodology}} of inference in cointegrating regression is extended to mildly integrated time {{series of the}} type introduced by Magdalinos and Phillips (2007, 2009). It {{is well known that}} conventional approaches to estimating cointegrat-ing regressions fail to produce even asymptotically valid inference procedures when the regressors are nearly integrated, and substantial size distortions can occur in econometric testing. The new framework developed here enables a general approach to inference that resolves this di ¢ culty and is robust to the persistence character-istics of the regressors, making it suitable for general practical application. Mildly <b>integrated</b> <b>instruments</b> are employed, one using system regressors and internally gen-erated instruments, the other using external instruments. These new IV techniques eliminate the endogeneity problems of conventional cointegration methods with near integrated regressors and robustify inference to uncertainty over the precise nature of the integration in the system. The use of mildly <b>integrated</b> <b>instruments</b> also provides a mechanism for linking the conventional treatment of endogeneity in simultaneous equations with the econometric methodology for cointegrated systems. The methods are easily implemented, widely applicable and help to alleviate practical concerns about the use of cointegration methodology when roots are in the vicinity of unity rather than precisely at unity...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedThis report discusses {{the development and}} evaluation of an <b>integrated</b> electronic <b>instrument</b> display designed to help alleviate pilot work load and improve aircraft control during the precision hover task while flying solely by reference to instruments.

Evaluation pilots {{were asked to rate}} the integrated display sgainst conventional flight instruments after flying a simulated night over-water rescue mission. The evaluation revealed that the simulated aircraft dynamics were susceptible to pilot induced oscillations in a hover and, therefore, unsatisfactory for use as an evaluation tool. In general, the evaluation pilots considered the integrated display preferable to conventional cockpit instruments; however, further study is recommended since meaningful quantitative data were not obtained.
