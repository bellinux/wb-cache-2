While it was an Eastern Slavic language, it is difficult to determine precisely what language he used as there was no conventional Belarusian language as we know it today.

Nevertheless, there is no doubt that Skaryna laid the foundations of the Belarusian literary language.|$|E
25|$|The future scholar {{also had}} a younger sister, Elena (Eliana). According to Gane, she and Udriște were the most educated of Radu's children, being taught {{to read and write}} <b>in</b> <b>Church</b> <b>Slavonic</b> and Koine Greek, and being {{introduced}} to art and history. Their father also displayed an interest in Renaissance literature; he had confiscated or bought a copy of Thomas à Kempis' The Imitation of Christ, in the Latin, while fighting a war in Moldavia. Helped by a private tutor, Udriște used that same book to learn Latin, which he could speak to perfection. In addition to Latin, Slavonic and Greek, Udriște was fluent in Russian. Some authors have suggested that Năsturel also attended school in Kiev Voivodeship, but this is not attested by any contemporary source.|$|E
25|$|The psalter {{is written}} <b>in</b> <b>Church</b> <b>Slavonic</b> of the Serbian recension, the medieval {{literary}} {{language of the}} Serbs. The book's text contains no vernacular or dialectal traces, as {{can be found in}} some Serbian manuscripts. The Cyrillic orthography used in the psalter mostly adheres to the norms of the Resava literary school, which developed {{in the last quarter of}} the 14th century and the first decades of the 15th century. The Resava orthography became dominant in Serbian literature, but it never fully ousted the rules of the older Raška literary school. The usage of the Raška orthography in the Goražde Psalter is comparable with that in the Crnojević Psalter published in Cetinje in 1495, though there are also notable differences between the two books. The former uses both yers, ъ and ь, as prescribed by the Resava school, while the latter uses only ь.|$|E

He was {{captured}} and imprisoned by the Bulgarian ruler Samuel. After marrying Samuel's daughter Kosara, he returned to his country. Emperor Basil, having overcome Bulgaria, attacked the Serbian lands, but Vladimir repulsed him. Basil advised the new Bulgarian ruler, Vladislav, to kill Vladimir by trickery. Vladislav invited Vladimir to visit him, as if to discuss the needs of their peoples. When Kosara came to him instead, Vladislav received her with apparent kindness; therefore Vladimir came as well. Vladislav was able to cut off his head only after Vladimir gave him his own sword. The saint then carried his severed head to the church he had built near Alba, and died there; it was AD1015. He was buried in the church. During Vladislav's siege of Dyrrachium, Vladimir appeared before his murderer when he dined, and slew him while he cried for help. The saint's relics then gushed myrrh, curing various illnesses. The kontakion which is contained, among other hymns, in the Church Slavonic akolouthia published as part of Srbljak, praises the saint: ...|$|E
500|$|A Serb, Lazar {{was born}} in the town of Prizren, in the Serbian Empire.

[...] speak of Lazar, newly arrived from Serbia, inventing and building a clock on a tower in the Grand Prince's palace in Moscow behind the Cathedral of the Annunciation at the request of Vasily I, the Grand Prince of Moscow (r. 1389–1425). It was the first ever spring-driven (mechanical) clock, or striking clock, in Russia, and also the country's first public clock. The clock numbers were written <b>in</b> <b>Church</b> <b>Slavonic.</b> It was among the first ten such advanced clocks in Europe, and was regarded a technical miracle at the time. Clocks in urban towers, or municipal hour signals, did exist earlier in Italy, though it is not known how they indicated the hours. In 1344, Paduan chronicles confirmed an entirely new technology – a clock in a tower at the Paduan palace which automatically struck the hours (24h).|$|E

2500|$|While the semantron was {{inherited}} from Greece, {{the use of}} church bells was imported into Russia from Western Europe. [...] The Russian word for bell is kolokol, which comes from the German word glocke, derived from the Latin clocca, which in turn appears {{to come from the}} Irish clog. [...] The word for bell <b>in</b> <b>Church</b> <b>Slavonic</b> is kampan, which is derived from Latin campana. During the fifteenth century the semantron began to be gradually replaced by bells. [...] At that time, several foundries for bell making were established in Russia. [...] Russian church bells are commonly cast using a mixture of bronze and tin, often with silver added to the bell metal, to produce their unique sonority and resonance. Russian bells also tend to differ from Western bells in the proportion of their height to width, and the method of varying the thickness of the walls of the bell. The clapper ("tongue") of the bell also follows a different design than that used in the West.|$|E

Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special diacritic symbol titlo, as shown in the figure at the right.

However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to [...] "good" [...] beings and the same words, when referring to [...] "bad" [...] beings, are spelled out; for example, while [...] "God" [...] {{in the sense of the}} one true God is abbreviated as [...] "", [...] "god" [...] referring to [...] "false" [...] gods is spelled out.

40|$|This study {{treats the}} verbal aspect system <b>in</b> Old <b>Church</b> <b>Slavonic.</b> A proper {{analysis}} of the aspect system <b>in</b> Old <b>Church</b> <b>Slavonic</b> can contribute {{to a better understanding}} of verbal aspect in the modern Slavic languages and the development of aspect in Slavic. In this study, it is demonstrated that the verbal aspect system <b>in</b> Old <b>Church</b> <b>Slavonic</b> can best be described if one categorizes the verbs into three main categories: perfective, imperfective and anaspectual. This differs from the traditional division into perfective and imperfective verbs only. To support this categorization, the study contains over 300 examples. The semantic {{analysis of the}}se examples shows, amongst others, that within the typology of Slavic aspect, verbal aspect <b>in</b> Old <b>Church</b> <b>Slavonic</b> functions more like verbal aspect in the Western group of Slavic languages (e. g. Czech) than like that in the Eastern group (e. g. Russian). The Eastern group can therefore be regarded as the more innovative group, while the Western group is the more conservative. The study also discusses the role the imperfect tense possibly plays in the development of derived imperfective verbs and, through that, in the development of the perfective-imperfective aspect opposition in Slavic...|$|R
