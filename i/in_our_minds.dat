All such constructions create dualities <b>in</b> <b>our</b> imagination, are Maya. The true reality, state Karikas 33-36, is nondual and it is Atman. Those who have mastered and grown past all attachments, past all fear and past all anger, they are past all dualities, know their Self, have secured the nonduality within. According to Karika 36-38, such wise individuals, do not care about praise from anyone, are beyond all rituals, are homeless wanderers, for they have realized the true inside them and outside; they, translates Potter, [...] "remain steadfastly true to nature".|$|R

500|$|Her early {{performances}} {{brought her}} immediate success in Britain, but she remained largely unknown {{in other parts}} of the world until the release of Gone with the Wind. In December 1939, film critic Frank Nugent wrote in The New York Times, [...] "Miss Leigh's Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up. She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable", and as her fame escalated, she was featured on the cover of Time magazine as Scarlett. In 1969 critic Andrew Sarris commented that the success of the film had been largely due to [...] "the inspired casting" [...] of Leigh, and in 1998, wrote that [...] "she lives <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence". Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that Leigh [...] "brilliantly played" [...] her role.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} planned as {{a documentary about}} Thirty Seconds to Mars' creative process while recording their next album, but upon {{the advent of the}} lawsuit, was retooled as a documentary about making that album {{in the face of a}} legal battle that might prevent it from being released. Leto described the film as [...] "a really special, DIY project." [...] He explained, [...] "We all shared a part of our lives that we've never shared on-screen before, a very intimate and personal part of our lives. We take you ... inside the studio, and in our hearts, and <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds,</b> to share how difficult this point is in our lives—just battling this massive corporation, and fighting for what we believe in."

500|$|Wenger at {{the start}} of the season prioritised regaining the league title: [...] "I feel it is very {{important}} <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> to do this and I know the hunger is strong to do it," [...] and named Newcastle United and Liverpool, along with Manchester United and Chelsea, as Arsenal's main rivals for the Premier League. Former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson asserted that his old club were favourites because they had the [...] "best players … If they all remain fit week-in week-out then they will not be beaten." [...] Glenn Moore of The Independent wrote of Arsenal's chances: [...] "They will be thereabouts, but unless Wenger finally puts his faith in youth, and the likes of Jérémie Aliadière, Jermaine Pennant and Phillipe Senderos repay him, they may lack the depth to sustain a title campaign." [...] Defender Sol Campbell however believed the squad was [...] "strong enough for the league and FA Cup", but doubted their chances of winning the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
500|$|Ned Block {{proposed}} {{a distinction between}} two types of consciousness that he called phenomenal (P-consciousness) and access (A-consciousness). [...] P-consciousness, according to Block, is simply raw experience: [...] it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies' and responses at the center. These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called qualia. [...] A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we perceive, information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we introspect, information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we remember, information about the past is access conscious, and so on. [...] Although some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have disputed the validity of this distinction, others have broadly accepted it. [...] David Chalmers has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging: [...] he calls this the hard problem of consciousness.|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} {{in this story}} {{is that of a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship between a planet and its inhabitants, similar to that in The Word for World Is Forest. In her introduction to the story, Le Guin stated [...] "We all have forests <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds.</b> Forests unexplored, unending. Each of us gets lost in the forests, every night, alone." [...] The [...] "vegetable love" [...] referred to in the poem from which the title is taken can be used to describe the final relationship between Osden and the planetary intelligence of World 4470. When Osden is attacked by Porlock in the planet, he transmits his fear to the planet, which amplifies it and reflects it back at him. Thus Osden's role {{is similar to that of}} Selver in The Word for World is Forest, in that he introduces violence to the forest world. The intelligence of Le Guin's forest has been contrasted to the [...] "low" [...] position occupied by vegetative beings in the works of other science fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke.|$|E
500|$|In Chapter 2 of the Proslogion, Anselm defined God as a [...] "being than {{which no}} greater can be conceived". He {{suggested}} that even [...] "the fool" [...] can understand this concept, and this understanding itself {{means that the}} being must exist in the mind. The concept must exist either only <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> or <b>in</b> both <b>our</b> <b>mind</b> and <b>in</b> reality. If such a being exists only <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> then a greater being—that which exists in the mind and in reality—can be conceived (this argument is generally regarded as a reductio ad absurdum because {{the view of the}} fool is proven to be inconsistent). Therefore, if we can conceive of a being than which nothing greater can be conceived, it must exist in reality. Thus, a being than which nothing greater could be conceived, which Anselm defined as God, must exist in reality.|$|R

500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|Other Coward works {{produced}} in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays Easy Virtue (1926), a drama about a divorcée's clash with her snobbish in-laws; The Queen Was in the Parlour, a Ruritanian romance; This Was a Man (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; The Marquise (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; Home Chat (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues On with the Dance (1925) and This Year of Grace (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, [...] "A Room with a View". His biggest failure in this period was the play Sirocco (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred Ivor Novello, of whom Coward said, [...] "the two most beautiful {{things in the world}} are Ivor's profile and my mind". Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre. Coward later said of this flop, [...] "My first instinct was to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> to practically the entire population of the British Isles." ...|$|E
500|$|Lutyens' [...] {{memorial}} in Ayscoughfee Hall gardens was constructed by Hodson Limited of Nottingham, {{at the south}} end of the formal gardens, replacing an earlier castellated tower—a 19th-century folly known as the [...] "Owl Tower". The unveiling took place at a ceremony on 9 June 1922, presided over by General Sir Ian Hamilton and dedicated by Reverend Alfred Jarvis, Assistant Chaplain-General to Northern Command. Barbara McLaren attended the ceremony along with several other members of the Jekyll and McLaren families. Several dignitaries gave speeches at the ceremony, including Jarvis, who spoke of the dead among the poppies on the Western Front, a [...] "symbol of oblivion". Hamilton spoke of the results of the carnage of the war; referring to the idea that the First World War was the war to end war, he told the assembled: [...] "The result has been so different. Europe is a seething cauldron of racial hatred; Ireland [...] is linked <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> with the idea of murder; Mesopotamia , India, and Egypt are straining at the leash of civilisation." [...] The general concluded: [...] "If you want to end war, you must end hatred" [...] and that [...] "In that way, I believe we shall be working towards peace, and in that way we will be doing in our own small way our best each of us—and Spalding minds united are a great force—and in that way we shall perpetuate the memories of those whose untimely deaths we have come here to commemorate". At the conclusion of the speeches a lone bugler played the [...] "Last Post" [...] and the crowd sang the national anthem, after which the dignitaries—including McLaren and her sons—laid floral tributes around the Stone of Remembrance.|$|E

500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E
500|$|After co-starring on 2004's {{fourth season}} of The Shield on cable network FX, Close told network {{president}} John Landgraf {{that she would}} be open to star in another series, suggesting a spin-off for her Shield character, Captain Monica Rawling. Landgraf pitched Damages to Close, who agreed to play Patty so long as the series was shot in New York City, where she resides. To prepare for her role, Close met New York attorney Mary Jo White and her partner Lorna Scoffield, as well as litigator Patricia Hines, from whom Close learned [...] "some extraordinary things". The producers sought after Byrne to play Ellen, but she was unavailable during the first round of auditions as she was filming 28 Weeks Later. She says the opportunity [...] "came up again, so I went in, auditioned, and got the role". Like Close, Byrne spent time with a female lawyer in New York and read books written by litigators Alan Dershowitz and David DuBois, while Donovan talked to his uncle, a New York corporate lawyer. He visited Manhattan's Centre Street courts, where he [...] "followed the most intense murder trial". Ivanek was so eager to work on the series that he auditioned for two different roles, and was cast as Ray. Todd Kessler said that Danson's 1979 film The Onion Field was [...] "a huge influence on Glenn, Daniel and myself, and that was something that had always stuck <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds.</b> And when we sought out to cast this role of Arthur Frobisher, Ted kind of came into focus." [...] In preparation for his role, the producers asked Danson to meet with CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations and watch documentaries such as , which examines the collapse of Enron. They also suggested that Danson meet with Close's acting coach Harold Guskin. The producers said that David and Katie were the hardest characters to cast. Noah Bean, who felt that he gave [...] "an awful first audition" [...] for the role of David, was called in for a second reading as he was waiting for an elevator to leave the building, and was ultimately cast. British actress Anastasia Griffith's agent informed her of the audition for the role of Katie only two hours before it began. When she met the producers, they were initially concerned about a Brit playing an American, especially since Australian Byrne had already signed on. [...] "To put their fears at rest", Griffith addressed the producers in an American accent from beginning to end of the audition. After being cast, Griffith and Byrne visited New York University dialect coach Deborah Hecht to perfect their accents.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds,</b> her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
