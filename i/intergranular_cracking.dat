40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine how the deformation propensities of individual grains of 316 L stainless steel influence <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> behavior in supercritical water (SCW). The grain-to-grain variations in deformation propensities were estimated from the Schmid and Taylor factors of grains. Resulting stress inhomogeneities and strain incompatibilities which were evaluated to determine the conditions that promoted <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> in SCW. Proton irradiation of 316 L caused hardening and radiation induced depletion of chromium at grain boundaries and was found to increase <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> severity. The SCW environment increased the crack density on the gage surfaces of the specimen by a factor of 18 compared to a 400 ˚C argon environment. Intergranular cracks preferentially occurred along grain boundaries oriented perpendicular to the tensile axis and adjacent to grains with low Schmid factors. The Schmid-Modified Grain Boundary Stress (SMGBS) model was developed to analyze local grain boundary stresses. The model was validated by showing that the Schmid factor dependence of cracking in SCW could be predicted from the trace inclination distribution, and confirmed that cracking was driven by the normal stresses acting on grain boundaries. The similar dependencies of slip discontinuity and <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> on trace inclination, Schmid factor, Taylor factor, and grain boundary character suggest that slip discontinuity contributes to <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking.</b> Grains with low Taylor factors decreased slip discontinuity propensity at grain boundaries with trace inclinations > 50 ˚ because they provided multiple favorably oriented slip systems on which deformation could occur. Grain boundary engineering reduced the <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> propensity of 316 L stainless steel in SCW by virtue of the fact that special grain boundaries were more resistant to <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> in SCW than random high angle grain boundaries. The findings of this study indicate that the <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> resistance of 316 L stainless steel in a SCW environment would be greatest for a microstructure with a large population of grains with high Schmid factors (for a specified stress state), a high frequency of grain boundaries oriented nearly parallel to the tensile direction, and a large fraction of special grain boundaries...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} of polycrystalline materials to <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> can {{be influenced by}} the microstructure. In sensitized stainless steels, for example, the grain boundaries prone to sensitization form paths of low resistance for intergranular stress corrosion cracking. The nonsensitized grain boundaries, such as twin boundaries, have been observed to encourage the formation of crack bridging ligaments. Computational models of <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> have been developed to investigate the consequences of crack bridging, through its effects on crack propagation in microstructures with different fractions of nonsensitized boundaries. This paper introduces the recently developed, two-dimensional model for <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> with crack bridging, and reports its application to investigate the effect of grain size. It is shown that the size of the crack bridging zone depends on the grain size, and the shielding contribution depends on the relative size of the bridging zone compared to the crack length. It is concluded that both grain refinement and increase in the fraction of resistant boundaries can improve microstructure resistance to <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking.</b> These observations are consistent with the effects of grain boundary engineering on stress corrosion cracking resistance in sensitized stainless steels.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research on}} the development of a simulation method {{for the study of the}} mechanisms of <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> nucleation and propagation in polycrystal metals on the mesoscale. Microstructural geometry models were built randomly using Voronoi techniques. Based on these grain structure geometry models, two-dimensional grain structure finite element models were created using a Patran Command Language (PCL) program. Techniques for the implementation of the cohesive elements between grain boundaries were developed in PCL for the generation of two-dimensional cohesive models. Simulations on <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> nucleation and evolution along grain boundaries using two-dimensional finite element cohesive models were carried out on the mesoscale level. Several aspects that affect the crack nucleation and propagation were studied, which included random grain geometries, grain boundary misorientations, grain boundary peak strength, grain boundary fracture energy, grain properties, and grain plasticity. The simulations demonstrated that the cohesive model is a useful and efficient modeling tool for the study of the <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> nucleation and evolution on the mesoscale level.

It is a complex degrading phenomenon which can have a significant influence on maintenance time and cost of PWRs’ core internals and hence, {{is an issue of}} concern. Recent studies have proposed using ion irradiation (to be specific, proton irradiation) as an alternative of neutron irradiation to improve the current understanding of the mechanism. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the cracking susceptibility of irradiated SA 304 L and factors contributing to cracking, using two different ion irradiations; iron and proton irradiations. Both resulted in generation of point defects in the microstructure and thereby causing hardening of the SA 304 L. Material (unirradiated and iron irradiated) showed no susceptibility to <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> on subjection to SSRT with a strain rate of 5 × 10 - 8 s- 1 up to 4 % plastic strain in inert environment. But, irradiation (iron and proton) was found to increase <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> severity of material on subjection to SSRT in simulated PWR primary water environment at 340 °C.

40|$|At high {{temperatures}} in air, introducing a dwell period {{at the peak}} stress of fatigue cycles promotes time dependent <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> growth which can increase crack growth rates by upto a few orders of magnitude from the rates of transgranular fatigue crack growth in superalloys. It is expected that time dependent <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> growth in nickel-based superalloys may not occur below a critical mechanical driving force, ΔKth−IG, analogous to a fatigue threshold (ΔKth) and a critical temperature, Tth. In this study, dwell fatigue crack growth tests have been carefully designed and conducted on Alloy 720 Li to examine such thresholds. Unlike a fatigue threshold, the threshold stress intensity factor range for <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> growth is observed to be highly sensitive to microstructure, dwell time and test procedure. The near threshold crack growth behaviour is made complex by the interactions between grain boundary oxidation embrittlement and crack tip stress relaxation. In general, lower ΔKth−IG values are associated with finer grain size and/or shorter dwell times. Often a load increasing procedure promotes stress relaxation and tends to lead to higher ΔKth−IG. When there is limited stress relaxation at the crack tip, similar ΔKth−IG values are measured with load increasing and load shedding procedures. They are generally higher than the fatigue threshold (ΔKth) despite faster crack growth rates (da/dN) in the stable crack growth regime.

40|$|At high temperatures, alloy 718, {{like many}} other nickel-based superalloys, is {{sensitive}} to an oxidation-assisted <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> (OAIC) growth mechanism. Former studies {{have pointed out that}} even if intergranular oxidation still occurred, <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> initiation was inhibited due to specific mechanical loadings which were identified as Portevin-Le Châtelier (PLC) plastic instabilities. In the present work, key parameters triggering crack initiation or PLC instabilities in the [550 – 700 °C] temperature range were determined for the studied grade by means of tensile tests on smooth specimens. Then, in order to assess the applicability of such a finding at a scale compatible with the material microstructure, a dedicated tensile V-shaped specimen was designed to generate different surface and sub-surface strain and strain rate histories. Thanks to a dual approach based on the observation of crack initiation location on this specific experimental specimen together with associated FE calculations, the critical mechanical loading paths inducing OAIC initiation have been specified.

40|$|As-fabricated EN 82 H welds are {{susceptible}} to low temperature embrittlements in 54 degree C hydrogenated water. Values of J[sub]IC in water are typically 90 % to 98 % lower than those in air due to a fracture mechanism transition from microvoid coalescence to hydrogen-included intergranular fracture. Environmental J[sub]IC testing demonstrated that a high temperature (1093 degree C) anneal and furnace-cool alleviates the material's susceptibility to hydrogen-induced <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking.</b> To identify metallurgical and compositional features {{that are responsible for}} the material's environment-sensitive behavior, detailed characterization of the microstructure and grain boundary chemistry for the as-fabricated and as-annealed materials was performed. Results from light optical microscopy, analytical electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, Auger electron spectroscopy and mechanical property characterization are used to provide insight into the observed low temperature embrittlement phenomenon. The key microstructural feature responsible for low temperature cracking in as-fabricated welds appears to be fine niobium and titanium-rich carbonitrides that cover most grain boundaries. These precipitates are effective hydrogen traps that promote hydrogen-induced <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking.</b> Dissolution the fine carbonitrides during the 1093 degree C anneal reduces grain boundary trapping sites, which accounts for the improved fracture resistance displayed by the annealed weld. The role of strength level in promoting low temperature embrittlement is evaluated by cold-rolling the annealed weld to increase its yield strength from 280 to 640 MPa. The annealed and cold-rolled weld exhibits high toughness in 54 degree C water and shows no evidence of hydrogen-induced <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking,</b> thereby demonstrating that strength is not a primary cause of low temperature embrittlement...|$|E

The 7075 -T 6511 specimens were fabricated from C- 141 aircraft upper wing skin panels. A non-destructive ultrasonic inspection was carried out to determine the depth of the exfoliation corrosion damage. Some corroded specimens were treated using UIT. Fatigue tests were carried out using the naturally exfoliated and UIT treated specimens. With the aid of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fractographic analyses were carried out on the fatigue specimens to determine the crack nucleating mechanism. The preliminary results suggested that the UIT had a potential to extend the fatigue lives of the naturally exfoliated 7075 -T 6511 specimens to some extent, depending on the level of exfoliation. For the lightly exfoliated specimen, the UIT changed the crack nucleating mechanism from <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracking</b> in exfoliation to fretting in the grips, which then resulted in a much longer fatigue life.

40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} growth {{behaviour}} of ultrafine grained (UFG) 6061 aluminium alloy processed by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) is studied and discussed {{in relation to}} the crack path and grain microstructure. The UFG samples exhibited a lower fatigue threshold, a unique transitional regime where only modest increases in crack growth rates resulted with increases in stress intensity amplitude and higher crack growth rates in the steady state regime than their coarse grained counterpart. Electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) was used for microstructural analysis in the crack tip process zone and outside the crack region to study fatigue induced changes and also provide a detailed analysis of crack path. A combination of <b>intergranular</b> and transgranular <b>crack</b> growth was reported at the fatigue threshold. Grain boundary sliding is a likely mechanism for <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> growth in the near threshold regime and is proposed to transfer plastic strain leading to a reversible plastic zone size that is ~ 10 times the grain size. The relative toughness of grain boundaries to grain interiors is estimated to be 0. 68. It is proposed that ECAP weakens grain boundaries, resulting in more near threshold <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> growth, grain boundary sliding and a lowering of the fatigue threshold with ECAP passes. The transitional regime featured a granulated surface where increased roughness-induced crack closure (RICC) effects may occur. A purely <b>intergranular</b> <b>crack</b> growth mode may result from a concentrated incompatibility of plastic deformation in adjacent grains. The UFG samples show a higher crack growth rate in the steady state regime which may be attributed to lower roughness induced crack closure effects and some cleavage crack growth.

40|$|A super-heater’s {{boiler tubes}} {{presented}} external longitudinal cracks. The tubes’ external surfaces presented a reddish-white layer consisting of paraffin chains: CH, functional groups: CO, NH and sulphur compounds. This brittle layer prevented heat transfer, thereby causing increased tube temperature. Creep led to failure due to long-term overheating. The steel tubes’ microstructure presented grain growth, cementite globulisation and <b>intergranular</b> <b>cracks</b> on the external surface. The foregoing observations support microstructure deterioration {{facilitated by the}} presence of unsuitable super-heater tube material when just using bagasse as fuel...|$|R
