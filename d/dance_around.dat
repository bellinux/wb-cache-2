5|$|As {{in other}} {{agricultural}} societies, Torajans dance and sing during harvest time. The Ma'bugi dance celebrates the thanksgiving event, and the Ma'gandangi dance is performed while Torajans are pounding rice. There are several war dances, {{such as the}} Manimbong dance performed by men, followed by the Ma'dandan dance performed by women. The aluk religion governs when and how Torajans dance. A dance called Ma'bua can be performed only once every 12 years. Ma'bua is a major Toraja ceremony in which priests wear a buffalo head and <b>dance</b> <b>around</b> a sacred tree.|$|E
5|$|Originally, EVE {{would have}} been {{electrocuted}} by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection {{at the hands of}} the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to <b>dance</b> <b>around</b> the ship. Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the Ratatouille short film Your Friend the Rat, created an end credits animation that continued the story—and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history—to clarify an optimistic tone.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also <b>dance</b> <b>around</b> the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E

25|$|The {{pillars of}} Ashoka are {{a series of}} columns {{dispersed}} throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, and erected by Ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century BCE. Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the swastika stands for the cosmic <b>dance</b> <b>around</b> a fixed center and guards against evil.|$|E

500|$|As Mimi {{refused to}} have a record player in her house, Lennon learned how to play his {{favourite}} songs by going to Julia's house. She played Elvis records to Lennon and would <b>dance</b> <b>around</b> her kitchen with him. In 1957, when The Quarrymen played at St. Barnabas Hall, Penny Lane, Julia turned up to watch. After each song she would clap and whistle louder than everyone else and was seen [...] "swaying and dancing" [...] throughout the whole concert. Lennon frequently visited her house during that period, detailing his anxieties and problems, where she gave him encouragement to continue with music over Mimi's objections.|$|E
500|$|Newman {{travelled}} to London {{to compose}} the end credits song [...] "Down to Earth" [...] with Peter Gabriel, {{who was one}} of Stanton's favorite musicians. Afterwards, Newman rescored some of the film to include the song's composition, so it would not sound intrusive when played. Louis Armstrong's rendition of [...] "La Vie en rose" [...] was used for a montage where WALL-E does not get EVE's attention on Earth. The script also specified using Bing Crosby's [...] "Stardust" [...] for when the two robots <b>dance</b> <b>around</b> the Axiom, but Newman asked if he could score the scene himself. A similar switch occurred for the sequence in which WALL-E attempts to wake EVE up through various means; originally, the montage would play with the instrumental version of [...] "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head", but Newman wanted to challenge himself and scored an original piece for the sequence.|$|E

[...] Traditionally, the dance [...] was led by the warrior who had hunted a big game or killed a man. He would wear his best clothes and a plume of red feather. He would wield a gun or dao and a shield. He would be followed by other dancers in a row, who would also carry weapons, or cymbals or gongs.|$|E
500|$|YAK Films is a three-man {{team that}} films urban <b>dance</b> <b>around</b> the world. It {{was founded in}} Oakland, California by Yoram Savion and Kash Grimes. Their first videos were of the Turf Feinz dance crew {{performing}} turfing—a regional hip-hop dance style from Oakland. After generating significant views on YouTube, they started YAK (Yoram And Kash) Films and added music producer Ben [...] "B'zwax" [...] Tarquin to the team. From shooting videos only in the United States, {{they were able to}} easily transition to covering dance events in Europe due to Savion's dual French citizenship. In 2009, they filmed Battle of the Year's first one-on-one b-boy competition, and in 2010 they filmed dance battles at Juste Debout, a French street dance competition. In addition to filming dance events and original freestyle performances, they post tutorials and upload a weekly web series called [...] "YAK Like You Know". Some of their more popular videos have been featured in Oakland Local and the Huffington Post.|$|E
500|$|The PKI {{are portrayed}} as enjoying violence, with the film heavily {{featuring}} [...] "eye-gouging women and decomposed, tortured bodies". The generals are kidnapped, and in several cases killed, {{in front of their}} families; later the captured generals are tortured while the communists <b>dance</b> <b>around</b> a bonfire. The sociologist Adrian Vickers suggests that the film's violence was meant to portray [...] "the state's enemies as outside the realm of the human", similar to monsters in horror films. Yoseph Yapi Taum of Sanata Dharma University notes that members of the leftist women's movement Gerwani are shown as part of a [...] "crazy" [...] Communist Party, dancing in the nude and cutting off the general's penises. However, Vickers considers these portrayals as ambiguous, suggesting that the New Order government was allowed a monopoly on violence. McGregor suggests that the violence in once-tranquil homes shows the [...] "'destruction' of the family". Sen notes the violence belies a [...] "representation of chaos before order" [...] which is common in New Order films.|$|E
