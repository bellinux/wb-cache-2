5|$|Archaeologists dug up the garden, while {{surveyors}} used infra-red beams {{to create}} a three-dimensional map of the area. A machete was found and sent for forensic tests. Police also searched the garden for Blakelock's truncheon and helmet. In October 2004 his overalls were retrieved from Scotland Yard's Crime Museum for <b>DNA</b> <b>tests.</b> Nothing was found {{that could be used}} as evidence.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} 5 of the {{individuals}} were <b>DNA</b> <b>tested.</b> Originally thought to be male, <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> revealed that DevilsGate5 is actually female; <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> also confirmed that DevilsGate1 is female, as originally believed. DevilsGate1 belongs to mtDNA Haplogroup D4, while DevilsGate2 belongs to mtDNA Haplogroup M.|$|R

5|$|Earliest reports put {{the death}} toll at eight, but Xinhua later revised the count several times, and then {{confirmed}} 53 deaths by 16 November. 26 bodies were identified using <b>DNA</b> <b>tests.</b> Some media outlets reported 79 fatalities by adding the number of identified victims {{to the number of}} previously reported fatalities, although Xinhua later said that the 26 identified were included amongst the 53.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{hardy breed}} with few breed {{specific}} health problems. The main hereditary problem {{highlighted by the}} American Sealyham Terrier Club is an eye condition called lens luxation, for which there are <b>DNA</b> <b>tests.</b> Lens luxation is {{a condition in which}} the lens slips out of position in the eyeball due to the weakening of the fibers that holds it in place.|$|E
50|$|The {{text of the}} Act {{amended the}} United States Code to include {{procedures}} for post-conviction <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> in federal court. Through the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction <b>DNA</b> <b>Testing</b> Program, the act established a federal grant program to provide money to states to defray the costs of post-conviction <b>DNA</b> <b>testing.</b> The program is named for {{the first man to}} be exonerated by use of post-conviction <b>DNA</b> <b>testing.</b> The act additionally contains provisions for increasing the quality of representation for indigent defendants in state capital cases, and for compensating victims of wrongful conviction.|$|R

50|$|No federally {{recognized}} tribe enrolls members solely {{based on}} <b>DNA</b> <b>testing,</b> as it generally cannot distinguish among tribes. Some tribes may require <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> only to document {{that a child}} is related to particular parents. Many researchers have published articles that caution that genetic ancestry <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> has limitations {{and should not be}} depended on by individuals to answer all their questions about heritage.|$|R
5|$|Although {{missing person}} cases are {{normally}} handled by {{local and state}} police, the FBI joined the investigation ten days after she disappeared. The FBI interviewed family from Massachusetts, and the Haverhill police chief disclosed that the search was now nationwide. Ten days after her disappearance, New Hampshire Fish and Game conducted a second ground and air search, using a helicopter with a thermal imaging camera, tracking dogs and cadaver dogs. Murray's older sister discovered a ripped white pair of women's underwear lying in the snow on a secluded trail near French Pond Road on February 26, but <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> found that the underwear {{did not belong to}} Murray.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> were {{performed}} on a sample of 45 men with the surname MacLeod, 47% were found to share a common ancestor in the male line (the remaining 53% of the sample contained 9 different genetic male line lineages). The genetic marker of the 47%-lineage {{was found to be}} the S68 branch of Haplogroup R1b. This marker is found not only the Western Isles, but also in Orkney, Shetland, England, Norway, and Sweden. In consequence, the study concluded that the genetic origin of Clan MacLeod likely lies in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Pelé had {{at least}} two more {{children}} from former affairs. Sandra Machado, who was born from an affair Pelé had in 1964 with her housemaid Anizia Machado, fought for years to be acknowledged by Pelé, who refused to submit to <b>DNA</b> <b>tests.</b> Although she was recognized by courts as his biologically daughter based on DNA evidence in 1993, Pelé never acknowledged his eldest daughter even after her death in 2006, nor her two children, Octavio and Gabriel. Pelé also had another daughter, Flávia Kurtz, in an extramarital affair in 1968 with journalist Lenita Kurtz. Flávia was recognized by him as his daughter.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> {{was used}} to {{exonerate}} Douglas Echols, {{a man who was}} wrongfully convicted in a 1986 rape case. Echols was the 114th person to be exonerated through post-conviction <b>DNA</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|R
25|$|Taking a genealogical <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> {{requires}} the submission of a DNA sample. The most common way {{to collect a}} DNA sample, which {{can be done by}} either visiting a <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> clinic or by ordering a home test through an independent <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> supplier, is by a cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab). Other methods include spit-cups, mouthwash, and chewing gum. After collection, the sample is mailed to a testing lab.|$|R

5|$|The <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> {{confirmed}} that Ramiro Pacheco {{was the son}} of Bueno and his surname was changed. Rodrigo's account at Credicoop Bank contained US$300,000, but it was emptied by his brother Ulises before it was blocked by Judge Sangiorg. The copyright holdings could not be transferred to Ramiro Bueno, since the original compositions of his father as well as other assets were registered on his behalf under the name of Ulises. Beatriz Olave negotiated deals over the image of Bueno for use on the jersey of the soccer team Club Atlético Belgrano.|$|E
5|$|The {{stains on}} Van der Sloot's clothes matched Flores' blood type. Blood {{was also found}} on the floor, hallway, and {{mattress}} in the hotel room. Police stated that <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> would be conducted on the clothes, skin found under the victim's fingernails, and the previously recovered tennis racquet. Ricardo Flores stated in interviews that his daughter's body needed to be exhumed to gather the fingernail DNA evidence, and that her body had not been cremated for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Whitaker {{was born}} in Longview, Texas, the son of Laura Francis (née Smith), a special {{education}} teacher who put herself through college and earned two master's degrees while raising her children, and Forest Steven Jr., an insurance salesman. According to <b>DNA</b> <b>tests,</b> his father was of Igbo descent, while his mother had Akan ancestry. When Whitaker was four, {{his family moved to}} Carson, California. Whitaker has two younger brothers, Kenn Whitaker, an actor, and Damon, and an older sister, Deborah. Whitaker's first role as an actor was the lead in Dylan Thomas' play Under Milk Wood.|$|E
50|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> {{was also}} used to {{establish}} his identity. A DNA sample obtained from Ansari's family {{was sent to the}} Saudi authorities by India. The <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> had matched and Saudi authorities were persuaded for handing him to India.|$|R
50|$|The muscle-specific isoform of the {{dystrophin}} gene {{is composed}} of 79 exons, and <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> and analysis can usually identify the specific type of mutation of the exon or exons that are affected. <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> confirms the diagnosis in most cases.|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} reopened in 2000 {{to allow for}} <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> on a stamp used to send one of the {{anonymous}} letters, but the tests were inconclusive. In December 2008, following an application by the Villemins, a Judge ordered the case reopened to allow <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> of the rope used to bind Grégory, the letters, and other evidence. This testing proved inconclusive. Further <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> in April 2013 on Grégory's clothes and shoes was also inconclusive.|$|R
5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he died by poison only and another view claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been shot through the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed to be that of Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E
5|$|By 2014, OR-7 {{had settled}} in the Rogue River {{watershed}} in the southern Cascade Range east of Medford, Oregon, with a mate. It is not known when the two wolves met, but <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> of fecal samples showed that she is related to wolves {{in two of the}} eight packs in northeastern Oregon. In early 2015, officials designated the two adult wolves and their offspring as the Rogue Pack, the first wolf pack in western Oregon and the state's ninth overall since wolves returned to Oregon from Idaho in the 1990s. The batteries in OR-7's tracking collar expired in October 2015, and monitoring the pack since then has depended on trail cameras and live sightings. Meanwhile, other wolves have migrated into the mountainous cross-border region, and relatives of OR–7 have formed two packs in northern California.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the bodies}} of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were exhumed from a mass grave near Yekaterinburg. They were {{identified}} {{on the basis of}} both skeletal analysis and DNA testing. For example, mitochondrial DNA was used to match maternal relations, and mitochondrial DNA from the female bones matched that of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whose maternal grandmother Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine was a sister of Alexandra. The bodies of Tsarevich Alexei and the remaining daughter were discovered in 2007. Repeated and independent <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> confirmed that the remains were the seven members of the Romanov family, and proved that none of the Tsar's four daughters survived the shooting of the Romanov family.|$|E
40|$|Background Many cancer-patients undergo <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> in the BRCA 1 / 2 {{genes to}} receive {{information}} about the likelihood that cancer is heritable. Previous nonsystematic studies suggested that <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> often does not fulfill the counselees' needs for certainty. We explored the balance between the counselees' need for certainty and perceived certainty (NfC-PC, i. e., level of fulfillment of NfC) regarding the specific domains of <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> result, heredity and cancer. We also examined relationships of NfC-PC with coping styles and distress. Method Before disclosure of BRCA 1 / 2 test results for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (T 1), questionnaires were filled in by 467 cancer-patients. Another questionnaire (T 2) was filled in after disclosure of pathogenic mutation results (n= 30), uninformative results (n= 202) or unclassified-variants (n= 16). Results Before and after <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> result disclosure, overall 5894 % of all counselees experienced unfulfilled NfC regarding the <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> result, heredity and cancer. Compared with T 1, the communication of pathogenic mutations (T 2) caused more fulfillment of the NfC about the <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> result, but less about cancer and heredity (pPC). Compared with T 1, uninformative results (T 2) caused more fulfillments of all needs than before disclosure (...|$|R

5|$|On 16 August 2007, {{acting on}} a suo motu notice, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took up the extrajudicial killings {{of the people at}} the Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa complex. Performance of the Islamabad {{administration}} attracted the reprimand of the court for its slow pace. The court was informed that 61 students were in custody, of whom 39 were on bailable offences. The Chief Justice of Pakistan ordered immediate release of 20 people considered innocent, as recommended by a joint investigation team. National Crisis Management Cell Director Javed Iqbal Cheema told the court that 28 <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> had not been confirmed. The Chief Justice also pointed out that Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali had stated that 30 bodies remained unidentified.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E
