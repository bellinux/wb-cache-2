5|$|Slight {{weakening}} {{took place}} after moving over western Cuba; however, once over the Gulf of Mexico, the storm steadily regained its strength. By September19, the system re-attained the equivalent intensity of a Category2 hurricane and the forward motion increased. <b>Early</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> the storm further intensified to attain its peak winds of 120mph (195km/h), {{equivalent to a}} mid-range Category3 cyclone. By the afternoon of September19, reports from the Louisiana and Mississippi coastline indicated that the outer bands of the hurricane were producing scattered rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{detonation}} {{was initially}} planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because {{of rain and}} lightning from <b>early</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation. A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45, and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison. By 05:30 the rain had gone. There were some communication problems. The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin arrived off Songjin, Korea on 15 March and {{concentrated}} her gunfire on enemy railway transport. <b>Early</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, {{when one of}} four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40mm mount; Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured. Wisconsin subsequently destroyed that battery with a full 16-inch (406mm) salvo before continuing her mission. After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.|$|E

5|$|General Buford {{recognized}} the importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg. He knew that if the Confederates could gain control of the heights, Meade's army {{would have a hard time}} dislodging them. He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town, Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. <b>Early</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> Reynolds, who was commanding the Left Wing of the Army of the Potomac, ordered his corps to march to Buford's location, with the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) to follow closely behind.|$|E
5|$|On July25, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 120km (75mi) west-southwest of Yap. Satellite imagery {{indicated that}} a low level circulation had developed and was under an area of light to moderate wind shear. The low traveled in a general northwest fashion as upper level outflow improved. By July 27, the low deteriorated, becoming elongated, and convection remained disorganized. However, as the low neared Central Luzon, Philippines, shower and thunderstorm activity {{near the center of}} the low increased, and based on its organization, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system a tropical depression <b>early</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> Shortly after, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as Tropical Depression Henry. As the depression neared the northern Philippines, wind shear increased, partially exposing the center of the system to the south. At 02:30UTC on June30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 00:00UTC the next morning, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W.|$|E
5|$|The first {{target of}} the WSGA was Nate Champion, {{who was at the}} KC Ranch (also known as Kaycee) at that time. They were tasked to perform the {{assassination}} that others had failed to carry out five months before. The group traveled to the ranch late Friday, April 8, 1892, quietly surrounded the buildings, and waited for daybreak. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men who were evidently going to spend the night on their way through were captured as they emerged from the cabin <b>early</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of the cabin. As the gunmen opened fire on the cabin, Champion grabbed the mortally wounded Nick Ray back to the cabin. The latter died hours later, and Champion was left besieged inside the log cabin alone.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July30, the cloud pattern of system quickly became better organized. Later after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, ships and satellite images confirmed that Tropical Depression Four had formed offshore {{of the north}} coast of the Yucatán Peninsula; although it was likely that the depression formed 80miles (129km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula several hours earlier than confirmed. The following morning after development occurred, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm 575miles (920km) southeast of Texas; the National Hurricane Center assigned it to the name Chantal. Although it became a tropical storm <b>early</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm until a reconnaissance flight confirmed tropical storm force winds about six hours later, when sustained winds were already 50mph (85km/h). Tropical Storm Chantal rapidly strengthened thereafter, with weather satellites indicating t–numbers increasing from 2.5to 3.5within twelve hours using the Dvorak technique. Chantal continued to intensify, and headed northwestward at 11mph (18km/h) due to weak ridging over Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{failed to}} intercept the Russian squadron as it attacked several transports south of Okinoshima Island on 15 June due to heavy rain and fog. The Russians sortied again on 30 June and Kamimura finally {{was able to}} intercept them the next day near Okinoshima. The light was failing when they were spotted and the Russians were able to disengage in the darkness. Jessen's ships sortied again on 17 July headed for the eastern coast of Japan {{to act as a}} diversion and pull Japanese forces out of the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. The Russian ships passed through Tsugaru Strait two days later and began capturing ships bound for Japan. The arrival of the Russians off Tokyo Bay on the 24th caused the Naval General Staff to order Kamimura to sail for Cape Toi Misaki, Kyūshū, fearing that Jessen would circumnavigate Japan to reach Port Arthur. Two days later he was ordered north to the Kii Channel and then to Tokyo Bay on the 28th. The General Staff finally ordered him back to Tsushima Island on the 30th; later that day he received word that Jessen's ships had passed through the Tsugaru Strait <b>early</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> and reached Vladivostok on 1 August.|$|E
5|$|While on course, JG 6 {{approached}} the airfield of Heesch {{and some of}} its pilots assumed it to be Volkel airfield. It is unlikely that the Heesch strip, built in October 1944, was known to the Luftwaffe. No. 126 Wing RCAF was based there and had dispatched its 411 and 442 Squadrons on recce missions <b>early</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> so the majority of its units were airborne. Its 401 Squadron was readying for takeoff when JG 6 appeared at 09:15. Most of the German pilots had failed to notice the airfield, concentrating on keeping formation at low altitude. 401 Squadron scrambled. Some of the German fighters were authorised to engage, while the main body continued to search for Volkel. Stab., and II./JG 6 stumbled on another strip at Helmond, which contained no aircraft. Several German pilots believed it to be Volkel and attacked, losing several of their number to ground fire. II./JG 6 suffered severely from Spitfire and Tempests based at Helmond. Very little damage was done at Heesch or Helmond.|$|E
