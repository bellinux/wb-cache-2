50|$|Cherenkov {{radiation}} is a shock wave resulting from charged particles moving through a material {{faster than the}} velocity of light in that material.

A later modification to both units allowed the speed of the units to be reduced to 1/4 of normal speed which was used for detailed head scanning. This also increased the scan time but gave the added benefit of increased resolution for cases that warranted it. The Delta 100 scanner, introduced in 1978, was an inexpensive dedicated head scanner priced to get around the certificate of need restrictions in place at the time. The Delta 2000 series, introduced in 1977, included Delta 2005, Delta 2010, Delta 2020, Delta 2060 and Delta 2060 Quantum. These scanners could scan the body in 2-5 seconds, thereby eliminating motion artifacts due to breathing. The HPS 1440 scanner was introduced in 1985 as an ultra high resolution CT scanner.

40|$|PET {{technologies}} have been merged {{to create a}} powerful diagnostic imag-ing modality known as PET/MR, a technology capable of superior lesion characterization with half the radiation exposure of PET/CT. PET uses radio-nuclides to provide metabolic and phys-iologic information. MR imaging, however, uses a strong magnetic field to align the hydrogen atoms within the body. Radio frequency is directed at the region of interest to knock the atoms out of alignment and receive a signal {{that is used to}} create a detailed anatomic image. As PET/MR contin-ues to evolve and new applications are developed, it could potentially hold many promises in fields such as oncol-ogy, neurology, and cardiology. Thus, {{there is a need for}} highly trained indi-viduals in the fields of both nuclear medicine and MR imaging. Currently, there are 2 dedicated PET/MR systems available for use. One is manufactured by Philips Healthcare, and the other by Siemens Healthcare. The Philips Ingenuity TF PET/MR system is designed with the PET <b>detector</b> <b>ring</b> and MR imaging magnet in tandem; that is, the gantries are housed in the same room but separated by a rotating table that allows the technologist to move the patient from one machine to the other without repositioning.

30|$|High-resolution imaging is {{achieved}} by the unique design of the <b>detector</b> <b>ring</b> of the InSPira HD (Fig. 1). The <b>detector</b> <b>ring</b> consists of two clamshells, each containing 12 fanbeam collimators. At start position, the two clams touch and the collimators are focused {{at the center of}} the ring, achieving a focal point of 3  mm in diameter. During acquisition, the gantry rotates and simultaneously the two clams are moved outward leading the two focal points of the clam’s collimators to follow spiral trajectories over the field of view (FOV). The spatial resolution in the resulting image slice is therefore determined by the speed at which the clams move outward. After acquiring the first slice, the camera moves in axial direction to the position for acquiring the adjacent slice, and so on. A proprietary iterative reconstruction algorithm tailored to this unique method of spatial sampling is used to reconstruct the data into 3 D images. This iterative reconstruction algorithm is based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. It includes a point spread function (PSF), which is defined as the detector response to an impulse activity source point placed in the scanner FOV. Attenuation correction is performed using either a CT previously obtained from the patient/phantom or a deformable CT template.

The <b>detector</b> <b>ring</b> consists of 16 detector module. The inner diameter of the ring was 151 mm, the external diameter was 216 mm, which was big enough for small animal research, e.g. rat, rabbit and tupaia. The sensor of each module was 2 * 2 SensL SPMArraySL, coupled with an array of 14 x 14 LYSO crystals, each crystal measuring 2 mm x 2 mm 10 mm. The detector was encapsulated in a copper box for light and magnetic shielding. Resister charge multiplexing circuit was used in the front end electronics. Each detector output 8 X and 8 Y position signals. One summed timing signal was extracted from the common cathode of all 64 channels. All these signals were transmitted to digital electronic board by a 3 m long coaxial cable from inside of the MR to the outside. Each digital electronic board handled 8 detector modules based on FPGA to obtain the timing, position and energy information of a single event. And then these single events were sent to the coincidence processing board to produce coincidence packets which are prepared for further processing. A 0.2 mCi 68 Ge line source was used to do the preliminary imaging test. The image was reconstructed by 3 D-OSEM algorithm. The initial result proved the system to be feasible as a PET.

Materials and Methods: The new tomograph consists of three rings of 112 BGO block detectors (50 mm x 23 mm x 30 mm deep) each, covering an axial field of view of 15 cm with a patient port of 56 cm diameter. Each block is sawed into an 8 x 7 matrix giving 24 <b>detector</b> <b>rings</b> with 784 crystals each. Results: Total sensitivity for a 20 cm cylinder phantom is 177 kcps/mu Ci/ml in two-dimensional (2 D) mode and increases to 1. 46 Mcps/mu Ci/ml in 3 D mode. Count rate performance was investigated for different low energy discriminator thresholds. Smaller detector blocks improve noise equivalent counts by similar to 50 % compared with the EXACT system both in 2 D and in 3 D mode. Scatter fractions vary in 2 D from 0. 09 to 0. 13 for energy thresholds from 450 to 250 keV for line sources in a 20 cm diameter phantom. In 3 D mode an increase of scatter {{by a factor of}} 3 is observed.
