30|$|All of the {{nanostructures}} of {{the present}} study have started from the identically prepared as-cast films. Since the precursor solution has been stirred in air for 5  h, {{it is likely that the}} Fe 3 + ions are condensed into iron <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles, probably sub-nanometer in size. Therefore, the as-cast films are mainly composed of iron <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles and F 127. Most of the solvent ethanol would have been lost by evaporation before the as-cast films were placed in the aging chamber. However, there must be some ethanol left in the film, at least, for a while so that the film materials (iron <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles and F 127) can move around to attain a self-assembly structure. From the morphology of the FN(80  °C, 0  %) sample, which has not experienced the effect of water and thus is expected to maintain the structure of the as-cast film, we can infer that the self-assembly structure of the as-cast film is composed of rod-like micelles whose inside is filled with removable organics and outside is occupied by iron <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles. Therefore, in the as-cast film state, the hydrophobic PO blocks of F 127 are segregated into micelle rods and the hydrophilic EO blocks are associated with the iron <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles forming hydrophilic domains.|$|R

Aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> was found to be very effective adsorbent for removing trivalent chromium from waste water. Effects of different parameters (such as contact time, initial pH, amount of adsorbents, and initial Cr(III) concentration) were studied for the maximum adsorption of Cr(III) on aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The study revealed more than 99  % removal of Cr(III) with 1  g of adsorbent in 50  mL of 40  mg/L Cr(III) solution over a wide range of initial pH (3 – 10).
