2500|$|A <b>key</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>technology</b> of LIGA is the synchrotron, {{capable of}} {{emitting}} high-power, highly collimated X-rays. This high collimation permits relatively large distances between the mask and the substrate without the penumbral blurring that occurs from other X-ray sources. [...] In the electron storage ring or synchrotron, {{a magnetic field}} constrains electrons to follow a circular path and the radial acceleration of the electrons causes electromagnetic radiation to be emitted forward. [...] The radiation is thus strongly collimated in the forward direction and can be assumed to be parallel for lithographic purposes. [...] Because of the much higher flux of usable collimated X-rays, shorter exposure times become possible. [...] Photon energies for a LIGA exposure are approximately distributed between 2.5 and [...]|$|E

While SBJ discussions continue with selected airframers, data from the Aerion-designed calibration fixture aboard a NASA F-15B {{in the summer of}} 2010 was used to guide the design of a second test surface flown {{during the first half of}} 2013. [...] The new test surface was designed to provide large extents of laminar flow and be shaped so boundary layer instabilities grow relatively slowly and smoothly. These characteristics should facilitate good boundary layer imaging of the roughness and step-height experiments performed in next phase. The experiments were intended to influence future laminar flow airfoil manufacturing standards for surface quality and assembly tolerances.|$|E
2500|$|Governments' {{grant of}} limited {{monopolies}} to inventors under a developing patent system (the Statute of Monopolies in 1623) {{is considered an}} influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, {{on the development of}} industrialisation are clearly illustrated {{in the history of the}} steam engine, the <b>key</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>technology.</b> In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors. Watt's monopoly prevented other inventors, such as Richard Trevithick, William Murdoch, [...] or Jonathan Hornblower, whom Boulton and Watt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the spread of steam power.|$|E
