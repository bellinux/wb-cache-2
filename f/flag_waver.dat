50|$|Felipe Massa was the {{chequered}} <b>flag</b> <b>waver</b> in this Grand Prix. The podium trophies were of {{an unusual}} three-pronged design and matt-turquoise in colour. They were designed by the architect Oscar Niemeyer and were constructed of recycled plastic bottle tops, collected on site {{over the course of}} the grand prix weekend, and remoulded at the site's plastic recycling plant. The initiative is to highlight sponsor Petrobras' green credentials.|$|E
50|$|The Chance of a Lifetime is a 1943 crime drama {{starring}} Chester Morris, Erik Rolf and Jeanne Bates. It {{is one of}} 14 films made by Columbia Pictures involving detective Boston Blackie, a criminal-turned-crime solver. This was {{the sixth}} in the series and one of three {{that did not have}} his name in the title. The film is also William Castle's directorial debut. As with many of the films of the period, this was a <b>flag</b> <b>waver</b> to support America's efforts during World War II.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the year}} 2004 to 2005 Gasson became Lord Mayor of Cardiff {{and was the}} first Liberal Democrat to hold this office (though Cardiff has had Liberal mayors in the past, for example John Batchelor). She later claimed she had used this period to {{successfully}} create links between local businesses and universities. [...] "I've always believed the role mayor should have a high status because the Lord Mayor is the <b>flag</b> <b>waver</b> for the city. I attended hundreds if not thousands of functions when I was in office" [...] she later said. In October 2004 the Lord Mayor pulled out of a gala dinner in protest because of the invitation of a homophobic Christian evangelist Luis Palau.|$|E

60|$|The Chancellor {{gathered}} himself together, {{and the two}} set forward. It was a {{long and}} complicated voyage; for the library was in the wing of the new buildings, and the tower which carried the flag was in the old schloss upon the garden. By {{a great variety of}} stairs and corridors, they came out at last upon a patch of gravelled court; the garden peeped through a high grating with a flash of green; tall, old gabled buildings mounted on every side; the Flag Tower climbed, stage after stage, into the blue; and high over all, among the building daws, the yellow <b>flag</b> <b>wavered</b> in the wind. A sentinel {{at the foot of the}} tower stairs presented arms; another paced the first landing; and a third was stationed before the door of the extemporised prison.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{before the}} convention, Michael Harrington had {{resigned}} as an Honorary Chairperson of the Socialist Party. Some {{months after the}} convention, he resigned his membership in SDUSA. Harrington and his supporters from the Coalition Caucus soon formed the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC). (Many members of the Debs caucus resigned from SDUSA and formed the Socialist Party USA.) Despite opposing {{the majority of the}} Socialist Party, Michael Harrington, acknowledged the validity of its members' concerns:"The anti-war activists of the sixties were overwhelmingly white and middle class. Many of them were unconcerned about the domestic political consequences of their actions and were even contemptuous of that majority of Americans who supported the war. There was a profoundly elitist tendency in the movement that majority of the Socialist Party leadership denounced as dilettantish and collegiate. Moreover, there was a vocal, and regularly televised, fringe of confrontationists, exhibitionists, and Vietcong <b>flag</b> <b>wavers</b> who could plausibly be dismissed as freakish, or sinister, or both."Harrington's caucus in the Socialist Party endorsed the [...] "New Politics" [...] movement and sought to expand that tendency into a viable left-wing pressure-group within the Democratic Party, advancing an explicitly socialist agenda and attempting to win influence over elected officials for that program. Harrington led many members of this caucus and from his networks to establish the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) in 1973.|$|R
60|$|But, {{somehow or}} other, that amiable and worthy orphan {{had become a}} part of the mystery of Mr Nadgett's existence. Mr Nadgett took an {{interest}} in his lightest proceedings; and it never <b>flagged</b> or <b>wavered.</b> He watched him in and out of the Assurance Office, where he was now formally installed as a Director; he dogged his footsteps in the streets; he stood listening when he talked; he sat in coffee-rooms entering his name in the great pocket-book, over and over again; he wrote letters to himself about him constantly; and, when he found them in his pocket, put them in the fire, with such distrust and caution that he would bend down to watch the crumpled tinder while it floated upwards, as if his mind misgave him, that the mystery it had contained might come out at the chimney-pot.|$|R
50|$|The race is {{preceded by}} a {{spectacular}} pageant, the Corteo Storico, which includes (among many others) Alfieri, <b>flag</b> <b>wavers,</b> in medieval costumes. Just before the pageant, a squad of carabinieri on horseback, wielding swords, demonstrate a mounted charge around the track. They take one lap at a walk, in formation, and a second at a gallop that foreshadows {{the excitement of the}} race to come, before exiting down one of the streets that leads out of Piazza del Campo. Spectators arrive early in the morning, eventually filling the centre of the town square, inside the track, to capacity; the local police seal the entrances once the festivities begin in earnest. Seats ranging from simple bleachers to elaborate box seats may be had for a price, but sell out long before the day of the race. At 7:30 p.m. for the July race, and 7 p.m. for the August race, the detonation of an explosive charge echoes across the piazza, signaling to the thousands of onlookers that the race is about to begin. The race itself runs for three laps of the Piazza del Campo, the perimeter of which is covered with several inches of dirt and tuff (imported and laid for the occasion at great expense to the city) and the corners of which are protected with padded crash barriers for the occasion. The jockeys ride the horses bareback from the starting line, an area between two ropes. Nine horses, in an order only decided by lot immediately before the race starts, enter the space. The tenth, the rincorsa, waits outside. When the rincorsa finally enters the space between the ropes the starter (mossiere) activates a mechanism that instantly drops the canapo (the front rope). This process (the mossa) can take a very long time, as deals have usually been made between various contrade and jockeys that affect when the rincorsa moves - he may be waiting for a particular other horse to be well- or badly-placed, for example.On the dangerous, steeply canted track, the riders are allowed to use their whips (in Italian, nerbi, stretched, dried bulls' hide) not only for their own horse, but also for disturbing other horses and riders. The Palio in fact is won by the horse who represents his contrada, and not by the jockeys. The winner is the first horse to cross the finish line - a horse can win without its rider (a condition known as cavallo scosso). A horse can also win without its decorative headgear (spennacchiera), although the opposite belief is widely held even among the Sienese. The loser in the race is considered to be the contrada whose horse came second, not last.|$|R
40|$|Fast {{and robust}} 3 D quality control {{as well as}} fast {{deformation}} measurement is of particular importance for industrial inspection. Additionally a direct response about measured properties is desired. Therefore, robust optical techniques are needed which use as few images as possible for measurement and visualize results in an efficient way. One promising technique for this aim is the inverse pattern projection which has the following advantages: The technique codes the information of a preceding measurement into the projected inverse pattern. Thus, {{it is possible to}} do differential measurements using only one camera frame for each state. Additionally, the results are optimized straight fringes for sampling which are independent of the object curvature. The hardware needs are low as just a programmable projector and a standard camera are necessary. The basic idea of inverse pattern projection, necessary algorithms and found optimizations are demonstrated, roughly. Evaluation techniques were found to preserve a high quality phase measurement under imperfect conditions. The different application fields can be sorted out by the type of pattern used for inverse projection. We select two main topics for presentation. One is the incremental (one image per state) deformation measurement which is a promising technique for high speed deformation measurements. A video series of a <b>wavering</b> <b>flag</b> with projected inverse pattern was evaluated to show the complete deformation series...|$|R
