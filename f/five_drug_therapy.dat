A systematic review of literatures published from database inception to February 2015 was conducted in eight databases. RCTs involving acupuncture for treatment of cancer-related pain were identified. Two researchers independently performed article selection, data extraction, and quality assessment of data. Results. 1, 639 participants in twenty RCTs were analyzed. All selected RCTs were associated with high risk of bias. Meta-analysis indicated that acupuncture alone did not have superior pain-relieving effects as compared with conventional <b>drug</b> <b>therapy.</b> However, {{as compared with the}} <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> alone, acupuncture plus <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> resulted in increased pain remission rate, shorter onset time of pain relief, longer pain-free duration, and better quality of life without serious adverse effects.

Acupuncture plus <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> is more effective than conventional <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> alone for cancer-related pain. However, multicenter high-quality RCTs with larger sample sizes are needed to provide stronger evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in cancer-related pain due to the low data quality of the studies included in the current meta-analysis...|$|R

The central hypothesis of the project is that patient consultation will aid in identifying <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> problems and reduce the amount of negative effects posed by these problems. Methods: This project will assess data obtained through a medication therapy intervention report utilized in multiple community pharmacy environments in Arizona. Any consultation provided to a patient by a pharmacist or pharmacy intern regarding a new or transferred prescription will be eligible for data collection. The primary dependent variable is the number of <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> problems identified during consultation. <b>Drug</b> <b>therapy</b> problems will be assessed via expert opinion to identify the potential negative impact they may have posed to patients.
