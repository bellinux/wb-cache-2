The old jetty with {{a barrier to}} show it was not safe beyond. The Roman Catholic “Star of the Sea” on Waterloo Point, that was the Government Commissariat building – The first Church of England with trees next it. The Bay View Hotel, Pier Hotel, - Being windy the sailing was put off till next day – Mark S Mitchell, Captain Glover, & two others in one boat when one pulled in the sail more, & over it went – Had not the stones for ballast fallen on the seats & kept the boat straight for them to cling on, {{they would have been}} drowned before help came. Our mother was afraid of sailing boats. She was home at Lisdillon & <b>felt</b> <b>Mark</b> was in danger, & went to her room & prayed for him {{at the time of the}} accident. I was at Kennedia, or Green Banks then with the clergyman’s family, Maysons – when Arthur Giblin rode over saying they were safe. Thank God. 1, 1925 Miss Louisa Amos says she was looking on, & so dangerous, this was her last Regatta. The sketches by Catherine Penwarne (Kate), eldest daughter of John and Catherine Mitchell (of Cornwall, England, who settled at Lisdillon, East Coast Tasmania in 1852) were made between 1860 and 1876, and portray aspects of 19 th Century social and domestic life. Catherine’s sketches were compiled by her sister Sarah. E. E. Mitchell. Derived from her own collection, from those of friends and relations, and from John Ball, Kate's husband, they were compiled sometime between 1928 and 1933. The sketches are mounted in an album, together with: locks of Kate's hair on red silk; a pressed fern arrangement; a coloured photograph of John and Catherine Ball; and coloured views of Buckland Churchyard in 1850, showing the grave of Paul Thomas Mitchell, aged 3 days, and in 1879 showing the grave of Catherine Penwarne Ball. The scrapbook was bequeathed to The Royal Society of Tasmania in 1946. RS 32 /...|$|E

50|$|Along {{the same}} lines, Evans criticized Stürmer for his {{emphasis}} on the modernity and totalitarianism of National Socialism, the role of Hitler, and the discontinuities between the Imperial, Weimar and Nazi periods. In Evans's view, the exact opposite {{was the case with}} National Socialism as a badly disorganized, anti-modern movement with deep roots in the German past, and the role of Hitler much smaller than one Stürmer credited him with. Evans accused Stürmer of having no real interest in the collapse of Weimar, and only using the Nazi Machtergreifung as a way of making contemporary political points. Evans denounced Stürmer for writing a laudatory biography of Otto von Bismarck, which he <b>felt</b> <b>marked</b> a regression to the Great man theory of history and an excessive focus on political history. In Evans's opinion, a social historical approach with the emphasis on society was a better way of understanding the German past. In his 1989 book about the Historikerstreit, In Hitler's Shadow, Evans stated that he believed that the exchanges during the Historikerstreit had destroyed Stürmer's reputation as a serious historian.|$|R
