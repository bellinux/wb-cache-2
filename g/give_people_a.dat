25|$|The {{buildings}} of the campus were designed by internationally renowned Modernist architect Paul Rudolph {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, to distinguish the campus from the outside world and provide what might be considered a Social Utopian environment. The building architecture {{is similar to that of}} the Boston Government Service Center. Rudolph made both the exterior and interior of each building of rough concrete (béton brut), an essential element of the style known as Brutalism, and he endowed buildings with large windows, with the intended effect of giving those inside the feeling of being connected to the outdoors. The stairs were made relatively short in height, ostensibly in order to slow people down and thus allow them to appreciate the campus more fully. Atriums were also placed in the Liberal Arts and Science & Engineering buildings to <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> place to socialize between sections of the halls. These areas are also filled with hanging and potted indoor plants. The main door of each building faces towards the Robert Karam Campanile, keeping students within the academic life area, where buildings for classes are located. Large mounds of earth (berms) also stand between the parking lots, making the lots partially invisible from within the original Academic Life area (though not from within some recent additions to it, such as the Charlton College of Business building). More recent buildings, most notably the Woodland Commons and residence halls to the south of the main campus, have been built to complement, but not to attempt to copy, Rudolph's Late Modernist aesthetic.|$|E
500|$|Early eliminativists such as Rorty and Feyerabend often {{confused}} {{two different}} {{notions of the}} sort of elimination that the term [...] "eliminative materialism" [...] entailed. On the one hand, they [...] claimed, the cognitive sciences that will ultimately <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> correct account of the workings of the mind will not employ terms that refer to common-sense mental states like beliefs and desires; these states will not be part of the ontology of a mature cognitive science. But critics immediately countered that this view was indistinguishable from the identity theory of mind.

Brook {{explained that he}} wanted to bring out the emotion expressed in the film: [...] "...in Inconvenient Truth, there's a lot of information and it's kind of a lecture, in a way, and very well organized and very well presented, but it's a lot to absorb. And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have – sort of <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> little break {{every once in a while}} and say, okay, you don't have to absorb this information, you can just sort of – and it was more the personal side of Al Gore's life or how it connected to the theme of the film.

500|$|Since 1952, the News-Miner has {{featured}} a small cartoon figure named Sourdough Jack {{at the bottom}} of its front page. The drawing of Sourdough Jack is always paired with a comment on a news story, pun, or joke, apparently having been spoken by the figure. The idea for Sourdough Jack came from News-Miner editor John J. Ryan, who said, [...] "People had many complaints about the town. ... He could make fun of that stuff and that would <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> chance to laugh at their problems." [...] Sourdough Jack's name came from Ryan's nickname (Jack) and the traditional nickname given to an old miner (sourdough). [...] Jack Ryan worked for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer later in his life. John Ryan changed his name in the 70's to John O'Ryan.|$|E
500|$|After {{the crash}} {{between himself and}} Burti on the first lap, Michael Schumacher said that {{although}} he saw Burti in his rear-view mirrors, {{he did not know}} which line he wanted to take and he could not take avoiding action because of his gear selection problem. Burti said that the accident [...] "looked worse on TV" [...] and that he stated his spin on lap 18 was caused because his left arm was aching from the crash. Coulthard questioned the decision to stop the race by saying: [...] "Accidents or injury off the track is not normally a reason to stop the race. There's lots of races that would have benefited from being red-flagged to <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> show." [...] He also said he felt consistency was needed but accepted that the organisers had the final say on stopping a race. Villeneuve also agreed with Coulthard's view. A spokesman for the FIA confirmed and defended the red-flag decision and they said it was shown to prevent a larger accident. Michelin Motorsport Director Pierre Dupasquier agreed with the FIA's view and stated he was concerned about cars hitting the strands of debris and catching a puncture.|$|E

500|$|Much of Hill's lyrics {{dealt with}} motherhood, the Fugees, reminiscence, love, heartbreak, and God. Commenting on the album's gospel content, Hill stated [...] "Gospel music is music {{inspired}} by the gospels. In a huge respect, {{a lot of this}} music turned out to be just that. During this album, I turned to the Bible and wrote songs that I drew comfort from." [...] Several of the album's songs, such as [...] "Lost Ones," [...] "Superstar," [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] and [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] were widely speculated as direct attacks at Fugee members Wyclef and Pras. [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] was originally intended for a different artist, however, Hill decided to keep it after it was completed, due to its personal content. Although {{a large portion of the}} album's love songs would turn out to be bitter from Hill's previous relationship, [...] "Nothing Even Matters," [...] a duet performed by Hill and R singer D'Angelo, showcased a brighter, more intimate perspective on the subject. The song was inspired by Hill's relationship with Rohan Marley. Speaking about [...] "Nothing Even Matters"' lyrics, Hill remarked: [...] "I wanted to make a love song, á la Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, and <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> humanistic approach to love again without all the physicality and overt sexuality." ...|$|E
500|$|Bungie {{used the}} beta to fix mistakes, glitches, and balance issues within {{gameplay}} elements. [...] "We needed our fans to provide feedback," [...] said Lehto, adding {{that having a}} large audience to [...] "hammer" [...] on the game allowed them to gather useful feedback to mold the finished product. The game automatically collected statistics such as upload and matchmaking speeds, as well as game preferences; sorting out what Jarrard called [...] "the more subjective anecdotal feedback" [...] from emails, notes, and forums proved more difficult. The Reach beta generated over 360,000 forum posts on Bungie's community forums. Bungie created official threads for groups of issues to manage the high volume of feedback; [...] "We tried to <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> {{little bit more of}} a direct avenue to give that feedback and to make our lives easier. It was definitely a lot to assess and digest," [...] said Jarrard. Certain feedback from the players did not correlate with the statistical data obtained from the matches during the beta. Chris Carney, lead designer for the multiplayer mode, recalled vocal dissatisfaction with the pistol early in the beta; {{by the end of the}} beta, the weapon was responsible for most of the kills coming from newly included weapons in the game. Bungie deployed special test matches to eliminate lurking variables, balance gameplay, and make other informed changes.|$|E
500|$|The {{two major}} {{parts of the}} [...] "Final Fantasy XV Universe" [...] were the {{original}} net animation series [...] and the CGI feature film [...] Brotherhood was produced by Square Enix and A-1 Pictures and was released through the game's official YouTube channel and anime streaming website Crunchyroll between March and September 2016. Each episode details the backstory of Noctis from his childhood to the game's opening, along with the backstories of his companions. The first and last episodes of the anime tie in with the Platinum Demo. The anime is intended to <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> view into Noctis' mind that would have appeared incongruous {{within the context of}} a video game. Kingsglaive was a joined production shared between the original staff of Advent Children and multiple Western companies including Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the Assassin's Creed series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including Jurassic World and the television series Game of Thrones. While similar in appearance to Advent Children, Kingsglaive had a different goal behind its development: while Advent Children was made for dedicated fans of Final Fantasy VII, Kingsglaive was made as an introduction for newcomers to the world of XV, along with conveying some of Regis' backstory. Digic Pictures later collaborated with Square Enix on [...] "Omen", a promotional trailer based on the world and story of Final Fantasy XV.|$|E

Like the earlier Aborigines Rights Protection Society and the National Congress of British West Africa, the WAYL sought to protect natural and constitutional rights, liberties and privileges for the African populaces. However, the WAYL was more militant, and eagerly sought to lead the West African people through [...] "economic, social and political emancipation". As Wallace-Johnson wrote in the Negro Worker, the league was trying to drive [...] "towards the establishing of a foundation for national independence". The rhetoric of Wallace-Johnson and the WAYL used Marxist phraseology and Christian imagery in their political thought, but opposed European interpretations of Christianity because of its use as a justification for slavery and colonialism by some politicians. By 1936, the WAYL had established 17 branches in major cities throughout the Gold Coast.|$|E

[...] As for his prior roles, he said, [...] "They are false and <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> wrong idea of us [...]" [...] Hayakawa desperately sought to show a more balanced and fair portrait of Asians.

2500|$|The {{consumption}} of dog meat {{is not a}} feature of modern Japanese culture. There is a belief in Japan that certain dogs have special powers in their religion of Shintoism and Buddhism. Dog meat was consumed in Japan until 675 AD, when Emperor Tenmu decreed a prohibition on its consumption during the 4th through 9th months of the year. Normally a dog accompanied the emperor for battle, so {{it was believed that}} eating a dog gave emperors bad luck. In Japanese shrines certain animals are worshipped, such as dogs as it is believed they will <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> good luck charm called [...] "Komainu".

She was renamed Anna Salén and, after initial conversion into a bulk carrier at the Bethlehem Shipyard in Baltimore, took a load of coal from the USA to Italy. By this time the owners had obtained a contract from the International Refugee Organisation to transport Displaced Persons from Europe to Australia and Canada.

After repairs were completed, Anna Salén resumed service. Her next two voyages, beginning on 20 June and 27 November 1950, departed from Bremerhaven bound for Australia. During the latter journey, one of the emigrants, Herr Gustav Kovaks, made a film about the voyage. It was later widely shown in Germany to <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> view of how the emigration process worked. Anna Salén arrived at Fremantle on 31 December 1950 and sailed for Melbourne later that day.

She departed Bremen, West Germany on 2 July 1953 to make a round trip to Quebec, Canada The journey took seven days.
