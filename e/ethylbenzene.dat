The {{mass balance}} in these nitrogen-atom-transfer processes has been examined. With PhI=NTs as the nitrogen source, the aziridination of styrenes, trans-stilbene, 2 -vinylnaphthalene, indene, and 2, 2 -dimethylchromene catalyzed by complex 1 or 2 resulted {{in up to}} 99 % substrate conversions and up to 94 % aziridine selectivities, whereas the amidation of <b>ethylbenzenes,</b> indan, tetralin, 1 -, and 2 -ethylnaphthalene catalyzed by complex 2 led to substrate conversions of up to 32 % and amide selectivities of up to 91 %. Complex 1 or 2 can also catalyze the asymmetric amidation of 4 -methoxyethylbenzene, tetralin, and 2 -ethylnaphthalene with "PhI(OAc) 2 " + NH 2 SO 2 Me", affording the N-substituted methanesulfonamides in up to 56 % ee with substrate conversions of up to 34 % and amide selectivities of up to 92 %. Extension of the "complex 1 + PhI=NTs" or "complex 1 + PhI(OAc) 2 + NH 2 R (R = Ts, Ns) " amidation protocol to a steroid resulted in diastereoselective amidation of cholesteryl acetate at the allylic C-H bonds at C- 7 with substrate conversions of up to 49 % and amide selectivities of up to 90 % (α:β ratio: up to 4. 2 : 1).

Four chlorinated benzenes and two chlorinated phenols were employed in the present study. Sorption experiments using sediment from the Patalganga River were conducted in laboratory (bottle point method) at different ionic strengths (viz. 0. 01, 0. 05, and 0. 10 M).

Three different treatments were used for each smectite, thus providing six samples for evaluation. The thermal and catalytic decomposition of HDPE was studied under isothermal (60 min at 420 degreesC) and dynamic (35 - 650 degreesC at 10 degreesC min(- 1)) conditions.

25|$|Biodegradation {{can be seen}} in {{some studies}} that {{biodegradation}} accounts for the absence of creosote preservatives on the initial surface of the sediment. In a study from Pensacola, Florida, PAHs were not detected on the surface on the aquatic sediment, but the highest concentrations were detected at a depth of 8-13 centimeters. A form an anaerobic biodegradation of m-cresol was seen in a study using sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing enriched environments. The reduction of m-cresol in this study was seen in under 144 hours, while additional chemical intermediates were being formed. The chemical intermediates were formed in the presence of bicarbonate. The products included 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzoic acid and acetate compounds. Although the conditions were enriched with the reducing anaerobic compounds, sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria are commonly found in the environment. For further information, see sulfate-reducing bacteria. The type of anaerobic bacteria ultimately determines the reduction of the creosote preservative compounds, while each individual compound may only go through reduction under certain conditions. BTEX is a mixture of benzene, toluene, <b>ethylbenzene,</b> and xylene, that was studied in the presence of four different anaerobic-enriched sediments. Though the compound, BTEX, is not found in creosote preservatives, the products of creosote preservatives' oxidation-reduction reactions include some of these compounds. For oxidation-reduction reactions, see the following section. In this study, it was seen that certain compounds such as benzene were only reduced under sulfate-enriched environments, while toluene was reduced under a variety of bacteria-enriched environments, not just sulfate. The biodegradation of a creosote preservative in an anaerobic enrichment depends not only on the type of bacteria enriching the environment, but also the compound that has been released from the preservative. In aerobic environments, preservative compounds are limited in the biodegradation process by the presence of free oxygen. In an aerobic environment, free oxygen comes from oxygen saturated sediments, sources of precipitation, and plume edges. The free oxygen allows for the compounds to be oxidized and decomposed into new intermediate compounds. Studies have shown that when BTEX and PAH compounds were placed in aerobic environments, the oxidation of the ring structures caused cleavage in the aromatic ring and allowed for other functional groups to attach. When an aromatic hydrocarbon was introduced to the molecular oxygen in experimental conditions, a dihydrodiol intermediate was formed, and then oxidation occurred transforming the aromatic into a catechol compound. Catechol allows for cleavage of the aromatic ring to occur, where functional groups can then add in an ortho- or meta- position.|$|E

40|$|Passive {{sampling}} with Ceramic Dosimeters {{allows for}} time-integrated monitoring of dissolved chemicals in ground- and surface water. The purely diffusion controlled device {{is based on}} a porous ceramic membrane. This membrane has the shape of a tube. The ceramic tube functions as diffusion barrier {{and at the same time}} serves as container to hold a solid sorbent. The latter can be selected according to compounds of interest and time scales needed for monitoring. The sorbents are required to have a high affinity and capacity for the uptake of the chemicals of concern combined with easy extraction at high recovery rates. As long as such sorbents can be found, Ceramic Dosimeters fit any analytical need. Diffusive transport of chemicals across the ceramic membrane at steady state can be described by Fick’s first law. Thus, the accumulated mass of a chemical at the end of an exposure period can be used to calculate the average concentration at which this chemical was present over the entire sampling time. Based on this, the Ceramic Dosimeter allows for quantification of chemical concentrations over extended periods without the need for calibration or frequent snap-shot sampling. The idea of the Ceramic Dosimeter was first conceived by Grathwohl [1] and by now, a number of laboratory experiments as well as explorations in the field have proven the suitability of Ceramic Dosimeters for time-integrated, long-term monitoring. Applications so far include the sampling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using Amberlite IRA- 743 (Sigma-Aldrich) as solid sorbent receiving phase [2 - 4] as well as the sampling of benzene, toluene, <b>ethylbenzenes,</b> and xylenes (BTEX) [5], naphthalenes [5] and chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) [5, 6] using Dowex Optipore L- 493 (Supelco). Furthermore, the Ceramic Dosimeter provided the basis for the development of the Toximeter, the first passive sampler that is directly compatible with toxicological tests. Biosilon polystyrene beads (Nunc) served as the sorbent material in the initial development of the Toximeter, which focused on PAH sampling and responses elicited in vertebrate cells (see also Chapter by Schirmer et al.). The goal of this Chapter is to provide details on the functioning of Ceramic Dosimeter sampling devices with particular focus on the role of the ceramic membrane and requirements regarding the solid receiving phase.

40|$|Transition metal catalyzed {{selective}} nitrene insertion into C-H bonds, {{which allows}} direct incorporation of nitrogen functionality into hydrocarbons, represents an appealing methodology for C-N bond formation, {{a type of}} bond formation of great importance in organic synthesis due to the prevalence of amino groups in biologically active natural products and pharmaceuticals. Organic azides are atom-economic and an environment-benign nitrene source. This dissertation reports the use of organic azides as a nitrene source to develop a series of protocols for C-H bond functionalization by metal-catalyzed nitrene insertion, including the diimination of indoles, the phosphoramidation of aldehydes and the amination of hydrocarbons catalyzed by ruthenium porphyrins. Carbonylruthenium(II) porphyrin complex Ru(TTP) (CO) (TTP = meso-tetrakis(p-tolyl) porphyrinato dianion) is an effective catalyst for nitrene transfer to sp 2 C-H bonds of indoles using aryl azides (ArN 3) as a nitrene source. This “Ru(TTP) (CO) + ArN 3 ” protocol selectively results in the diimination of indoles without the corresponding monoimination products being detected. In {{the presence of a}} catalyst Ru(TTP) (CO), the reactions of N-methylindole with ArN 3 (Ar = 4 -nitrophenyl; 3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl), and reactions of a variety of N-substituted indoles with 4 -nitrophenylazide, afford 2, 3 -diiminoindoles in good to excellent yields (up to 90 %). This unique type of 2, 3 -diimination products was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray crystallography. The catalytic diimination product from N-methylindole and ArN 3 (Ar = 3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) can also be obtained through stoichiometric reaction of N-methylindole with the corresponding bis(arylimido) ruthenium(VI) porphyrin, suggesting the possible involvement of RuVI(TTP) (NAr) 2 intermediates in the Ru(TTP) (CO) -catalyzed diimination reactions. Dichlororuthenium(IV) porphyrin complex Ru(TTP) Cl 2 efficiently catalyzes the phosphoramidation of aldehydes with phosphoryl azides (RO) 2 P(O) N 3 via a nitrene insertion into sp 2 C-H bonds of aldehydes. This represents the first study on the catalytic activity of a ruthenium(IV) porphyrin towards nitrene insertion into C-H bonds. The “Ru(TTP) Cl 2 + (RO) 2 P(O) N 3 ” protocol exhibits high chemoselectivity and functional group tolerability. Good to excellent product yields (up to 99 %) have been obtained for the Ru(TTP) Cl 2 -catalyzed phosphoramidation {{of a wide variety of}} aldehydes with commercially available (PhO) 2 P(O) N 3 (DPPA) and phosphoramidation of p-tolualdehyde with various (RO) 2 P(O) N 3 (R = Me, Et, CCl 3 CH 2, 4 -nitrophenyl). The reaction can be scaled up by adding phosphoryl azide dropwise. The use of commercially available DPPA in this protocol offers a convenient and practical method for the synthesis of N-acylphosphoramidates. “Ru(TDCPP) Cl 2 + (CCl 3 CH 2 O) 2 P(O) N 3 ” (TDCPP = meso-tetrakis(2, 6 -dichlorophenyl) porphyrinato dianion) serves as an effective protocol for intermolecular nitrene insertion into sp 3 C-H bonds of hydrocarbons. Using this protocol, a variety of hydrocarbons including cycloalkanes (such as cyclohexane) and <b>ethylbenzenes</b> undergo sp 3 C-H amination in moderate to high yields (up to 86 %). Compared with ruthenium(II) porphyrins such as Ru(TDCPP) (CO) and dirhodium carboxylates such as Rh 2 (OAc) 4, Ru(TDCPP) Cl 2 displays a markedly higher catalytic activity towards the nitrene sp 3 C-H insertion with (CCl 3 CH 2 O) 2 P(O) N 3. In addition, intramolecular nitrene insertion into sp 3 C-H bond can also take place in good yields with Ru(TDCPP) Cl 2 as the catalyst. published_or_final_versionChemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

2500|$|Located off Tyler Lane and Spring Valley Road on the Old Bridge Township border, {{the area}} of Burnt Fly Bog in Marlboro Township is listed as a Superfund {{clean-up}} site. It is a rural area covering approximately , {{most of it in}} Marlboro Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. During the 1950s and early 1960s, many unlined lagoons were used for storage of waste oil. As a result, at least [...] of the bog have been contaminated. In addition to the current contaminated area, the site still consists of: an approximately 13,000-cubic-yard mound of sludge; and an undetermined number of exposed and buried drums. The site is a ground water discharge area for the Englishtown Aquifer. In this bog, ground water, surface water, and air are contaminated by oil and various organic chemicals. Contaminants known to be present include <b>ethylbenzene,</b> methylene chloride, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, base neutral acids, metals, PAHs, PCBs, unknown liquid waste, and VOCs.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} goal of environmental chemistry is tracing {{the source and}} degradation of pollutants. [...] Various methods have been employed for fingerprinting pools of environmental pollutants such as the bulk chemical composition of a spill, isotope ratios of the bulk chemical mixture, or isotope ratios of individual constituent compounds. [...] Stable isotopes of carbon and hydrogen {{can be used as}} complimentary fingerprinting techniques for natural gas. [...] Recently, the D/H ratio of hydrocarbons from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was used to verify that their origin was likely from the Macondo well. [...] Hydrogen isotope ratios have also been used as a measure of the relative amount of biodegradation that has occurred in oil reservoirs in China, and studies on pure cultures of n-alkane degrading organisms have shown a chain-length dependence on the amount of hydrogen isotope fractionation during degradation. [...] Additional studies have also shown hydrogen isotope effects in the degradation of Methyl tert-butyl ether and Toluene that have been suggested to be useful in the evaluation of the level of degradation of these polluting compounds in the environment. [...] In both cases the residual unreacted compounds became enriched in deuterium to a few tens of per mil, with variations exhibited between different organisms and degree of reaction completeness. [...] These observations of heavy residual compounds have been applied to field observations of biodegradation reactions such as the removal of benzene and <b>ethylbenzene,</b> which imparted a D/H fractionation of 27 and 50 per mil, respectively. [...] Additionally analysis of o-xylene in a polluted site showed high residual D/H ratios after biodegradation, consistent with activation of C-H bonds being a rate limiting step in this process ...|$|E
