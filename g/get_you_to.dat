It was described as [...] "the sort of episode that either rewards someone who liked the characters on this show, or could potentially <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> like them if you didn’t really know what was going on." [...] Britt's only complaint was that the romance between T'Pol and Tucker wasn't further developed as it brought out the best in Blalock and Trinneer.|$|E

Each new piece of media contained various hints and clues to discover the next, relying on fan participation to discover each new facet of the expanding game. Rolling Stone described the fan involvement in this promotion as the [...] "marketing team's dream".

Isis Briones from Vogue praised the cover saying that Ballerini [...] "stripped the track {{all the way down}} with just a guitar in hand and delivered an incredibly moving performance in just a few seconds. Not only will you want to replay this clip, but her voice on the song will <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see in a completely different light."

Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who {{independently}} released his sixth album Ghosts I-IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year, thought {{it did not}} go far enough, calling it [...] "very much a bait and switch, to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> pay for a MySpace-quality stream {{as a way to}} promote a very traditional record sale." [...] Singer Lily Allen called it [...] "arrogant", saying: [...] " [...] millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?" [...] In the Guardian, journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote: [...] "Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who, nowhere near Radiohead's levels of fame and fortune, now have pretty much no chance of ever making a living from their music." [...] Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release [...] "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them.

It depicts violence {{in a most}} compelling way: You don't see it. You just feel it." [...] Bob Wisehart of The Sacramento Bee said, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} while NYPD Blue is a fine show [...] it was on my 10-best list for 1993 [...] Homicide is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is what it took to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> watch NYPD Blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson favored [...] "Run Run Rudolph" [...] as her {{favorite}} classic, saying: [...] "Just because {{it got to}} be a little more rock and roll." [...] She also remarked that [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This is going to be different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that to try and <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas".

2500|$|Though {{silent and}} {{reserved}} in public, Wheatstone {{was a clear}} and voluble talker in private, if taken on his favourite studies, and his small but active person, his plain but intelligent countenance, was full of animation.

'You don't say so!' exclaimed the statesman. 'I must <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{tell that to the}} Lord Chancellor.' And so saying, he fastened the electrician on Lord Westbury, and effected his escape.

Truman told Stevenson [...] "I have been trying since January to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say that. Why should it embarrass me?" [...] Kefauver led on the first ballot, but was well below the vote total he needed to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot. Historian John Frederick Martin says party leaders selected {{him because he was}} [...] "more moderate on civil rights than Estes Kefauver, yet nonetheless acceptable to labor and urban machines—so a coalition of southern, urban, and labor leaders fell in behind his candidacy in Chicago."

2500|$|Rating {{it three}} out of four stars, Steve Jones of USA Today commented. [...] "the singer is in a sexy, fun-loving mood [...] While she overdoes the between-song interludes here, she never fails to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> move. When it comes to burning up a dance floor, she is still Ms. Jackson." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms. Jackson luxuriates in textures as dizzying as a new infatuation," [...] commended the album as {{containing}} [...] "songs so baroquely sumptuous that they're virtually experimental." [...] Pareles added, [...] "Boudoir ballads undulate in torrid slow motion while Ms. Jackson moans like a phone-sex operator, and uptempo tunes hark back to disco, splice mock-operetta to hard rock or, in Better Days, conjure an easy-listening 1960's-pop apotheosis." [...] Her vocals were also praised, saying [...] "Countless overdubs of Ms. Jackson's voice turn her into an airborne choir; computer rhythms thump and sizzle." [...] He concluded saying the album [...] "isn't as immediately melodic as Ms. Jackson's previous albums, but it compensates for lost catchiness with unabashed strangeness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club {{argued that}} {{through the use of}} a spoken {{introduction}} and other exposition-filled dialogue, the film fails by [...] "baldly revealing up front everything that the novel is trying to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> wonder about and to explore slowly". Youyoung Lee wrote in a December 2007 Entertainment Weekly that the film [...] "leaves out the gore", such as the book's ritualistic heart-eating that concludes the bear fight, [...] "to create family-friendlier fare". Lee also said that the film [...] "downplays the Magisterium's religious nature", but Robinson argued that the depiction of the Church in the film is as [...] "a hierarchical organization of formally robed, iconography-heavy priests who dictate and define morality for their followers, are based out of cathedrals, and decry teachings counter to theirs as 'heresy.'...doing ugly things to children under cover of secrecy". Robinson then asks, [...] "Who are most people going to think of besides the Catholic Church?" [...] The film gives more prominence to scenes showing the Magisterium officials' perspective than the novel. The novel rarely mentions explicitly the Magisterium's intentions, relying on the gossip of others, and the comments of Mrs. Coulter.|$|E
