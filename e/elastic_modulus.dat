25|$|<b>Elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> with low deflection. As the <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The <b>Elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAnisotropy in the {{compressive}} {{strength and the}} elastic stiffness of normal hot-mix asphalt (HMA) and polymer-modified asphalt (PMA) were investigated experimentally. Two types of prismatic specimen with planes of compaction either normal to or parallel to the applied axial compression were used. Both axial and lateral principal strains were measured locally. Continuous monotonic loadings at a constant strain rate were axially applied to investigate the anisotropy in the {{compressive strength}}. Very small strain–amplitude cyclic stresses were also applied by means of another load-controlled apparatus to investigate the anisotropy in the elastic stiffness. The followings were found: (i) compressive strengths of both HMA and PMA are anisotropic in that the values for the vertical direction were significantly larger than those of horizontal direction; (ii) the small strain stiffness of both HMA and PMA are anisotropic with the vertical <b>elastic</b> Young׳s <b>modulus</b> being greater than the horizontal elastic Young׳s modulus; (iii) the <b>elastic</b> Young׳s <b>modulus</b> is stress level dependent, exhibiting a hypo-elastic behaviour; and (iv) the <b>elastic</b> Young׳s <b>modulus</b> becomes greater with the applications of the normal and the polymer-modified asphalt cement binders...|$|R

25|$|Methylcellulose (MC) is a {{material}} with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs {{because of an}} increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases. The sol-gel transition is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the <b>elastic</b> <b>modulus</b> equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response. It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in in vivo applications. MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies. Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.|$|E

It is not surprising given this understanding of the forces involved that {{studies have shown that}} Ka varies strongly with osmotic pressure [...] but only weakly with tail length and unsaturation.
