60|$|She shook <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No,</b> {{she was not}} startled, but {{the idea}} shocked her early convictions. Her patriotism was larger. She had never {{considered}} that possibility.|$|E
60|$|On the beach, some {{half of a}} mile away, {{he found}} her gazing at the sea, a great white gull {{wheeling}} about <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> word of greeting passed between them; they only grasped each other's hands and looked into each other's hollow eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Making {{a sign to}} two men-at-arms, these {{brought forward}} Dame Editha and so placed her on the battlements {{that she could be}} seen from below. Dame Editha was still a very fair woman, {{although}} nigh forty years had rolled over <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> sign of fear appeared upon her face, and in a firm voice she cried to her son,-- ...|$|E

60|$|MARTHA--[Shaking <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sadly.] <b>No.</b> Curt {{has grown}} to dislike children. They remind him of--ours that were taken. He adored them so--he's never become reconciled.|$|R
60|$|Lady Mason, when Mrs. Orme {{returned}} to her, was sitting {{exactly in the}} position {{in which she had}} been left. Her bonnet was off and was lying by her side, and she was seated in a large arm-chair, again holding both her hands to the sides of <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> attempt had been made to smooth her hair or to remove the dust and soil which had come from the day's long sitting in the court. She was a woman very careful in her toilet, and scrupulously nice in all that touched her person. But now all that had been neglected, and her whole appearance was haggard and dishevelled.|$|E
6000|$|Evidently it {{had been}} her {{intention}} to go off with the murderer--to live with him! That story about America. If all had gone well, it would have accounted for everything. After leaving Laleham Gardens she had taken lodgings in a small house in Kentish Town under the name of Howard, giving herself out to be a chorus singer, her husband being an actor on tour. To make the thing plausible, she had obtained employment in one of the pantomimes. Not for a moment had she lost <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> one had ever called at her lodgings, and there had come no letters for her. Every hour of her day could be accounted for. Their plans must have been worked out over the corpse of her murdered husband. She was found guilty of being an [...] "accessory after the fact," [...] and sentenced to fifteen years' penal servitude.|$|E
60|$|In {{all this}} Eleanor was {{perfectly}} innocent, and Bertie Stanhope {{could hardly be}} called guilty. But every familiarity into which Eleanor was entrapped was deliberately planned by his sister. She knew well how to play her game, and played it without mercy; she knew, none so well, what was her brother's character, {{and she would have}} handed over to him the young widow, and the young widow's money, and the money of the widow's child, without remorse. With her pretended friendship and warm cordiality, she strove to connect Eleanor so closely with her brother as to make it impossible that she should go back even if she wished it. But Charlotte Stanhope knew really nothing of Eleanor's character, did not even understand that there were such characters. She did not comprehend that a young and pretty woman could be playful and familiar with a man such as Bertie Stanhope and yet have no idea in <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>no</b> feeling in her heart, that she would have been ashamed to own to all the world. Charlotte Stanhope did not in the least conceive that her new friend was a woman whom nothing could entrap into an inconsiderate marriage, whose mind would have revolted from the slightest impropriety had she been aware that any impropriety existed.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Maynard {{looked up}} with interest, but, shaking <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> coughed for <b>no.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Arthur {{kissed her}} and patted <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No,</b> she shouldn't go to school. As for going himself, {{that was quite}} out of the question. He had {{determined}} that {{that part of his}} life should not be renewed. In the midst of the general grief, and the corpse still lying above, he had leisure to conclude that he would have it all holidays for the future, that he wouldn't get up till he liked, or stand the bullying of the Doctor any more, and had made a hundred of such day-dreams and resolves for the future. How one's thoughts will travel! and how quickly our wishes beget them! When he with Laura in his hand went into the kitchen {{on his way to the}} dog-kennel, the fowl-houses, and other his favourite haunts, all the servants there assembled in great silence with their friends, and the labouring men and their wives, and Sally Potter who went with the post-bag to Clavering, and the baker's man from Clavering--all there assembled and drinking beer on the melancholy occasion--rose up on his entrance and bowed or curtseyed to him. They never used to do so last holidays, he felt at once and with indescribable pleasure. The cook cried out, [...] "O Lord," [...] and whispered, [...] "How Master Arthur do grow!" [...] Thomas, the groom, in the act of drinking, put down the jug alarmed before his master. Thomas's master felt the honour keenly. He went through and looked at the pointers. As Flora put her nose up to his waistcoat, and Ponto, yelling with pleasure, hurtled at his chain, Pen patronised the dogs, and said, [...] "Poo Ponto, poo Flora," [...] in his most condescending manner. And then he went and looked at Laura's hens, and at the pigs, and at the orchard, and at the dairy; perhaps he blushed to think that it was only last holidays he had in a manner robbed the great apple-tree, and been scolded by the dairymaid for taking cream.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I build my cathedral, that woman," [...] I said, {{pointing}} to a small painting by the fire, [...] "shall {{be among the first}} of my saints. You see her there, in an every-day dress-cap with a mortal thread-lace border, and with a very ordinary worked collar, fastened by a visible and terrestrial breastpin. There is no nimbus around <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>no</b> sign of the cross upon her breast; her hands are clasped on no crucifix or rosary. Her clear, keen, hazel eye looks as if it could sparkle with mirthfulness, as in fact it could; there are in it both the subtile flash of wit and the subdued light of humor; and though the whole face smiles, it has yet a certain decisive firmness that speaks the soul immutable in good. That woman shall be the first saint in my cathedral, and her name shall be recorded as Saint Esther. What makes saintliness in my view, as distinguished from ordinary goodness, is a certain quality of magnanimity and greatness of soul that brings life within the circle of the heroic. To be really great in little things, to be truly noble and heroic in the insipid details of every-day life, is a virtue so rare as to be worthy of canonization,--and this virtue was hers. New England Puritanism must be credited with the making of many such women. Severe as was her discipline, and harsh as seems now her rule, we have yet to see whether women will be born of modern systems of tolerance and indulgence equal to those grand ones of the olden times whose places now know them no more. The inconceivable austerity and solemnity with which Puritanism invested this mortal life, the awful grandeur of the themes which it made household words, the sublimity of the issues which it hung upon the commonest acts of our earthly existence, created characters of more than Roman strength and greatness; and the good men and women of Puritan training excelled the saints of the Middle Ages, as a soul fully developed intellectually, educated to closest thought, and exercised in reasoning, is superior to a soul great merely through impulse and sentiment.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2010, {{police in}} Minneapolis, Minnesota, raided the {{apartment}} of Rickia Russell looking for drugs. While Russell was eating dinner with her boyfriend, police threw a flashbang grenade after breaching the door. The exploding flashbang gave Rickia 3rd degree burns on both calves, and burns to <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> drugs were found in Russell's apartment and the Minneapolis City Council agreed to pay $1 million in damages.|$|E

5000|$|On May 21, 1994, Leal kidnapped, raped, {{and murdered}} 16-year-old Adria Sauceda. The {{girl had been}} at a party and become intoxicated, {{and a group of}} men gang-raped her. Leal is said to have offered to drive her home, and the two {{struggled}} when Sauceda tried {{to get out of the}} car a little distance away from the party. Official court documents state, [...] "There was a 30- to 40-pound asphalt rock roughly twice the size of the victim's skull lying partially on the victim's left arm; Blood was underneath this rock. A smaller rock with blood on it was located near the victim's right thigh.” There was also a stick 15 in in length extending out of her vagina, with a screw at the end. Leal claimed that she fell and hit <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> one was charged in the gang rape.|$|E

6000|$|The girl shook <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "There's <b>no</b> next time," [...] she said; [...] "once you're {{put down}} {{as one of}} the stand-offs. Plenty of others to take your place." ...|$|R

60|$|Oh My, immobile-faced, a statue, {{stood in}} the far doorway {{awaiting}} commands. Oh Dear, grief-stricken, stood at <b>her</b> mistress's <b>head,</b> <b>no</b> longer wringing <b>her</b> hands, but holding them so tightly clasped that the finger-tips and nails showed white. To the rear, at Paula's dressing table, Doctor Robinson noiselessly dissolved in a glass the anodyne pellets and filled his hypodermic.|$|R

60|$|It {{was truly}} Sylvia. She {{was dressed in}} white, not gray. Her hair was massed upon <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> There was <b>no</b> gray bonnet. She {{looked up at the}} sky, then at the trees, and withdrew.|$|R
60|$|Ethel smiled, {{and drew}} up <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and said <b>no</b> boys were like them anywhere, and papa would be delighted, and so {{went to bed}} happier in her exultation, and in hoping that the {{holidays}} would make Norman himself again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't say, Major," [...] and {{he shook}} his head gloomily. [...] "P'raps all put up job. But lots of rum things in world, Major, {{specially}} among beastly African savage who very curious and always ready pay blood to bad Spirit. Hope Asika not get this into <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> because <b>no</b> one know what happen. P'raps we see too much and scared all our lives; but p'raps all tommy rot." ...|$|R
60|$|Because she {{had lived}} near Farmer Brown's so long and had been hunted so often by Farmer Brown's boy and by Bowser the Hound, she had got the idea in <b>her</b> <b>head</b> that <b>no</b> matter what she did {{they would not be}} able to catch her. So at last she grew careless. Yes, Sir, she grew careless. And that is {{something}} no Fox or anybody else can afford to do.|$|R
60|$|Few know, {{and fewer}} love, the tomb and its place,--not shrine, for it stands bare by the cathedral wall: only, by chance, a cross is cut deep {{into one of}} the {{foundation}} stones behind <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> But <b>no</b> goddess statue of the Greek cities, no nun's image among the cloisters of Apennine, no fancied light of angel in the homes of heaven, has more divine rank among the thoughts of men.|$|R
60|$|Ravonino at last {{solved the}} {{difficulty}} by taking his lady-love in his strong arms. She submitted with a sleepy protest, and <b>her</b> little <b>head</b> was <b>no</b> sooner on the man's shoulder {{than she was}} fast asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I am {{glad she}} {{is out of}} the question. It is {{offering}} a great deal both on her part and her husband's to take charge of these two, but it would never do. She is almost a child herself,--a bride and beauty under twenty,--excessively admired, very likely to have <b>her</b> <b>head</b> turned. <b>No,</b> it would be too absurd. All her kindness, amiability, desire to make Marian her friend and companion, would only serve to do harm." ...|$|R
60|$|The child {{dropped her}} eyes, and shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> but made <b>no</b> further remark. I saw that tears were {{trickling}} down her cheeks, and, feeling uncertain {{as to how}} far she realised her forlorn condition, refrained from further speech, and drew <b>her</b> little <b>head</b> upon my breast, while I sought to comfort her with hopes of soon meeting her father.|$|R
60|$|Laurent, indeed, {{snatched}} up a chair, and felled her by a blow of it across <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> He would, <b>no</b> doubt, have proceeded in his fury to have battered her to death, {{but for the}} arrival of gens d'armes and the police commissioner of the district, who took her in their protecting charge.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him with a sad smile and shook <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "No, <b>no,</b> dear prince, I don't laugh at you. Heaven forbid! You are much too serious an affair.
