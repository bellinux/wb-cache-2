40|$|Flutter {{measurements}} were performed with a supercritical 2 -dimensional wing (section: NLR 7301) {{primarily in the}} transonic flow regime. The rigid wing model was mounted in a symmetrical suspension system permitting two degree-of-freedom oscillations in heave and pitch. The motion of the wing was measured non-intrusively by optical methods and steady/unsteady forces are obtained by a piezo-electric balance. A non-intrusive flutter control system was applied based on a laser vibrometer and <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>exciters.</b> It permitted positive and negative feedback. The flutter tests were performed in the Mach number range 0. 5 <Ma< 0. 81 and the stagnation pressure range 0. 38 <p 0 < 1. 2 bar. The transonic dip {{was found to be}} a very sharp one at Ma&# 610. 77. The dynamic pressure for flutter at this minimum is roughly half of the subsonic value (Ma &# 61 approx 0. 5) ...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{exposure}} at workplaces {{is generally}} multi-axial. The {{health effects of}} vibration exposure also likely depend on the vibration direction. Therefore, {{there is a wide}} interest in the simulation of multi-axial vibration in laboratory experiments. Advances in technology have {{led to the development of}} a new 3 -D test system for studying hand-transmitted vibration exposure and health effects. The purposes of this paper are to introduce the system and to present the results of its preliminary evaluations. Test System As shown in Figure 1, the system is basically composed of three vibration generators, a multi-axis vibration control system, instrumented handle, handle fixture, and shaker-fixture linkages (stingers). [] Figure 2 shows the array of three vibration generators (MB Dynamics, Energizer BLACK- 500 lbs) and their associated support bases and foundation developed by MB Dynamics (Cleveland, USA), which create the 3 -axis simultaneous motion. These <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>exciters</b> are powered by power amplifiers which provide current proportional to the analog drive signal from a controller. The controller (JAGUAR Multi-Input/Multi-Output closed-loop vibration controller) was provided by Spectral Dynamics, San Jose, California, USA).

Three types of flutter were observed: in and near the transonic dip minimum limit cycle oscillations (LCO) in heave and pitch. The second type was pure limited cycle pitch oscillations. A little bit away from the minimum, where the dynamic pressure is slightly increased, an alternating oscillation between heave and pitch was observed. Pure heave oscillations were not found. A bifurcation diagram was plotted from four data points. The type of bifurcation seemed to be supercritical because no hysteresis effects were found. In all flutter cases the oscillations could be controlled (suppressed) using the flutter control system...|$|R
40|$|During the {{prototype}} vibration {{tests of the}} GAS adapter beam, significant impacting of the beam at its support points was observed. The cause of the impacting was traced to gaps under the mounting bolt heads. Because of the nonlinear nature of the response, {{it was difficult to}} evaluate the effects which Shuttle launch dynamics might have on the mounting bolt loads. A series of tests were conducted on an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>exciter</b> in which the transient acceleration time histories, which had been measured during the Space Transportation System- 1 (STS- 1; Space Shuttle mission 1) launch, were simulated. The actual flight data had to be filtered and compensated so that it could be reproduced on the shaker without exceeding displacement and velocity limitations. Mounting bolt loads were measured directly by strain gages applied to the bolts. Various gap thicknesses and bolt torques were investigated. Although increased gap thickness resulted in greater accelerations due to impacting, the bolt loads were not significantly affected. This is attributed to the fact that impacting excited mostly higher frequency modes which do not have significant modal mass...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{acceptance}} tests with the PPF/ENVISAT- 1 Flight Model are {{planned to be}} performed in August 2000. As it is required to check and validate the structural dynamics model, it is desired to identify the modal parameters. First, the theory and {{the basic principles of}} modal identification by multi-axial base excitation are described. A frequency domain method, which is best suited for a general and reliable modal identification, is described in detail and the required steps for performing a modal identification are summarized. Recommendations are given for the performance of the base excitation tests. Also the proposed measurement point plan is reviewed. Apart from the lack of additional measurement points on the spacecraft core structure, which would allow a better global mode assessment, the measurement point plan seems to be adequate for modal identification. In order to have an alternative in case of difficulties with the HYDRA performance, a complementary modal identification method is proposed and described. The additional modal survey test shall be performed in a simplified manner with one single <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>exciter...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work {{deals with the}} reduction of windshield-vibration-induced interior noise in an automobile passenger compartment by means of active structural acoustic control (ASAC). The investigations are based on former work conducted {{within the framework of}} the EU-IP InMAR and make use of an existing test-car equipped with an active windshield. The active windshield consists of the passive structure augmented with optimally placed piezo-ceramic transducers. Main focus of the subsequent work was the development and evaluation of different control strategies (H 2, FxLMS) designed with regard to either local or global performance metrics. Due to the lack of a roller test bench, the structural excitation was realized by an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>exciter</b> (shaker) lo-cated at the roof brace between the A-pillars. By this choice it was possible to emulate the struc-tural excitation of the windshield due to rolling and motor force harmonics. In order to achieve a fully structurally integrated sensing and actuation of the windshield vibration the exclusive use of optimally placed piezoelectric transducers was intended. Though, in the experiments, sensing was performed by means of acceleration sensors facilitating a calibration of structural sensor- and Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV) data...|$|E
40|$|Two test campaigns were performed, {{the first}} one on the CSI Phase- 0 Evolutionary Model Testbed, and the second one on the Phase- 3 testbed. The purpose of these modal {{analysis}} studies was to evaluate promising modal test and data analysis methods, and {{to make use of}} simulated on-board excitation capabilities in the first test campaign, and to apply and evaluate methods for the selection of measurement and exciter locations, as well as to make use of conventional and unconventional means to excite flexible space structures in the second test campaign. The test on the CEM- 0 showed that excitation functions consisting of exponentially decaying sinusoids are the most favorable excitations for the identification of a limited number of target modes. Multi-point random excitation gave the best overall results. A two-step data improvement strategy was developed to account for noisy measurements. The second test campaign is not yet finished. But there are some remarkable results from the tests performed up to now. The excitation concept not to excite all flexible substructures individually, but to excite the structure as in a multi-axis vibration test, using the available <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>exciters,</b> proved to be very effective. The methods used for the sensor placement worked well when they were applied to finite-element models. But they are sensitive to modeling inaccuracies. Therefore additional criteria like redundancy, and the ability to interpret and classify modes by just inspecting them visually, turned out to be very helpful. (orig.)

40|$|The <b>Electrodynamic</b> Vibration <b>Exciter</b> (shakers) {{has been}} one of the most {{employed}} excitation sources in modal tests. The shaker is an electromechanical device that provides a mechanical motion due to the input signal sent to its coil. Despite being widely used, it is well known that the shaker interacts with the structure under test. In particular, when the structure passes through a given resonance, the force delivered by the shaker abruptly decreases, causing the so called drop off phenomenon. This paper aims to study this force drop off phenomenon in the single shaker modal testing. Analytical models are developed to help in understanding the physical principles involved in the interaction between the shaker and the structure under test. Experimental analyses are performed using different shakers as well as excitation signals, in order to evaluate the effects of the input signal, as well as the power amplifier operational modes, on the structure dynamics. Preliminary tests revealed that significant distortions might occur during vibration tests using shakers and these distortions significantly affect the determination of the structure response...|$|R
40|$|When using <b>electrodynamic</b> {{vibration}} <b>exciters</b> {{to excite}} structures, the actual force {{applied to the}} structure under test is the reaction force between the exciter and the structure. The magnitude and phase of the reaction force is dependent upon {{the characteristics of the}} structure and exciter. Therefore the quality of the reaction force i. e. the force applied on the structure depends on the relationship between the exciter and structure under test. Looking at the signal from the force transducer when exciting a structure with a sine wave, the signal will appear harmonically distorted within the regions of the resonance frequencies. This phenomenon is easily observed when performing tests on lightly damped structures. The harmonic distortion is a result of nonlinearities produced by the shaker when undergoing large amplitude vibrations, at resonances. When dealing with non-linear structures, it is of great importance {{to be able to keep}} a constant force level as well as a non-distorted sine wave in order to get reliable results within the regions of the resonance frequencies. This paper presents theoretical methods that can be used to create a non-distorted sinusoidal excitation signal with constant force level...|$|R
40|$|The poor sound {{insulation}} of windows especially at low frequencies constitutes a severe problem, both in transportation {{and in the}} building sector. Due to additional constraints on vehicles or aircrafts regarding energy efficiency and lightweight construction, the demand of light-weight-compliant noise-reduction solutions is amplified in the transportation industry. Simultaneously, {{in order to satisfy}} the customer demands on visual comfort and modern design, the relative size of glazed surfaces increases in all sectors. The experimental study presented below considers the feasibility of actively controlled windows for noise reduction in passenger compartments by using the example of an automobile windshield. The active windshield consists of the passive windshield, augmented with piezoceramic actuators and sensors. The main focus of the subsequent work was the development and evaluation of feedforward and feedback control strategies with regard to interior noise reduction. The structural excitation of the windshield was realized by an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>exciter</b> (shaker) applied at the roof brace between the A-pillars. By this choice it was possible to emulate the structural excitation of the windshield through the car body, induced by coasting and motor-force harmonics. The laboratory setup does not permit the consideration of hydrodynamic and acoustic loads, which might be important as well. However, the experimental results indicate the high noise reduction potential of active structural acoustic control of structure-borne sound that radiates into a cavity...|$|E
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) can be {{used for}} atomic and nanoscale surface characterization in both air and liquid environments. AFM is basically used to measure the mechanical, chemical and biological properties of the sample under investigation. AFM contains basically a base-excited microcantilever with nano tip along with a sensing circuit for scanning of images. Design and analysis of this microcantilevers is a challenging task in real time practice. In the present work, design and dynamic analysis of rectangular microcantilevers in tapping mode with tip-mass effect is considered. Computer simulations are performed with both lumped-parameter and distributed parameter models. The interatomic forces between the nano tip mass and substrate surfaces are treated using Lennard Jones (LJ) model and DMT model. The equations of motion are derived for both one-degree of freedom lumped parameter model with squeeze-film damping and distributed parameter model under the harmonic base excitation. Also the nonlinearity of the cantilever is investigated by considering cubic stiffness. The distributed parameter model is simplified with one mode approximation using Galerkin’s scheme. The resulting nonlinear dynamic equations are solved using in numerical Runge-Kutta method using a MATLAB program. The natural frequencies of the microcantilever and dynamic response are obtained. Dynamic stability issues are studied using phase diagrams and frequency responses. An experimental work is carried out to understand the variations in dynamic characteristics of a chromium plated steel microcantilever specimen fabricated using wire-cut EDM process. An <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>exciter</b> is attached at the cantilever base and laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) is used to provide sensing signal at the oscilloscope.

40|$|The {{multimodal}} {{friction ignition}} tester (MFIT) is a testbed for experiments on the thermal and mechanical effects of friction on material specimens in pressurized, oxygen-rich atmospheres. In simplest terms, a test involves recording sensory data while rubbing two specimens {{against each other}} at a controlled normal force, with either a random stroke or a sinusoidal stroke having controlled amplitude and frequency. The term multimodal in the full name of the apparatus refers to a capability for imposing any combination of widely ranging values of the atmospheric pressure, atmospheric oxygen content, stroke length, stroke frequency, and normal force. The MFIT was designed especially for studying the tendency toward heating and combustion of nonmetallic composite materials and the fretting of metals subjected to dynamic (vibrational) friction forces {{in the presence of}} liquid oxygen or pressurized gaseous oxygen test conditions approximating conditions expected to be encountered in proposed composite material oxygen tanks aboard aircraft and spacecraft in flight. The MFIT includes a stainless-steel pressure vessel capable of retaining the required test atmosphere. Mounted atop the vessel is a pneumatic cylinder containing a piston for exerting the specified normal force between the two specimens. Through a shaft seal, the piston shaft extends downward into the vessel. One of the specimens is mounted on a block, denoted the pressure block, {{at the lower end of}} the piston shaft. This specimen is pressed down against the other specimen, which is mounted in a recess in another block, denoted the slip block, that can be moved horizontally but not vertically. The slip block is driven in reciprocating horizontal motion by an electrodynamic vibration exciter outside the pressure vessel. The armature of the <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>exciter</b> is connected to the slip block via a horizontal shaft that extends into the pressure vessel via a second shaft seal. The reciprocating horizontal motion can be chosen to be random with a flat spectrum over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 1 kHz, or to be sinusoidal at any peak-to-peak amplitude up to 0. 8 in. (. 2 cm) and fixed or varying frequency up to 1 kHz. The temperatures of the specimen and of the vessel are measured by thermocouples. A digital video camera mounted outside the pressure vessel is aimed into the vessel through a sapphire window, with its focus fixed on the interface between the two specimens. A position transducer monitors the displacement of the pneumatic-cylinder shaft. The pressure in the vessel is also monitored. During a test, the output of the video camera, the temperatures, and the pneumatic-shaft displacement are monitored and recorded. The test is continued for a predetermined amount of time (typically, 10 minutes) or until either (1) the output of the position transducer shows a sudden change indicative of degradation of either or both specimens, (2) ignition or another significant reaction is observed, or (3) pressure in the vessel increases beyond a pre-set level that triggers an automatic shutdown...|$|E
