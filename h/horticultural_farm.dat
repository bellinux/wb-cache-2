5000|$|The {{land was}} {{originally}} purchased in 1917. Rutgers Gardens—then called [...] "Horticultural Farm No. 1"—housed the Experiment Station's peach-breeding program, although ornamental displays were also {{established in the}} early 1920s in conjunction with ongoing ornamental research. In 1930, the farm featured more than 600 varieties of dahlias and iris, including test gardens developed in coordination with the Dahlia Society of New Jersey and the American Iris Society. Trials of gladiolus were also established, {{in cooperation with the}} New Jersey Gladiolus Society. These and other displays were opportunities to showcase selected and developed varieties in cooperation with community organizations. Around this time, a shrub display garden containing over 200 species and numerous varieties was established, which remains one of the oldest surviving sections of the existing collection (which was expanded between 1930 and 1950). Some of the oldest hollies at Rutgers Gardens were planted in the late 1930s, and expanded through the 40s, 50s, and into the 60s, as part of an active breeding program. Many of these make up the foundation of what is now a significant collection. A 1936 photo of <b>Horticultural</b> <b>Farm</b> No. 1 shows a series of nine display gardens, of which the bearded iris display was the precursor to the current Donald B. Lacey Display Garden, originally constructed in 1964. Later additions and removals of plant, as well the establishment of various new ornamental and tribute gardens, have shaped Rutgers Gardens into its current form.The name of Rutgers Gardens is strongly associated with that of Bruce [...] "Doc" [...] Hamilton. In the 1990s, despite strong opposition, Rutgers University planned to sell Rutgers Gardens for urban development. In 1993, Dr. Bruce Hamilton, Rutgers professor, accepted responsibility for directing the Gardens' management and funding. Thanks to his dedication, to generous supporters, and to the work of many volunteers, the Gardens survived for everybody's enjoyment.|$|E

While, root respiration accounted for substantial proportions: tea plantation   28 %, <b>horticultural</b> <b>farm</b>   53 %, and natural forest   53 %. Soil temperature demonstrated a significant positive correlation with the CO 2 flux, except in the natural forest. On the other hand, water-filled pore spaces displayed varying correlation with site CO 2 flux: a negative relationship in both bare plot and tea plantation, appreciably positive in the <b>horticultural</b> <b>farm,</b> and weakly related in the natural forest. Soil respiration and C-organic content appeared to be strongly correlated; the rate of soil respiration increased with higher C-organic content. In field, CO 2 flux from organic matter decomposition in Andisols, Latosols, and peatland ranged from 5. 35 - 13. 22 Mg C-CO 2 ha- 1 yr- 1, with root respiration contributing most of the flux, which was, in turn, influenced by type vegetation, humidity and soil temperature.

40|$|According to {{the current}} findings, BfR assumes that the EHEC O 104 :H 4 {{outbreak}} in Germany is attributable to the consumption of contaminated sprouts. The outbreak pathogen was very likely introduced via supplied fenugreek seeds into the sprout production. BfR believes that a causal input via water, humans, animals or pests into the <b>horticultural</b> <b>farm</b> in Lower Saxony is hardly probable, in particular because the outbreak strain was not detected {{in any of the}} samples taken despite intensive investigations. The trace back investigation of seed supplies in Germany and other EU member states by the German authorities and the EFSA Task Force clearly shows that cases of disease which occurred in France in late June caused by EHEC O 104 :H 4 are connected to the <b>horticultural</b> <b>farm</b> in Lower Saxony through the same seed batch produced in 2009. So far there is no specific indication suggesting that other seed types and batches were contaminated by the outbreak strain due to non-hygienic production conditions in the country of origin or by cross-contamination between the intermediaries and recipients (e. g. cleaning, mixing and filling processes). This is nonetheless possible. As long as there are still contaminated seed batches on the market and may be used for the production of sprouts and germ buds, restaurants and catering institutions are advised to carefully consider any serving of raw sprouts and germ buds to consumers.

For heavy metals the availability in the soil solution was estimated based on the measured absolute content. Abundance, biomass and species richness were significantly higher in grassland soils than in horticultural soils, and within the <b>horticultural</b> <b>farms</b> significantly higher in vegetable than in flower-bulb farms. No epigeic species were found in horticultural soils. The differences between the various farm types were probably related to the intensity of management practices, such as soil tillage, harvesting and crop protection measures, that result in less soil organic matter of lower quality. The data from the grassland farms were analyzed in conjunction with the physico-chemical soil characteristics, applying canonical correspondence analysis. Community parameters such as species richness and diversity apparently were not related to soil characteristics, but an appreciable part of the variation in abundance and biomass of several individual species could be explained by factors such as lutum content (particles < 16 7 m), pH, bio-availability of metal ions and geographical position of the sample site.

40|$|Finance is {{important}} for Indonesian farmers to purchase agricultural inputs and machinery and to pay for hired labour, which can improve farm performance. Farmers in Indonesia can access finance from various finance providers, i. e. banks, micro-finance institutions, farmers’ associations, traders, agricultural input kiosks and so-called “other sources” such as family and friends. The overall objective of this thesis was to analyse the relation between finance utilisation from different finance providers and horticultural business performance in Indonesia. This thesis first compares farmer knowledge of the requirements to obtain finance with the actual requirements set by finance providers, and investigates factors that determine farmer knowledge of the requirements. Next, this thesis analyses the relation between finance utilisation from different finance providers and the technical efficiency of <b>horticultural</b> <b>farms</b> using a bootstrap truncated regression. Furthermore, the role of finance utilisation from different finance providers in production risk is analysed using an ordinary least squares regression. Finally, this thesis analyses finance utilisation and its relation with chili supply chain continuity as reflected by contract fulfilment rates using a censored regression analysis. Findings show that farmers generally have little knowledge of the finance requirements. Findings also show that in-kind finance utilisation from farmers’ associations positively associates with farmer knowledge of finance requirements. The results of the bootstrap truncated regression show that commercial credit from banks and in-kind finance from farmers’ associations positively associate with the technical efficiency of some types of <b>horticultural</b> <b>farms.</b> Commercial credit from micro-finance institutions and flexible payment of inputs to agricultural input kiosks generally have negative associations, especially with the technical efficiency of mangosteen farms. Subsidised credit from banks and in-kind finance from traders have {{both positive and negative}} associations with the technical efficiency of the <b>horticultural</b> <b>farms.</b> With regard to production risk, results show that depending on the risk measure, risk-reducing associations were found for commercial credit from banks and flexible payments of inputs to kiosks.

40|$|The annual {{agricultural}} census in Belgium delivers quantitative data of net and additional areas of land used for agriculture and horticulture. We introduce the term ‘tare land’ {{to indicate the}} latter as the area of land fragments not directly supporting crops or fodder, at farm level or at higher (landscape, region) level. For spatial planning and zoning purposes data on gross agricultural area (being the sum of net and tare areas) are required. However, {{the quality of the}} tare data is not documented or even questioned. In Belgian and international scientific and grey literature, little information on tare is available. In this paper we define two classes of tare, functional tare (fTare) and plan tare (pTare). fTare encompasses the sum of the area of all additional land used by farmers for professional purpose or closely associated to the net agricultural area but not directly used for the production of food, fodder or industrial crops. Plan tare (pTare) is defined as these parts of the statutory agricultural area not specifically used in farming, such as public roads and inclusions of non-farming buildings. By means of a GPS-survey and interviews with farm managers, we used two methods to survey net and tare areas of land. On one hand we surveyed the land within farm enterprises: 3 open air <b>horticultural</b> <b>farms,</b> 6 greenhouse <b>horticultural</b> <b>farms</b> and one mixed farm (open air horticulture and greenhouse). On the other hand we surveyed 10 segments of 25 ha, all situated in one municipality within a major horticultural region of Flanders (northern region of Belgium). fTare areas account on average for 21 % of the total farm area in the case of open air horticulture whereas the fTare area is 39 % in case of greenhouse <b>horticultural</b> <b>farms.</b> These averages are significantly different. The mixed farm had an fTare area of 32 %. Within areas designated for agriculture plan tare is 44 %. Hence only 56 % of the land with an agricultural destination is effectively used for agriculture. These figures illustrate the spatial importance of tare areas and the spatially extremely scattered organisation of horticulture in the study area. Knowledge on quality and nature of tare areas is important for multiobjective spatial planning in which economic and ecological sustainability of agriculture is considered. status: publishe...|$|R
