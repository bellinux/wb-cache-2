Mut-Ashkur the new king of Assyria was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> tribute to Hammurabi, however Babylon did not rule Assyria directly.|$|E
5|$|In 1205, the Republic of Venice invaded Dalmatia {{with the}} forces of the Fourth Crusade. Ragusa was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a tribute, {{eventually}} becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara, used as Venice's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea. In the 14th century, after liberation from Venetian supremacy, extensive work was done on the walls to ensure the republic's liberty.|$|E

5|$|A {{new kind}} of {{pollution}} entered the lower Saw Mill in 2003 when a Yonkers sugar refinery spilled hydrochloric acid into the river. Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro brought criminal environmental charges against American Sugar Refining, the plant owner, which was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a $20,000 fine; make a $100,000 donation to Riverkeeper, a regional environmental organization {{that focuses on the}} Hudson and its tributaries; and give one ton (800kg) of sugar to Westchester Food-PATCH, a local nonprofit that supplies food to other nonprofits. Riverkeeper passed the money it received along to the Saw Mill River Coalition for local projects in Yonkers.|$|E
5|$|According to Constantine VII, the Slavs rose {{up again}} in the early 840s, but were {{defeated}} by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios. In the south, the two tribes of the Ezeritai and Melingoi held out longer. They were eventually subdued and <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> heavy tribute, but retained their autonomy. These two tribes rose up again a century later, in 921. Again they were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|E

5|$|Ernuszt also {{rented out}} the royal copper mines at Besztercebánya to the Thurzós for 12 years on 26 December 1494. The Thurzós and the banker Jakob Fugger {{established}} a joint venture, named Ungarischer Handel ("Hungarian Trade"), {{to exploit the}} mines. According to Antonio Bonfini, Ernuszt persuaded the king to launch a campaign against Lawrence Újlaki who had captured Futak and Cserög. Újlaki was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> homage to the king at Pécs on 27 March 1495, and to return the two estates to Ernuszt.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, the {{combined}} fleets of France, England and Russia defeated {{the combined}} Ottoman–Egyptian fleet in the Battle of Navarino. In 1828, {{under the terms}} of the Treaty of Constantinople, Greece became an independent state which was recognized by the Ottomans in 1829. When Ioannis Capodistrias was made president of Greece, he had Petros Mavromachalis imprisoned. The Mavromichalis' reacted by assassinating Capodistrias in Nauplion as he went to church. The Maniots continued causing trouble and defeated two Bavarian armies King Otto sent against them before they were subdued only after some of the leaders were bribed. This ended the Maniots' independence and they were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes.|$|E
5|$|In 60 BC, Hybrida {{was quietly}} {{removed from the}} {{position}} of governor of Macedonia and replaced by Gaius Octavius. The next year, he was prosecuted by Julius Caesar and Marcus Licinius Crassus. The outcome of this was that Hybrida was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a fine and banished to the Island of Cephallania. Sometime in 47 BC, Hybrida was recalled from his banishment by Caesar. In 45 BC he made himself {{a candidate for the}} position of censor which ultimately failed. The final mention of Hybrida comes from Cicero in 44 BC when Mark Antony divorced himself from Hybrida's daughter Antonia Hybrida Major.|$|E

During the ensuing struggle in which the Board tried <b>to</b> <b>force</b> Mark <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> various board members received threats from Mark. This resulted in the filing of a suit on January 28, 1977, by Mr. Vehar on behalf of the Board. The complaint filed not only sought <b>to</b> <b>force</b> Mark <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the money due under the contract but also requested $50,000 in exemplary damages because of the threats made against the Board members.|$|R

5|$|In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed {{no further}} than Stora Karlsö off Gotland before it had to turn back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, {{and the loss of}} vital equipment. Stenbock, held {{personally}} responsible for the failure by King Charles XI, was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the campaign out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of the new}} routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} continue into downtown Washington, as they once had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents would be <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate {{the impact of the}} total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E

He was {{assigned}} to B Flight. MacLachlan was uncomfortable with the military banter and the use of religious profanities. He also complained about the bills applicants were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Mess bills were reportedly £ 2 10s per week and laundry 5s. Most of his salary was expended on these necessities.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed. This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for its completion, {{as it had been}} obliged to with the finger reliquary. This request is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{affected}} all of England; even {{families were}} split over Royalist or Parliamentarian loyalties. Little is recorded over the divisions within Hale Barns, but Hale and Hale Barns did {{emerge from the}} Civil War more or less untouched by events– {{though there was a}} heavy tax to pay to support the Parliamentarian army they avoided much of the requisitioning of supplies and animals for passing armies. None of the Royalists in Hale and Hale Barns had their lands confiscated or was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> fines.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and many people had left {{the city for the}} country. It was an {{intensely}} hot day, which further reduced the number of people prepared to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{highlights}} of the match included the sending-off of Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira for a second bookable offence, for an incident that also brought about a booking for Manchester United centre-forward Ruud van Nistelrooy, and the decision by referee Steve Bennett to award Manchester United a penalty kick in the last minute of the match. Players from both teams were charged by The Football Association (the FA) for their reactions {{at the end of}} the game, five Arsenal players and two Manchester United players were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> fines.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes on it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for {{the ability to be}} turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} of Nicopolis, the Ottomans {{occupied}} Bulgaria and could attack Wallachia more easily. Mircea I the Old, however, could reoccupy Dobruja in 1402 {{by taking advantage of}} the Ottomans' difficulties after their defeat by Timur Lenk in {{the battle of}} Ankara. He even intervened in the Ottoman civil war and supported the struggle of Musa and Mustafa against their brother, Mehmed I. After the two pretenders had been defeated, the Ottomans annexed again Dobruja and occupied Giurgiu, and Mircea I was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> an annual tribute to the sultan. Under Mircea I iron mines were opened at Baia de Fier and copper mining began at Baia de Aramă. In addition, sulfur and amber were extracted in the region of Buzău.|$|E
