50|$|Small-hole gauges {{require a}} {{slightly}} different technique to the telescopic gauges, the small hole gauge is initially set smaller than the bore to be measured. It is then inserted into the bore and adjusted by rotating the knurled knob at the base, until light pressure is felt when the gauge is slightly moved in the bore. The gauge is then removed and measured with a caliper or micrometer. To accurately detect the maximal distance between {{the two halves of}} the <b>gauge</b> <b>head,</b> move the head of the gauge around while making the measurement to insure you get the maximal reading. Grasp the gauge near the head to aid in your maneuvering of the gauge while adjusting the micrometer so it just stops the gauge's motion at one spot only. A bit of practice will quickly give you the idea.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Current {{methods for}} {{measuring}} Globoidal cam exist these problems: difficulty of measurement of profile machining error, heavy dependency on expensive measuring equipment and low measuring efficiency. In order to solve them, this paper established a high efficient virtual measuring method for globoidal cam machining errors. Based on virtual measuring theory and globoidal cam space engagement theory, and {{by taking the}} three-dimensional machining simulation models of the globoidal cam profile as the measured object, the virtual <b>gauge</b> <b>head</b> can do measurement along the planned measuring path. The machining error calculation method was determined according {{to the degree of}} geometric interference between virtual <b>gauge</b> <b>head</b> and the surface of machined models. And a virtual measuring system on UG platform for globoidal cam profile machining errors was built by use of Visual C++ 6. 0 and UG/Open API secondary development tools. Finally, a virtual measuring experiment was performed for the two kind of machining simulation models generated by generating method and one-side machining method. The experimental results show that the high efficient virtual measuring method for globoidal cam machining error is correct and the virtual measuring system is reliable. On the one hand, an effective method is provided to achieve an efficient, low-cost measurement for globoidal cam profile machining errors in this paper. On the other hand, it has great engineering guiding significance for the actual production and processing of globoidal cam...|$|E

40|$|Commercially {{produced}} {{sheets of}} superplastic grade Al 7475 with various thicknesses have been characterised {{in terms of}} their microstructure and mechanical properties. Gold grids deposited on polished surfaces of tensile specimens were used to measure the surface strains on mesoscopic and microscopic length scales, and fracture surfaces were examined using SEM. The results show that mechanically the alloy behaves like other superplastic materials, with a maximum strain rate sensitivity, m, of 0. 6, and a grain size exponent, p, of 2. 6. Thinner sheets had smaller grain sizes and therefore higher superplastic strain rates. The surface studies showed that the actual strain rate in the gauge length was considerably smaller than the ratio of the crosshead velocity to the nominal gauge length owing to extrusion of material from the <b>gauge</b> <b>head.</b> Evidence for grain boundary sliding and localised tensile separation of material were found. The latter effect was responsible for about 30 % of the strain in the surface. The separated regions were bridged by filaments of similar dimensions to whiskers observed protruding from the fracture surfaces. These whiskers were rich in Mg and were oxidised. It is suggested that the solid oxide layer is responsible for stabilising the filaments against necking...|$|E

Details are presented of the tapping point, stilling well, stilling well/tapping point connection and the technique used to measure gauge height. The relationship between discharge rate and <b>gauge</b> <b>head</b> for the weir structure installed is discussed. The high gradient and high silt load of the run-off streams have led to silt deposition behind the weirs. Information is given on the silt levels and their effect of the discharge/gauge head relationship.

The error on the total discharge in an event, a parameter of interest in estimating runoff coefficients and total pollution loads, was in general less than this.

However, how to precisely determine if the bowel can withstand the pressure of a colorectal anastomosis experiment, which is called anastomotic bursting pressure, has not been determined. MethodA task force developed the experimental animal hollow organ mechanical testing system to provide precise measurement of the maximum pressure that an anastomotic colon can withstand, and to compare it with the commonly used method such as the mercury and air bag pressure manometer in a rat colon rupture pressure test. Forty-five male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into the manual ball manometry (H) group, the tracing machine manometry pressure <b>gauge</b> <b>head</b> (MP) group, and the experimental animal hollow organ mechanical testing system (ME) group. The rats in each group were subjected to a cut colon rupture pressure test after injecting anesthesia in the tail vein. Colonic end-to-end anastomosis was performed, and the rats were rested for 1 week before anastomotic bursting pressure was determined by one of the three methods. ResultsNo differences were observed between the normal colon rupture pressure and colonic anastomotic bursting pressure, which were determined using the three manometry methods. However, several advantages, such as reduction in errors, were identified in the ME group. ConclusionDifferent types of manometry methods {{can be applied to the}} normal rat colon, but the colonic anastomotic bursting pressure test using the experimental animal hollow organ mechanical testing system is superior to traditional methods...|$|E

40|$|Published in : ISH Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, Vol. 21, No. 1, 65 – 84 In this paper, two multi-variable {{regression}} {{models have been}} developed to predict the discharge and approach velocity coefficients from relevant independent variables. The {{regression models}} are developed based on relevant experimental data obtained from testing nine different flow measurement long-throated flumes with symmetrical rectangular compound cross-sections. The long-throated flume was used in the compound cross-section to experimentally estimate the discharge and approach velocity coefficients using mainly head measurements and cross-section dimensions as required by the stage-discharge equations. The independent variables used in predicting the two coefficients represent dimensionless parameters defined using the <b>gauged</b> <b>head</b> at the head measurement section, floodplain depth, length of throat in the direction of flow, and cross-section geometry at the control section. Several statistically-based analyses were performed to verify the reliability of the developed multi-variable regression models. All deployed analyses have indicated that the two regression models are associated with high predictive strength. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is the development of regression-based models to predict the discharge and approach velocity coefficients {{that can be used in}} conjunction with stage-discharge equations to estimate the flow in a symmetric rectangular channel with compound cross-section...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between groundwater and surface water along the Tambo and Nicholson rivers, southeast Australia, was investigated using 222 Rn, Cl, differential flow <b>gauging,</b> <b>head</b> gradients, electrical conductivity (EC) and temperature profiles. Head gradients, temperature profiles, Cl concentrations and 222 Rn activities all indicate higher groundwater fluxes to the Tambo River {{in areas of}} increased topographic variation where the potential to form large groundwater–surface water gradients is greater. Groundwater discharge to the Tambo River calculated by Cl mass balance was significantly lower (1. 48 × 10 4 to 1. 41 × 10 3 m 3 day − 1) than discharge estimated by 222 Rn mass balance (5. 35 × 10 5 to 9. 56 × 10 3 m 3 day − 1) and differential flow gauging (5. 41 × 10 5 to 6. 30 × 10 3 m 3 day − 1) due to bank return waters. While groundwater sampling from {{the bank of the}} Tambo River was intended to account for changes in groundwater chemistry associated with bank infiltration, variations in bank infiltration between sample sites remain unaccounted for, limiting the use of Cl as an effective tracer. Groundwater discharge to both the Tambo and Nicholson rivers was the highest under high-flow conditions in the days to weeks following significant rainfall, indicating that the rivers are well connected to a groundwater system that is responsive to rainfall. Groundwater constituted the lowest proportion of river discharge during times of increased rainfall that followed dry periods, while groundwater constituted the highest proportion of river discharge under baseflow conditions (21. 4 % of the Tambo in April 2010 and 18. 9 % of the Nicholson in September 2010) ...|$|R

40|$|Evaluating {{summaries}} {{is currently}} {{performed by the}} use of statistically-based tools which lack any linguistic knowledge and are unable to produce grammatical and semantic judgements (Landauer et al., 1997). However, summary evaluation needs precise linguistic information with a much finer-grained coverage than what is being offered by currently available statistically based systems. We assume that the starting point of any interesting application in these fields must necessarily be a good syntactic-semantic parser. In this paper we present the system for text understanding called GETARUNS, General Text and Reference Understanding System (Delmonte, 2003). The heart of the system is a rule-based top-down parser, which uses an LFG oriented grammar organization. Lately, a less constrained version of the parser for the application field of text summarization has been developed, which allows the system to recover gracefully from failures. To this end, the parser is couple with another concurrent parsing processes: a partial or shallow parse is always produced and used to recover from complete failures. GETARUNS, has a highly sophisticated linguistically based semantic module which is used to build up the Discourse Model. Semantic processing is strongly modularized and distributed amongst a number of different submodules which take care of Spatio-Temporal Reasoning, Discourse Level Anaphora Resolution. Evaluation taps information from the Discourse Model and uses Predicate Argument Structures (PAS) to detect students’ understanding of the text to summarize. It also uses the output of the Anaphora Resolution Module to check for most relevant topics in the text which the student should have addressed in his/her summary.

40|$|Traditionally high {{strain rate}} {{material}} characterisations {{have been conducted}} using strain <b>gauges</b> and/or cross <b>head</b> displacements in servo-hydraulic test machines, and force transducers in split Hopkinson bar experiments. Non-contact full-field techniques for experimental stress/strain analysis have been available {{for many years and}} used extensively for structural analysis under static or quasi static loading. These techniques have the advantage that they are non-contact and high resolution, so damage initiation can be captured within the field of view and the material behaviour is not modified by the sensor. In the paper, one such technique known as Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is used to assess the material behaviour by using high-speed digital cameras to capture images from material subject to high strain rate events. The high strain rate loading is achieved using an Instron VHS high speed tensile test machine that allows the applied strain rates to vary from 12. 5 s– 1 to 125 s– 1. Although the strain rates that can be achieved are low in comparison to those achieved with the Hopkinson bar, the test machine provides better optical access and opportunities for illumination of the specimen necessary for the DIC.

40|$|A {{numerical}} modelling analysis of climate change’s precipitation {{effects on the}} long-term, averaged surface and subsurface hydrology of the Grand River Watershed (GRW) was undertaken {{in order to assess}} possible areas of concern for decision makers in the water management sector. The physically-based, fully-integrated and variably-saturated 3 -D surface-subsurface numerical simulator, HydroGeoSphere, was used to drive five mid- 21 st century climate change scenarios, developed from multiple general circulation models. Calibration involved altering measured and literature-derived hydraulic conductivity and precipitation distribution estimates, resulting in very good matching between observed and simulated long-term average surface flow at all <b>gauge</b> stations. Subsurface <b>head</b> results, too, matched observed heads quite well, though groundwater linkage to neighbouring watersheds was not included. When groundwater linkage to neighbouring watersheds was allowed, via regional Dirichlet boundary conditions used in a parent study, groundwater throughput was deemed to be unrealistic. All but one of the climate change scenarios caused an increase in both river discharge and water table elevation, with the greatest climate perturbations causing the greatest increases. For Scenario 1 (5 % less precipitation than the 1960 -to- 1999 average), percentage discharge changes averaged - 15 % over all gauge stations. For the other scenarios (more precipitation than average), the inter-scenario discharge response ranged from approximately + 12 % to + 59 %. In general the range of inter-subcatchment response was greater than was the range for intra-subcatchment response; the greatest percentage response was consistently in the Speed River subcatchment, while the least was consistently in the Nith and Conestogo subcatchments. The exception was the application of less-than-average precipitation to the Grand River, whose gauge stations reported percentage changes in discharge that varied more substantially from one another. Subsurface hydrology reacted to the climate change scenarios in much the same manner as did the surface hydrology, with all climate change scenarios associated with a precipitation increase unsurprisingly resulting in higher total hydraulic heads throughout the entire domain. Specifically, the minimum and maximum mean head increases among the climate change scenarios were 0. 41 m and 1. 25 m respectively, while the only decrease was an average of 0. 55 m. Similarly, the depth from the ground surface to the water table decreased in most scenarios, the maximum water table rise being 1. 08 m and the minimum 0. 36 m. When precipitation was allowed to decrease by 5 % relative to the long-term average, the average water table elevation decreased by 0. 48 m. However the water table’s pattern of high and low points remained very much the same among all climate change scenarios, suggesting that basin-wide groundwater flow patterns may not be among the hydrological measures most sensitive to climate change. Groundwater recharge, like almost all other components of the water budget, changed in linear proportion to the climate forcing and in agreement with GRW recharge estimates developed by others. Evapotranspiration, which met potential evapotranspiration in all scenarios due to the constant application of precipitation, was the only element of the water budget that did not increase, even though the water table was elevated closer to the rooting zone by most of the climate scenarios. On a smaller scale, changes in flow patterns may well be expected, given that zones of infiltration were observed to intensify with most of the climate forcing...|$|R
