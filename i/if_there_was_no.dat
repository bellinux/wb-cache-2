He agreed, but only <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> disrespect. Vartanil went along with them, and (much to Mohandar's annoyance) so did Dahl. Mohandar pointed out the protoss were still evaluating her, a terran female.|$|E
5|$|Once a vote occurred, and {{a measure}} passed, {{he could do}} nothing, since his promise to {{physically}} interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> veto, and the matter was of minor importance, it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E
5|$|John Adams {{was running}} {{this time with}} Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina (the elder brother of {{candidate}} Thomas Pinckney from the 1796 election). Hamilton now toured New England, again urging northern electors to hold firm for Pinckney in the renewed hope of making Pinckney president; and he again intrigued in South Carolina. Hamilton's ideas involved coaxing middle-state Federalists to assert their non-support for Adams <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> support for Pinckney and writing to more of the modest supports of Adams concerning his supposed misconduct while president. Hamilton expected to see southern states such as the Carolinas cast their votes for Pinckney and Jefferson, and {{would result in the}} former being ahead of both Adams and Jefferson.|$|E

5|$|Mining ceased in Ny-Ålesund in 1929; it {{was taken}} up again in 1941, {{but because of the}} Second World War the town was {{evacuated}} the following year. From 1946, the Royal Norwegian Air Force started serving Ny-Ålesund with their Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft. The aircraft were able to land <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> ice on the fjord and lighting and weather permitted it. The first flight took place on 10 May and consisted of post drops. No further flights were carried out until 1949; one of the flights that year was an air ambulance operation. The service also dropped post at the other Norwegian settlements in Svalbard. In 1961, the Catalinas were replaced with Grumman HU-16B Albatross aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|The {{key role}} women have in farming is to {{maintain}} ownership of the main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, and <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women do more agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more populated areas, men do more work than women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This type of work supplements agricultural income.|$|E

5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E
5|$|Plato, in his Laws, {{set forth}} rules that governed not the ideal state, which he {{described}} in The Republic, but what he felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian practice, with {{the daughter of a}} man who died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave rules governing who the husband of the epikleros might be, and said that the inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but to a pair, one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry and provide an heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.|$|E
