50|$|In mid-December 1868, {{three former}} slaves named Green Evans, Pryer Evans, {{and the third}} known only as <b>Ned,</b> <b>rode</b> through Evergreen, {{intending}} evidently to visit friends further south. Longley, accompanied {{by a couple of}} friends, forced the three men at gunpoint into a dry creek bed. Green Evans panicked and spurred his horse to escape. Longley shot at him several times, killing him.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2007, Hollendorfer won his 5,000th race. His 6,000th win came on September 3, 2011 at Golden Gate Fields.

[...] "I've been blessed {{to have been in}} this {{business}} as long as I have," [...] said Hollendorfer. [...] "It's a lot of work, and nobody can do it by themselves. You have to have excellent help, excellent owners and excellent horses." ...|$|R
60|$|Much disquieted by the news, <b>Ned</b> <b>rode</b> on {{rapidly and}} entered the town by the gate upon the {{southern}} side; for, as he approached, {{he learned that the}} Spaniards had already appeared in great force before the city. He rode at once to his aunt's house, hoping to find that she had already left the town with the girls. Leaping from his horse he entered the door hurriedly, and was dismayed to find his aunt seated before the fire knitting.|$|R
60|$|He drew {{a pistol}} and fired. Ned was equally quick, {{and the two}} shots rang out together. Ned's cap flew from his head, the bullet just grazing his skin, while Genet fell forward on his saddle and rolled to the ground, shot through the heart. Almost {{at the same instant}} two guns were {{discharged}} from the wood, and two of the officials fell. The other two, behind whom the prisoners were strapped, set spurs to their horses; but <b>Ned</b> <b>rode</b> in front of them, and the men dashing from the trees seized the reins.|$|R
50|$|Another {{difficulty}} to the club's {{operation was}} dealt by {{the creation of}} the County Borough of Teesside in 1968, the new boundaries of which extended into parts of the old North Riding of Yorkshire, including Kirklevington village. The immediate impact to patrons was that the very popular Sunday night, which had previously been licensed for alcohol sales until 12:00 midnight by the <b>N.</b> <b>Riding</b> licensing authority, was now reduced to 10:30pm by the new Teesside Licensing Dept. After this time, only 'soft-drinks' could be purchased until the club closed at midnight.|$|R
50|$|Longley and {{his friends}} went through the dead man's pockets, as Pryer Evans and <b>Ned</b> <b>rode</b> away. Although given sole {{responsibility}} for the murder, Longley later claimed {{that he was not}} the only one shooting. Longley's account of this murder differs from that of his later killings, where he was more inclined to brag about shooting men than to try to divert blame to others. Some versions of Green's killing claim he was a member of the Texas State Police; the TSP only existed from 1870 to 1873.|$|R

50|$|Prior to COTA, the {{bus service}} in the area was managed by the Columbus Transit Company (CTC). In 1971 the CTC {{was in the midst}} of budget problems, so in order to {{maintain}} bus {{service in the}} area, the local governments of central Ohio created COTA. COTA acquired the assets from the CTC On January 1, 1974 and began operations the same day. COTA acquired the CTC bus service for $4.8 million. In mid-1974 COTA established its Park <b>N</b> <b>Ride</b> program and sets up the first routes at area shopping centers. At that time, cash fares were 50 cents.|$|R

60|$|<b>Ned</b> <b>rode</b> {{through the}} city of Mechlin without drawing rein. It was but a month since {{that it had been}} the scene of the most horrible butchery, simply because it had opened its gates to the Prince of Orange on his forward march to attempt the relief of Mons. A few of the prince's German mercenaries had been left there as a garrison. These fired a few shots when the Spanish army approached, and then fled in the night, leaving the town to the vengeance of the Spaniards. In the morning a {{procession}} of priests and citizens went out to beg for pardon, but the Spaniards rushed into the town and began a sack and a slaughter that continued for three days.|$|R

5000|$|Chauncey's {{relationship}} with Ned begins to suffer {{as he starts}} resorting to anonymous sexual encounters in parks. He starts turning away from Ned, who is now more open about his own sexuality. Ned asks Chauncey to be monogamous for him, and Chauncey initially agrees. Several weeks later, however, Ned finds Chauncey again at the automat, looking for one-night stands. Chauncey rejects Ned, telling him he has lost interest in him, and that he prefers [...] "to be used and discarded." [...] Ned, sensing the imminent shutdown of burlesque, tells Chauncey he has taken {{a job as an}} ensemble member in a touring show and asks Chauncey to join him as a last try at a monogamous relationship. Chauncey insists the crackdown on burlesque is temporary, and that he will stay where he is. Confessing his self-hatred, he rejects the offer of a monogamous relationship, telling Ned, [...] "This is not what I should be having." [...] He <b>kisses</b> <b>Ned</b> goodbye, but is (ironically) seen by a policeman who arrests him for deviant behavior in public after Ned has left.|$|R

50|$|Janae starts {{working for}} Rex Colt (David Serafin), {{who tries to}} sexually assault her. Janae hits Rex to protect herself, when she escapes {{she is the one}} charged with assault. Janae discovers that Ned is {{responsible}} for ruining Dylan's relationship with Elle. Janae and Janelle blackmail Ned into becoming their slave. Janae eventually forgives Ned and he soon becomes her boxing coach. Ned's brother Steve Parker (Steve Bastoni) and his family arrive in Erinsborough. After Ned reveals his feelings for her, the two get together. Ned found out that he has a son with previous girlfriend Kirsten. Mickey, is left by Kirsten in Ned's care and Janae decide to help him to look after the child. Ned then moves in with her and so did Mickey. Kirsten returns on a more permanent basis and clashes with Janae, after Kirsten reveals that she still has feelings for Ned. At the Oakey reunion, Kirsten <b>kisses</b> <b>Ned</b> who rejects her. This causes Janae's insecurities to grow. After an argument about the Timmins' house, Janae kisses Darren. Kirsten witnesses the kiss through a window and begins blackmailing Janae. Janae eventually tells Ned, though he forgives her and they attempt to solve their problems. Janae decides it would be for the best if she were to leave and reveals that she is moving to Cairns. Ned follows Janae to the airport where they say good-bye to one another.|$|R
6000|$|Even the ultra Catholic Jean Richardot, {{member of}} the Grand Council, in {{reporting}} upon the events, ended his narration by saying [...] "He could say no more, for his hair stood on end, not only at recounting, but even at remembering the scene." [...] The survivors of the sack were moving listlessly about {{the streets of the}} ruined city as <b>Ned</b> <b>rode</b> through. Great numbers had died of hunger after the conclusion of the pillage; for no food was to be obtained, and none dare leave their houses until the Spanish and German troops had departed. Zutphen had suffered a vengeance even more terrible than that of Mechlin. Alva had ordered his son Frederick, who commanded the army that marched against it, to leave not a single man alive in the city, and to burn every house to the ground; and the orders were literally obeyed. The garrison were first put to the sword, and then the citizens were attacked and slaughtered wholesale. Some were stripped naked and turned out to freeze to death in the fields. Five hundred were tied back to back and drowned in the river. Some were hung up by their feet, and suffered for many hours until death came to their relief.|$|R
5000|$|Ned, Cookie, and Moze attend [...] "Seth's Basement Bash". Ned goes to Seth's {{party with}} Missy because {{she asked him}} so many times he had no choice. (The last {{instance}} mentioned is actually Missy's henchmen holding him against lockers). Moze went with Faymen and kisses him yet again but it still has no sparks. Cookie can't get in the party because he got banned from Seth's house. This is because at Seth's last party he accidentally started a fire in Seth's house dancing to a particular very fast song that makes him lose control. After seeing a group of pretty girls get in even though they weren't invited, Cookie then dresses as Symone (pronounced See-MOAN) from the short [...] "Girls". He gets in. Ned sees Suzie at the party. He misses her and {{wants to talk to}} her very much but Missy can't see Ned with Suzie and Suzie can't see Ned with Missy. Ned fakes being trapped in a closet, so Missy gets help. Moze takes Cookie's magnetized bottle and his magnetic paper clip for spin the bottle game. She realizes that the only time she felt [...] "sparks" [...] when kissed was when she and <b>Ned</b> <b>kissed</b> (sort of an accident) in [...] "Double Dating & The Last Day". This bothers her so she tries to <b>kiss</b> <b>Ned</b> again and compare it to her kiss(es) with Faymen. But every time she pulls Ned next to her, he leaves too early and Coconut Head comes. She is forced to kiss Coconut Head. The next time she tries to bring Ned, Faymen's dog appears instead. Cookie sees Lisa with Seth and tries to break them up. Missy breaks down the door to the closet, finding out he isn't in there. She gets banned from the house. Ned then tells Suzie and Missy the truth and everything is back to normal, but then Suzie has to leave. Faymen comes to sit down, much to Moze's frustration. The particular very fast song comes on and Cookie dances like crazy. His wig falls onto the stove, starting a fire. The music stops and everyone is silent, recognizing Cookie and staring at him in shock. Cookie flees, knocking Ned into the seat the magnetic paper clip is in front of. The bottle spins due to the impact and it points to the paper clip (and Ned). Moze and <b>Ned</b> <b>kiss,</b> and there are not only sparks but fireworks. After they kiss, everyone in the party is evacuating because of the fire (it's quite small but they take no notice). They are bewildered and Moze asks, in shock, [...] "Is it me or is it hot in here?" [...] (a clever pun, due to the fire that is around them). Ned, equally in shock, with a trembling voice, responds [...] "Maybe?" [...] The episode ends with Moze and Ned staring horrified at each other, with everyone else screaming and leaving the party up the stairs.|$|R
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: In the equestrian world {{it is assumed}} that riders use changes in weight distribution and leg forces as important instruments to give horses directions about speed and direction of movement. However, the changes of these forces have never been quantified. Objectives: To investigate the distribution of normal forces (perpendicular to surface) underneath the saddle and of normal forces exerted by the rider's legs during lateral movements. Materials and methods: Eleven riders performed 3 different exercises: riding straight ahead, shoulder-in and travers at trot. Three saddle force systems were used simultaneously. The magnitudes of the forces were summed for the total area, the inside and the outside half of the saddle and inside and outside leg. Mean and maximum summed forces were analysed statistically. Results: The saddle forces showed a rhythmic pattern but leg forces were more irregular. Mean total saddle force was lower (P = 0. 006) when riding straight ahead (671 ± 143 <b>N)</b> than when <b>riding</b> shoulder-in (707 ± 150 N) or travers (726 ± 165 N). Mean inside saddle force was higher (P = 0. 003) when riding travers (468 ± 151 <b>N)</b> than when <b>riding</b> straight on (425 ± 121 N) or shoulder-in (413 ± 136 N). Maximum outside leg force was higher (P = 0. 013) when riding travers (47. 2 ± 33. 9 <b>N)</b> than when <b>riding</b> straight on (31. 6 ± 24. 1 N) or shoulder-in (34. 2 ± 27. 3 N). Conclusion: The study helps to give a biomechanical background to well established but intuitive horse riding techniques...|$|R

50|$|In four dimensions, it {{was known}} for some time that the answer is either 24 or 25. It is easy to produce a packing of 24 spheres around a central sphere (one can place the spheres at the {{vertices}} of a suitably scaled 24-cell centered at the origin). As in the three-dimensional case, {{there is a lot of}} space left over—even more, in fact, than for n = 3—so the situation was even less clear. In 2003, Oleg Musin proved the <b>kissing</b> number for <b>n</b> = 4 to be 24, using a subtle trick.|$|R
