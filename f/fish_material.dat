50|$|If fish {{hydrolysate}} is heated, the oils and certain proteins {{can be more}} easily removed to be sold in purified forms. The complex protein, carbohydrate and fats in the <b>fish</b> <b>material</b> are denatured, which means they are broken down into less complex foods. Overheating can result in destruction of the material as a food to grow beneficial organisms. Once the oils are removed and proteins denatured and simplified by the heating process, this material is called a fish emulsion. The hydrolysate process has substantially lower capital and production costs compared to fish emulsion production.|$|E

30|$|Alkali {{hydrolysis}} is held at less elevated temperatures (typically 27 – 54  °C) in {{the presence}} of such alkaline agents as calcium, sodium or potassium hydroxide during several hours until the desired degree of hydrolysis is reached (Pasupuleti and Braun 2010). The use of alkali reactants, mainly sodium hydroxide, generally results in reduced functionality and nutritive value of final FPH. Moreover, a range of substances, which are not absorbed or even toxic for human organism, can be created during alkali hydrolysis (Kinsella and Melachouris 1976; Kristinsson and Rasco 2000; Lahl and Braun 1994; Linder et al. 1995). A number of amino acids as serine and threonine are destroyed during alkaline hydrolysis; however, tryptophan remains intact contrary to the acid hydrolysis (Pasupuleti and Braun 2010). Despite described drawbacks, limited alkali hydrolysis is used in the fish processing industry to recover a range of proteins from <b>fish</b> <b>material</b> and fish protein concentrates in order to hydrolyze a valuable protein fraction and, thus, improve the functionality (Kristinsson and Rasco 2000; Sikorski and Naczk 1981; Tannenbaum et al. 1970 a, b).|$|E

Modification in value of these indicators points out some metabolic perturbations in fish body. Fish have an immunitary system whose complexity and efficiency are directly proportional to their evolution level. That is why, in comparison to the superior vertebrates, the immune reactions of fish body to an antigenic attack are lower, the immune response is weaker and slower, and the quantity of antibodies to form is low. Under the influence of a specific antigen, the immunoformating cells synthetize the corresponding antibodies, determining occurrence of a specific antigen-antibody reaction, resulting in occurrence of the Ag-Ac immune complexes having a role in annihilating and destroying the respective antigens. Formation of immune complexes (CI) is a normal physiological process within the humoral immunity of bodies, representing one of the methods to remove from the body the substances identified as non-self...|$|E
