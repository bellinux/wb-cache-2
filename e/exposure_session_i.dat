40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the (mis) match model of Rachman and {{co-workers}} during real life exposure therapy in panic disorder patients with agoraphobic avoidance. The results showed that although the patients tended to overpredict their expected fear before the <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions,</b> their predictions did not show a tendency to become more accurate in the course of treatment. After an overprediction predicted fear tended to decrease and self-efficacy tended to increase; after a correct match both predicted fear and self-efficacy remained unchanged. Patients reports of fear tended to decrease within and across <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> regardless of the occurrence of correct or incorrect matches. Patients reported significantly more positive self-statements in underprediction sessions compared to overprediction and correct match sessions. Positive self-statements increased both in underprediction and correct match sessions, but decreased in overprediction sessions. The largest reduction in negative self-statement within an <b>exposure</b> <b>session</b> was found in correct match sessions. The theoretical and clinical relevance of the results are discussed in line of the match/mismatch model of Rachman and co-workers...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary animal {{research}} suggests that yohimbine hydrochloride, a selective competitive alpha 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist, accelerates fear extinction and converts ineffective extinction regimens (long intertrial intervals) to effective ones. This randomized placebo controlled study examined the potential exposure enhancing effect of yohimbine hydrochloride in claustrophobic humans. Participants (71 % undergraduate students and 29 % community volunteers) displaying marked claustrophobic fear (n = 24) were treated with 2 1 -h in vivo <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions.</b> Participants were randomly allocated to take 10. 8 mg yohimbine hydrochloride (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12) prior to each <b>exposure</b> <b>session.</b> Outcome measures included peak fear during a behavioral avoidance task, the Claustrophobia Questionnaire, and the Claustrophobic Concerns Questionnaire. Results showed that both conditions improved significantly at post-treatment with {{no significant difference between}} groups. Consistent with prediction the group that took yohimbine hydrochloride prior to <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> showed significantly greater improvement in peak fear at the one-week follow-up behavioral assessment (d = 1. 68). This was also true across other outcome measures with large to very large effect sizes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} psychological mechanisms associated with prolonged and repeated body image exposure. METHOD: In an experimental design, 30 female volunteers diagnosed with binge-eating disorder (BED) (DSM-IV) and 30 non-eating-disordered controls (NC) were exposed to their physical appearance in a mirror. The confrontation procedure was guided by a standardized interview manual and took place on two separate days. Self-reported mood, appearance self-esteem, and frequency of negative cognitions were assessed repeatedly throughout the experiment. RESULTS: During body image <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions,</b> binge-eating-disordered individuals showed significantly lower mood than controls while appearance self-esteem was diminished in both groups. During the second body image <b>exposure</b> <b>session,</b> higher levels of mood and appearance self-esteem were observed in both groups, and negative cognitions occurred less frequently. CONCLUSION: Results are discussed with regard to the therapeutic use of body image exposure...|$|R

40|$|Hyperacusis is a {{condition}} in which sufferers experience everyday sounds in their surroundings as unmanageable and disturbing. The condition is often associated with symptoms such fatigue, headaches, sleep disturbances and difficulties concentrating. Present study aimed to investigate how people are affected when exposed to noise over time. This was operationalized by collecting data from essentially three domains; subjective, physiological and cognitive. Since hyperacusis is largely defined by the individuals’ subjective experience, participants were divided into three groups based on their own subjective reports of discomfort during an exposure to white noise (60 db). Cognitive performance was assessed using two well established measurements in {{the beginning and the end}} of the <b>exposure</b> <b>session.</b> Contrary to expectations, the groups did not differ significantly in cognitive performance. Heart rate variability was measured during the <b>exposure</b> <b>session</b> and was hypothesized to be lower in participants experiencing higher discomfort.

40|$|Purpose/Background: D-cycloserine (DCS) is {{a partial}} N-methyl-Daspartate {{receptor}} agonist that potentially augments response to exposure therapy in anxiety disorders by enhancing extinction learning. This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled augmentation trial examined (1) {{the effectiveness of}} adding 125 mg of DCS to exposure therapy (before or directly after the first 6 treatment sessions) in patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia and (2) the effectiveness of DCS augmentation preceding exposure relative to DCS augmentation directly postexposure. Methods/Procedures: Fifty-seven patients were allocated to 1 of 3 medication conditions (placebo and pre-exposure and postexposure DCS) as an addition to 6 <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> within a 12 -session exposure and response prevention protocol. The primary outcome measure was the mean score on the "alone" subscale of the Mobility Inventory (MI). Findings/Results: No {{differences were found in}} treatment outcome between DCS and placebo, administered either pre-exposure or postexposure therapy, although at 3 -month follow-up, the DCS postexposure group compared with DCS pre-exposure, exhibited greater symptom reduction on the MI-alone subscale. Ancillary analyses in specific subgroups (responders vs nonresponders, early vs late responders, severely vs mildly affected patients) did not reveal any between-group DCS versus placebo differences. Finally, the study did not find an effect of DCS relative to placebo to be specific for successful <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions.</b> Implications/Conclusions: This study does not find an effect of augmentation with DCS in patients with severe panic disorder and agoraphobia administered either pretreatment or directly posttreatment sessions. Moreover, no preferential effects are revealed in specific subgroups nor in successful <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions.</b> Yet, a small effect of DCS administration postexposure therapy cannot be ruled out, given the relatively small sample size of this stud...|$|R

The use of human exposure chambers permits safe mechanistic {{studies of the}} effect of inhalation or dermal deposition of such particles. The performance of a dynamic and continuous whole-body human exposure chamber using turbulent air mixing during exposure to these organic aerosols of humans and of a new heated mannequin was evaluated. Variability of temporal and spatial distribution of the airborne particle concentration, and aerodynamic aerosol size distribution of the inhalable fraction, were evaluated. The temporal and spatial distribution of these aerosols close to the breathing zone during an <b>exposure</b> <b>session</b> was typically < 10 %, which is low for airborne particles of this size. In a larger section around a human, only slightly higher spatial variation was found. Variability between <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> was also low (< 10 %). Only limited effect of relative humidity for the organic aerosols was observed. The aerodynamic particle size distribution curves differed slightly, but some were comparable to those in occupational envi-ronments.

40|$|Work {{over the}} last 20 years has {{provided}} evidence that syntactic comprehension is affected by comprehenders’ language experience: Structures that are more expected in their context are processed faster [1 - 2]. Comprehenders achieve this by integrating information from multiple cues [1, 3]. Recent work further suggests that how these cues are combined into syntactic expectations can change due to recent experience [2, 4 - 6]. However, there are so far no models of how comprehenders adapt {{to changes in the}} informativity of the cues that explain the observed ability to adapt syntactic expectations. Here we develop a Bayesian belief-updating model which captures the qualitative behavioral effects found in a recent study on cue-combination and syntactic adaptation [6]. Via a Dirichlet-multinomial model, this model formalizes the following related claims: that comprehenders (a) track the co-occurrence of syntactic structures— here, sentence complement (SC) or direct object (DO) continuations, as in (1) —and cues providing information about the probability of those structures (here, the verbs and the complementizer that), and (b) use these continuously updated estimates to generate expectations about upcoming syntactic structures. In a between-subjects, multi-visit self-paced reading experiment (pre-test <b>session,</b> three <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> over 6 days, post-test session 2 days after last <b>exposure</b> <b>session,</b> cf.
