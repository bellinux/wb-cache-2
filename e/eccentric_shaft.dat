25|$|In engines {{having more}} than two rotors, or two rotor race engines {{intended}} for high-rpm use, a multi-piece <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> may be used, allowing additional bearings between rotors. While this approach does increase {{the complexity of the}} <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> design, it has been used successfully in the Mazda's production three-rotor 20B-REW engine, as well as many low volume production race engines. The C-111-2 4 Rotor Mercedes-Benz <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> for the KE Serie 70, Typ DB M950 KE409 is made in one piece. Mercedes-Benz used split bearings.|$|E
25|$|Single {{cylinder}} hydraulic cone crusher is mainly composed of main frame, transmission device, <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft,</b> bowl-shaped bearing, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, dust-proof ring, feed plate, etc.|$|E
25|$|Multi-cylinder {{hydraulic}} {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of main frame, <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft,</b> crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> to make periodic swing movement under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches {{and leaves the}} surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotor housing}} {{was made of}} sand-cast {{aluminum}} plated with chrome, while the aluminum sides were sprayed with molten carbon steel for strength. Cast iron {{was used for the}} rotors themselves, and their <b>eccentric</b> <b>shafts</b> were of expensive chrome-molybdenum steel. The addition of aluminum/carbon apex seals addressed the chatter mark problem.|$|R
50|$|Even so, at 50 °C the {{fuel-air}} mixture {{was still}} hotter than ideal, and the engine's volumetric efficiency remained somewhat impaired The <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft's</b> main bearings and the inlet manifolds were fed by oil-injection lubrication, and the fuel-air mix also carried residual mist {{of oil from}} {{the interior of the}} rotors, which helped to lubricate the rotor tips.|$|R
50|$|The {{stroke of}} each piston {{is caused by}} an <b>eccentric</b> drive <b>shaft</b> or an {{external}} eccentric tappet (e.g., stroke ring).|$|R
25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|E
25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft.</b> A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E
25|$|In {{the single}} toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on the <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> {{which leads to}} a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.|$|E
50|$|The Hewland AE75 {{was never}} fitted to any {{aircraft}} {{apart from the}} ARV Super2, and when ARV production ceased, Hewland stopped AE75 production also. The rights to the AE75 were bought by MidWest, who were developing their AE100 twin-rotor Wankel aero-engine. MidWest had intended to restart production of the AE75 near Stroud, Gloucestershire, but this never materialised. MidWest based the AE100’s gearbox on the AE75’s PSRU, amending {{it so that the}} propeller axis was above the <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft's</b> axis. This increased propeller clearance, but also raised the ARV's thrust line.|$|R
50|$|The guided-rotor {{compressor}} (GRC) is a positive-displacement rotary gas compressor. The compression {{volume is}} defined by the trochoidally rotating rotor mounted on an <b>eccentric</b> drive <b>shaft</b> with a typical 80 to 85% adiabatic efficiency.|$|R
50|$|In {{piston engine}} engineering, a balance <b>shaft</b> is an <b>eccentric</b> {{weighted}} <b>shaft</b> that offsets vibrations in engine designs {{that are not}} inherently balanced. They were first invented and patented by British engineer Frederick W. Lanchester in 1904.|$|R
2500|$|The {{central drive}} shaft, called the [...] "eccentric shaft" [...] or [...] "E-shaft", {{passes through the}} center of the rotor and is {{supported}} by fixed bearings. The rotors ride on eccentrics (analogous to crankpins) integral to the <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> (analogous to a crankshaft). The rotors both rotate around the eccentrics and make orbital revolutions around the <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft.</b> Seals at the corners of the rotor seal against the periphery of the housing, dividing it into three moving combustion chambers. The rotation of each rotor on its own axis is caused and controlled by a pair of synchronizing gears A fixed gear mounted on one side of the rotor housing engages a ring gear attached to the rotor and ensures the rotor moves exactly 1/3 turn for each turn of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft.</b> The power output of the engine is not transmitted through the synchronizing gears. The force of gas pressure on the rotor (to a first approximation) goes directly to the center of the eccentric part of the output shaft...|$|E
2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively low torque, propeller driven aircraft must use a propeller speed reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox. [...] The rotational shaft speed of a Wankel engine is high compared to reciprocating piston designs. Only the <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> spins fast, while the rotors turn at exactly one-third of the shaft speed. If the shaft is spinning at 7,500 rpm, the rotors are turning at a much slower 2,500 rpm.|$|E
2500|$|Compression-ignition engine {{research}} is being undertaken by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, which {{was commissioned by}} DARPA to develop a compression-ignition Wankel engine {{for use in a}} prototype VTOL flying car called the [...] "Transformer". The engine, based on an earlier concept involving an unmanned aerial vehicle called [...] "Endurocore", powered by a Wankel diesel. plans to utilize Wankel rotors of varying sizes on a shared <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft</b> to increase efficiency. The engine is claimed to be a 'full-compression, full-expansion, compression-ignition-cycle engine'. An October 28, 2010 patent by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, describes a Wankel engine superficially similar to Rolls-Royce's earlier prototype, that required an external air compressor to achieve high enough compression for compression-ignition-cycle combustion. The design differs from Rolls-Royce's compression-ignition rotary, mainly by proposing an injector both in the exhaust passage between the combustor rotor and expansion rotor stages, and an injector in the expansion rotor's expansion chamber, for 'afterburning'.|$|E
25|$|Wankel engines {{generally}} {{are able to}} reach much higher engine revolutions than reciprocating engines of similar power output. This {{is due to the}} smoothness inherent in circular motion, and the absence of highly stressed parts such as crankshafts, camshafts or connecting rods. <b>Eccentric</b> <b>shafts</b> do not have the stress related contours of crankshafts. The maximum revolutions of a rotary engine is limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears. Hardened steel gears are used for extended operation above 7000 or 8000rpm. Mazda Wankel engines in auto racing are operated above 10,000rpm. In aircraft they are used conservatively, up to 6500 or 7500rpm. However, as gas pressure participates in seal efficiency, racing a Wankel engine at high rpm under no load conditions can destroy the engine.|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} of manufacturing processes to assure product quality {{and reduce the}} amount of raw material and energy is the main objective of many recent researches. Some of them study cross wedge rolling (CWR) as a substitute to hot upsetting in the manufacture of stepped <b>shafts,</b> pins, <b>eccentric</b> <b>shafts</b> and many other mechanical parts. In this process a cylinder is deformed by two wedge tools assembled on plane plates that move tangentially one against the other. The main objective of this work is to study the thermomechanical behaviour of medium carbon steel during hot CWR by means of a numerical analysis. The numerical results will be compared to the microstructure of microalloyed steel samples which were submitted to CWR experimental tests. The results suggested that dynamic recrystallization was present during CWR and that microstructures in the austenitic region were very refined...|$|R
50|$|Wankel engines run very hot, so Garside {{gave this}} {{air-cooled}} motor additional interior air-cooling. Air was drawn through a forward-facing filter situated {{to provide a}} ram air effect. This air passed through {{the interior of the}} rotors and then into a large pressed-steel plenum before entering the combustion chambers via twin carburettors. The plenum (which doubled as the bike's semi-monocoque frame) enabled the transfer of much of the heat to the surrounding atmosphere. The carburation process further reduced temperatures via the heat of evaporation. Even so, at 50 °C the fuel-air mixture was still hotter than ideal, and the engine's volumetric efficiency remained somewhat impaired The <b>eccentric</b> <b>shaft's</b> main bearings and the inlet manifolds were fed by oil-injection lubrication, and the fuel-air mix also carried residual mist of oil from the interior of the rotors, which helped to lubricate the rotor tips.|$|R

5000|$|Nissan {{introduced}} its Variable Valve Event and Lift (VVEL) in 2007 as the world's second CVVL system. The first application {{was on the}} VQ37VHR V6 engine of Skyline Coupe (Infiniti G37). Nissan's system is more compact than BMW’s, involving fewer parts and less energy loss, and is therefore more adaptable to high-performance engines. [...] The VVEL does not use a conventional intake camshaft. Each valve is actuated by a cam which is pivoted on - but not fixed to - the camshaft. While conventional camshafts feature fixed rotating lobes, the cam in VVEL swings up and down; {{this is why it}} does not need a symmetric profile. Its movement is driven by the camshaft via a series of components. VVEL varies valve lift by the <b>eccentric</b> control <b>shaft</b> inside the rocker arm. By rotating the <b>eccentric</b> control <b>shaft,</b> the position of rocker arm is shifted, changing the swing angle of cam. The swing angle of cam determines the degree of valve lift.|$|R
50|$|The {{central shaft}} was rotated by {{synchronous}} motor, driving an eccentric with a throw of about 2mm. (0.077 inch) Push-rods from this operated the contacts.

50|$|Since carbide {{saw blades}} are circular, they are {{radially}} the stiffest {{elements of the}} power train {{in the direction of}} the feed, but very unstable perpendicular to the feed direction. Due to the thin blade body the blades must be stabilized to minimize the side vibration amplitudes. When the first experiments with carbide saws were made, a development engineer of Advanced Machine & Engineering in Rockford stabilized the blade by using a broomstick which he pushed against the vibrating blade, minimizing the vibrations. From this experience a blade stabilizer was developed using two plastic coated ball bearings mounted on <b>eccentric</b> <b>shafts</b> and supported by a welded bracket to the gearbox. Horst Doepcke, who saw this method during experiments carried out by Metalcut, also describes them in his dissertation “Sägen von Rohren mit hartmetallbestückten Kreissägeblättern”. Further Amsaw developments lead to segment stabilizers, whereby on both sides of the blade adjustable plastic-coated plates minimized the blade vibrations (AME). Other manufacturers later used similar slide elements as “vibration dampeners”. These erroneously labeled vibration dampeners did not however dampen the oscillations, but merely minimized the amplitudes. Mr. Doepke describes this function in detail in his dissertation.Recently the Advanced Machine & Engineering Company has developed a pair of front stabilizers for its AMSAW machines arranged close to the point at which the blade enters the material. These stabilizers hydraulically extend, when the carbide teeth have moved past the stabilizer tips before cutting and stabilize the blade which also help to guide the blade into the cut to improve the accuracy. Other forms of stabilizers are listed in German in the VDI Verlag Nr. 1999 by Dipl.-Ing. Rainer Liebrecht. This report especially addresses the effect of vibration on saw blades.|$|R

50|$|The engine valvegear was simple, {{compared}} to that of contemporary steam engines. A single rotating overhead camshaft ran above the cylinders, parallel to the crankshaft. <b>Eccentrics</b> on this <b>shaft</b> actuated a transverse slide valve for each cylinder.

5000|$|Abner Doble {{considered}} Stephenson valve gear: [...] "(...) {{the most}} universally suitable valve gear of all, {{for it can}} be worked out for a long engine structure or a short one. It {{can be a very}} simple valve gear and still be very accurate, but its great advantage is that its accuracy is self-contained, for the exact relationship between its points of support (<b>eccentrics</b> on <b>shaft,</b> valve crosshead, and link hanger arm) have but little effect on the motion of the valve. Its use on engines in which all the cylinders lie in one plane, represents, in the belief of the writer, the best choice." [...] Another benefit of the Stephenson gear, intrinsic to the system, is variable lead: usually zero in full gear and increasing as cutoff is shortened. One consequent disadvantage of the Stephenson gear is that it has a tendency to over-compression {{at the end of the}} stroke when very short cut-offs are used, and therefore the minimum cut-off cannot be as low as on a locomotive with Walschaerts gear. Longer eccentric rods and a shorter link reduce this effect.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} the isenthalpic two-phase flow approximation (Brennen, 1995) to the study of cavitation and ventilation effects in plane journal bearings with whirling eccentricity. A quasi-homogeneous bubbly liquid/vapor model, suitably modified to account for thermal effects (Rapposelli and d’Agostino, 2001), is used to describe the occurrence of flow cavitation. An homogeneous liquid/gas/vapor model without thermal effects is used to describe the simultaneous occurrence of cavitation and ventilation. The proposed model treats the fully-wetted and two-phase portions of the fluid in a unified manner {{in order to avoid the}} use of “ad hoc” matching conditions, whose applicability and accuracy is questionable in the presence of significant inertial and/or unsteady effects. A non-linear analysis that accounts for the inertia of the lubricant is used to determine the reaction forces caused by the <b>shaft’s</b> <b>eccentric</b> motion both in the viscosity-dominated regime and at intermediate values of the Reynolds number, where the inertia of the lubricant is no longer negligible. The classical iteration method for the Reynolds lubrication equation (Muster and Sternlicht, 1965; Mori and Mori, 1991; Reinhardt and Lund, 1975) has been extended to the unsteady two-phase flow case in order to account for flow acceleration effects in the presence of cavitation and/or ventilation. Significant deviations from the steady-state case are obtained at moderately high Reynolds numbers (Re = ωRc/νL ≅ 10). Comparisons with the scant experimental data support the validity of the proposed model. Results are shown in a number of representative cases in order to illustrate the influence of the relevant parameters...|$|R
