5|$|On January 28, Khánh {{flew from}} Huế to Saigon dressed in {{civilian}} clothes on a commercial airliner. He covered for his ruse by claiming that he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating {{that he had come}} for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E

5|$|Once {{through this}} door, which swung inward, Booth barricaded it by wedging a stick {{between it and}} the wall. From here a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is {{evidence}} that, <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> Booth had bored a peephole in this second door, though this is not certain.|$|E
5|$|Some, {{including}} most persistently the fascist journalist Giorgio Pisanò, {{have claimed that}} Mussolini and Petacci were shot <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> near the De Maria farmhouse and that the execution at Giulino de Mezzegra was staged with corpses. The first to put this forward was Franco Bandini in 1978.|$|E

5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{began the}} year by {{reaching}} his first semifinal in ATP Adelaide, Australia, where he lost to Chris Guccione, having beaten Igor Kunitsyn <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> He then reached {{the second round of}} the Australian Open, where he had to retire because of injury in his match against eventual finalist Fernando González in the fifth set.

5|$|No. 6 Commando led {{the brigade}} from the beach. Moving through a swamp that briefly slowed their progress, the commandos {{began to come}} up against the German defences {{that had not been}} {{destroyed}} by the naval bombardment. Where possible they attempted an indirect approach, penetrating the defences using infiltration tactics. However, as they advanced towards bridges that had been captured by the paratroopers <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> they assaulted four pillboxes as well as an artillery battery that had been firing on the landing beaches.|$|E
5|$|The Canucks retired Linden's jersey number, 16, from {{circulation}} in a pre-game ceremony December 17, 2008, prior to playing the Edmonton Oilers.

5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
50|$|V. phoeniceum is pollinated by hoverflies and bees {{although}} it is suspected that moths also take part <b>in</b> pollinating <b>the</b> mulleins. The flowers expel a fragrance <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> believed to attract moths and close up midday.|$|R

50|$|As anticipated, the Artuqid horse archers began harassing {{the column}} at dawn. Ilghazi's attacks soon {{increased}} <b>in</b> intensity and <b>the</b> Crusader army was probably {{brought to a}} halt fairly <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> three vanguard squadrons were dispersed and {{the main body of}} Latin infantry came under serious attack. The infantry sturdily defended itself, but, without its normal cavalry support, suffered heavy losses.|$|R
5|$|April {{opened with}} United playing the {{defending}} MLS Cup champions, Colorado Rapids {{at their home}} ground, DSG Park on 2 April. The match was almost postponed due to snow <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> However, the match was still called on, as a smaller crowd of around 9,000 braved the wintry conditions. The match saw Colorado take a first half lead off recently purchased Irish-international Caleb Folan. In the 67th minute of play, the United leveled the score thanks to a strike from Santino Quaranta.The tie was short-lived, as the Rapids immediately struck back with a 68th-minute goal from Scottish-international Jamie Smith.

5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his passport, {{and went back to}} the amphitheatre he had visited <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> in order to find it. Walking around the deserted ruins, he thought the silence and natural ambient sounds present would make a good {{backdrop}} for the music. He also felt that filming the band without an audience would be a good reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter, where the films paid equal attention to performers and spectators. One of Maben's contacts at the University of Naples, a professor who was a Pink Floyd fan, managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming.|$|E
5|$|<b>Earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> {{at about}} 2:30pm, South Vietnamese Colonel Trinh Tieu, Chief of the ARVN 2nd Brigade in II Corps, {{discovered}} that the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division had moved into positions south of Ban Me Thuot from their base in Laos.

By 5pm the North Vietnamese 8th Battalion, 149th Regiment, {{in combination with the}} 198th Special Forces Regiment, tried but failed to capture Hoa Binh airfield, which was defended by one South Vietnamese ranger battalion.|$|E
50|$|The New York Stock Exchange did {{not open}} on September 11 even as CNBC showed futures numbers <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> As Wall Street was covered <b>in</b> debris from <b>the</b> World Trade Center and {{suffered}} infrastructure damage, it remained closed until September 17.|$|R

50|$|For best flavor, flowers {{should be}} fresh and {{harvested}} <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Wilted and faded flowers, and the unopened buds of most species, can be distasteful, often bitter.

5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were put}} in effect for six provinces in southeastern Cuba, where significant precipitation ranging up to 20inches (500mm) across the mountainous south was expected {{as the center of}} Ernesto tracked slowly across Cuba.

A single to center field by Richie Ashburn allowed the speedy Caballero to score from second and completed the doubleheader sweep for Philadelphia—Bubba Church having pitched a three-hit shutout in the first game <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{winning the}} 2010–11 Premier League title <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> meant double pride for Manchester as its teams claimed both of English {{football}}'s blue ribbon competitions. Some football pundits debated whether the joint win – along with City's qualification for the Champions League – would mark {{the start of}} new era similar to the late 1960s when both City and United dominated English football; during that period, both clubs won the league championship once, with United winning the European Cup and City winning the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup within four years. The '35 years' banner that had stood at Old Trafford, home of Manchester United which referenced to Manchester City's long trophy drought, was taken down in recognition of City's victory.|$|E
50|$|This {{portion of}} the phrase {{suggests}} a person should arrive to vote <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Most democratic electoral processes involve polling booths, which are open for a mandated period of time. Voting early would suggest a particular enthusiasm for voting not necessarily shared by other electors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of <b>the</b> Mimouna, {{families}} {{go to the}} sea, splash {{water on}} their face, and walk barefoot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, to replay {{the scene of the}} miraculous crossing of the Reed Sea, which is held to have taken place on <b>the</b> last <b>day</b> of Passover.|$|R
