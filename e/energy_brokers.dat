5000|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>Brokers</b> (also {{referred}} to as energy consultants) are at times confused {{to be thought of}} as the entity that supplies the energy, however, they are typically a middle-man assisting clients in procuring electric or natural gas rates from energy wholesalers/suppliers. Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market. It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day. In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted. An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers. An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers. Under some State Laws they use the term [...] "Suppliers" [...] to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and aggregators, however there are very important differences between them all.|$|E

40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility is {{an issue}} that is working its way into many policy debates and {{corporate}} agendas. The definition of corporate social responsibility has undergone substantial modifications over time and it is still evolving along with society and society’s expectations. There is no globally accepted definition of CSR, nor is there a consensus on a definitive list of the issues it encompasses. It is generally agreed that CSR is neither corporate philanthropy nor strict compliance with the law. However, we can easily identify “events” which doesn’t fit in the CSR framework. The collapse of <b>energy</b> <b>broker</b> Enron Corp. has been described as the biggest business surprise of the past 10 years. It was a surprise which unexpectedly left 20000 employees in a deeply compromised safety of their pension funds. The concept of CSR is underpinned by the idea that corporations can no longer act as isolated economic entities operating in detachment from broader society. Traditional views about competitiveness, survival and profitability are being swept away. The increasingly negative and very pervasive impact of global corporations in all aspects of social life and in the environment has been the catalyst in the emergence of a diversity of stakeholders demanding accountability about the impact of corporate activity in the whole aspects of its influence. corporate social responsibility, irresponsibility, ethical leadership, Enron...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} designing a mechanism that efficiently regulates imbalances on the <b>energy</b> grid. <b>Brokers</b> aggregate supply and demand on the energy market by buying and selling power ahead of time. Mispredictions create discrepancies between supply and demand {{and need to be}} resolved. With the increasing usage of sustainable but often less predictable energy sources it is important that these imbalances are solved efficiently. Brokers can engage in load curtailment to create efficient ways of solving imbalances. In this thesis we design market-based mechanisms that make use of these capabilities. We define the desirable properties that a balancing mechanism should have and present several mechanisms that satisfy these. We also show that if brokers can actively participate themselves in the regulation it is impossible to create an efficient mechanism with all the desired properties as the problem becomes equivalent to a multi-unit double auction. Finally we identify an open problem in auction theory and propose a 2 -item multi-unit auction. AlgoritmicsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

With the increasing spread of renewable power sources, new market strategies are needed to guarantee a more sustainable participation and less dependency of bulk generation. In PowerTAC (Power Trading Agent Competition), different software agents compete in a simulated <b>energy</b> market, impersonating <b>broker</b> companies to create and manage attractive tariffs for customers while aiming to profit. In this paper, we present TugaTAC Broker, a PowerTAC agent that uses a fuzzy logic mechanism to compose tariffs based on its customers portfolio. Fuzzy sets allow adaptive configurations for brokers in different scenarios. To validate and compare the performance of TugaTAC, we have run a local version of the PowerTAC competition. The experiments comprise TugaTAC competing against other simple agents and a more realistic configuration, with instances of the winners of previous editions of the competition. Preliminary results show a promising dynamic: our approach was able to manage imbalances and win the competition in the simple case, but need refinements to compete with more sophisticated market.

The episode damaged Lloyd George's reputation, but also that of Asquith, Walter Long speaking of the latter as; [...] "terribly lacking in decision".

40|$|The Energy Performance Certification in Sweden was {{developed}} {{as a tool to}} achieve the Government's target to reduce Sweden's energy consumption by 20 percent by 2020. The Energy Performance Certificate has previously received some criticism for not fulfilling its purpose.  Questions that formed the basis for this report is how the energy performance certification provides support to buyers of single-family houses and if the energy performance improved in terms of reliability. The report begins with a background description that describes how the energy declaration works and some of the findings of previous evaluations and surveys. A survey to investigate the <b>broker's</b> position to <b>energy</b> performance have been conducted as well as interviews with buyers and sellers of houses. An investigation whether the energy performance can vary between different calculation programs, depending on various assumptions made by the energy declarant, has been made. Brokers and sellers have proved negative attitudes towards <b>energy</b> performance, particularly <b>brokers.</b> Buyers are, for obvious reasons, those who are most positive to the declaration. Energy performance {{has proved to be a}} rather uncertain value that varies with assumptions so that comparability is questionable. Development of energy efficiency policy options have proven to be even more uncertain, in that there are many assumptions made.  In order to get the energy certificate to work better and to support buyers, brokers have to change their attitude and position against the Energy Performance Certification and this must be made more comparable. The number of assumptions in an energy declaration should also be reduced by giving more clear instructions to the energy experts who perform the certifications.

40|$|This is the {{specification}} for the Power Trading Agent Competition for 2012 (Power TAC 2012). Power TAC is {{a competitive}} simulation that models a “liberalized” retail electrical energy market, where competing business entities or “brokers” offer energy services to customers through tariff contracts, and must then serve those customers by trading in a wholesale market. Brokers are challenged {{to maximize their}} profits by buying and selling energy in the wholesale and retail markets, subject to fixed costs and constraints. Costs include fees for publication and withdrawal of tariffs, and distribution fees for transporting energy to their contracted customers. Costs are also incurred whenever there is an imbalance between a <b>broker’s</b> total contracted <b>energy</b> supply and demand within a given time slot. The simulation environment models a wholesale market, a regulated distribution utility, and a population of energy customers, situated in a real location on Earth during a specific period for which weather data is available. The wholesale market is a relatively simple call market, similar to many existing wholesale electric power markets, such as Nord Pool in Scandinavia or FERC markets in North America, but unlike the FERC markets we are modeling a single region, and therefore we do not model location-marginal pricing. Customer models include households {{and a variety of}} commercial and industrial entities, many of which have production capacity (such as solar panels or wind turbines) as well as electric vehicles. All have “real-time” metering to support allocation of their hourly supply and demand to their subscribed brokers, and all are approximate utility maximizers with respect to tariff selection, although the factors making up their utility functions may include aversion to change and complexity that can retard uptake of marginally better tariff offers. The distribution utility models the regulated natural monopoly that owns the regional distribution network, and is responsible for maintenance of its infrastructure and for real-time balancing of supply and demand. The balancing process is a market-based mechanism that uses economic incentives to encourage brokers to achieve balance within their portfolios of tariff subscribers and wholesale market positions, in the face of stochastic customer behaviors and weather-dependent renewable <b>energy</b> sources.

40|$|Energy Union (En Un) is {{a program}} {{released}} by the European Commission intended to create a single energy market between the European Union {{in order to have}} secure, affordable and sustainable energy. This way the imports will be reduced and the final price should be lower (theoretically) increasing the energy security for all the countries. The first communication was in February 2015 and is a very new topic for all the energy stakeholders in the EU. This is why a dissertation for the implications of this policy in UK was developed as part of the Master in Energy, Environmental Technology & Technology from City University London. UK is currently catalogued as an Energy Island (less than 10 % of cross-border interconnection), with 30 % of the generation based in coal, 30 % in gas and 20 % renewable, a liberalised market that varies with changes in gas or wind availability and the third highest kWh price from the EU. More than 20 energy policies and Conservative government with a constraint view against renewables’ subsidies. The implication for the UK and the En Un are divided into three: Infrastructural, Political and Economical. In the middle a map of the new cross-border grids proposed by this policy some of the findings are. The Energy Union in the UK will happen even if there’s no political wiliness or if they decide to not be part of the EU, mainly because the new infrastructure is already being developed (UK-Belgium) additional to the four current cross-border interconnectors. The wholesale market in UK is already liberalized and some cross border trades are being done with clean and cheap electricity from France and Holland; the key development is UK-Ireland, because UK, instead of being a 100 % exporter to Ireland, will flip the coin with an import-export relationship with 8 interconnectors, electricity generated in Euros and close distance. Now it will not really matter if you generate electricity from Fossil Fuels, Nuclear or Renewable; the country will purchase from where is cheapest and available, independently from the source.  Shale Gas, Nuclear, Gas and coal with CCS will be the important investment in the next years, not only in PPP (private public partnership) schemes but with R&D.  New Universities courses will be develop (<b>energy</b> traders / <b>brokers,</b> cross border trade supervisors, etc) and more women should get involved.  The £/ kWh for domestic and small companies will not be significantly reduced (albeit the low cost of it), those companies more engaged with the market will have very good deals and low £/ kWh.
