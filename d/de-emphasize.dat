5|$|From 1947 to 1955, Jim Tatum {{served as}} the {{head coach of the}} Maryland Terrapins {{football}} team, which represented the University of Maryland in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college football. Maryland hired Tatum to replace Clark Shaughnessy after the 1946 season. Tatum had created both success and controversy during his one season as head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners football team. During his nine-year tenure, Tatum {{became one of the most}} successful head football coaches in Maryland history, and the Terrapins compiled two national championships, three conference championships, and five bowl game appearances. His teams compiled a 73–15–4 record without a single losing season, and as of the end of 2016, he has the highest winning percentage of any Maryland football coach who coached at least seven games. In 1954, the University of Maryland appointed a new president, Dr. Wilson Elkins, who chose to <b>de-emphasize</b> football. Following the 1955 season, Tatum took a pay cut to coach at his alma mater, North Carolina, and he died four years later.|$|E

Russia Today has rebranded itself as RT. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.|$|E
25|$|Early, pre-sectarian Buddhism had a {{somewhat}} vague {{position on the}} existence and effect of deities. Indeed, Buddhism is often considered atheistic on account of its denial of a creator god and human responsibility to it. However, nearly all modern Buddhist schools accept the existence of gods of some kind; the main point of divergence is {{on the influence of}} these gods. Of the major schools, Theravada tends to <b>de-emphasize</b> the gods, whereas Mahayana and Vajrayana do not.|$|E

The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent Buddha-nature, which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.|$|E

As such, the 2DS is a handheld console targeted at a different audience than that of the regular Nintendo 3DS models, particularly younger users. Despite concerns from critics who felt that the company was trying to <b>de-emphasize</b> the 3D functionality by releasing the 2DS, Nintendo maintains that 3D is still part of their future plans.|$|E

25|$|Like the Chrysler Building, One Liberty Place has {{a square}} shape with {{recessed}} corners. The facade is also {{inspired by the}} Chrysler Building, using glass and aluminum to invoke the Chrysler Building's horizontal and vertical shapes along the building's core. The facade's color ranges between grays, silver, and metallic blues and uses horizontal bands of granite and glass to <b>de-emphasize</b> the visual impact of {{the height of the}} tower. The building's lobby features white and gray marble imported from Italy. The elevator lobby and the elevator cabs echo the shape of the building's spire while the elevator doors feature abstraction of One Liberty Place itself.|$|E
25|$|By the 1952 season, the {{university}} decided to <b>de-emphasize</b> sports. The new president at Louisville, Dr. Philip Grant Davidson, reduced {{the amount of}} athletic aid, and tightened academic standards for athletes. As a result, 15 returning players could not meet the new standards and lost their scholarships. But Unitas maintained his scholarship by taking on a new elective: square dancing. In 1952 Coach Camp switched the team to two-way football. Unitas not only played safety or linebacker on defense and quarterback on offense but returned kicks and punts on special teams. The Cards won their first game against Wayne State, and then Florida State in the second game. Unitas completed 16 of 21 passes for 198 yards and three touchdowns. It was said that Unitas put on such a show at the Florida State game that he threw a pass under his legs for 15 yards. The {{rest of the season}} was a struggle for the Cards, who finished 3–5. Unitas completed 106 of 198 passes for 1,540 yards and 12 touchdowns in his sophomore year.|$|E
25|$|By March 2011, {{the market}} share of OS X in North America had {{increased}} to slightly over 14%. Whether {{the size of the}} Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to <b>de-emphasize</b> market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published {{in the first quarter of}} 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, with 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.|$|E

Still, {{it is not unusual}} for survival horror games to draw upon elements from first-person shooters, action-adventure games, or even role-playing games.

500|$|After {{breaking}} even {{in each of}} {{his first}} three seasons, Shaughnessy's Chicago teams suffered a losing record each year from 1936 to 1939. Chicago finished the 1939 season with a 2–6 record and were winless in the Big Ten Conference. The Maroons were outscored by their opponents, 308–37, and failed to tally in each loss. These included routs by Michigan, 85–0; Ohio State, 61–0; Illinois, 46–0; , 61–0; and , 47–0. President Hutchins, who hated the sport and said [...] "there is no doubt that football has been a major handicap to education in the United States," [...] successfully pushed to have the program disbanded.

[...] Hutchins hoped the move would set an example for other universities to follow, but this did not occur.|$|E
500|$|Because {{historical}} information about Proba is limited, many scholars {{have taken to}} analyzing Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi so as {{to learn more about}} the poet herself. According to the classicist Bernice Kaczynski, [...] "Scholars have seen traces of Proba's own character in her emphasis on the beauty of the natural world, readily apparent in her account of the creation." [...] The cento suggests that Proba had great regard for [...] "domestic matters, for marriage and the family, for marital devotion and [...] filial piety". While the New Testament stresses asceticism, Proba seems to <b>de-emphasize</b> its importance, given that topics like virginity and poverty are not recurring themes in the poem. In regards to issues of finance, Proba reinterprets a number of New Testament episodes in which Jesus urged his followers to eschew wealth as passages suggesting that Christians should merely share wealth with their families. These changes illustrate Proba's historical context, her socio-economic position and the expectations of her class.|$|E

500|$|In other cases, feminist economists work on {{removing}} gender biases {{from the}} theoretical bases of globalization itself. Suzanne Bergeron, for example, {{focuses on the}} typical theories of globalization as the [...] "rapid integration of the world into one economic space" [...] through the flow of goods, capital, and money, {{in order to show}} how they exclude some women and the disadvantaged. She argues that traditional understandings of globalization over-emphasize the power of global capital flows, the uniformity of globalization experiences across all populations, and technical and abstract economic processes, and therefore depict the political economy of globalization inappropriately. She highlights the alternative views of globalization created by feminists. First, she describes how feminists may <b>de-emphasize</b> the idea of the market as [...] "a natural and unstoppable force," [...] instead depicting the process of globalization as alterable and movable by individual economic actors including women. She also explains that the concept of globalization itself is gender biased, because its depiction as [...] "dominant, unified, [...] intentional" [...] is inherently masculinized and misleading. She suggests that feminists critique such narratives by showing how a [...] "global economy" [...] is highly complex, de-centered and unclear.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Adams {{returned}} to Wildstorm to draw an eight-page flashback sequence in issue #4 of Alan Moore's series, Tom Strong, {{which was published}} under Moore's brand for Wildstorm, America's Best Comics. His subsequent Wildstorm work would include Danger Girl Special #1 (2000) and two issues of The Authority in 2002, significant portions of which Adams was asked by DC Comics to redraw in order to <b>de-emphasize</b> the violence, {{in light of the}} September 11 attacks, much to Adams' frustration. That same year, Adams and writer Steve Moore co-created [...] "Jonni Future", a pastiche of a pulp science fiction series such as Adam Strange and Barbarella, which was published in eight-page installments in the America's Best Comics anthology Tom Strong's Terrific Tales, the first ten issues of which Adams penciled from 2002 to 2004.

500|$|Beginning {{with the}} periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood {{published}} {{a series of}} short articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon magazine, {{the first of which}} was about a monster known as the curst. Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, and assigned Jeff Grubb {{to find out more about}} the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon. According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him [...] "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?"; Greenwood answered [...] "yes" [...] to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD 2nd Edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began working to get the Forgotten Realms officially published. Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee. Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, [...] "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to <b>de-emphasize</b> this meaning".|$|E
