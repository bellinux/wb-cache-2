50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the original}} NMT specification is that voice traffic was not encrypted, therefore {{it was possible to}} listen to calls using e.g. a scanner. As a result, some scanners have had the NMT bands blocked so they could not be accessed. Later versions of the NMT specifications defined optional analog scrambling which was based on two-band audio <b>frequency</b> <b>inversion.</b> If both the base station and the mobile station supported scrambling, they could agree upon using it when initiating a phone call. Also, if two users had mobile (phone) stations supporting scrambling, they could turn it on during conversation even if the base stations didn't support it. In this case, audio would be scrambled all the way between the 2 mobile stations. While the scrambling method was not at all as strong as encryption of current digital phones, such as GSM or CDMA, it did prevent casual listening with scanners. Scrambling is defined in NMT Doc 450-1: System Description (1999-03-23) and NMT Doc 450-3 and 900-3: Technical Specification for the Mobile Station (1995-10-04)'s Annex 26 v.1.1: Mobile Station with Speech Scrambling - Split Inversion Method (Optional) (1998-01-27).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for the inversion of full-waveform ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. It {{is designed to}} tame the non-linearity issue that afflicts inverse scattering problems, especially in high contrast media. We first investigate the limitations of current full-waveform time-domain inversion schemes for GPR data and then introduce a much-improved approach based on a combined frequency-time-domain analysis. We show by means of several synthetic tests and theoretical considerations that local minima trapping (common in full bandwidth time-domain inversion) can be avoided by starting the inversion with only the low frequency content of the data. Resolution associated with the high frequencies can then be achieved by progressively expanding to wider bandwidths as the iterations proceed. Although based on a frequency analysis of the data, the new method is entirely implemented {{by means of a}} time-domain forward solver, thus combining the benefits of both frequency-domain (low <b>frequency</b> <b>inversion</b> conveys stability and avoids convergence to a local minimum; whereas high <b>frequency</b> <b>inversion</b> conveys resolution) and time-domain methods (simplicity of interpretation and recognition of events; ready availability of FDTD simulation tools) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough sound {{has been}} applied to the study of {{sediment}} transport processes for a number of years, it is acknowledged that there are still problems in using the backscattered signal to measure suspended sediment parameters. In particular, when the attenuation due to the suspension becomes significant, the uncertainty associated with the variability in the scattering characteristics of the sediments in suspension can lead to inversion errors which accumulate as the sound propagates through the suspension. To study this attenuation propagation problem, numerical simulations and laboratory experiments have been used to assess the impact unpredictability in the scattering properties of the suspension has on the acoustically derived suspended sediments parameters. The results clearly show the commonly applied iterative implicit inversion can lead to calculated sediment parameters, which become increasingly erroneous with range, as the sound propagates through the suspension. To address this problem an alternative approach to the iterative implicit formulation is investigated using a recently described dual <b>frequency</b> <b>inversion.</b> This approach is not subject to the accumulation of errors and has an explicit solution.

40|$|The shufflon, a {{multiple}} DNA inversion {{system in the}} plasmid R 64, consists of four DNA segments flanked and separated by seven 19 -bp repeat sequences. Site-specific recombinations mediated by the rci product occur between each inverted repeat sequence, resulting in inversions of the four segments independently or in groups. The seven 19 -bp repeat sequences are classified into four types (repeat-a, -b, -c, and -d), according to their 3 -bp variable sequences. We individually cloned A, B, and C segments of the R 64 shufflon and determined the in vivo <b>inversion</b> <b>frequency</b> of each segment. The <b>inversion</b> <b>frequencies</b> of three segments differed greatly. The <b>inversion</b> <b>frequency</b> declined in the following order: segments A, B, and C. Synthetic 19 -mer oligonucleotides corresponding to both strands of repeat-a, -b, -c, and -d sequences were inserted into appropriate sites of pBR 322.

40|$|International audienceThis is {{the first}} paper in a two-part series that {{describes}} a massively parallel code that performs 2 D frequency-domain full-waveform inversion of wide-aperture seismic data for imaging complex structures. Full-waveform inversion methods, namely quantitative seismic imaging methods based on {{the resolution of the}} full wave equation, are computationally expensive. Therefore, designing efficient algorithms which take advantage of parallel computing facilities is critical for the appraisal of these approaches when applied to representative case studies and for further improvements. Full-waveform modelling requires the resolution of a large sparse system of linear equations which is performed with the massively parallel direct solver MUMPS for efficient multiple-shot simulations. Efficiency of the multiple-shot solution phase (forward/backward substitutions) is improved by using the BLAS 3 library. The inverse problem relies on a classic local optimization approach implemented with a gradient method. The direct solver returns the multiple-shot wavefield solutions distributed over the processors according to a domain decomposition driven by the distribution of the LU factors. The domain decomposition of the wavefield solutions is used to compute in parallel the gradient of the objective function and the diagonal Hessian, this latter providing a suitable scaling of the gradient. The algorithm allows one to test different strategies for multiscale <b>frequency</b> <b>inversion</b> ranging from successive mono-frequency inversion to simultaneous multifrequency inversion. These different inversion strategies will be illustrated in the following companion paper. The parallel efficiency and the scalability of the code will also be quantified...|$|E
40|$|Two {{important}} {{subjects in}} high frequency fluorescent lighting are investigated. Part I. presents a fundamental {{understanding of the}} negative incremental impedance of flourescent lamps. Search for simple, high power factor, lamp ballast topologies, a more practical aspect of lighting electronics, is presented in Part II. Part I. Flourescent lamps have a special v-i characteristic. Their incremental or small-signal impedance is defined and studied in the frequency domain. It is found that the negative incremental impedance of a fluorescent lamp can be characterized by a right half plane zero. The existence of such a result is explained by the modified Francis equation. Two approaches are proposed in order {{to set up a}} stable operating point for the lamp. First, a resonant matching network, which provides impedance transformation, is placed between a voltage source and the lamp. Second, a feedback loop is closed from the lamp current to control the magnitude of the voltage source. Stability criteria based on the Nyquist criterion are developed for the impedance of the resonant matching network and for the loop gain in the above two cases, respectively. It is found that the input impedance of a switching dc-to-dc regulator, which is another case with the negative incremental impedance, and the fluorescent lamp impedance, are two dual cases and thus can be analyzed in a unified manner based on the stability of one-port circuit. The small-signal lamp impedance is measured in the most practical case of a sinusoidal carrier, and it is fit by a real rational function with a right half plane zero. The small signal models describing low frequency variations of sinusoidal magnitude are developed and are experimentally verified for the three major resonant matching networks. Stability analysis for resonant matching networks at parallel resonance are performed. It shows that the LCC network is the simplest resonant matching network that a fluorescent lamp needs. It is also predicted, and experimentally verified, that the resonant matching networks at series resonance are feasible as ballasts when the lamp current feedback loop is closed. Part II. Unlike conventional high power factor ballasts requiring two cascaded power conversion stages, the proposed new lamp ballasts achieve near unity input power factor and high frequency sinusoidal lamp current in a single power conversion stage. A single-stage, high power factor lamp ballast is proposed, which is derived from the Cuk converter. A new discontinuous inductor current mode of its input inductor makes this possible by separating the input current-shaping from the output high <b>frequency</b> <b>inversion.</b> The desirable mode of operation is presented with major waveforms. The high efficiency is further enhanced by the soft-switching improvement, which is provided naturally through the lagging current of the resonant matching network. Design equations are given. The performances of the proposed single-stage, high power factor lamp ballast are verified by the experimental results. Single-switch, unity power factor ac-to-ac converter topologies based on proper integrations of automatic current shapers and single-switch inverters, such as the Class E converter, are presented, which are suitable for lamp ballast applications. Descriptions of the desirable mode of operations and a first order analysis are given. The ballasts have the compact structure of single active switch, high input power factor and low crest factor lamp current as well as soft-switching. Experimental results confirm all the performance advantages...|$|E

In this paper we analyze these techniques {{from the point of view}} of how effective they are in the task of compressing low-entropy strings, that is, strings which have many regularities and are therefore highly compressible. This is a non-trivial task since many compressors have non-constant overheads that become non-negligible when the input string is highly compressible. Because of the properties of the Burrows-Wheeler transform, being locally optimal ensures an algorithm compresses low-entropy strings effectively. Informally, local optimality implies that an algorithm is able to effectively compress an arbitrary partition of the input string. We show that in their original formulation neither Move-to-Front, nor Distance Coding, nor <b>Inversion</b> <b>Frequencies</b> is locally optimal. Then, we describe simple variants of the above algorithms which are locally optimal. To achieve local optimality with Move-to-Front it suffices to combine it with Run Length Encoding.

40|$|Population {{studies of}} the {{distribution}} of transposable elements (TEs) on the chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster have suggested that their copy number increase due to transposition is balanced by some form of natural selection. Theory suggests that, as a consequence of deleterious ectopic meiotic exchange between TEs, selection can favor genomes with lower TE copy numbers. This predicts that TEs should be less deleterious, and hence more abundant, in chromosomal regions in which recombination is reduced. To test this, we surveyed the abundance and locations of 10 families of TEs in recombination-suppressing chromosomal inversions from a natural population. The sample of 49 chromosomes included multiple independent isolates of seven different inversions and a corresponding set of standard chromosomes. For all 10 TE families pooled, copy numbers were significantly higher overall within low <b>frequency</b> <b>inversions</b> than within corresponding regions of standard chromosomes. TEs occupied chromosomal sites at significantly higher frequencies within the In(3 R) M 0 and In(3 R) K inversions than within the corresponding regions of standard 3 R chromosomes.

A realistic synthetic example provides for {{an assessment of the}} potential and limits of 2 D elastic full-waveform inversion FWI of wide-aperture seismic data for recovering high-resolution P- and S-wave velocity models of complex onshore structures. FWI of land data is challenging because of the increased nonlinearity introduced by freesurface effects such as the propagation of surface waves in the heterogeneous near-surface. Moreover, the short wavelengths of the shear wavefield require an accurate S-wave velocity starting model if low frequencies are unavailable in the data. We evaluated different multiscale strategies with the aim of mitigating the nonlinearities. Massively parallel full-waveform inversion was implemented in the frequency domain. The numerical optimization relies on a limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm that outperforms the more classic preconditioned conjugate-gradient algorithm. The forward problem is based upon a discontinuous Galerkin DG method on triangular mesh, which allows accurate modeling of free-surface effects. Sequential <b>inversions</b> of increasing <b>frequencies</b> define the most natural level of hierarchy in multiscale imaging. In the case of land data involving surface waves, the regularization introduced by hierarchical <b>frequency</b> <b>inversions</b> is not enough for adequate convergence of the inversion. A second level of hierarchy implemented with complexvalued frequencies is necessary and provides convergence of the inversion toward acceptable P- and S-wave velocity models. Among the possible strategies for sampling <b>frequencies</b> in the <b>inversion,</b> successive inversions of slightly overlapping frequency groups is the most reliable when compared to the more standard sequential <b>inversion</b> of single <b>frequencies.</b> This suggests that simultaneous <b>inversion</b> of multiple <b>frequencies</b> is critical when considering complex wave phenomena...|$|R

After 36 generations of selection, the average time to the first emergence of adults was about half a day less in lines selected for fast development {{than it was in}} the other lines. Polymorphisms for Adh and six chromosome inversions were monitored during the course of selection. Average Adh F allele frequencies become higher over the 36 generations in lines selected for fast development than in other lines. Collating this result with earlier reports, an association with development time has now been found for three enzyme polymorphisms in laboratory D. melanogaster populations selected for rapid development. Allele frequencies at all three loci show latitudinal clines in natural populations, as does development time, and for each of the three polymorphisms the allele associated with rapid development in the laboratory selection lines is also associated with rapid development in the latitudinal clines.

This potentially represents a novel means of transcriptional control. Here, it is initially shown that DNA inversion per se is required for inhibition of gene expression from invertible DNA. Binding, without DNA scission, of Rci to its substrate sequences on DNA cannot explain the data obtained. Next, it is shown that <b>inversion</b> <b>frequencies</b> of xylE-encoding DNA, bracketed by Rci substrate sequences, may be modulated by changes in the 19 -bp consensus sequences which are essential components of Rci substrate DNA.

40|$|A {{recently}} published methodology based on semiclassical path integral (SCPI) theory was {{implemented in the}} case of a model of a double-well potential perturbed by a static electric field, with application to the <b>inversion</b> <b>frequency</b> of NH 3. This model was chosen as an idealized case for testing of the present approach, as well as for quantum mechanical models that might be applied in the future. The calculations were concerned with the variation of the <b>frequency</b> of <b>inversion</b> as a function of field strength, F, and of distance, x(f) (from the symmetric point x(o) = 0), where the field is "felt. " It is found that this variation occurs sharply in very small regions of values of these parameters, and the system switches from internal oscillation to diffusion to the continuum. The fact that the theory is in analytic form allows the extraction of results and conclusions not only at the full SCPI level, but also at the Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (JWKB) level. Comparison shows that the discrepancy sets in as the field strength increases, in accordance with the well-known limitations of the JWKB method regarding its dependence on the degree of variation of the potential as a function of position.

30|$|We have {{presented}} a 3 -D <b>frequency</b> domain <b>inversion</b> scheme to invert satellite magnetic data for global mantle conductivity. The scheme {{is based on}} the analysis of time spectra of the internal (induced) coefficients of the SHE of the magnetic potential due to magnetospheric sources. The efficacy of the inversion is achieved by the implementation of a limited memory quasi-Newton method and the usage of an adjoint approach to calculate the misfit gradient. Par-allelization with respect to frequencies and an efficient implementation of the computation of Green’s tensors further accelerate the calculations. Producing the inversion results presented in this paper only took a few hours on 20 nodes of ETH’s cluster “Brutus”.|$|R
40|$|Scalar CSAMT {{measurements}} {{collected over}} the San Nicolás massive sulphide deposit are inverted using a 3 D <b>frequency</b> domain <b>inversion</b> methodology. Maxwell’s equations are solved {{in the frequency}} domain using finite volumes on a staggered grid, while the inversion is solved using a Gauss-Newton methodology. A corrective-source formulation is used to reduce the large 3 D numerical domain required for the CSAMT survey configuration. The resulting conductivity is compared with a 1 D interpretation; the 3 D inversion model shows an improved recovery of the deposit geometry. A comparison with a conductivity model obtained using time-domain measurements and a similar inversion methodology show a great agreement in the resulting models despite large differences in the survey configurations...|$|R
