Based on this observation, the hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). The hurricane struck without warning in the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in Nassau. In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs. Every building in Nassau was damaged or destroyed. After moving through the islands, the hurricane curved northeastward, affecting <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> ships and wrecking four. On October4, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force11 winds on the Beaufort scale. The hurricane was last observed on October5 to the southeast of Atlantic Canada.

5|$|Critical {{reception}} and the series' legacy {{has focused on}} the two main trilogies of episodes, with Vorticons having large success as a shareware game and impacting the success of Apogee (now 3D Realms) and its shareware model. The second trilogy sold fewer copies, which was blamed by id and Apogee on its split into two parts, and the 2001 game received mixed reviews. The MS-DOS games have been re-released in several compilation packages, and all but the sixth episode are still sold through modern emulation releases on platforms such as Steam. References to the series have been made by <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> games, especially to the Dopefish, an enemy in the fourth episode, which has been termed one of the video game industry's biggest in-jokes.

5|$|Forming an {{alliance}} with Ptolemy, Antigonus, and Lysimachus, Cassander had his officer Nicanor capture the Munichia fortress of Athens' port town Piraeus in defiance of Polyperchon's decree that Greek cities should be free of Macedonian garrisons, sparking the Second War of the Diadochi (319–315BC). Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon, in 317BC, PhilipIII, by way of his politically engaged wife Eurydice II of Macedon, officially replaced him as regent with Cassander. Afterwards, Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias in Epirus. A joint force of Epirotes, Aetolians, and Polyperchon's troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of PhilipIII and Eurydice's army, allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide.

5|$|Itzamna was {{the creator}} god, {{but he also}} {{embodied}} the cosmos, and was simultaneously a sun god; K'inich Ahau, the day sun, {{was one of his}} aspects. Maya kings frequently identified themselves with K'inich Ahau. Itzamna also had a night sun aspect, the Night Jaguar, representing the sun in its journey through the underworld. The four Pawatuns supported the corners of the mortal realm; in the heavens, the Bacabs performed the same function. As well as their four main aspects, the Bakabs had <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> aspects that are not well understood.

5|$|Matthew and Brown also {{described}} a fifth skeleton (AMNH 5664), which Charles H. Sternberg had collected in 1917 {{and sold to}} their museum. It was smaller than other Gorgosaurus specimens, with a lower, lighter skull and more elongate limb proportions. Many sutures between bones were unfused in this specimen as well. Matthew and Brown noted that these features were characteristic of juvenile tyrannosaurids, but still described it as the holotype of a new species, G. sternbergi. Today's paleontologists regard this specimen as a juvenile G. libratus. <b>Dozens</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> specimens have been excavated from the Dinosaur Park Formation and are housed in museums across the United States and Canada.

5|$|On January 31, 2004, a victim's rights group, the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed {{a lawsuit}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, against several U.S. {{companies}} for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed {{that the use of}} Agent Orange violated the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs' claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under international law {{at the time of its}} use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government. Weinstein used the British example to help dismiss the claims of people exposed to Agent Orange in their suit against the chemical companies that had supplied it.|$|E

German guitarist Günter Schulz joined in 1990; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999. Konietzko resurrected KMFDM in 2002 (Esch and Schulz declined to rejoin) on Metropolis Records, and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line-up that included American singer Lucia Cifarelli, British guitarists Jules Hodgson and Steve White, and British drummer Andy Selway.
