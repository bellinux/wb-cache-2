5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E
5|$|In April, Raonic {{opened the}} Monte-Carlo Masters {{with a victory}} over João Sousa. Just one game into his second-round match against Tommy Robredo, Raonic called for a medical timeout due to a right foot injury. Although {{he went on to}} win the match, Raonic's manager {{indicated}} that Raonic had made a pre-existing injury worse by playing. In his quarterfinal match against Berdych, he complained of numbness in his right foot during a medical timeout, and retired while trailing 2–5 in the opening set. It was diagnosed as a pinched nerve, and Raonic was expected to be <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> the Madrid Open.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 {{season was}} the first season where Harris was <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> the entire season. Dorrance again {{employed}} Harris in the two-goalkeeper system along with Rodenbough. Harris played in 27 games and made 13 starts, playing a total of 1233 minutes. She allowed nine goals and recorded 28 saves, giving a 0.757 save percentage. In the 2008 NCAA Women's Soccer Tournament, Harris appeared in {{second half of the}} third round match against Illinois, where she made three saves, as well as the semi-final match against UCLA, where she again made three saves. She appeared in goal in the championship game against Notre Dame, which UNC won 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the starting rotation in 2010, he won 18 games and earned his first All-Star selection. Arm fatigue cost Hughes {{nearly half of the}} season in 2011, but the following year, he stayed <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> the entire season, winning 16 games as the Yankees' third starter. In 2013, he had his worst season, posting a 4–14 win–loss record and 5.19 earned run average, a performance that led to him being removed from the rotation. The following year, Hughes had a turnaround season with the Twins, where he went 16-10 with an ERA of 3.52 that resulted in him placing 7th in American League Cy Young Award voting.|$|E
5|$|Diaby {{started the}} 2009–10 season <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time}} since 2007 and quickly made an impact. Playing {{alongside}} Alex Song and Cesc Fàbregas, he became part of the dynamic three-man midfield partnership. On 22 August 2009, he scored a double in a 4–1 win over Portsmouth. The following month, Diaby assisted on a goal in the team's 3–2 comeback win over Belgian club Standard Liège in the Champions League. After alternating between the bench and starting lineup for the rest of September, in November, Diaby returned to the first eleven and responding by scoring the game-winning goal in a 3–1 win over Birmingham City. Three weeks later, in the Champions League, he netted another goal in a group stage win over Dutch club AZ. On 7 November, Diaby picked up an injury in a 4–1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. The injury resulted in the player missing France's World Cup playoff tie with the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|With Duncan being <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> 78 {{games and}} posting typical 20/10 numbers, San Antonio {{concluded}} the 2007–08 regular {{season with a}} 56–26 record, finishing behind the Lakers and New Orleans Hornets in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Suns. The Suns—defeated by the Spurs {{in three of the}} past four seasons of playoffs—were out for revenge and featured a new player in four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal. In Game 1, Duncan set the tone with a 40-point game and a rare three-pointer that sent the game into double overtime. The trio of Duncan, Ginóbili and Parker continued playing to form {{for the remainder of the}} series, and the Spurs eliminated the Suns in five games. In the first game of the next round against the Chris Paul-led Hornets, San Antonio was badly defeated 101–82 as Duncan played one of the worst playoff games in his career, recording only 5 points and 3 rebounds. The Spurs dropped the next game as well, but recovered in Games 3 and 4, with Duncan putting up a team-high 22 point/15 rebound/4 block performance in the game that tied the series. Duncan then recorded 20 points and 15 rebounds in Game 6, and the Spurs relied on their experience to seal the series in Game 7. However, arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers defeated San Antonio in five games in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.|$|E

25|$|Extreme {{urination}} continues {{throughout the}} day and the night. In children, DI can interfere with appetite, eating, weight gain, and growth, as well.

However, there is a continuous risk of dehydration and loss of potassium that may lead to hypokalemia.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} seafood, shrimp {{is high in}} calcium, iodine and protein but low in food energy. A shrimp-based meal is also a {{significant}} source of cholesterol, from 122mg to 251mg per 100g of shrimp, depending on the method of preparation. Shrimp consumption, however, is considered <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> the circulatory system because the lack of significant levels of saturated fat in shrimp means that the high cholesterol content in shrimp actually improves the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol and lowers triglycerides.|$|E

In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines.

25|$|Raw bones fed to dogs contain high {{amounts of}} calcium and {{phosphorus}} {{that is essential}} for neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine and clotting function. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus for adult dogs should be 1:1. Compared to commercial dog food, the raw food diet allows dogs to work for their meal, ripping the meat off bones and then gnawing at the bones. In regards to dental health, bone to tooth gnawing allows a dog to rid their teeth of plaque buildup promoting good oral health. Skeptics argue however that this isn't <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> dogs and it can cause dental fractures.|$|E

25|$|Peter H. Russell, a {{professor}} emeritus {{of political science at}} the University of Toronto, suggested that if Harper had sought a dissolution, the governor general would have had to consider carefully the reasonableness of the request. In Russell's view, the viceroy's primary concern is to protect parliamentary democracy and a dissolution of parliament would have necessitated an election only two months after the preceding one; repeated short term elections are not <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> the system. In such a case, with a reasonably viable coalition available, Jean might then refuse Harper's advice to dissolve parliament (forcing him to resign under constitutional precedent), and invite Dion to form a government.|$|E
25|$|At more {{realistic}} levels, developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure septic systems, and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimise impacts to {{drinking water and}} to ecosystems. Developed countries can not only share technology better, including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in hydrological transport modeling. At the individual level, people in developed countries can look inward and reduce overconsumption, which further strains worldwide water consumption. Both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems, especially wetlands and riparian zones. These measures will not only conserve biota, but also render more effective the natural water cycle flushing and transport that make water systems more <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> humans.|$|E
25|$|Ophelia, also, {{has been}} defended by feminists, most notably by Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia was driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture, a symbol which may not be entirely accurate nor <b>healthy</b> <b>for</b> women.|$|E
