5|$|Aaronson {{was born}} on 18 February 1895 at 34 Great Pearl Street, Spitalfields in the East End of London to poor Orthodox Jewish parents who had immigrated from Vilna <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> of Settlement in Eastern Europe. His father was Louis Aaronson, a bootmaker, {{and his mother was}} Sarah Aaronson, née Kowalski. He {{attended}} Whitechapel City Boys' School and later received a scholarship to attend Hackney Downs grammar school.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden had an on-again off-again {{relationship}} with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist avant la lettre {{and one of}} his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (Shulamith set in Jerusalem, Mashiach Tzeiten?! ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, {{he spent most of his}} life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> of Settlement and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.|$|E
25|$|Queen Elizabeth I {{encouraged}} {{the use of}} Irish even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> {{with a view to}} promoting the reformed religion. She was a proficient linguist and is reported to have expressed a desire to understand Irish, so a primer was prepared on her behalf by Sir Christopher Nugent, ninth baron of Delvin.|$|E

25|$|By the Tudor period, the Irish {{culture and}} {{language}} had regained {{most of the}} territory initially lost to the colonists: “even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale,</b> all the common folk … {{for the most part}} are of Irish birth, Irish habit and of Irish language”. At a higher social level, there was extensive intermarriage between the Gaelic Irish aristocracy and Anglo-Norman lords, beginning not long after the invasion.|$|E
25|$|Although 500,000 Russian Jews {{were serving}} in the Russian army, the Russian {{leadership}} regarded all Jews as their enemies and assumed that most were avoiding the draft. In 1914-1915 500,000 Jews were ordered {{to leave their homes}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> of Settlement, mostly with less than 24 hours notice. An estimated 100,000 died of starvation and exposure and their plight contributed to the disintegration of the Russian army.|$|E
25|$|Cases of {{the disease}} were not known to occur {{in what is now}} France (except <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> of Calais, which was {{controlled}} by England at the time) or Italy. It also emerged in Flanders and the Netherlands, probably transmitted directly from England by travellers, as it appeared simultaneously in the cities of Antwerp and Amsterdam on the morning of 27 September. In each place it infected, it prevailed for a short time, generally not more than a fortnight.|$|E

25|$|Official Russian {{policy would}} {{eventually}} {{prove to be}} substantially harsher to the Jews than that under independent Polish rule. The lands {{that had once been}} Poland were to remain the home of many Jews, as, in 1772, Catherine II, the Tzarina of Russia, instituted the Pale of Settlement, restricting Jews to the western parts of the empire, which would eventually include much of Poland, although it excluded some areas in which Jews had previously lived. By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{authorities}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> {{worried about}} the Gaelicisation of Norman Ireland, and passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366 banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes or inter-marrying with the Irish. The government in Dublin had little real authority. By {{the end of the}} 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared. England's attentions were diverted by the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) and then by the Wars of the Roses (1450–85). Around the country, local Gaelic and Gaelicised lords expanded their powers {{at the expense of the}} English government in Dublin.|$|E
25|$|In Rioja {{the grape}} is planted {{mostly in the}} warmer Rioja Baja region located in the eastern expanse of the wine region. Usually blended with Tempranillo, Garnacha {{provides}} juicy fruitiness and added body. In recent years, modern Rioja producers have been {{increasing the amount of}} Garnacha used in the blend in order to produce earlier maturing and more approachable Riojas in their youth. Garnacha is also used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> colored rosados of Rioja. The vine has a long history in the Navarra region where it has been the dominant red grape variety with nearly 54% of the region's vineyard planted with Garnacha.|$|E

25|$|Nahum Goldmann {{was born}} in Vishnevo, Russian Empire, a shtetl <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> of Settlement (now Vishnyeva, Belarus), {{the son of a}} {{teaching}} and writing Litvak family, whose father was an ardent Zionist. At the age of six, he moved with his parents to Frankfurt, Germany, where his father entertained leading Zionists and intellectuals, and where he attended the Musterschule. In 1911, while still in high school, he and his father attended the Tenth Zionist Congress. Goldmann went on to study law, history, and philosophy in Marburg, Heidelberg, and Berlin. He graduated in law and philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Jews in Eastern Europe faced {{constant}} pogroms and persecution in Tzarist Russia. From 1791 {{they were}} only allowed to live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> of Settlement. In response to the Jewish drive for integration and modern education (Haskalah) and the movement for emancipation, the Tzars imposed tight quotas on schools, universities and cities to prevent entry by Jews. From 1827 to 1917 Russian Jewish boys were required to serve 25 years in the Russian army, starting {{at the age of}} 12. The intention was to forcibly destroy their ethnic identity, however the move severely radicalized Russia's Jews and familiarized them with nationalism and socialism.|$|E
25|$|In 1366, so {{that the}} English Crown could assert its {{authority}} over the settlers, a parliament was assembled in Kilkenny and the Statute of Kilkenny was enacted. The statute decreed that intermarriage between English settlers and Irish natives was forbidden. It also forbade the settlers using the Irish language and adopting Irish modes of dress or other customs, as such practices were already common. The adoption of Gaelic Brehon property law, in particular, undermined the feudal nature of the Lordship. The Act was never implemented successfully, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> itself, and {{was a sign of}} how Ireland was withdrawing from English cultural norms.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, Christie {{worked in}} the {{pharmacy}} at University College Hospital, London, where she acquired a knowledge of poisons that she {{put to good use}} in her post-war crime novels. For example, the use of thallium as a poison was suggested to her by UCH Chief Pharmacist Harold Davis (later appointed Chief Pharmacist at the UK Ministry of Health), and <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Pale</b> Horse, published in 1961, she employed it to dispatch a series of victims, the first clue to the murder method coming from the victims' loss of hair. So accurate was her description of thallium poisoning that on at least one occasion it helped solve a case that was baffling doctors.|$|E
25|$|Horowitz was the {{youngest}} of four children of Samuil Horowitz and Sophia Bodik, who were assimilated Jews. Samuil was a well-to-do electrical engineer and a distributor of electric motors for German manufacturers. Horowitz's grandfather Joachim was a merchant (and an arts-supporter), belonging to the 1st Guild. This status gave exemption from having to reside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> of Settlement. Horowitz was born in 1903, but in order to make him appear too young for military service so as not to risk damaging his hands, his father took a year off his son's age by claiming he was born in 1904. The 1904 date appeared in many reference works during the pianist's lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Baltic amber {{yields on}} dry {{distillation}} succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> opaque or bony varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly {{due to this}} acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name succinite. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather {{greater than that of}} many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. It can be distinguished from other ambers via IR spectroscopy due to a specific carbonyl absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of abietic acid.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th {{century the}} symbol began to proliferate among the Jewish {{communities}} of Eastern Europe, ultimately being used among the Jewish communities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> of Settlement. A significant motivating factor, according to scholar Gershom Sholem, was {{the desire to}} represent Jewish religion and/or identity {{in the same manner}} the Christian cross identified that religion's believers. The earliest Jewish usage of the symbol was inherited from medieval Arabic literature by Kabbalists for use in talismanic protective amulets (segulot) where it was known as a Seal of Solomon. The symbol was also used in Christian churches as a decorative motif many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue. Before the 19th century, official use in Jewish communities was generally known only in the region of today's Czech Republic, Austria and possibly parts of Southern Germany, having begun in medieval Prague.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Schutz, born in Annaberg, Saxony, {{was the son}} of Christoph Schutz (born 1505) of Chemnitz. His mother's name is unknown. He {{learned his}} craft in mines in the Erzgebirge. About 1563 he {{received}} an invitation to work in England. William Humfrey (d.1579), who had been appointed Assay Master at the Royal Mint in 1561, needed someone knowledgeable about calamine ore, used in the production of latten and brass, and paid Schutz' way to England. In 1564 Schutz, aided by twenty German-speaking workers, built England's first blast furnace at Tintern. In a letter of 16 August 1565 to Sir William Cecil, Humfrey stated that Schutz was 'bound in £10,000 to communicate his art in working metals', and requested that he and Schutz be granted a joint patent. In September 1565 Humfrey and Schutz were granted licences to prospect for calamine in England and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> in Ireland, and to mine and process the ore, being joined in some of their licences with Thomas Smythe, William Williams and Humfrey Cole. Only a few months later, in early 1566, William Humfrey and Schutz found calamine in the Mendip Hills, and Daniel Hoechstetter designed a refining process by which it could be used in Schutz' furnace at Tintern.|$|E
