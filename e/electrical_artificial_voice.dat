40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is <b>artificial</b> <b>voices</b> with {{different}} person-alities. Previous studies have shown links between an individ-ual’s use of disfluencies in their speech and their perceived per-sonality. Here, filled pauses (uh and um) and discourse markers (like, you know, I mean) have been included in synthetic speech as a way of creating an <b>artificial</b> <b>voice</b> with different personali-ties. We discuss the automatic insertion of filled pauses and dis-course markers (i. e., fillers) into otherwise fluent texts. The au-tomatic system is compared to a ground truth of human “acted” filler insertion. Perceived personality (as defined by the big five personality dimensions) of the synthetic speech is assessed by means of a standardised questionnaire. Synthesis without fillers is compared to synthesis with either spontaneous or synthetic fillers. Our findings explore how the inclusion of disfluencies influences the way in which subjects rate the perceived person-ality of an <b>artificial</b> <b>voice.</b> Index Terms: <b>artificial</b> personality, TTS, disfluency 1...|$|R

40|$|With {{a rate of}} 40 %, malign tumors of {{the larynx}} are the most {{commonly}} occurring head-neck-melanoma. Voice rehabilitation after laryngectomy has been a main point of interest ever since the first laryngectomy was conducted by Bilroth in Vienna in 1873. For decades, voice rehabilitation was mainly attained {{by means of an}} oesophageal voice replacement and/or an <b>artificial</b> <b>voice</b> aid, until E. Mozolewski described the first well-functioning voice-prothesis. Since then a multitude of <b>artificial</b> <b>voice</b> aids with various characteristics and different demands on quality has been developed. Supplying the patient with an voice-prothesis immediately after the laryngectomy is common practice, as this method has proven to yield better results than secondary care. This study will show the durability of Provox-II-voice-prothesis in an international comparison. In particular, the study will investigate whether the handling of these <b>artificial</b> <b>voice</b> aids is a factor in shortening or extending their durability. 133 patients (15 women, 118 men) were included in the study; the period of investigation extends retrospectively from 1998 to August 2004. In the process, 1323 <b>artificial</b> <b>voice</b> aids were exchanged. At the time of investigation, the patients were between 40 and 84 years old. With all patients, the primary illness was cancer of the larynx, hypopharynx or the oropharynx. We differentiated between primary and secondary implantation of the voice-prothesis. Another evaluation criterion was postoperative ray treatment. In order to also investigate the factors that influence Provox-II-voice-prothesis durability, we additionally conducted a survey among 61 patients who were under medical treatment at the time. According to our study, the average lifetime of Provox-II-voice-prothesis was 104. 54 days. During the period of investigation, lifetime ranged from a minimum of 100 days (1999) to a maximum of 115 days (2000). The frequency of exchanges does not affect the lifetime of the Provox-II-voice-prothesis. Throughout the study, we could not find any significant differences between the respective types of tumors, the method of operation, the postoperative ray treatment or the method of electrolarynx implantation. In the survey of additional patients, the only finding consisted of a clear extension of exchange intervals in patients who had indicated regular alcohol intake. Neither this study nor similar other studies have found factors that significantly extend the lifetime of Provox-II-voice-prothesis. Consequently, the development of new materials gains priority...|$|R

50|$|Speech {{synthesis}} {{has improved}} immeasurably in recent years. It {{is often used}} in electronic dictionaries to enable learners {{to find out how}} words are pronounced. At word level, speech synthesis is quite effective, the <b>artificial</b> <b>voice</b> often closely resembling a human voice. At phrase level and sentence level, however, there are often problems of intonation, resulting in speech production that sounds unnatural even though it may be intelligible. Speech synthesis as embodied in Text To Speech (TTS) applications is invaluable as a tool for unsighted or partially sighted people. Gupta & Schulze (2010: Section 4.1) list several examples of speech synthesis applications.|$|R

Organizing nanoparticles into ordered hierarchical structures are highly desired for constructing novel optical and <b>electrical</b> <b>artificial</b> materials that are different from their isolated state or thermodynamics random ensembles. My research integrates the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, interfacial assembly and lithography techniques to construct nanoparticle based functional structures. We designed and synthesized tailor-made ligands for gold, semiconductor and magnetic nanoparticle, to modulate the assembly process and collective properties of the assembled structures, by controlling the key parameters such as particle-interface interaction, dielectric environments and inter-particle coupling etc. Top-down technologies such as micro contact printing, photolithography and nanoimprint lithography are used to guide the assembly into arbitrarily predesigned structures for potential device applications. ...|$|R

40|$|Background. A newly {{developed}} <b>artificial</b> <b>voice</b> source was clinically evaluated in laryngectomized women for voice quality improvements. The prosthesis was placed In a commercially available, tracheoesophageal shunt valve. Methods. In 17 subjects, voice-producing element (VPE) prototypes {{were compared with}} the subject's regular tracheoesophageal shunt voice in a randomized cross-over trial. The evaluation was based on aeroacoustic measurements and perceptual analysis. Results. Considerably higher fundamental frequencies were attained {{with the use of}} the VPE. The sound pressure level also increased for most subjects. The required driving pressures of the lung and air flow rates were altered, allowing significantly longer phonation times in 1 breath. Accumulation of mucus did not interfere with the proper functioning of the device during these tests. Conclusion. A VPE with sound-generating membranes is suitable for providing a substitute voice source for laryngectomized patients, especially patients suggestive of a severely hypotonic or atonic pharyngoesophageal segment who can benefit from a more melodious and louder voice. © 2008 Wiley Peridicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|From <b>artificial</b> <b>voices</b> in GPS to {{automatic}} {{systems of}} dictation, from voice-based identity verification to voice pathology detection, speech processing applications are nowadays omnipresent {{in our daily}} life. By offering solutions to companies seeking for efficiency enhancement with simultaneous cost saving, the market of speech technology is forecast to be particularly promising in the next years. The present thesis deals with advances in glottal analysis in order to incorporate new techniques within speech processing applications. While current systems are usually based on information related to the vocal tract configuration, the airflow passing through the vocal folds, and called glottal flow, is expected to exhibit a relevant complementarity. Unfortunately, glottal analysis from speech recordings requires specific complex processing operations, which explains why it has been generally avoided. The main goal of this thesis is to provide new advances in glottal analysis so as to popularize it in speech processing. First, new techniques for glottal excitation estimation and modeling are proposed and shown to outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on large corpora of real speech. Moreover, proposed methods are integrated within various speech processing applications: speec...|$|R
