40|$|Protected {{horticulture}} production {{represents one}} of the most important agricultural businesses in Southern Europe. However, many problems related to the lack of mechanisation, intensive use of pesticides, and, in some cases, undesirable residues on food, have not been solved yet. In this context, application technology is a key factor for the improvement of the efficacy and efficiency of plant protection products. Spray guns and <b>knapsack</b> <b>sprayers</b> are the most common technologies that have been used for this purpose. However, several studies have demonstrated that, compared with spray guns, the use of vertical boom sprayers in greenhouses improves spray distribution and reduces labour costs and operator exposure. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of air-assistance on spray application in conventional tomato greenhouses. For this purpose three different spray conceptions were evaluated; 1) a modified commercial handheld trolley sprayer with two air assistance concepts; 2) a self-propelled sprayer; and 3) an autonomous self-propelled sprayer with remote control. All the sprayers considered were evaluated in terms of absolute and normalised canopy deposition, uniformity of distribution, and losses to the ground. In addition, the vertical liquid and air velocity distributions of the sprayers were assessed and compared with the canopy profiles and spray depositions. Yellow tartrazine (E- 102 yellow) was used as a tracer for deposition evaluation. The results indicated that increasing the air velocity does not increase the efficiency of a spray application. In general, the modified handheld trolley sprayer showed the best results in terms of deposition and uniformity of distribution, especially at the lowest air assistance rate. These results were confirmed with evaluation of the uniformity of the air and liquid distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{exposure}} assessment {{in this context}} is to consider realistic and high exposure scenarios arising from the proposed Good Agricultural Practice for non-dietary systemic exposure that can be compared with appropriate toxicological reference values. The calculator can be used to assess exposures for operators (persons who are involved in activities relating to the application of a plant protection products (PPP), workers (persons who, as part of their employment, enter an area that has been treated previously with a PPP or who handle a crop that has been treated with a PPP), bystanders (persons who could be located within or directly adjacent to the area where PPP application or treatment is in process or has recently been completed) and residents (persons who live, work or attend school or any other institution adjacent to an area that is or has been treated with a PPP). The Data Entry form requires information about the plant protection product, toxicological reference values and a description of the intended use. The operator exposure uses the AOEM model (GroÃkopf, 2012) and includes application techniques and scenarios for outdoor treatment of low and high crops, by vehicle-mounted/trailed or self-propelled sprayers or by hand-held spray guns and <b>knapsack</b> <b>sprayers.</b> 75 th and 95 th centile exposures are estimated for both mixing and loading and application and these can be modified by applying suitable combinations of PPE. An additional sheet allows the estimation of operator exposure for granular formulations based on the Pesticide Handlers Exposure Database (PHED, 1992). The worker worksheet estimates dermal and inhalation exposure for indoor and outdoor worker scenarios. The Transfer Coefficients for dermal exposure were modified from EUROPOEM II (2002) considering US EPA (2012) and for inhalation exposure Task Specific Factors are taken from van Hemmen et al., 2002.

40|$|Farmers who spray their rice crops with {{pesticides}} can generally {{expect to}} harvest more rice and earn more money. But {{a report by}} the International Rice Research Institute concludes that there are hidden costs to human health which can cancel out those gains. The researchers, led by Dr Parbhu Pingali, found that while farmers are aware that contact with pesticides can cause skin irritation, they are generally unaware that, in the long term, using pesticides exposes them and their families to the risk of damage to their lungs, eyes, kidneys and nervous systems. As these effects build up over time, working days are lost and eventually treatment is required. It is these costs that the study has added into the production equation. The study points out that it is difficult for many smallholder farmers to handle and use pesticides safely. They are not trained, they do not have adequate storage facilities and they cannot afford protective clothing. Many of the chemicals used are category 1 and 2 pesticides that the World Health Organization classifies as being 'extremely'; or 'moderately' hazardous. The report questions the need to use pesticides at all. Despite the generally held belief that half a rice crop could be lost to pests, the researchers found losses were not nearly as high. They suggest that {{there is no need to}} spray the crop regularly unless there is a major infestation. Natural control of nests through a policy of integrated pest management (IPM) should be actively encouraged by governments, says Dr Pingali. At the same time they should remove subsidies and other incentives for using pesticides. Switching to less hazardous chemicals, those in categories 3 and 4 would have enormous benefits to health. Pesticides, rice production and farmers' health Published 1993 by IRRI PO Box 993 Manila 1099 PHILIPPINES The dangers of pesticide use are also highlighted in a report published by the Silsoe Research Institute which points out that, according to the figures issued by WHO/UNEP in 1990, pesticides kill approximately 20, 000 people each year. Most of these deaths occur in developing countries, even though they use relatively small amounts of pesticides compared to the developed world. One of the main reasons is that spraying equipment, based on designs from industrialized countries, is often unsuitable for use in tropical developing countries. Furthermore, term workers are not sufficiently literate to read warnings or understand instructions on pesticide usage. The problem is further exacerbated by the use of potent chemicals, some of which are so toxic that they have been banned in industrialized countries. The report suggests that pesticide poisoning could be reduced by the use of better-designed and better-maintained <b>knapsack</b> <b>sprayers,</b> by the use of smaller volumes of chemicals and through safer handling practices.

This phenomenon not only adds to cost of production but also cause environmental pollution and imbalance in natural echo system. This paper suggests a model of manually operated multi nozzle pesticides sprayer pump which will perform spraying at maximum rate in minimum time. Constant flow valves can be applied at nozzle to have uniform nozzle pressure...|$|E

RW 14 -M-C 2 b- 1 (60, 000 per row-metre, equalling 0.75 [*]Ã[*] 109 IJs/ha) and the {{international}} S. longicaudum X 7 (60, 000 /row-metre, equalling 0.75 [*]Ã[*] 109 IJs/ha; 120, 000 /row-metre, equalling 1.5 [*]Ã[*] 109 IJs/ha; 200, 000 /row-metre, equalling 2.5 [*]Ã[*] 109 IJs/ha) were applied with water (2000 Â l/ha) into the soil along the plant rows. For that, an about 5 -cm-deep furrow had been made at about 10 to 15 Â cm distance to the plants. EPNs formulated in sponge (Yan et al., 2016) were diluted in water and transferred through a sieve into an 8 -l <b>knapsack</b> <b>sprayer.</b> Nozzles were removed and EPNs applied into the soil. EPNs were applied about 30 Â days after planting (4 June 2015) in field N, and about 55 Â days after planting in field M (10 July 2015).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the findings of}} the research carried out on agricultural tools and machinery used by Samoan subsistence farmers to cultivate and harvest crops like taro (Colocasia esculents var. esculenta), banana (musa spp.), taâamu (Alocasia macrorhiza) breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), yam (Discorea spp.) and coconut (Cocosnucifera). The research was conducted by interviewing farmers chosen by field officers who work directly with them on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture in Samoa. The information collected focused on the type of tool, implement or machine that the farmer owned or has access to, its effectiveness, susceptibility to breakdowns, maintenance issues, ease of repair and availability of spare parts. In general the level of engineering inputs employed in the production of these crops is low and confined mainly to the bushknife, metal tip for planting stick, spade, the lower â operated <b>knapsack</b> <b>sprayer</b> and the mist blower...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} {{to establish the}} extent of pesticide exposure in a farming community. Cholinesterase (ChE) activity in whole blood {{was used as a}} marker for assessing exposure to pesticides. Complete data were gathered for 63 farmers at Akumadan (exposed) and 58 control subjects at Tono, both prominent vegetable farming communities in Ghana, by means of a questionnaire and blood cholinesterase analyses (acetylcholine-assay). Although whole blood ChE was significantly lower in the exposed than the control participants, it was not significantly correlated with either confounders of age, sex, body weight, and height or high risks practices. The high risks practices revealed during the survey included lack of use of personal protective clothing, short re-entry intervals, and wrong direction of spraying of pesticides by hand or <b>knapsack</b> <b>sprayer.</b> About 97 % of exposed participants had experienced symptoms attributable to pesticide exposure. The frequent symptoms were reported as weakness and headache. There is the need to review safety precautions in the use and application of pesticides in Ghana...|$|E
30|$|The organic Piper {{emulsion}} botanical comprised West African {{black pepper}} (Piper guineense) that was harvested from a primary forest at Inokun-Eyumojock in South-western Cameroon and prepared according to Tanyi et al. [35]. Briefly, 250 Â g crushed sun-dried Piper seed powder was dissolved in 1 Â L vegetable oil (KINGâSÂ®, Lagos-Nigeria) and 10 Â g detergent (SABAÂ®, Douala-Cameroon) {{was added to}} produce a sticky emulsion. The mixture was stirred thoroughly and stored in a plastic container at room temperature while laboratory tests were conducted to determine the effective dose for best field results. 50 Â mL Piper emulsion was filtered using a double 169 -folded muslin cloth and diluted in 15 Â L water for field application every 2 Â weeks, during cold dry early morning periods with minimal drift. Piper emulsion was stirred thoroughly to achieve homogeneity and sprayed using a <b>knapsack</b> <b>sprayer</b> {{on both sides of}} cabbage leaves for all 192 plants in the respective plots.|$|E
40|$|False flax, German sesame and Siberian oilseed are {{the names}} used for oil seed crop, Camelina sativa L. Crantz {{of the family}} Brassicaceae. Camelina sativa is a flexible, summer annual oilseed crop that can be raised in {{different}} climatic and soil conditions. The objectives {{of this study were}} to test the efficacy of different insecticides against aphid, Lipaphis erysimi on Canadian and Australian Camelina sativa varieties. Insecticides were tested at their field recommended doses using <b>knapsack</b> <b>sprayer.</b> The data on adult mortality of Lipaphis erysimi were recorded after 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h. Acetamiprid and mospilon were found more effective in controlling aphid. For Canadian variety, after 5 days of application, maximum mortality was recorded for acetamiprid (98. 70 %) while least was observed for diafenthiuron (53. 52 %). In case of Australian camelina, maximum mortality (98. 26 %) of aphid were found using acetamiprid. Acetamiprid was the most effective insecticide to control aphid in both varieties of Camelina sativa...|$|E
40|$|Two factors, {{transplanting}} {{date and}} insecticide frequency were combined {{to evaluate their}} effects in reducing population of thrips and yield of onion. Transplanting was done at monthly interval from November through March, while spraying was done fortnightly, starting from three weeks after transplanting (WAT) to nine WAT (3, 5, 7 and 9) using <b>knapsack</b> <b>sprayer</b> at 18. 67 g a. i. /ha. Results showed that early transplanting done in November and December had fewer thrips than the subsequent ones. At 7 WAT, late transplanting made in February had up to 191 thrips/plant and about 76 % and second and subsequent sprays were less effective. There was significant difference between treatments (P sprays produced up to 52. 53 t/ha, nearly doubling the control plots with 31. 6 t/ha. November transplant produced up to 60 t/ha and December transplant 51. 82 t/ha in three-insecticide spray.
