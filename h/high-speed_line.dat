5|$|Plans for an {{expansion}} of the <b>high-speed</b> <b>line</b> to Hamar have been launched, but have not been incorporated into any specific plans. This suggestion would increase the length of the high-speed rail north of Oslo with —almost a doubling. The project may or may not incorporate a further <b>high-speed</b> <b>line</b> to Trondheim.|$|E

5|$|On 23 September 2009 an {{overhead}} power line dropped on to a Class 373 train arriving at St Pancras station, activating a circuit breaker and delaying eleven other trains. Two days later, on 25 September 2009, electrical power via the overhead lines was lost on a section of <b>high-speed</b> <b>line</b> outside Lille, delaying passengers on two evening Eurostar-operated services.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of three separate <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines</b> from Ankara to Istanbul, Konya and Sivas, {{as well as}} taking an Ankara-Izmir line to the launch stage, form part of the Turkish Ministry of Transport's strategic aims and targets. Turkey planned to construct a network of <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines</b> {{in the early part}} of the 21st century, targeting a 1500 km network of <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines</b> by 2013 and a 10000 km network by the year 2023.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{original}} plan for Regional Eurostar services to destinations north of London was abandoned, the significantly improved journey times available since the opening of High Speed 1 — which is physically connected to both the East Coast Main Line and the North London Line (for the West Coast Main Line) at St Pancras — and the recently increased maximum speeds on the West Coast Main Line may make potential Regional Eurostar services more commercially viable. This {{would be even more}} likely if proposals are adopted for a new <b>high-speed</b> <b>line</b> from London to the north of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Its {{extensions}} to Belgium {{and towards}} Paris, {{as well as}} connecting to the Channel Tunnel, have made LGV Nord a part of every Eurostar journey undertaken. A Belgian <b>high-speed</b> <b>line,</b> HSL 1, {{was added to the}} end of LGV Nord, at the Belgian border, in 1997. Of all French high-speed lines, LGV Nord sees the widest variety of high-speed rolling stock and is quite busy; a proposed cut-off bypassing Lille, which would reduce Eurostar journey times to Paris, is called LGV Picardie.|$|E
5|$|LGV Picardie is a {{proposed}} <b>high-speed</b> <b>line</b> between Paris and Calais via Amiens. By {{cutting off the}} corner of the LGV Nord at Lille, it would enable Eurostar trains to save 20minutes on the journey between Paris and Calais, bringing the London–Paris journey time under 2hours. In 2008 the French Government announced its future investment plans for new LGVs to be built up to 2020; LGV Picardie was not included but was listed as planned in the longer term. It has later been confirmed that LGV Picardie is intended to be built between 2020 and 2030.|$|E

50|$|The {{path of the}} Spanish High Speed (AVE) {{stops in}} the town of Valladolid as part of the Madrid-Valladolid <b>high-speed</b> rail <b>line.</b> This line was inaugurated on 22 of December 2007. It is {{expected}} that in the future other localities such as Olmedo and Medina del Campo have another <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines</b> that are at different stages of project like Olmedo-Zamora-Galicia <b>high-speed</b> rail <b>line</b> or Valladolid-Palencia-León <b>high-speed</b> rail <b>line.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... RENFE Class 120 and RENFE Class 130 {{trains are}} in service. Class 120 trains are {{used on the}} routes from Madrid to Pamplona, Logroño, Irún, and Hendaye (running on <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines</b> from Madrid to Valladolid and {{changing}} gauge there), and between Barcelona and Vigo, Irún, Bilbao (running on <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines</b> between Barcelona and Zaragoza). Class 130 trains are employed on the routes from Madrid to Alicante (on <b>high-speed</b> <b>lines</b> from Madrid to Valencia), and to Gijón, Santander, Bilbao, Irún, and Hendaye (France) changing gauge at Valladolid, León and Venta de Baños.|$|R
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the new line is to allow {{regional}} and express trains to run directly between Asker Station, Sandvika Station and Lysaker Station, without being slowed and delayed by commuter trains that make frequent stops at intermediate stations. The Asker Line will improve regularity, and capacity will increase from 12 to 26 trains per hour in each direction. Travel time from Asker to Skøyen Station will be reduced from 20 to 13 minutes. The line has received criticism for not being a true <b>high-speed</b> <b>line,</b> and for Lysaker Station not being in compliance with accessibility requirements. Similar parallel, high-speed lines have been or will be built northeast and southeast of Oslo.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminus}} for the <b>high-speed</b> <b>line</b> in London is St Pancras railway station. During the 2000s, {{towards the}} end of the construction of the CTRL, the entire station complex was renovated, expanded and rebranded as StPancras International, with a new security-sealed terminal area for Eurostar trains to continental Europe. In addition, it retained traditional domestic connections to the north and south of England. The new extension doubled the length of the central platforms now used for Eurostar services; new platforms have been provided for existing domestic East Midlands Trains and the Southeastern high-speed services that run along High Speed 1 to Kent. New platforms on the Thameslink line across London were built beneath the western margins of the station, and the station at King's Cross Thameslink was closed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the tunnel's shuttle trains carrying cars and lorries between Folkestone and Calais, the decision to build a railway tunnel opened up the possibility of through passenger and freight train services between places further afield. British Rail and SNCF contracted with Eurotunnel to use half the tunnel's capacity for this purpose. In 1987 Britain, France and Belgium set up an International Project Group to specify a train to provide an international high-speed passenger service through the tunnel. France had been operating high-speed TGV services since 1981, and had begun {{construction of a new}} <b>high-speed</b> <b>line</b> between Paris and the Channel Tunnel, LGV Nord; French TGV technology was chosen {{as the basis for the}} new trains. An order for 30 trainsets, to be manufactured in France but with some British and Belgian components, was placed in December 1989. On 20 June 1993, the first Eurostar test train travelled through the tunnel to the UK. Various technical difficulties in running the new trains on British tracks were quickly overcome.|$|E
