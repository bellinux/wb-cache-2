50|$|Earlier diesel pumps used an in-line layout with {{a series}} of {{cam-operated}} <b>injection</b> <b>cylinders</b> in a line, rather like a miniature inline engine. The pistons have a constant stroke volume, and injection volume (i.e., throttling) is controlled by rotating the cylinders against a cut-off port that aligns with a helical slot in the cylinder. When all the cylinders are rotated at once, they simultaneously vary their injection volume to produce more or less power from the engine. Inline pumps still find favour on large multi-cylinder engines such as those on trucks, construction plant, static engines and agricultural vehicles.|$|R

50|$|For use on {{cars and}} light trucks, the rotary pump or {{distributor}} pump was developed. It uses a single <b>injection</b> <b>cylinder</b> driven from an axial cam plate, which injects into the individual fuel lines via a rotary distribution valve. Later incarnations {{such as the}} Bosch VE pump vary the injection timing with crankshaft speed to allow greater power at high crank speeds, and smoother, more economical running at slower revolution of crankshaft. Some VE variants have a pressure-based system that allows the injection volume to increase over normal to allow a turbocharger or supercharger equipped engine to develop more power under boost conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{comparative}} {{performance was}} determined of engines using three methods of mixing the fuel and the air: {{the use of}} a carburetor, manifold <b>injection,</b> and <b>cylinder</b> <b>injection.</b> The tests were made of a single-cylinder engine with a Wright 1820 -G air-cooled cylinder. Each method of mixing the fuel and the air was investigated over a range of fuel-air ratios from 0. 10 to the limit of stable operation and at engine speeds of 1, 500 and 1, 900 r. p. m. The comparative performance with a fuel-air ratio of 0. 08 was investigated for speeds from 1, 300 to 1, 900 r. p. m. The results show that the power obtained with each method closely followed the volumetric efficiency; the power was therefore the highest with <b>cylinder</b> <b>injection</b> because this method had less manifold restriction.

The LT4 engine {{is based on the}} same Gen 5 small block foundation as the Corvette Stingray’s LT1 6.2L naturally aspirated engine, incorporating several unique features designed to support its higher output and the greater cylinder pressures created by forced induction, including: Rotocast A356T6 aluminum cylinder heads that are stronger and handle heat better than conventional aluminum heads, lightweight titanium intake valves, forged powder metal steel connecting rods which are highly machined to an optimized geometry for increased strength while eliminating unnecessary reciprocating mass, 10.0:1 compression ratio, high for a forced-induction engine, enhances performance and efficiency and is enabled by direct injection, forged aluminum pistons with unique, stronger structure to ensure strength under high cylinder pressures, stainless steel exhaust manifolds for structure at higher temperatures, aluminum balancer for reduced mass, and standard dry-sump oiling system with a dual-pressure-control oil pump. The engine uses a 1.7L Eaton TVS supercharger. Although smaller than the previous 2.3l supercharger used on the sixth-gen ZR1, it spins 5000 RPM faster thus generating boost quicker while making only slightly less total boost than the LS9 engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} new type semi-solid injection process, that is, runner-less injection process. In order {{to investigate the}} effects of solid fraction on microstructure and casting defects of AZ 91 D in new type semi solid injection process, semi-solid forming testing machine which has the same system as a runner-less injection machine has been made on an experimental basis. Its temperature controlling system has been established to obtain the homogeneous solid-liquid coexisted state in its <b>injection</b> <b>cylinder.</b> AZ 91 D billets are injected into a permanent mold by this machine in the semi-solid state. A shearing {{in the part of}} nozzle of <b>injection</b> <b>cylinder</b> is the most important to reveal thixotropic property of alloy slurry in semi solid forming process by injection machine. So it needs controlling of solid fraction to affect thixotropic property. In order to decrease casting defects and hold homogeneous structure, solid fraction more over 50 % is needed. But when the solid fraction increases more than 50 %, primary solid particles grow coarser, and then controlling method is required to suppress coarsening. In the case of less than 50 % of solid fraction, liquid part preferentially fills inside the permanent mold and alloy slurry continue to fill the mold behind alloy liquid. Then large casting defects form at the boundary of both flows...|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{injection}} temperature on {{thermal degradation}} and porosity of the bagasse/polypropylene injection molding composites were studied. Above 185 ºC, incomplete filling occurred. The incomplete filling increased with increase of injection temperature.

A modified injection method with the venting of gas increased the complete filling percentage. Mechanical properties decreased with increase of injection temperature from 165 ºC to 260 ºC. This was due to increase of porosity and fiber shortening. The calculated flexural modulus, which incorporated the effect of porosity and fiber length, agreed well with the experimental results. Composites with maleic acid anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) were also investigated. Flexural strength and impact strength were improved by 45 % and 35 %, respectively, by addition of 20 wt% MAPP.
