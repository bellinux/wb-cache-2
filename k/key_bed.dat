50|$|In geology, a <b>key</b> <b>bed</b> (syn marker bed) is a {{relatively}} thin layer of sedimentary rock that is readily recognized {{on the basis of}} either its distinct physical characteristics or fossil content and can be mapped over a very large geographic area. As a result, a <b>key</b> <b>bed</b> is useful for correlating sequences of sedimentary rocks over a large area. Typically, key beds were created as the result of either instantaneous events or (geologically speaking) very short episodes of the widespread deposition of a specific types of sediment. As the result, key beds often can be used for both mapping and correlating sedimentary rocks and dating them. Volcanic ash beds (tonsteins and bentonite beds) and impact spherule beds, and specific megaturbidites are types of key beds created by instantaneous events. The widespread accumulation of distinctive sediments over a geologically short period of time have created key beds in the form of peat beds, coal beds, shell beds, marine bands, black shales in cyclothems, and oil shales. A well-known example of a <b>key</b> <b>bed</b> is the global layer of iridium-rich impact ejecta that marks the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (K-T boundary).|$|E

The analyses include petrography, XRD and size analysis using laser particle sizing. Core analysis of the sequence shows that it is composed of shaly limestone, limy shale, carbonate cemented sandstones, shale and oolitic ironstones from bottom to top. The dominant minerals of these deposits at the upper part are goethite, phosphate, calcite, clay minerals and siderite. These analyses showed that the studied ooids were deposited in a shallow marine environment with bidirectional currents and occasional storms. Lack of limestone relics, the presence of marine ooids, change in iron minerals from siderite to goethite in sediment sequence from bottom to top and high roundness and symmetry of grains confirms such environment.

The younger ash bed, sampled at Mosciano S.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Apart from Bouma sequences, {{recurrent}} {{patterns of}} sedimentation can be recognized at two hierarchic levels in turbidite formations {{of the northern}} Apennines. First order cycles (turbidite suites) encompass most of the basin fill, second order cycles (megaseqttenees) occur as organized groups of beds 2 - 70 m thick within the suites. The Marnoso-arenacea (Lower-Upper Miocene) {{is an example of}} a progradational or offlapping suite with thickening and coarsening upward trend. The Laga Formation (Upper Miocene-Lower Pliocene) is characterized by a "transgressive " (retrogradational) or on-lapping trend. Vertical facies changes go eitlier way through the following steps: basin plain ~ outer fan ~ midfan ~ inner fan ~ slope deposits (- ~ = prograding, ~- = re-ceding). Both suites are enclosed by hemipelagie pelites and chaotic deposits, the start of turbidite sedimentation being gradual in the progradational case, and abrupt (large scale erosion) in the reverse one.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves [120]- 122 Folded map in pocket (missing 9 / 1 / 83) The Miocene Alverson Formation {{represents}} {{the most extensive}} Neogene volcanism along the western boundary of the Salton Trough. The formation occurs from the U. S. A. -Mexican border north to the Fish Creek Mountains as small outcrops generally less than 5 square kilometers and separated by a few to tens of kilometers. These local exposures of Alverson strata have received only cursory examination until now. The stratigraphy of the Alverson volcanic strata was analyzed and columnar sections prepared for four localities: Fossil Canyon, Painted Gorge, northern Red Rock Canyon, and Superstition Mountain. At each locality the Alverson strata were divided into members, which consist {{of a series of}} lava flows, pyroclastic rocks and volcanic plugs. The volcanic strata were apparently deposited subaerially. The lava flows are dominantly aa type with locally thick flow-breccias. A major lapilli tuff deposit separates the upper and lower compound lava flows in Fossil Canyon and Painted Gorge and caps the Miocene section at Superstition Mountain. Localized agglomerate deposits occur in northern Red Rock Canyon and Painted Gorge, and are proximal to minor vents. The occurrence of volcaniclastic deposits in the stratigraphic sections of Fossil Canyon and Painted Gorge indicates quiescent intervals of the Miocene volcanism. The stratigraphic sequence indicates at least three distinct episodes of volcanism, which consist of two periods of basaltic lava separated by explosive eruption of andesitic ash flow deposits. The Alverson strata are locally underlain by either pre-Tertiary basement rocks or the Miocene Split Mountain Formation. Intertonguing of Alverson and Split Mountain strata or incorporation of volcanic clasts within the Split Mountain strata occurs locally in the area investigated. This implies that the formations are at least in part contemporary. The overlying strata may be locally the Imperial Formation, Quaternary terrace or fanglomerate deposits. All are generally discordant upon the Alverson Volcanics. Correlation of the Alverson strata was accomplished by comparisons of stratigraphic relationships and tuffaceous deposits between the areas investigated. The flows between the areas investigated were correlated as compound units (successive series of flows) with corresponding stratigraphic relationships, and not on a "one-for-one" basis. The dominant tuff deposit was used as a <b>key</b> <b>bed</b> for correlation based on distinctive lithologic and mineralogic characteristics. Radiometric dating of the volcanic rocks sampled by this writer indicate an early to middle Miocene age for the Alverson Formation (24. 8 ?? 7. 4 m. y. to 14. 9 ??. 5 m. y.). These results indicate a major difference in age between the Alverson and succeeding Pliocene Imperial strata...|$|E
40|$|The {{western part}} of Tōnō {{district}} of Gifu Prefecture is well {{known as one of}} the locality of fireclay("Kibushi" clay) in Tokai region, japan. Nakayama fireclay mine is situated in the southern part between the Toki and Tajime city. This area composed of the lower Pliocene, the Tokiguchi clay formation, which was overlaying on the Meso and/or Paleozoic and Miocene basement rocks. The Tokiguchi clay formation is assumed as non-marine sediments in concave on the basement rock. "Kibushi" clay beds are intercalated in the Tokiguchi clay formation accompanying with lignite seams and are covered by the Toki gravel formation as a role of cap rock. The writers have been carried out the mapping of the cross section of mine at main six portions. In order to identified the formation of ore deposit, the distribution state of "Kibushi" clay beds are considered to be controlled by the paleo-topography of basement rocks, and are the most useful <b>key</b> <b>bed</b> for sedimentary process. Three "Kibushi" clay beds occur associated with lignite seams in this mine. The lower layer distributed at only the northern part of the area. The middle layer is distributed over the area extending mostly along the valley of west to east direction. and can be observed in every profiles of ore deposit. The most workable thickness of this layer, ranging from 6 to 9 meters, are maximum in comparison with those of other two layers. The upper layer is extinguished at the southern part of the area. Further, mineralogical study of four profiles of ore deposit have been investigated, schmatically. In profile, clay formation can be classfied into the following zones from the bed rock to the surface(depth about 20 m) :bluish grey sandy clay, lower "Kibushi" clay, grey sandy clay, middle "Kibushi clay, white grey sandy clay, upper" Kibushi clay and grey sandy clay. The uppermost zone is covered by the gravel zone. In general, the sandy clay predominate in the deposit, as a whole. The clay formation is chiefly composed of kaolinite and fine grained quartz accompanying small amounts of feldespar. Moreover, most of clayey materials contain a little quantity of montmorillonite and illite. These mineral assemblages in this mine are similar to that of other "Kibushi" clay deposits. However, montmorillonite is assumed to be derived from other source materials. On the other hand, general inclination of paleo-topography of basement in this area trend toward the western side, therefore, residual substances originating from weathered granite were transported from the eastern side area. The white clay bed (about 20 cm in thickness) occurs at a specific horaizon in the upper sandy zone. This clay is named "Shinmei kaolin" which consists of halloysite. This was probably formed diagenetically from volcanic ash. 岐阜県中山鉱山地域の陶土層は中・古生層および中新統を基盤とする凹地に土岐口陶土層が堆積したものである。陶土層の胚胎状況は基盤の古地形に支配されるもののようで、基盤の地形を基に鉱床断面図を作成した。鉱体の木節粘土は 3 層準分布しており、当中山鉱山周辺ではその下部層は層厚約 4 m、北部のみに分布しほとんど連続しないが、中部層は比較的良く連続し、層厚は最大 6 m、西部で薄くなる。上部層は北東から南西にかけて分布し層厚は約 4 mを示す。また本地域の基盤は西に下る傾向をなすことから、当陶土層の供給物は東から運ばれたことがわかる。一方鉱床プロファイルは下位から上位にかけて、砂質粘土、木節粘土層、砂礫層からなる。木節粘土層は亜炭層を同層準間に挾み 3 層分布する。陶土層を構成する主な鉱物はカオリン、石英で少量の長石を含み、モンモリロナイト、イライトがかなり普遍的に含まれる。また本鉱床には“神明カオリン”とよばれる白色粘土層を産出するが、この粘土の構成鉱物はハロイサイトである。なお粘土層のカオリナイトは不整が著しくまた結晶度も悪く、指数値は他地域の同型堆積性鉱床のものとほとんど同じ範囲内にある...|$|E
40|$|The {{system of}} stratigraphic {{classification}} used in North America for all sedimentary rock units except nonmarine deposits of the Pleistocene Series established groups, formations, and smaller units based on objectively determined {{characteristics of the}} rocks and not on geomorphology or subjective features, such as geologic time. Not all students of the nonmarine Pleistocene have kept these two kinds of units distinct from each other. The Pleistocene sediments of Indiana and the surrounding States are continental in origin rather than marine, and thus they show far less lithologic homogeneity than sediments and rocks of marine origin. Nevertheless, these Pleistocene sediments {{can and should be}} grouped into logical and usable formational units by means of lithologic characteristics. A classification based on lithologic characteristics omits units that are wholly geomorphic, such as terraces, but it does not change many time-lithic units that are now shown on most surficial geologic maps. Instead, these units are given names as formations or members or are regarded as facies. Three of the six formations proposed in this study of Pleistocene sediments in Indiana, the Jessup, Trafalgar, and Lagro Formations, are composed dominantly of glacially deposited mudstone or till. These formations have upper and lower contacts that coincide with unconformities within the Pleistocene. Other unconformities permit the separation of the Jessup and Trafalgar Formations into members, named here the Cloverdale, Butlerville, Center Grove, and Cartersburg Till Members. These unconformities generally are marked by <b>key</b> <b>beds,</b> such as paleosols and thin fossiliferous beds. The remaining three units, the Prospect, Atherton, and Martinsville Formations, consist of several related lithofacies, through most of which significant unconformities are difficult or impossible to trace. This method of classification permits local names to be designated for lithostratigraphic units in the Pleistocene Series that are useful in field studies in Indiana. These units are particularly valuable for use in problems that frequently arise in correlating rocks within a finely divided time sequence. By means of a classification system for Pleistocene sediments, existing terminology of glaciations can be referred to readily and can be correlated as a kind of geologic-time stratigraphy. Fossil mollusks are found in two of the facies of the Atherton Formation and in thin beds of silt between barren mudstones in the Jessup and Trafalgar Formations. Largely because of environmental changes, the assemblages differ from unit to unit in vertical succession, but differences are slight. Three range zones based on forms of Succinea are named, in descending order, the S. vermeta, S. gelida, and S. gelida var. Range Zones. In addition, the fossiliferous parts of the <b>key</b> <b>beds</b> that separate formations and members are termed the lower, middle, and upper Hendersonia occulta beds and the Vertigo alpestris oughtoni bed...|$|R

Die Terrassen des Donjons von Chambord - ein Projekt von Leonardo da Vinci ?, von Patrick Ponsot Die Aussicht von den Terrassen von Chambord ist unvergleichlich. Ganz so, wie die Schwierigkeit, sie abzudichten. Die Restaurierungsarbeiten haben zu drei Enrdeckungen geführt. Die kassettierten Gewölbe, die die Terrassen tragen, sind Flachtonnengewolbe ans Keilsteinen, was bis dahin in Frankreich beispiellos ist. Die Pflasterung der Terrasse wurde ursprünglich von grossen, von den Gewölben unabhangigen scheitrechten Bogen getragen. Unter der Terrasse schließlich waren bis zu den drastischen Umbaumafinahmen des 17. Jahrhunderts die Gewölbe mit glasierten tegulae ummantelt. Muss man nicht in diesen konnerschaftlichen Lösungen der Renaissance ein Echo der unermüdlichen Forschungen des Leonardo da Vinci sehen, den man heute als den Urheber des Entwurfes von Chambord ansieht ? Einige Zeichen in seiner Laufbahn und seinen Skizzenbüchern legen diesen Vorschlag nahe, trotz des Abstandes von 18 Jahren, der den Tod des großen Florentiners von den Arbeiten an den Terrassen trennt.
