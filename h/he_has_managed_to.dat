5|$|The Doctor {{suspects}} that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> set back Dalek evolution by several centuries, and considers his mission complete. He {{and his companions}} say goodbye to the surviving Thals and Mutos before using the Time Ring to return to Earth and their own time.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> remain {{clean and}} sober for {{extended}} periods in recent years, Osbourne has frequently commented on his former wild lifestyle, puzzled at how he has survived 40years of drug and alcohol abuse. Upon being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Osbourne spent {{the next three months}} locked in his hotel room taking vast amounts of alcohol and other drugs all day, every day. He claims that he would certainly have died if his future wife Sharon had not offered to manage him as a solo artist.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{more people}} from dying, Tris offers herself over to Erudite and {{is placed in}} a cell by Peter and, to her shock, Caleb, {{both of whom are}} now working with Jeanine. However, Tobias follows her and ends up {{becoming}} captured, although he states that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> convince Dauntless to ally themselves with the factionless, with the upcoming insurgency scheduled several days afterward. After unsuccessful simulation tests, Jeanine orders for Tris' execution, but Peter, in return for Tris' rescue of him at the Amity sector, has swapped the serum for a paralytic serum beforehand and also frees Tobias, allowing the trio a chance to escape back to the Abnegation sector. There, Tris meets with Marcus, who tells her that Jeanine is withholding the information that Abnegation protected; should the factionless take hold of it, it would certainly be destroyed.|$|E
60|$|That night, all {{on board}} {{did nothing but}} talk about Dan Baxter and the way <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> escape.|$|R
6000|$|Chauvelin {{threw open}} the door, and before his {{secretary}} could say a word, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> stammer between two sneezes-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> bring {{before me}} vividly that terrible, {{volcanic}} flow on Versailles of the Paris mob. He put back {{the book and}} resumed his seat.|$|R
25|$|Kat briefly {{works the}} market again, but marker {{inspector}} Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) forces her off her stall when he discovers {{she is working}} and claiming maternity benefit. Alfie lies to her that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> convince the council to give them more time to rally together the money they need, but secretly plans to claim house insurance by setting fire to their house. He does so, but is unaware Kat is inside. She becomes trapped although Alfie rescues her. She is badly burnt and suffers permanent scarring to her face. On leaving hospital, she and Alfie remarry with two nurses as the only witnesses, {{before returning to the}} square and moving into a flat Alfie has organised for them to squat in. When the owners arrive, they are thrown out and Kat is angry with Alfie, although out of desperation they squat in a new flat with help from Donna. Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hanchard) calls the landlord of the flat when trying to fix the boiler, so they are evicted again and they stay at the Vic with Alfie's friend Mick Carter (Danny Dyer). After Kat makes an emotional speech to the social housing manager, they are offered a council house in Hull. Stacey tries to stop her but before they leave Kat discovers a photo of Nana that was not lost in the house. Alfie confesses that it was he who started the fire. Kat, appalled by the disclosure, insists their marriage is over and stays with Stacey and Lily.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's next release, Nashville Skyline (1969), was {{mainstream}} country featuring Nashville musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a {{duet with}} Johnny Cash, and the hit single [...] "Lay Lady Lay". Variety wrote, [...] "Dylan is definitely doing {{something that can be}} called singing. Somehow <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> add an octave to his range." [...] During one recording session, Dylan and Cash recorded a series of duets but only their version [...] of Dylan's [...] "Girl from the North Country" [...] was released on the album.|$|E
2500|$|... "In his Dorchester House chimneypiece {{he has two}} figures, {{who are in a}} {{crouching}} {{position on}} each side. They belong to the design yet are doing very little absolute work. Possibly here the wonderful sense of harmnony is gained by the splendid modelling of practically nude forms, with their evidence of vigour and great dormant strength. In this way too <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> utilise the undraped figure without any incongruity for so conspicuous a position in a room for general assembly." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Merevale {{thought that}} if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} anything else from the note he must possess a mind of no common order, {{but he did not}} say so.|$|R
50|$|Hrabal penned Too Loud a Solitude late in {{life after}} a long bout with illness and forced temperance. He claimed that the book was what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> live for.|$|R
50|$|After the war Chilton {{returned}} to practicing and teaching law; by 1870 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> recoup {{most of his}} financial losses. He was also elected Grand Master of Alabama's Masonic Grand Lodge.|$|R
2500|$|In eight Test matches since April 2012, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> score just 408 runs at {{an average}} of 31.38, with highest being 117. In six ODIs in the same period, he scored 183 runs {{at an average}} of 30.5 and was dropped for the ODI series against England. His last ODI century was the double hundred against the West Indies in December 2011. Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott had hinted that it might {{be the end of the}} road for Sehwag."I don't think he'll play again. I think it's because India have gone the right way. It took a little while to come around to it. They've given youth a chance," [...] Boycott told a cricket website.|$|E
2500|$|Patnaik is {{a writer}} and had for most part of his youth been away from both {{politics}} and Odisha, but after his father Biju Patnaik's demise, he entered politics in 1997 and a year later founded the Biju Janata Dal, named after Biju Patnaik, which won the state election with the BJP as its alliance and formed the government in which Patnaik became Chief Minister. His mild mannerism, [...] "stand against corruption" [...] and [...] "pro-poor policies" [...] have resulted {{in the development of a}} huge support base in Odisha, which has voted him to power in the last four consecutive terms. Like his father, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> control the bureaucracy and transformed it into a machine for the development of the state. He is a devotee of Lord Jagannath, Puri.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{basketball}} observers, {{in addition}} to Abdul-Jabbar, believe that Kareem's reticence, whether through disdain for the press corps or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA. In his words, {{he said he had}} a mindset he could not overcome, and proceeded through his career oblivious to the effect his reticence may have had on his future coaching prospects. Abdul-Jabbar said: [...] "I didn't understand that I also had affected people that way and that's what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I paid a price for it." [...] Since he began lobbying for a coaching position in 1995, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> obtain only low-level assistant and scouting jobs in the NBA, and a head coaching position only in a minor professional league.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Pavićević {{became the}} coach of the Chinese club Liaoning Flying Leopards, with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the playoff finals in 2014-15 season where they lost from Beijing Ducks.|$|R
60|$|One day Jacobus came {{in early}} and, beckoning {{me into the}} dining- room, wiped his brow with a weary gesture {{and told me that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> unearth a supply of quarter-bags.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} he was 63 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> drop his weight down from 320 pounds to 185. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery at the Clovis Community Medical Center in Fresno, California.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{very fine}} living," [...] said she; [...] "very fine. I don't {{remember}} that we have anything so good ourselves,--except it is Plumstead, the archdeacon's place. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> butter his bread pretty well." ...|$|E
60|$|Just at {{this moment}} some unfortunate {{individual}} appears, with a very smirking air, {{at the bottom of}} the long passage. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> elude the vigilance of the special constable downstairs, and is evidently congratulating himself on having made his way so far.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I know him; {{he comes}} from County Mayo--his property's close to mine; that is, the patch of rocks and cabins--which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{mortgage}} three times over, and each time for more than its value--which he still calls the O'Leary estate." ...|$|E
60|$|Schomberg {{received}} this turn of temper unmoved. He {{did not require}} to be very subtly observant <b>to</b> notice that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> arouse some sort of feeling, perhaps of greed, in Ricardo's breast.|$|R
50|$|Kim Jae-duck {{surprised}} many {{viewers and}} fans with his amazing dancing skills and rap that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> preserve {{for more than}} 20 years. He received more invitation after reunion and joined different activities.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} contended that Semmelweis {{could have had}} an even greater impact if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{communicate}} his findings more effectively and avoid antagonising the medical establishment, even given the opposition from entrenched viewpoints.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> get a sparrow, and {{has already}} {{partially}} tamed it. His means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food.|$|E
6000|$|Late in {{the cold}} weather, the Collector and his wife came into the Buria Kol country. 'Go and look at Krenk's Mission' said Gallio. 'He is doing good work in his own way, and I think he'd be pleased if you opened the bamboo chapel that <b>he,</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> run up. At any rate you'll see a civilised Buria Kol.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Mertons! Why, certainly; {{established}} in the land, and among its tip-top people. The Colonel finds his health benefited by the climate, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> get some appointment which keeps him among us. He has Boston relatives, moreover, and I believe is fishing up some claims to property in that quarter. The Mertons here, indeed! what would New York be without the Mertons!" ...|$|E
50|$|In 1996, {{after six}} years of {{apprenticeship}} with P-5 Jewelers, he set out on his own. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> save a meager $5,000 to start a namesake brand that designs and sells fine jewelry and watches.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 2009, {{during an}} {{interview}} with NCRV, Bakker stated that it was thanks to his clinic that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> introduce the Twelve-Step Program in the Netherlands, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> followed himself in Scotland.|$|R
50|$|His nephew, Joachim Conan (son of Thibaud and Catherine Geraud) is coseigneur Connezac and Beauvais. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{escape the}} family Faure land of his {{ancestors}} {{to move to another}} place, which he would build his main residence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is what {{my father}} used to say of amusements--the instant they become passions they grow unclerical and do mischief. Now he used, though not getting on with the Curtises, to be most {{successful}} with the second-rate people; but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> offend half of them during this unhappy mania, which, of course, they all resent as mercenary, and how he is ever to win them back I don't know. After all, curatocult is a shallow motive--Rachel Curtis might triumph!" ...|$|E
6000|$|All crowded {{round to}} examine the arrow, and then Mr. Hardy said solemnly, [...] "Thank God for his mercy, He has decided our way now. Undoubtedly, as Hubert says, {{one of the men}} we aided is of the party, and wishes to show his gratitude. So <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> get a piece of Ethel's dress, and has tied it to this arrow, hoping that we should {{recognize}} the feather. Thank God, there is no more doubt, and thank Him, too, that Ethel has at least one friend near her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear,' {{the doctor}} would answer apologetically, 'you're really quite too hard upon young Le Breton. As far as school-work goes, he's a capital master, I assure you--so conscientious, and hard-working, and systematic. He does his very best with the boys, {{even with that}} stupid lout, Blenkinsopp major; and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> din {{something}} into them in mathematics somehow, so that I'm sure the fifth form will pass a better examination this term than any term since we first came here. Now that, you know, is really a great thing, even if he doesn't quite fall in with our preconceived social requirements.' ...|$|E
60|$|With all {{his other}} labors <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> find time, {{since the last}} trip, to repair the harness and to {{strengthen}} his sledge, {{so that when the}} deer came to him at twilight <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no difficulty in harnessing them.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} Saxo's {{report that the}} {{inscription}} was illegible {{as early as the}} 12th century, the Danish physician and antiquary Ole Worm declared in the 17th century that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> read four letters in the description: Lund.|$|R
