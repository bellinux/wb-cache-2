LeMond suffered a concussion and was left with no memory of the incident. According to Associated Press, a Plymouth police report says LeMond left the road, hit a fence and shrubs, and then hit an embankment before ending up in the backyard of a home. LeMond may have lost consciousness before the accident, according to his wife Kathy, and he suffered a compression fracture in his back and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> brace for three months. The accident curtailed LeMond's public appearances {{in the first half of}} 2013, but he made a full recovery.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia {{requires}} Muslim {{women to}} cover their hair and all women <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> full-body garment. Saudi women commonly wear the traditional abaya robe, while foreigners sometimes opt for a long coat. These regulations are enforced by the religious police and vigilantes. In 2002 the Saudi religious police were accused by Saudi and international press of hindering the rescue of schoolgirls from a fire {{because they were not}} wearing hijab, which resulted in 15 deaths.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 1995, Grunge {{had faced}} Richards, with a pre-match {{stipulation}} {{stating that the}} loser would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> dress. Grunge won, meaning Richards was forced to wear the dress. Grunge would team up with partner Rocco Rock to form The Public Enemy, as they defeated Richards and Raven on November 3. The following night, Grunge's team would keep the advantage, as partners The Pitbulls and Tommy Dreamer defeated Cactus Jack, Raven and Richards in a Six-Man Tag Team match. In a preview for December to Dismember, The Pitbulls faced The Eliminators at November to Remember. The Pitbulls {{would go on to}} win the match after Kronus was pinned. The Eliminators got their revenge on November 25, winning in their return match against The Pitbulls. Raven would also face Tommy Dreamer on November 25, but in a Death Match, which Raven won. This eventually led to the Ultimate Jeopardy Steel Cage match at December to Dismember.|$|E

The Austrian Emperor decreed that the members <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> special uniform; this made it the only Polish parliament-like body in the history of Polish politics with a dress code requirement.|$|E

Hergé later recalled: [...] "I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star, but finally I did see some. They told me that some Jews were gone; that people had come for them and sent them away.

2500|$|Given his {{commitment}} to college, he was not drafted until the 9th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft, when he was picked by the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox signed him, for $600,000—an amount that was consistent with what second-round draft prospects received, but well over the norm for a 9th-rounder. [...] Major League Baseball's Commissioner's Office held up his signing initially, {{as the amount of}} money exceeded his draft slot, but approved it by late August. [...] The signing was not without other problems, however. [...] Kalish explained: [...] "My girlfriend, but especially her dad, are Yankees fans. It was brutal.

2500|$|All {{respirators}} {{have some}} type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method. The facepiece of the respirator covers either the entire face or {{the bottom half of the}} face including the nose and mouth. Half-face respirators can only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is painting an object with spray paint could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with chlorine gas would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> full-face respirator. Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The [...] differences in respirator design impact the respirator assigned protection factors, ie the resulting degree of protection which kind of hazard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tendency}} of still wine from the Champagne region to lightly sparkle was {{noted in the}} Middle Ages but this was considered a wine fault and was disdained in early Champagne winemaking although it made the pride of other historic sparkling wine production areas like Limoux. Dom Pérignon was originally charged by his superiors at the Abbey of Hautvillers {{to get rid of}} the bubbles since the pressure in the bottles caused many of them to burst in the cellar. Later, when deliberate sparkling wine production increased in the early 18th century, cellar workers would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> heavy iron mask that resembled a baseball catcher's mask to prevent injury from spontaneously bursting bottles. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The mysterious circumstance surrounding the then unknown process of fermentation and carbonic gas caused some critics to call the sparkling creations [...] "The Devil's Wine".|$|E

2500|$|Even though Muslim {{women are}} {{forbidden}} to marry non-Muslims in Islamic law, from 1880 to 1949 it was frequently violated in Xinjiang when Chinese men married Muslim Uyghur women. A reason for this, suggested by foreigners, {{is that even though}} Uyghur women who married Chinese men were labelled as whores by the Uyghur community, the women obtained benefits from marrying Chinese men as the Chinese protected them from Islamic authorities, meaning that the women were not subjected to the tax on prostitution and were able to save their incomes for themselves. Chinese men gave their Uyghur wives privileges which Uyghur men's wives did not have, e.g. the wives of Chinese men did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> veil and a Chinese man in Kashgar once beat a mullah who tried to force his Uyghur wife to veil. The Uyghur women also were not subjected to any legal binding to their Chinese husbands. This meant that they could force their Chinese husbands provide them with as much money as they wanted for their families by threatening to leave them. Additionally, the property of Chinese men was left to their Uyghur wives after they died. Uyghur women considered Uyghur men to be inferior husbands to Chinese and Hindus. Because they were viewed as [...] "impure", Islamic cemeteries banned the Uyghur wives of Chinese men from being buried within them. Uyghur women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns. Besides Chinese men, other men such as Hindus, Armenians, Jews, Russians, and Badakhshanis (Pamiris) intermarried with local Uyghur women. The local society accepted the Uyghur women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages being in violation of Islamic law. Uyghur women also conducted temporary marriages with Chinese soldiers temporarily stationed in the area for tours of duty. Once the soldiers' tours of duties ended, they returned to their own cities and often sold their mixed daughters with Uyghur women to their comrades. If they could afford it, the soldiers would take their mixed sons back to their own cities but would leave them behind if they couldn't. The soldiers typically sold their temporary Uyghur wives to comrades or simply left them behind.|$|E
2500|$|Even though Muslim {{women are}} {{forbidden}} to marry non-Muslims in Islamic law, from 1880-1949 it was frequently violated in Xinjiang since Chinese men married Muslim Turki (Uyghur) women, a reason suggested by foriengers that {{it was due to}} the women being poor, while the Turki women who married Chinese were labelled as whores by the Turki community, these marriages were illegitimate according to Islamic law but the women obtained benefits from marrying Chinese men since the Chinese defended them from Islamic authorities so the women were not subjected to the tax on prostitution and were able to save their income for themselves. Chinese men gave their Turki wives privileges which Turki men's wives did not have, since the wives of Chinese did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> veil and a Chinese man in Kashgar once beat a mullah who tried to force his Turki Kashgari wife to veil. The Turki women also benefited in that they were not subjected to any legal binding to their Chinese husbands so they could make their Chinese husbands provide them with as much their money as she wanted for her relatives and herself since otherwise the women could just leave, and the property of Chinese men was left to their Turki wives after they died. Turki women considered Turki men to be inferior husbands to Chinese and Hindus. Because they were viewed as [...] "impure", Islamic cemeteries banned the Turki wives of Chinese men from being buried within them, the Turki women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns. Besides Chinese men, other men such as Hindus, Armenians, Jews, Russians, and Badakhshanis intermarried with local Turki women. The local society accepted the Turki women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages being in violation of Islamic law. Turki women also conducted temporary marriages with Chinese men such as Chinese soldiers temporarily stationed around them as soldiers for tours of duty, after which the Chinese men returned to their own cities, with the Chinese men selling their mixed daughters with the Turki women to his comrades, taking their sons with them if they could afford it but leaving them if they couldn't, and selling their temporary Turki wife to a comrade or leaving her behind. The basic formalities of normal marriages were maintained as a facade even in temporary marriages. Prostitution by Turki women due to the buying of daughters from impoverished families and divorced women was recorded by Scotsman George Hunter. Mullahs officiated temporary marriages and both the divorce and the marriage proceedings were undertaken by the mullah at the same ceremony if the marriage was only to last for a certain arranged time and there was a temporary marriage bazaar in Yangi Hissar according to Nazaroff. Islamic law was being violated by the temporary marriages which particularly violated Sunni Islam.|$|E
