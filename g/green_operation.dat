40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on {{investigating}} and benchmarking <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> initiatives in the automotive industry documented in the environmental reports of selected companies. The investigation roadmaps the main environmental initiatives taken by the world's three major car manufacturers and benchmarks them against each other. The categorisation of <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> initiatives that is provided in the paper can also help companies in other sectors to evaluate their green practices. Design/methodology/approach: The first part of the paper is based on existing literature on the topic of <b>green</b> and sustainable <b>operations</b> and the "unsustainable" context of automotive production. The second part relates to the roadmap and benchmarking of <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> initiatives based on an analysis of secondary data from the automotive industry. Findings: The findings show that the world's three major car manufacturers are pursuing various environmental initiatives involving the following <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> practices: <b>green</b> buildings, eco-design, green supply chains, green manufacturing, reverse logistics and innovation. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this paper start from its selection of the companies, which was made using production volume and country of origin as the principal criteria. There is ample evidence that other, smaller, companies are pursuing more sophisticated and original environmental initiatives. Also, there might be a gap between what companies say they do in their environmental reports and what they actually do. Practical implications: This paper helps practitioners in the automotive industry to benchmark themselves against the major volume manufacturers in three different continents. Practitioners from other industries will also find it valuable to discover how the automotive industry is pursuing environmental initiatives beyond manufacturing, apart from the <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> practices covering broadly all the activities of operations function. Originality/value: The originality of the paper is in its up-to-date analysis of environmental reports of automotive companies. The paper offers value for researchers and practitioners due to its contribution to the <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> literature.

30|$|In this article, {{a review}} of the Green Computing {{paradigm}} was presented with a focus on emerging IT technologies. Cloud computing, mobile computing, big data analytics, IoT, and software-based networks were identified as the emerging IT technologies driving the current popularity of the IT industry. The demand and social integration of IT technologies is increasing rapidly, hence, increasing the energy consumption. With a renewed focus on the global energy crisis, IT researchers and practitioners have proposed and implemented several algorithms and protocols for the <b>green</b> <b>operation</b> of the IT industry. These algorithms and protocols implement mechanisms such as idle sleep states, energy-aware decision making, and resource scheduling. However, minimizing the energy consumption of a system significantly affects its performance parameters. The energy optimization level for a device highly depends on the use case of the application. Aggressive energy minimization policies effect system durability due to frequent power off and on system routines.|$|E

40|$|As a {{flexible}} and scalable architecture, heterogeneous cloud radio access networks (H-CRANs) inject strong vigor {{into the green}} evolution of current wireless networks. But the brutal truth is that energy efficiency (EE) improves {{at the cost of}} other indexes such as spectral efficiency (SE), fairness, and delay. It is thus important to investigate performance tradeoffs for striking flexible balances between energy-efficient transmission and excellent quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees under this new architecture. In this article, we first propose some potential techniques to energy-efficiently operate H-CRANs by exploiting their features. We then elaborate the initial ideas of modeling three fundamental tradeoffs, namely EE-SE, EE-fairness, and EE-delay tradeoffs, when applying these green techniques, and present open issues and challenges for future investigations. These related results are expected to shed light on <b>green</b> <b>operation</b> of H-CRANs from adaptive resource allocation, intelligent network control, and scalable network planning.

40|$|Purpose: Sustainable {{operations}} are increasingly part of firms’ competitive strategies. Research widely investigates {{the relationship between}} sustainable operations and competitive advantage, considering financial performance as a dependent variable, and shows controversial results. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to operationalize competitive advantage as internal and external intangible benefits, such as human resource (HR) and customer benefits. HR benefits concern the deployment of a workforce pursuing a firm’s goals and strategy; customer benefits concern the improvement of a firm’s relationship with its customers. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical results are provided in an analysis of data from a survey conducted on a sample of 107 Italian firms in the food industry. A single industry and country are selected to avoid possible differences in regulations and in operations processes. Structural equation modelling is used to test hypotheses relating sustainable operations to HR and customer benefits. Findings: The authors distinguish between <b>green</b> and social <b>operations</b> practices. <b>Green</b> <b>operations</b> practices directly impact customer benefits but not HR benefits. Social sustainable operations practices do not directly impact customer benefits but instead have a direct impact on HR benefits. Hence, through HR benefits, they have an indirect impact on customer benefits. Practical implications: The authors provide results showing to operations managers that both <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> and social {{operations are}} crucial to obtaining customer benefits. Social operations do this by enhancing HR benefits. <b>Green</b> <b>operations</b> instead are not positively related to HR benefits. Originality/value: This research serves as an original contribution to the sustainable operations literature in two ways.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} more {{profound}} discussion of the philosophical underpins of sustainability than currently exists in the MOT literature and considers their influence {{on the construction of}} the theories on <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> and technology management. Ultimately, it also debates the link between theory and practice on this subject area. The paper is derived from insights gained in three research projects completed during the past twelve years, primarily involving the first author. From 2000 to 2002, an investigation using scenario analysis, aimed at reducing atmospheric pollution in urban centres by substituting natural gas for petrol and diesel, provided the first set of insights about public policy, environmental impacts, investment analysis, and technological feasibility. The second research project, from 2003 to 2005, using a survey questionnaire, was aimed at improving environmental performance in livestock farming and explored the issues of green supply chain scope, environmental strategy and priorities. Finally, the third project, from 2006 to 2011, investigated environmental decisions in manufacturing organisations through case study research and examined the underlying sustainability drivers and decision-making processes. By integrating the findings and conclusions from these projects, the link between philosophy, theory, and practice of <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> and technology management is debated. The findings from all these studies show that the philosophical debate seems to have little influence on theory building so far. For instance, although ‘sustainable development’ emphasises ‘meeting the needs of current and future generation’, no theory links essentiality and environmental impacts. Likewise, there is a weak link between theory and the practical issues of <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> and technology management. For example, the well-known ‘life-cycle analysis’ has little application in many cases because the life cycle of products these days is dispersed within global production and consumption systems and there are different stakeholders for each life cycle stage. The results from this paper are relevant to public policy making and corporate environmental strategy and decision making. Most of the past and current studies in the subject of <b>green</b> <b>operations</b> and sustainability management deal with only a single sustainability dimension at any one time. Here the value and originality of this paper lies in its integration between philosophy, theory, and practice of <b>green</b> technology and <b>operations</b> management...|$|R

40|$|We {{experience}} a major paradigm change in mobile networks. The infrastructure of cellular networks becomes mobile {{as it is}} densified by using mobile and nomadic small cells to increase coverage and capacity. Furthermore, the innovative approaches such as <b>green</b> <b>operation</b> through sleep scheduling, user-controlled small cells, and end-to-end slicing will make the network highly dynamic. Mobile cells, while bringing many benefits, introduce many unconventional challenges that we present in this paper. We have to introduce novel techniques for adapting network functions, communication protocols and their parameters to network density. Especially when cells on wheels or wings are considered, static and man-made configurations will waste valuable resources such as spectrum or energy if density is not considered as an optimization parameter. In this paper, we present the existing density estimators. We analyze the impact of density on coverage, interference, mobility management, scalability, capacity, caching, routing protocols and energy consumption.

40|$|Biocatalytic {{membranes}} {{are promising}} to remove micro-pollutants in aqueous environment {{due to their}} mild and <b>green</b> <b>operation</b> condition. However, more efforts need to be devoted to improving their removal efficiency and stability. In this study, metal chelating affinity membrane chromatography (MCAMC) was used to construct a biocatalytic membrane by selectively capturing laccase from a crude fermentation broth. Metal ions {{had a significant effect}} on the activity of the immobilized laccase and copper ion was the best choice. A pH of 4. 5 was selected for laccase adsorption and its loading seemed the same under flow rates from 0. 5 to 10 mL min(- 1) thanks to the inherent convective transport of membrane chromatography. The pH value and salt concentration in the storage buffer had an obvious effect on the stability of the immobilized laccase, and the prepared biocatalytic membrane retained 87 % of initial activity after 20 days storage. When applying such membrane to micro-pollutant removal (taking bisphenol A (BPA) as an example), a high BPA removal efficiency (99. 3 %) could be obtained. The biocatalytic membranes could be operated at a high flux of 50 L m(- 2) h(- 1) without recycling the permeate into the feed, and its throughput and BPA removal rate were superior to the most results in the literature. However, BPA removal decline (from 99. 6 % to 56. 6 % after five cycles) occurred during the successive water treatment due to the membrane fouling caused by BPA polymerization products. Membrane regeneration could be achieved by simple elution-cleaning-reloading, and the laccase activity and BPA removal were fully recovered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
