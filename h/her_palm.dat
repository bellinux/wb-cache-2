Rothenburg then dies of her injuries.|$|E
25|$|In a prologue set in Paris in {{the year}} 1921, a young 14-year-old Gilda Bessé, the {{daughter}} of a French aristocrat and an emotionally unstable American mother, reluctantly is told by a fortune teller that the life line on <b>her</b> <b>palm</b> doesn't extend past the age of 34. Fast forward to a rainy night in 1933, when Gilda stumbles into the room of Guy Malyon, an Irishman who is a first-year scholarship student at Cambridge University. She has had a lover's quarrel with one of the dons, and rather than turn her out into the storm, Guy gallantly allows her to spend the night. Later, they become lovers, but the two are separated when Gilda's mother dies and she opts to leave England. A few years later, Guy sees her as an extra in a Hollywood film, and shortly after he coincidentally receives a letter from her inviting him to visit her in Paris, where she's working as a photographer.|$|E
500|$|Andula strikes up a flirtation with Milda, the big-city pianist of {{the band}} {{providing}} the music. He reads <b>her</b> <b>palm</b> and instructs her in how to rebuff unwanted advances with {{a kick in the}} shins. After the party she goes to bed with Milda, although the comic frustrations continue, with Milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won't close, before he feels secure in making love. Afterward, as they lie in bed together, Andula asks what Milda meant when he said she was [...] "angular". He replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar: [...] "And you, you look like a guitar too", he tells her, [...] "but one painted by Picasso." [...] Before they part, he offhandedly invites her to come to Prague and pay him a visit sometime.|$|E

500|$|The video later {{shifts to}} a night scene on a {{building}} rooftop, where half of Gaga's body is inside a car, while her legs protrude {{from the window}} and onto the roof of the car. She has blonde hair and wears a black plastic leather outfit. She gets her full body into the car, kissing a [...] "Marry the Night" [...] tape and inserting it into the audio player. The song begins playing as Gaga smokes on the driver's seat. As the chorus begins, vehicles in the background explode aflame and Gaga exits the car and dances. In a new dance studio setting as the second verse begins, Gaga enters with her dancers, and warms up to do an intricate choreography during the chorus with her team. During the bridge, she and her dance team take a break and warm up to perform another choreography. The rooftop car parking scene and a bath scene intersperse. Gaga and her dancers repeat the choreography [...] during the final chorus, as one dancers falls and is helped up by Gaga. During the breakdown, Gaga and her team dance on a street while interspersing scenes show her causing chaos, including falling down the stairs, attempting to get into a car with a ridiculously oversized hat and pouring water over herself with a marble plant pot in the bath. She enters a car and reveals [...] "Interscope Records; Hollywood, CA; 4p.m." [...] written on <b>her</b> <b>palm.</b> The last scene shows Gaga in couture and surrounded by flames. The video ends with Gaga suddenly vanishing.|$|E
2500|$|In {{southern}} California, {{her father}} owned an automobile dealership with Hal Roach, an American {{film and television}} producer and director. Dixon claimed that {{while growing up in}} California, a [...] "gypsy" [...] gave her a crystal ball and read <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> predicting she would become a famous seer and advise powerful people. She was married to James Dixon, who had been previously divorced, from 1939 until his death. The couple had no children. James Dixon was a car dealer in California, who later ran a successful real estate company in Washington, D.C. Dixon worked with her husband in the business for many years and served as the company's president.|$|E
2500|$|The Victory at Jülich {{shows the}} only {{military}} {{event that the}} Queen participated in during her regency: the return of Jülich (or Juliers in French) to the Protestant princes. Being a crossing of Ruhr, Juliers was of great strategic importance for France and thus the French victory was chosen to be the glorious subject of Rubens' painting. [...] The scene is rich with symbolism highlighting her heroism and victory. [...] The Queen thrusts her arm high with an assembler's baton in hand. In {{the upper part of}} the image Victoria appears crowning her with laurel leaves which is a symbol of victory. Also symbolizing victory is the imperial eagle which can be seen in the distance. The eagle in the sky compels the weaker birds to flee. The Queen is accompanied by a womanly embodiment of what was once thought to be, Fortitude because of the lion beside her. However, the figure is Magnanimity, also referred to as Generosity, because of the riches held in <b>her</b> <b>palm.</b> One of the pieces in her hand is the Queen's treasured strand of pearls. [...] Other figures include Fame and the personification of Austria with her lion. Fame in the right side of the painting pushes air through the trumpet so powerfully that a burst of smoke comes out. In the painting Marie de’ Medici is highly decorated and triumphant after the collapse of a city, she is depicted across a white stallion to demonstrate that, like the departed King [...] Henry IV, she could triumph over rivals in warfare.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Cheong, {{considers}} {{his wife}} to be [...] "completely unremarkable in any way". He explains that when he first met her, he was not even attracted to her and that suits him just fine. Mr. Cheong is content meandering through life; {{it seems as if}} his only goal is to live a conventional, unremarkable life. He chooses to marry his wife since he thinks she would prove to be a good, dutiful wife who would fit nicely into the kind of lifestyle he seeks. [...] After several years of relatively normal marriage, Mr. Cheong wakes up to find his wife disposing of all meat products in the house. He demands an explanation, and Yeong-hye replies vaguely that [...] "I had a dream." [...] Mr. Cheong attempts to rationalize his wife's life decision {{over the next few months}} and to deal with vegetarian meals at home, but eventually calls Yeong-hye's family and an intervention is scheduled. While around the dinner table, Yeong-hye's family attempts to convince her to eat meat; her father, who served in Vietnam and is known for his stern temperament, slaps her when she refuses. Her father then asks a reluctant Mr. Cheong and Yeong-hye's brother Yeong-ho to hold her arms while he force-feeds her a piece of pork. Yeong-hye breaks away, spits out the pork, grabs a fruit knife, and slits her wrist. The incredulous family rushes her to a hospital where she recovers and where Mr. Cheong admits to himself that she has become mentally unstable. As the section ends Yeong-hye manages to walk out of the hospital and when she is tracked down, she reveals a bird in <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> which has a [...] "predator's bite" [...] in it, and she asks [...] "Have I done something wrong?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The story follows Sakura, a 14-year-old princess who'd rather marry {{for love}} and make her own choices in life than be married away to someone she's never met. Her best friend is Asagiri, a cute female Mononoke (a tiny spirit) who she once saved from a life of slavery (unbeknownst to her, Asagiri is really a Yuki-Onna). Since birth, she's been engaged to Prince Oura. Not wanting to marry the prince after a {{precarious}} argument with Prince Oura's messenger, named Aoba, Sakura runs away but gets lost and accidentally looks at the full moon, which she was warned to never do. A man-eating demon arrives, referring to Sakura as [...] "Princess Kaguya" [...] and nearly wounds her, but Aoba and a priestess that Sakura knows named Byakuya arrive. Priestess Byakuya tells Sakura that she is in fact Princess Kaguya's granddaughter {{and is the only}} one able to destroy the demons. By drawing a pair of back-to-back crescent moons on <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> she is able to summon the mystic sword Chizakura and kill the demon. She also discovers the word “destroy” is actually her Soul Symbol (a symbol each person possesses that best represents his or her true nature). Soon after, Sakura, Asagiri, and Aoba travel to Prince Oura's estate, where it's discovered that Aoba actually is Prince Oura, explaining {{that he wanted to be}} mischievous. Of course, the two don't get along from then on, until finally while relaxing under a tree, the two finally seem to come to an understanding, and do appear to be finding the silver lining in their arranged engagement. Unfortunately, she is soon under threat of execution, as Aoba turns on her, as he's afraid that she will eventually become a demon herself, like her mother and grandmother before her. Aoba shoots an arrow through her chest and Sakura falls into a river, only to be found by a cute and sassy young ninja named Kohaku and her childhood friend Hayate, who used to be human but was accidentally turned into a frog by Kohaku (although he regains his human form during the full moon). While with Kohaku, the two form a nice friendship, and Sakura reveals that she is being hunted by Kohaku's master, who just so happens to be Aoba. Kohaku though in return admits already knowing this, and tells that she doesn't wish to harm her, and wants to protect her. The two, along with Asagiri and Hayate, soon encounter Aoba and his men, and Volume 1 ends with Sakura being affected by a youko whistle that Aoba has.|$|E

6000|$|Still in her riding habit, Paula {{sat down}} on the concrete, facing her husband, {{in the center of the}} sitting audience. Under his direction, timing her {{movements}} to his, she slapped her hands on her knees, slapped <b>her</b> <b>palms</b> together, and slapped <b>her</b> <b>palms</b> against his palms much in the fashion of the nursery game of [...] "Bean Porridge Hot." [...] Then he sang the song, which was short and which she quickly picked up, singing it with him and clapping the accent. While the air of it was orientally catchy, it was chanted slowly, almost monotonously, but it was quickly provocative of excitement to the spectators: ...|$|R

60|$|Sally looked cross for a moment, and thoughtfully {{rubbed her}} hands against her shapely hips; <b>her</b> <b>palms</b> were itching, evidently, {{to come in}} contact with Martha's rosy cheeks--but {{inherent}} good-humour prevailed, and with a pout and a shrug of the shoulders, she turned her attention to the fried potatoes.|$|R
60|$|Instead of {{answering}} her by speech, the unfortunate Countess dropped {{on her knee}} before the Queen, let her casket fall from her hand, and clasping <b>her</b> <b>palms</b> together, looked up in the Queen's face with such a mixed agony of fear and supplication, that Elizabeth was considerably affected.|$|R
