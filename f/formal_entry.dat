5|$|The {{marriage}} was unhappy from the start. A few nights following the <b>formal</b> <b>entry,</b> Marguerite Louise demanded the Tuscan crown jewels {{for her own}} personal use; Cosimo refused. The jewels that she did manage to extract from Cosimo were almost smuggled out of Tuscany by her attendants but for the efforts of Ferdinando's agents.|$|E
5|$|William and a tearful Mary {{were married}} in St James's Palace by Bishop Henry Compton on 4 November 1677. Mary {{accompanied}} her husband on a rough sea crossing back to the Netherlands later that month, after a delay of two weeks caused by bad weather. Rotterdam was inaccessible because of ice, and {{they were forced to}} land at the small village of Ter Heijde, and walk through the frosty countryside until met by coaches to take them to Huis Honselaarsdijk. On 14 December, they made a <b>formal</b> <b>entry</b> to The Hague in a grand procession.|$|E

25|$|The Entry {{began as}} a gesture of loyalty and fealty by a city to the ruler, with its origins in the adventus celebrated for Roman emperors, which were <b>formal</b> <b>entries</b> far more {{frequent}} than triumphs. The first visit by a new ruler was normally the occasion, or the first visit with a new spouse. For the capital they often merged with the Coronation festivities, and for provincial cities they replaced it, sometimes as part of a Royal Progress, or tour of major cities in a realm.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a generalization of team semantics {{which provides a}} framework for manipulationist theories of causation based on structural equation models, such as Woodward's and Pearl's; our causal teams incorporate (partial or total) information about functional dependencies that are invariant under interventions. We give a unified treatment of observational and causal aspects of causal models by isolating two operators on causal teams which correspond, respectively, to conditioning and to interventionist counterfactual implication. The evaluation of counterfactuals may involve the production of partially determined teams. We suggest a {{way of dealing with}} such cases by 1) the introduction of <b>formal</b> <b>entries</b> in causal teams, and 2) the introduction of weaker truth values (falsifiability and admissibility), for which we suggest some plausible semantical clauses. We introduce formal languages for both deterministic and probabilistic causal discourse, and study in some detail their inferential aspects. Finally, we apply our framework to the analysis of direct and total causation, and other notions of dependence and invariance...|$|R

25|$|Viceroy Mayorga {{had been}} trying to resign to return to Spain for several years. In 1783 King Charles III {{accepted}} his resignation. To reward Gálvez for his service in Guatemala, the king named him viceroy of New Spain, in spite of his age and ill health. He traveled overland to the capital, passing through Oaxaca and Puebla. Matías de Gálvez was the last viceroy to make his <b>formal</b> <b>entry</b> into Mexico City on horseback, which he did on April 28, 1783.|$|E
25|$|The Marquis {{arrived in}} Chapultepec and {{remained}} there some days before making his <b>formal</b> <b>entry</b> into Mexico City. While in Chapultepec he gave orders that no celebration was to accompany his arrival, because the treasury {{of the colony}} had been exhausted by remittances to Spain and {{the war against the}} English. However he also ordered that the 16,000 pesos intended for the celebration be used for a filigreed golden box to be sent as a present to the king. He entered Mexico City October 15, 1664, and took up his office.|$|E
25|$|He became viceroy of New Spain in 1766, in {{succession}} to Joaquín de Montserrat, who had clashed with visitador (inspector) José de Gálvez. He arrived in Veracruz on July 10, 1766. The transfer of power occurred at Otumba, en route to Mexico City, on August 23, 1766, but his term of office is usually dated from his <b>formal</b> <b>entry</b> into Mexico City two days later. His nephew, Teodoro de Croix, future Commandant General of the Provincias Internas and Viceroy of Peru, arrived in his retinue as Captain of the Viceroy's Guard.|$|E

50|$|Starting in 1932, Sawyer {{designed}} {{over two}} dozen residential and farm buildings for Point Farm, {{the estate of}} career diplomat Jefferson Patterson in Calvert County, Maryland. Her designs include a main house in Colonial Revival style with such elements as a <b>formal</b> pillared <b>entry,</b> side porch, and classical moldings in the interior. She enlisted Rose Greely to design the landscaping. The Patterson estate was later given to the state by Patterson's widow and turned into the 560-acre Jefferson Patterson Park & Museum.|$|R

25|$|An early French {{supporter}} of American independence, Beaumarchais lobbied the French government {{on behalf of}} the American rebels during the American War of Independence. Beaumarchais oversaw covert aid from the French and Spanish governments to supply arms and financial assistance to the rebels in the years before France's <b>formal</b> <b>entry</b> into the war in 1778. He later struggled to recover money he had personally invested in the scheme. Beaumarchais was also a participant {{in the early stages of}} the French Revolution. He is probably best known, however, for his theatrical works, especially the three Figaro plays.|$|E
25|$|On February 26, 1585 Philip {{named him}} viceroy of New Spain to succeed Pedro Moya de Contreras. At this time Manrique de Zúñiga {{had lived for}} several years in Seville, where he had gained {{indirect}} experience with the Indies. In his case, the king made the choice personally, {{rather than relying on}} the recommendation of the Council of the Indies, as was the case ordinarily. He remained in Spain for a few months before leaving for the New World. He arrived in San Juan de Ulúa (Veracruz) on September 7, 1585, with his wife. Shortly thereafter he made his <b>formal</b> <b>entry</b> into Mexico City to take up his office.|$|E
25|$|Portugal {{participated in}} World War I {{on the side}} of the Allies. The Portuguese Army would engaged in combat against the Germans in the European Western Front, in the South-West Africa and in the East Africa campaigns. The {{conflict}} between Portugal and Germany started well before the formal declaration of war between the two countries when several military clashes between Portuguese and German troops occurred in the borders of southern Angola with German West Africa and of northern Mozambique with German East Africa in the middle of 1914. The <b>formal</b> <b>entry</b> in the war would only occur when Germany declared war on Portugal on the 9th March 1916 in response to the Portuguese seizure of German shipping.|$|E

25|$|He {{was named}} viceroy of New Spain by Philip V in 1740 to replace Juan Antonio de Vizarrón y Eguiarreta. The Dutch {{merchant}} ship transporting him to New Spain {{was taken by}} an English frigate near Puerto Rico, but {{he was able to}} launch a boat and, together with some other passengers, avoid being captured. He did, however, lose all of his luggage, including his credentials and the royal orders and instructions, therefore, arriving in San Juan, Puerto Rico without papers. He then made his way to Veracruz, where he arrived on June 30, 1740. From Veracruz he wrote to the archbishop of Mexico, who recognized him as the new viceroy. He made his <b>formal</b> <b>entry</b> into Mexico City on August 17, 1740.|$|E
25|$|The Women's College in Brown University, {{known as}} Pembroke College, {{was founded in}} October 1891.

25|$|After {{the death}} of the great Kalhora, started the Talpur Rule. Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro's period is {{considered}} to be the Golden period in the history of Sindh. Later the Kalhora behaved as incompetent rulers and Sindh was ruined under Mian Abdun-Nabi Kalhoro. Mir Fateh Ali Khan Talpur left his capital Khudabad, the land of God and made Hyderabad his capital in 1789. Great celebrations were held in 1792 CE to mark his <b>formal</b> <b>entry</b> in the Hyderabad fort. He made the Pacco Qillo his residence and also held his courts there. Mir Fateh Ali Khan Talpur along with his three other brothers was responsible for the affairs that persisted in the city of Hyderabad in the years of their kingdom. The four were called Chār Yār, Sindhi for four friends. The rulers of Sindh were named Ameers, Arabic for leaders. A portion of the population of Khudabad migrated to the new capital, including Sonaras, Amils and Bhaibands. Those groups retained the term Khudabadi in the names of their communities as an identifier of origin.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Wal-Mart’s {{expansion into}} food retailing, focusing on its store conversion strategy via a <b>formal</b> IO <b>entry</b> framework. Forty-eight different competing model specifications {{are considered to}} determine how the company perceives competition from incumbent food retailers and how its geographic expansion pattern has influenced its store differentiation decisions over time. The results show that Supercenter openings mainly have targeted large areas with low population density and a high percentage of population receiving food stamps. The results also suggest that as the company moves toward geographic saturation of local markets, some of the strategic location decisions creating economies of density may need to be reconsidered in future years...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of what determines new firm formation in developing countries. Because of the influence that this may have on the design of firm entry policies, our main concern is whether the determinants of new firm formation are the same and/or have the same impact in developed and developing countries. We discuss arguments put forward in the literature that may support the existence of differences in the determinants of firm creation between developed and developing countries. We also analyse the results found on the determinants of <b>formal</b> firm <b>entry</b> in developing countries and compare these results with those found in developed countries. Our main conclusion is that policy makers in developing economies should be careful when using evidence from developed countries to design firm entry-promoting policies...|$|R
40|$|This {{is a new}} {{approach}} to carry out an additive index factor analysis. The novelty is, that during the decomposition of the total growth of the resulting quantity into the corresponding specific subgrowths, the structural characteristics of the extensive factor is clearly identified. The scheme of the analysis is presented closer to the reality, the factor subgrowths are specified much more easily and simply, at a much clearer <b>formal</b> external <b>entry.</b> The problems arising {{as a result of the}} decomposition of the total growth have been discussed for both types of weights – basic weight and survey weight. The differences between both types of weighting are pointed out, as well as the interrelations between them. The derived theoretical formulations are supported by the elaborated real example from the Bulgarian demographic practice. ...|$|R
