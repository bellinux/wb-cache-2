40|$|Présentation de l'éditeur : There {{are more}} than 400 million draught animals in the world. They {{significantly}} improve working conditions on smallholdings, provide for greater efficiency and productivity, and increase agricultural output. In less developed countries, much of the energy used to till the soil is provided by human manual labour. Animals complement other power sources. Draught animals are of considerable benefit {{as a source of}} appropriate renewable energy {{in a world in which}} fuel prices continue to rise. Animal power for agriculture and transport can contribute directly to poverty elimination and wealth creation. Animal traction is increasing and diversifying in many countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific, providing increasing opportunities for environmentally friendly economic development. This book reviews and builds upon previous experience and presents many long-standing and well-proven technologies. It also includes analyses of recent experiences relating to agricultural extension, animal welfare and non-governmental organisation (NGO) activities. It covers types of working animals, training, nutrition, welfare, housing and health, with detailed practical advice on <b>harnesses</b> <b>and</b> <b>yokes,</b> agricultural implements and modes of transport. It also deals with using working animals for soil management and the wider benefits associated with draught animals. Contents: 1. Working animals in the world. 2. Types of working animals. 3. Training working animals. 4. Nutrition for working animals. 5. The welfare, housing and health of working animals. 6. <b>Harnesses</b> <b>and</b> <b>yokes.</b> 7. Agricultural implements and modes of transport. 8. Working animals and soil management. 9. Wider benefits associated with working animals. 10. Making the best use of working animals in the future.

50|$|The {{singular}} prefixes of Warembori <b>and</b> <b>Yoke</b> {{are nearly}} identical to the 1sg e-, 2sg a-, 3sg i- of the Kwerba languages Kauwera and Airoran. However, Kwerba has no more basic vocabulary {{in common with the}} Lower Mamberamo family than what is expected by chance.|$|R

50|$|Each {{anterior}} semi-circular canals has excitatory projections to the ipsilateral superior {{rectus muscle}} <b>and</b> its <b>yoke</b> i.e., the contralateral inferior oblique while simultaneously inhibiting the ipsilateral inferior rectus muscle <b>and</b> its <b>yoke</b> i.e. the contralateral superior oblique. Also, each posterior semi-circular canals has excitatory projections to the ipsilateral superior oblique <b>and</b> its <b>yoke</b> i.e. the contralateral inferior rectus, while simultaneously inhibiting the ipsilateral inferior oblique <b>and</b> its <b>yoke</b> i.e. the contralateral superior rectus. A head tilt causes stimulation of both anterior semi-circular canals and the posterior semi-circular canals resulting in excitation of ipsilateral intorters (superior oblique and superior rectus) and contralateral extorters (inferior oblique and inferior rectus) while their antagonists are simultaneously inhibited. The otoliths (utricle and saccule) probably follow a similar pathway.|$|R
50|$|The two languages, Warembori <b>and</b> <b>Yoke,</b> {{were listed}} as {{isolates}} in Stephen Wurm's widely used classification. Donohue (1998) {{showed them to}} be related with shared morphological irregularities. Ross (2007) classified Warembori as an Austronesian language based on pronouns; however, Donohue argues that these are borrowed, since the two pronouns most resistant to borrowing, 'I' and 'thou', do not resemble Austronesian or any other language family. The singular prefixes resemble Kwerba languages, but Lower Mamberamo has nothing else in common with that family. (See Warembori language <b>and</b> <b>Yoke</b> language for details.) Donohue argues that they form an independent family, though one perhaps related to another Papuan family, that has been extensively relexified under Austronesian influence, {{especially in the case}} of Warembori.|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that behavioral variability can come under control of discriminative stimuli. The present experiment further examined discriminative control of variability in a novel way by using the discrimination-reversal paradigm. Eight pigeons responded under a multiple schedule of Vary <b>and</b> <b>Yoke</b> components signaled by different-colored keylights. In the Vary component, 4 -response sequences that differed from the previous 10 produced food, while in the Yoke component, any 4 -response sequence had a fixed probability of producing food, yoked to the prior Vary component. Following stability in this procedure, the key colors signaling the Vary <b>and</b> <b>Yoke</b> components were reversed across four successive conditions. Across the experiment, variability of keypeck sequences was higher in the Vary than in the Yoke component. Across successive reversals, the level of variability in the Vary component adapted more rapidly to the reversed contingencies, while the rate of adaptation in the Yoke component did not change systematically. These results are interpreted in terms of the different contingencies in the Vary <b>and</b> <b>Yoke</b> components. In addition, the improvement in the rate of adaptation across successive reversals in the Vary component appears consistent with a proactive interference account of discrimination-reversal performance. These results join others in suggesting that variability may be an operant dimension of behavior...|$|R
