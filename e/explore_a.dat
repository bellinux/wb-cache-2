5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints on possible locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} <b>explore</b> <b>a</b> broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E

5|$|Overdrive is the 19th studio album by pop punk trio Shonen Knife. It was {{released}} on April 14, 2014 in Europe, and on April 16, 2014 in Japan. According to band leader Naoko Yamano, because their album Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) had explored a more pop-oriented sound, Overdrive was {{a chance for the}} band to <b>explore</b> <b>a</b> more hard rock sound. The album's lyrics cover a wide array of topics, from green tea, fortune cookies, and cats.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} for Anachronox is turn-based; {{the player}} controls {{a party of}} up to three characters as they <b>explore</b> <b>a</b> 3D environment of futuristic cities, space vessels, and outdoor areas. Inspirations for the game include older role-playing video games such as Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy series, animator Chuck Jones and the novel Ender's Game. The game was built with a heavily {{modified version of the}} Quake II engine, rewritten chiefly to allow a wider color palette, emotive animations and facial expressions, better lighting, particle, and camera effects.|$|E
5|$|Alien: Isolation is a single-player action-adventure {{game with}} heavy {{emphasis}} on stealth and survival horror features. The player controls the protagonist, Amanda Ripley, from a first-person perspective {{to interact with the}} environment. To advance through the game, the player must <b>explore</b> <b>a</b> space station and complete numerous objectives while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating enemies. Objectives range from activating computers to collecting certain items or reaching a specific area in the game. The player has the ability to run, climb ladders, and sneak into vents. The player can also crouch and hide behind objects to break the line of sight with enemies, and covertly peek over or lean around to gain view. The player also has the ability to go under nearby tables or inside lockers to hide from enemies.|$|E
5|$|Chocobo Tales {{features}} {{a mix of}} three different types of gameplay; role-playing video game, exploration, and card battles. Players <b>explore</b> <b>a</b> 3D environment to find picture books. Upon finding them the player is transported into pop-up picture books to complete minigames and open {{the path to the}} next part of the story. The picture books take the form of Aesop's Fables and Grimm's Fairy Tales with the player character often taking the main role. Other Final Fantasy characters take up roles within the stories. More simplistic minigames, known as microgames, are also scattered throughout the world. Unlike minigames, these are not located within pop-up books, do not affect the game-world and are not required to progress in the game.|$|E

5|$|Finding {{an account}} of a World War II-era Japanese {{military}} and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon, Lara decides to <b>explore</b> <b>a</b> coastal tomb, where she finds {{the remains of a}} samurai general who committed seppuku. It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since. Her rage is what's causing the storms on the island. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom. Once the Sun Queen awakens in Sam's body, the storms will subside.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 {{closing of}} Copia, {{a group of}} investors, developers, advocates, and vintners named the Coalition to Preserve Copia was formed to <b>explore</b> <b>a</b> plan to {{preserve}} the building and grounds. Part of the group's plan included forming a Mello-Roos district with participation of local hotel properties to finance bonds to purchase the property, but their effort failed. In May 2009 local developer George Altamura spoke about his interest in purchasing the property. Other developers including the Culinary Institute of America also {{expressed an interest in}} acquiring the property. Copia's bond holder, ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation, listed the property for sale in October 2009. Napa Valley College's upper valley campus became the home of the center's library of around 1,000 cookbooks. By late 2010, local chefs had revived the center's garden and the parking lot had become the location of a weekly farmer's market. In 2011, the museum was reported to still maintain its original furnishings, with the gift store fully stocked and the restaurant still furnished. In an April 2012 auction, most of the center's fixtures, furniture, equipment, wine collection (around 3,500 bottles), dinnerware, displays, artistic items, and antiquities were sold.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Grant {{began the}} second Typhonian Trilogy with Nightside of Eden, {{in which he}} {{discussed}} {{some of his own}} personal magical ideas, outlining magical formulae with which to <b>explore</b> <b>a</b> dark, dense realm that he variously called 'Universe B' and 'the Tunnels of Set', conceived as a 'dark side' of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Grant made connections between this realm and the extramundane deities of H.P. Lovecraft's horror fiction. The book proved controversial among occultists and Thelemites, and starkly divided opinion. The sequel appeared in 1980 as Outside the Circles of Time, and introduced Grant's thoughts on the relevance of Ufology and insectoid symbolism for occultism. This would prove to be the final Grant volume published by Muller, who would merge with Blond and Briggs in 1984, while the publishing rights to his works reverted to him the following year. His next book would not appear for another eleven years after Outside the Circles of Time.|$|E
