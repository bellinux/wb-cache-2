40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} we examined a variety of strategies that consumers may use to resist persuasion towards non-profit and commercial advertising. Based on research by Jacks and Cameron (2003), we investigated seven strategies (i. e., attitude bolstering, counter arguing, negative affect, selective exposure, social validation, source <b>derogation,</b> <b>and</b> assertions of confidence) that might be effective in conferring resistance. The results demonstrate that consumers denote attitude bolstering, and social validation as strategies they would use to resist non-profit advertisements whereas selective exposure, counter arguing, source <b>derogation,</b> <b>and</b> negative affect are strategies that consumers {{are more likely to}} adopt when resisting commercial advertisements...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{longitudinal}} relationships between parent <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> family bonding in a sample of African American and non-Hispanic White males during middle school. While statistically controlling race, regression analyses indicated that parent derogation levels reported in sixth, seventh and eighth grades were statistically highly significant predictors of eighth grade family bonding. However, sixth grade parent derogation was not as strong a predictor as seventh grade parent <b>derogation,</b> <b>and</b> seventh grade was not as strong a predictor as eighth grade parent derogation. These results suggest that improving parent-child communication patterns at any point during middle school could reduce the development of problem behaviors in high school and young adulthood...|$|R

40|$|Astoundingly, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) {{does not}} contain [a] {{derogation}} clause. Furthermore, it has been established by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the Commission) {{in the case of}} Commission Nationale des Droits de l'Homme et des Libertes v Chad (Commission Nationale case) that a member state of teh ACHPR cannot derogate human rights in case of emergencies. Hence, the Commission's view may lead to a conclusion that all rights under the ACHPR are non-derogable. This raises the issue of whether it is tenable to conclude that a state facing a situation that endangers the nation, should not at all derogate from the provisions of the ACHPR. Emergency clauses, which permit derogation of human rights in times of emergencies, are also found in most domestic legal instruments. Most African states also encompass this clause in their constitutions. Although the levels of compliance by states are questionable, some of these constitutions also include a list of non-derogable rights. The constitutions of Ethiopia and Mozambique also provide for a <b>derogation</b> clause <b>and</b> a list of non-derogable rights. The aim of the study is to make a critical analysis of the African derogation system. Firstly, the study will analyse the concept of <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable rights in general. Secondly, the jurisprudence and the law of the African system with regard to <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable rights will be examined. In analysing the jurisprudence of the Commission effort will be made to critically study the cases that have been examined by the Commission in relation to <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable rights. Lastly, the compatibility of the Ethiopian and Mozambique constitutions in light of the African system and international standards will be discussed. [...] . Chapter one highlights the basis and structure of the entire study. Chapter two presents a brief historical evolution as well as conceptual framework of the system of <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable human rights in state of emergency. Chapter three focuses on the ACHPR and the jurisprudence of the Commission with regard to <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable rights in state of emergency. Chapter four assesses the compatibility of the non-derogable rights provided in the constitutions of African states with African and international standards. This chapter will [analyse], in particular, the constitutions and the practices of Ethiopia and Mozambique. Chapter five is a conclusion of the overall study stating specific recommendations.

40|$|Several {{prominent}} {{human rights}} treaties attempt to minimize violations during emergencies by authorizing states to “derogate”—that is, to suspend certain {{civil and political}} liberties—in response to crises. The drafters of these treaties envisioned that international restrictions on <b>derogations</b> <b>and</b> international notification and monitoring mechanisms would limit rights suspensions during emergencies. This article analyzes the behavior of derogating countries using new global datasets of <b>derogations</b> <b>and</b> states of emergency from 1976 to 2007. We argue that derogations are a rational response to domestic political uncertainty. They enable governments facing serious threats to buy time and legal breathing space from voters, courts, and interest groups to confront crises while signaling to these audiences that rights deviations are temporary and lawful. Our findings have implications for the studies of treaty design and flexibility mechanisms and compliance with international human rights agreements...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{argues for}} the use of new methods to assess racial {{prejudice}} because existing methods only provide a piecemeal understanding of the phenomenon, leading to an under-assessment of key constructs (e. g., ingroup favoritism, outgroup <b>derogation)</b> <b>and</b> provide no precision to assess new constructs, such as generalized outgroup derogation (negativity directed at all outgroups equally) <b>and</b> selective outgroup <b>derogation</b> (negativity directed at a specific outgroup or specific outgroups). The use of new response options, multiple targets, and multiple perceivers integrated into a single instrument is encouraged. The multidimensional architecture of the proposed instrument will allow researchers to uncover new constructs (e. g., selective or generalized outgroup <b>derogation)</b> <b>and</b> improve the assessment of existing constructs (e. g., ingroup favoritism, outgroup derogation) associated with racial prejudice. This chapter concludes by arguing that the methodological and theoretical clarity offered by these new methods in a single instrument will supplement and advance our understanding of racial prejudice, and that the approach is equally applicable to both the child and adult literatures...|$|R
