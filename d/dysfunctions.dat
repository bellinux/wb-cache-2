40|$|Background: Antipsychotics {{drugs are}} known to cause sexual <b>dysfunction</b> and {{are said to be}} a major cause of {{non-compliance}} /poor compliance. There is no local data on the subject although clinical observations indicate that sexual <b>dysfunction</b> in patients on neuroleptics is relatively common. This study was carried out to ascertain the frequency of sexual <b>dysfunction</b> in patients taking antipsychotics medications as no study has been done locally on the subject. Methods: Sexual <b>dysfunction</b> was assessed in fifty patients receiving antipsychotic medication and fifty normal controls using Arizona Sexual experience scale (ASEX). Results: Erectile <b>dysfunction</b> (48 %) and ejaculatory <b>dysfunction</b> (45 %) are the two most prominent sexual <b>dysfunction</b> affecting patients taking antipsychotics and the difference from controls is statistically significant. Conclusions: Sexual <b>dysfunction</b> among male patients on antipsychotic medications is relatively common.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{a chronic}} disease that commonly affects {{young adults who}} may be sexually active. Sexual <b>dysfunction</b> is a significant, but often underestimated, symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting 50 - 90 % of men and 40 - 80 % of women. The types of sexual <b>dysfunction</b> can be categorized {{in terms of the}} normal sexual response cycle: sexual interest/desire <b>dysfunction</b> (reduced libido), sexual arousal <b>dysfunction</b> (including erectile <b>dysfunction)</b> and ejaculatory and orgasmic <b>dysfunction.</b> Sexual <b>dysfunction</b> may not only be due to lesions affecting the neural pathways involved in physiological function (primary <b>dysfunction),</b> but also result from general physical disabilities (secondary <b>dysfunction)</b> or psychological and emotional issues (tertiary <b>dysfunction).</b> Comprehensive management should address all these possible contributing problems. Specific pharmacotherapy is only currently available for erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> This review summarizes the available information about sexual <b>dysfunction</b> in men and women with multiple sclerosis...|$|R

5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic <b>dysfunctions.</b> Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E

In the Season 4 finale, she dies after a bus crash sustained while picking up a drunken House from a bar. Her death eventually leads Wilson to conclude that his relationship with House serves to enable House's <b>dysfunctions.</b> To remove himself from House's influence, he resigns from Princeton-Plainsboro at the beginning of Season 5. The two reconcile when Wilson forces House to attend the funeral of House's father. Wilson realizes that he had been afraid of losing House, who is his true friend, and that Wilson's life didn't get any better when he resigned. He then returns to Princeton-Plainsboro.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{population-based}} surveys {{suggest that}} the prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> is between 30 % and 56 % among men {{over the age of}} 40. Most of these studies, however, are from the United States or Europe. We need estimates of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> from samples of Brazilian populations, as societies that differ ethnically, culturally, and economically may also differ with respect to potential risk factors for erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> and its potential correlates. SETTING: Santos, State of S??o Paulo. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A population-based sample of men aged 40 - 70 years. Out of 718 men invited, 342 (47. 6 %) returned a completed questionnaire. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Data on demographic variables, medical history, lifestyle habits and degree of erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> RESULTS: The prevalence of any degree of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> was 45. 9 % (minimal, 33. 9 %; moderate, 8. 5 %; complete, 3. 5 %) and increased with age. In bivariate age-adjusted analyses comparing men with no erectile <b>dysfunction</b> or minimal erectile <b>dysfunction</b> with those with moderate or complete erectile <b>dysfunction,</b> histories of diabetes or hypertension, depressive symptoms, heavy smoking and obesity were significantly associated with increased prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction,</b> whereas moderate alcohol consumption was inversely associated with erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> In the multivariate model, age was a strong predictor of erectile <b>dysfunction,</b> while history of diabetes or hypertension and heavy smoking remained significantly associated with increased prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> CONCLUSION: We found higher prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> (45. 9 %) among men older than 40 years old in Brazil. The variables associated with erectile <b>dysfunction</b> may alert physicians to patients who are at risk of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> as well as offer clues to the etiology of erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> Physicians should routinely ask their patients about sexual health and erectile <b>dysfunction...</b>|$|R

25|$|The human sexual {{response}} cycle set {{the foundation for}} studying and categorizing sexual <b>dysfunctions</b> in men and women. There are four main categories of sexual dysfunctions: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, and sexual pain disorders. They are still categorized as such in the DSM-IV-TR. Recent research however, suggests that the current model of {{sexual response}} needs to be revised to better treat these <b>dysfunctions.</b> One reason {{is that there is}} considerable overlap between sexual <b>dysfunctions</b> in women. One study found that in patients with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), 41% of women had at least one other sexual dysfunction and 18% had diagnoses in all 3 categories (that is, in desire, arousal, and orgasm disorders).|$|E

However, this <b>dysfunction</b> was rather more extensive than that found in the other diseases. The specific findings in one case were perivascular infiltration of tumor cells. 2) Generalized disease, 16 cases Moderate spermatopoietic <b>dysfunction</b> was f o und in 3 cases and slight <b>dysfunction</b> in 12 cases. The <b>dysfunction</b> was rather severe in the cases with intracranial diseases, cirrhosis of the liver, and leukemia. In a case of pulmonary tuberculosis, although testicular fundings were normal, the tuberculosis was so acute that death ensued. 3) P rostatic cancer, 9 cases Spermatopoietic <b>dysfunction</b> was found in all 9 cases, among which moderate <b>dysfunction</b> was found in 3 cases and slight <b>dysfunction</b> in 6 cases. In these cases, the <b>dysfunction</b> by age was naturally under consideration. The specific findings in this group were proliferation of Leydig's cell in 7 out of 9 cases. 4) Prostatic hypertrophy, 21 cases : Moderate spermatopoietic dys f unction was found in 8 cases, slight <b>dysfunction</b> in 12 cases, and normal function in 1 case. Proliferation of interstitial connective tissue was found in 16 cases. However, proliferation of Leydig's cell was found in few {{cases in which the}} proliferation was slight and in most cases there was a tendency to be normal or rather decreased. 5) Tuberculous epididymitis, 21 case s Spermatopoietic <b>dysfunction</b> was found in all 21 cases, among which moderate <b>dysfunction</b> was found in 6 cases and slight <b>dysfunction</b> in 15 cases. Furthermore, the degree of the <b>dysfunction</b> was parallel to changes in the epididymis. In cases with tuberlous formation and cellular infiltration into the interstitial tissue, spermatopoietic function was highly disturbed. 6) Simple epididymitis, 2 cases : Spermatopoietic <b>dysfunction</b> was not found in both cases. Microscopic fundings of the testicle was almost normal comparing with that of tuberculous epididymitis in which clinical findings were identical to simple epididymitis. 7) Diseases of the testicle and its adjacent tissue, 20 cases Sever s p ermatopoietic <b>dysfunction</b> was found in 2 cases, moderate <b>dysfunction</b> in 8 cases. Marked <b>dysfunction</b> was found in the patients with congenital defects, such as micro-orchidia, eunuchoidism, and hypospadia, or hormonal disturbance. 8) Sexual <b>dysfunction,</b> 11 cases : Spermatopoietic <b>dysfunction</b> was found in all 11 cases, among which moderate <b>dysfunction</b> was found in 5 cases, slight <b>dysfunction</b> in 6 cases.
