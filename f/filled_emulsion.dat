In the case of the skin creme investigated in the present study, the flow behavior in small gaps below 100 mum is dominated by the presence of micro-crystalline wax particles with mean diameters in the range of 50 mum. The sudden decrease in the apparent viscosity, or equivalently the sudden increase in the slip velocity between two surfaces with decreasing gap and increasing applied stress, is of importance in end-user perceptions of textural quantities such as 'slipperiness' or 'lubricity' which are typically used to characterize creams and other complex consumer products. The ability to progressively vary the gap between the two shearing surfaces means that the flexure-based microrheometer developed in the present work may find future applications in helping to bridge the gap between the traditionally-distinct fields of bulk rheological characterization and tribological testing.

40|$|Oral {{administration}} of pharmaceuticals is a convenient and simple route for drug delivery. Due to challenges concerning patient compliance and bioavailability, {{there has been}} exerted a great effort {{the last couple of}} years to optimize different types of oral delivery vehicles. Gelled emulsion-based systems have shown great promise as delivery system. They are chewable, thereby increasing patient compliance, and they are able to &# 147;trap&# 148; drugs, either in the gelled or dispersed phase, and thus provide a controlled and prolonged release of the drug, which reduce the possibility of the drug being inactivated in the stomach. The purpose of this study was to investigate how gelatin type and strength, as well as oil content, influences the physical properties of gelatin-based solid <b>emulsions.</b> <b>Filled</b> gel <b>emulsions</b> stabilized by 160 g or 260 g Bloom gelatin type A or B were prepared with varying amounts of corn oil (0, 10, 20, 40 and 50 wt. %) and subjected to rheological characterization. The obtained results showed an increase in storage modulus, gelling and melting temperatures and viscosity with increasing amount of dispersed phase. The increases were more pronounced for both 160 g and 260 g gelatin type A, than for either types of gelatin B. Gelled emulsions were investigated using longitudinal deformation and there was a clear increase in Young&# 146;s modulus for gelatin A when the oil content was raised. For 260 g Bloom gelatin A and B, there was also a clear trend towards a decrease in force and strain at break with increasing oil content, but again, this was more pronounced in gelatin type A. In vitro dissolution studies in a near gastric environment were performed on a <b>filled</b> gel <b>emulsion</b> (40 wt. % corn oil) stabilised by either gelatin type A or B (260 g Bloom). Here there was also seen a clear correlation between the rheological characteristics of the <b>filled</b> gel <b>emulsions</b> and dissolution time, where gelatin type A had a prolonged dissolution profile compared to gelatin type B. According to these results, there is a possibility to use different gelatin types and oil content to modify the properties of <b>filled</b> gel <b>emulsions</b> for a variety of pharmaceutical applications. </p...|$|R

The drive to be innovative and popular, combined with ever changing public perception and scientific knowledge, makes the food industry fascinating. One of the recent trends, including sugar and salt, has been the reduction of fat in our diets. However, consumers like to treat themselves and fatty foods give a pleasurable eating experience. These two things are often at odds. This work focusses on the development and use of a novel fat replacement technology known as air <b>filled</b> <b>emulsions</b> (AFEs) as a substitute for the function, both structurally and organoleptically, of the fats present within emulsion products.

They {{have the potential}} for technological applications in very different fields such as biomedical, environmental sciences and the food industry. This thesis focuses on the construction of AFEs and their use as ingredients to construct reduced fat and calorie emulsion-based products. These microstructurally complex materials have been termed triphasic A/O/W emulsions. A sonochemical templating process has allowed for the construction of air cells (the majority around 0. 5 - 10 μm) in the size range of oil droplets found in emulsion based foods. Air cells were stabilised with either hydrophobins, obtained from submerged fermentation and extraction, or other cysteine rich but more common proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and egg albumen (EWP). The air cells were stable against disproportionation and ripening for substantial periods of time. They resisted destabilisation effect of oil droplets and could survive unit operations involving mild vacuum treatment and centrifugal forces, relatively high shear forces, temperatures and pressures. Triphasic A/O/W emulsions were created with up to 60 % included phase of air and oil in an aqueous continuous phase. This gave a greater than 50 % reduction in lipid content. Comparative rheology and tribology showed that the triphasic A/O/W emulsions could have similar if not better lubrication properties than a full O/W version. The molecular properties of the protein used for the AFEs {{played a crucial role in}} the determination of lubrication properties (mouth-feel).

40|$|Abstract. Styrene (SM), methyl {{methacrylate}} (MMA), and butyl acrylate (BA) {{were used to}} synthesize a polyacrylic emulsion by core-shell emulsion polymerization. The solid content of the emulsion reached 40 % using reasonable reactive emulsifier contents and feeding modes. Then, two kinds of fibers (recovered and hardwood fiber) were respectively dispersed, coated, and dried with emulsion. Finally, fiber-based water-resistant material was successfully fabricated. The experimental results showed that under the conditions of a mass ratio of polyacrylic emulsion to fiber of 2 : 1, the Cobb value of the material reached 7. 1 g/m 2 and 10. 8 g/m 2 respectively. Cobb value of recovered fiber material was more stable than hardwood fiber, and stayed in a lower variation scope on the whole.

This dry <b>emulsion</b> formulation is <b>filled</b> in HPMC capsules as it is of vegetarian source but not gelatin because of several drawbacks.

Dry <b>emulsions</b> are prepared by the drying of liquid emulsions in which there is a solid form in the aqueous phase. The solid support provides the dry and bulk emulsions.

In this study, the effects of oil concentration, emulsifier type and oil droplet size on the physical stability of emulsions encapsulated in calcium alginate microgel particles (20 – 80 μm) produced by a continuous impinging aerosol technique were studied. Oil emulsions emulsified by using either sodium caseinate (SCN) or Tween 80 were encapsulated at different oil concentrations (32. 55, 66. 66 and 76. 68 % w/w of total solids content). The emulsions were analysed before and after encapsulation for changes in emulsion size distribution during storage, and compared to unencapsulated emulsions. The size distribution of encapsulated fine emulsion (mean size ~ 0. 20 μm) shifted to a larger size distribution range during encapsulation possibly due to the contraction effect of the microgel particles. Coarse emulsion droplets (mean size ~ 18 μm) underwent a size reduction during encapsulation due to the shearing effect of the atomizing nozzle. However, no further size changes in the encapsulated emulsion were detected over four weeks. The type of emulsifier used and emulsion concentration did not significantly affect the emulsion stability.

40|$|Texture {{perception}} of {{food is a}} dynamic phenomenon depending on food properties and oral processing. Several sensory techniques enable to measure texture perception over time. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA), temporal dominance of sensation (TDS) and progressive profiling in the assessment of dynamic texture of <b>emulsion</b> <b>filled</b> gels varying in fracture stress (low/high), fracture strain (low/high) and oil release (oil droplets bound/unbound to the gel matrix). The QDA results revealed that the variation of mechanical properties led to significant differences in texture properties perceived at first bite (firmness and brittleness). Texture attributes perceived at later stages of mastication showed significant differences between gels depending on the first bite properties e. g. soft gels were perceived as more melting. Progressive profiling showed that creaminess increased over eating time while firmness decreased. TDS results were in agreement with the other methods and additionally conveyed information on the succession of perceived attributes over time. The TDS sensory trajectories demonstrated that for all gels dynamic perception evolved in a similar fashion but samples with a high or low fracture strain differed at the end of oral processing. We conclude that texture {{perception of}} semi-solid gels is dynamic and can be measured by either of the three sensory methods. The mechanical properties of the gels influence the perception of texture attributes at first bite and at later stages of mastication.

40|$|The {{deliberate}} {{design of}} food structures that impact on lipid digestion has received increasing attention {{because of the}} need for solutions to combat nutrition related concerns such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. In this study we examined how the hierarchical structure of foods can impact lipid digestion by incorporating gastric structuring emulsions in different biopolymer networks, namely i) a thermally reversible gelatine network, ii) a colloidal casein network, and iii) a concentrated starch particulate dispersion. The digestive breakdown of these <b>emulsion</b> <b>filled</b> biopolymer gels was followed by fat digestion kinetics in vitro and human clinical study (in vivo), rheological measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The parent caseinate/monoglyceride (CasMag) stabilised emulsion underwent extensive partial coalescence upon exposure to gastric juice and as a result had very slow lipolysis (in vitro and in vivo). When the emulsion was incorporated within the biopolymer networks the rates of lipolysis were strongly correlated with the extent of partial coalescence of the CasMag emulsion, which was directly influenced by the structure and breakdown properties of each different biopolymer network. The way that biopolymer networks alter the digestion of the parent CasMag emulsion is likely affected by; i) how well the digestive juices mixed with the network/emulsion and, ii) the frequency and speed of droplet encounters, both of which have a direct impact on the ability of emulsions to undergo flocculation and (partial) coalescence. This knowledge may have important implications for the design and testing of real foods to understand and control the digestive behaviour of food nutrients. ...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound {{irradiation}} of {{a protein}} or polymer solution at the air:water interface {{can be used}} to form hollow microspheres containing an air bubble. By introducing a layer of oil and sonicating the oil:water interface, microspheres containing an oil droplet are formed. The microspheres are stabilised by disulfide crosslinking, have diameters of between 1 - 20 mm and have a number of applications; gas filled protein microspheres are used as ultrasound contrast agents and oil filled microspheres are being developed for delivery of lipophilic drugs. This project extends the scope of sonochemically produced microspheres to include water-in-oil <b>emulsion</b> <b>filled</b> microspheres, which facilitate encapsulation of hydrophilic species, and polymer microspheres that release their contents in response to an external stimulus. Successful encapsulation of a water in oil emulsion phase is demonstrated using confocal microscopy. Release studies are reported for a number of hydrophilic species (in vitro) including 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein, 5 -fluorouracil and sodium chloride. Release can be triggered by sonochemical disruption of the microsphere shells or cleavage of the disulfide cross links. Thiol-ene coupling reactions initiated by ultrasound irradiation are reported. In water, ultrasound initiation of thiol-ene reactions with electron rich alkenes results in rates of reaction which compare favourably with conventional thermal initiation. Thiol-ene crosslinking is proposed as an alternative to disulfide crosslinking to stabilise sonochemically produced microspheres. Temperature responsive microspheres are produced via the sonochemical method using a block copolymer of N-isopropylacrylamide and thiolated methacrylic acid, P(MASH-b-NIPAm). The block co-polymer is synthesised using reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerisation and has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 37 ºC. The microspheres formed from this block copolymer can be seen to rupture, releasing their internal oil phase, when heated above 37 ºC. These findings provide a basis from which to develop sonochemically produced polymer microspheres for responsive delivery of both hydrophilic and lipophilic species...|$|R
40|$|The wetting of {{anisotropic}} {{colloidal particles}} {{is of great}} importance in several applications, including Pickering <b>emulsions,</b> <b>filled</b> foams, and membrane transduction by particles. However, the combined effect of shape and surface chemistry on the three-phase contact angle of anisotropic micrometer and submicrometer colloids has been poorly investigated to date, {{due to the lack}} of a suitable experimental technique to resolve individual particles. In the present work, we investigate the variation of the contact angle of prolate ellipsoidal colloids at a liquid−liquid interface as a function of surface chemistry and aspect ratio using freeze-fracture shadow-casting cryo-SEM. The method, initially demonstrated for spherical colloids, is extended here to the more general case of ellipsoids. The prolate ellipsoidal particles are prepared from polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) spheres using a film stretching technique, in which cleaning steps are needed to remove all film material from the particle surface. The effects of the preparation protocol are reported, and wrinkling of the three-phase contact line is observed when the particle surface is insufficiently cleaned. For identically prepared ellipsoids, the cosine of the measured contact angle is, in a first approximation, a linearly decreasing function of the contact line length and thus a decreasing function of the aspect ratio. Such a trend violates Young−Laplace’s equation and can be rationalized by adding a correction term to the ideal Young−Laplace contact angle that expresses the relative importance of line effects relative to surface effects. From this term the contribution of an effective line tension can be extracted. This contribution includes the effects that both surface chemical and topographical heterogeneities have on the contact line and which become increasingly more important for ellipsoids with higher aspect ratios, where the contact line length to contact area ratio increases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{environment}} in inner cores of water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) microfluidic double emulsions {{has a significant}} impact on industrial applications of such systems. For example, in the case of shear sensitive cells compartmentalised in the cores, high shear conditions may be deleterious. This study reports on the flow characteristics of w/o/w inner cores in comparison to those in single water-in-oil (w/o) microdroplets of equal size moving in the same microchannel, resolved by means of micro-particle image velocimetry (??PIV). The multiphase flow system employed in the study had a viscosity ratio, ??, between aqueous and oil phase of the order of unity (?? = 0. 78) and both single droplets and inner cores of double <b>emulsions</b> <b>filled</b> the channel. This configuration resulted in a weak recirculating flow inside the w/o single droplet: the measured flow field exhibited a uniform low velocity flow field in the central region surrounded by small regions of reversed flow near the channel walls. This flow topology was maintained in the inner cores of w/o/w double emulsions for intermediate capillary numbers (Ca) ranging from 10 ??? 3 to 10 ??? 2, and core morphologies varying from large plugs to pancake cores. The core morphology affected the magnitude and distribution of the velocity in the droplets. The similarity in the flow topology resulted from the fact that inner cores were located {{at the back of the}} outer droplet in such a way that inner and outer interfaces were in contact for over half of core surface area and separated only by a thin lubricating film. Both single droplets and inner cores exhibited a narrow shear rate distribution characterised by small regions of maximum shear confined near the channel walls. Shear rate magnitude values were found to be an order of magnitude lower than those in the channel and hence capable of reducing stresses in flow cytometry to far below reported values for cell damage. Hence, it can be concluded that double emulsions are suitable candidates to substitute single droplets in flow cytometry to protect the screened items and are compatible with the commercial flow cytometry systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} food {{industry}} on societal aspects grows dynamically, thereby posing new challenges for food developers to comply to consumer demands. Consumers expect {{new and more}} sophisticated products that are tuned to their very specific needs, like health and life-style. This means that food products must be fully programmable to meet these market demands. The taste, smell, and texture perception of food {{are the most important}} properties that influence the consumer’s experience. To provide control over these features the physics behind them during oral manipulation and structure breakdown must be understood. Most desirably, the physical properties can be tightly linked to attributes of oral perception. In this thesis the texture of semi-solid and liquid (model) food is studied using Quantitative Descriptive Analysis. Despite the quantification of sensory scores, it remains difficult to translate these into food physical characteristics in an absolute mode. For that reason, in parallel a physical study is performed using mainly tribology to provide quantitative description of the mechanical processes in the oral environment. Therefore, the experimental setup is adapted such to mimic oral conditions by employing soft surfaces. Next to more complex commercial products, like milk, the samples studied include aqueous dispersions of protein aggregates or polysaccharides, and <b>emulsion</b> <b>filled</b> gels. These components may contribute to fat-feel in low or no-fat dairy products and provide a major uncertainty in predicting the sensorial restraints of the product. In this thesis we investigate how various factors influence the friction of above-mentioned systems and how this friction can be understood at a more fundamental level. In addition, the surface effects are studied in detail to determine how sensitive the choice of the oral surface analog is on the friction and what the most important surface properties are that are relevant to better predict sensory attributes. In this thesis we present an overview of correlations obtained between different sensory attributes and frictional data. We show that oral perception can be translated into physical quantities using friction. The best correlations are obtained for physical conditions that resemble most the oral environment, i. e. speed below 50 mm/s, shear rate of about 50 s- 1 and soft, rough surface. For instance a low friction coefficient correlates well with the creamy perception of the consumer. This finding may contribute to develop healthy foods with a full fat creamy taste. Moreover, samples with low friction coefficient can be perceived as soft and velvety, while high friction results in rough texture perception. Some attributes, like filmy or slimy, correlate better with viscosity, as their perception is determined by the bulk properties of a sample rather than interaction with oral surfaces. In a few cases the correlation with friction coefficient could not be established, e. g. for sticky or powdery attributes. The latter one, however, shows a good correlation with particles size if they are present in the solution. This thesis presents a comprehensive picture of the relation between physical quantities and sensory attributes and provides a step forward towards a better control over oral perception of food...|$|R
40|$|Flavour {{release from}} food is {{determined}} by the binding of flavours to other food ingredients and the partition of flavour molecules among different phases. Food emulsions are used as delivery systems for food flavours, and tailored structuring in emulsions provides novel means to better control flavour release. The current study investigated four structured oil-in-water emulsions with structuring in the oil phase, oil-water interface, and water phase. Oil phase structuring was achieved by the formation of monoglyceride (MG) liquid crystals in the oil droplets (MG structured emulsions). Structured interface was created by the adsorption of a whey protein isolate (WPI) -pectin double layer at the interface (multilayer emulsion). Water phase structured emulsions referred to <b>emulsion</b> <b>filled</b> protein gels (EFP gels), where emulsion droplets were embedded in WPI gel network, and emulsions with maltodextrins (MDs) of different dextrose-equivalent (DE) values. Flavour compounds with different physicochemical properties were added into the emulsions, and flavour release (release rate, headspace concentration and air-emulsion partition coefficient) was described by GC headspace analysis. Emulsion structures, including crystalline structure, particle size, emulsion stability, rheology, texture, and microstructures, were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction, light scattering, multisample analytical centrifuge, rheometry, texture analysis, and confocal laser scanning microscopy, respectively. In MG structured emulsions, MG self-assembled into liquid crystalline structures and stable β-form crystals were formed after 3 days of storage at 25 °C. The inclusion of MG crystals allowed tween 20 stabilized emulsions to present viscoelastic properties, and it made WPI stabilized emulsions more sensitive to the change of pH and NaCl concentrations. Flavour compounds in MG structured emulsions had lower initial headspace concentration and air-emulsion partition coefficients than those in unstructured emulsions. Flavour release can be modulated by changing MG content, oil content and oil type. WPI-pectin multilayer emulsions were stable at pH 5. 0, 4. 0, and 3. 0, but they presented extensive creaming when subjected to salt solutions with NaCl ≥ 150 mM and mixed with artificial salivas. Increase of pH from 5. 0 to 7. 0 resulted in higher headspace concentration but unchanged release rate, and increase of NaCl concentration led to increased headspace concentration and release rate. The study also showed that salivas could trigger higher release of hydrophobic flavours and lower release of hydrophilic flavours. In EFP gels, increases in protein content and oil content contributed to gels with higher storage modulus and force at breaking. Flavour compounds had significantly reduced release rates and air-emulsion partition coefficients in the gels than the corresponding ungelled emulsions, and the reduction was in line with the increase of protein content. Gels with stronger gel network but lower oil content were prepared, and lower or unaffected release rates of the flavours were observed. In emulsions containing maltodextrins, water was frozen at a much lower temperature, and emulsion stability was greatly improved when subjected to freeze-thawing. Among different MDs, MD DE 6 offered the emulsion the highest stability. Flavours had lower air-emulsion partition coefficients in the emulsions with MDs than those in the emulsion without MD. Moreover, the involvement of MDs in the emulsions allowed most flavours had similar release profiles before and after freeze-thaw treatment. The present study provided information about different structured emulsions as delivery systems for flavour compounds, and on how food structure can be designed to modulate flavour release, which could be helpful in the development of functional foods with improved flavour profile...|$|R
