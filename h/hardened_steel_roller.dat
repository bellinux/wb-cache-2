By {{means of the}} high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF) method, the coating was formed onto the axially ground and circumferentially ground roller specimens made of a thermally refined carbon steel. In the experiments, the WC cermet coated steel roller was mated with the carburized <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> <b>roller</b> without coating in line contact condition. The coated roller was mated with the smooth non-coated roller under a contact pressure of 1. 0 or 1. 2 GPa, and it was mated with the rough non-coated roller under a contact pressure of 0. 6 or 0. 8 GPa. As a result, {{it was found that}} in general, the coating on the circumferentially ground substrate shows a lower durability compared with that on the axially ground substrate and this difference appears more distinctly for the higher contact pressure for both smooth mating surface and rough mating surface.

40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of thermally sprayed WC-Cr-Ni cermet coating under lubricated rolling with sliding contact condition were examined experimentally. Experiments were performed using a two-roller testing machine. The coating was formed onto the blasted or ground roller specimens made of thermally refined carbon steel or induction hardened carbon steel by high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF). A mirror-like finished cermet coated steel roller was mated with a noncoated carburized <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> <b>roller.</b> In {{the case of}} thermally refined steel substrate and for the mating surface roughness R max= 0. 1 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed lower durability than that on the blasted substrate. For the mating surface roughness Rmax= 3. 0 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed an extremely short life as compared with that on the blasted substrate. In general, durability of cermet coating was greatly increased due {{to the increase in}} the coating thickness. In the case of induction hardened steel substrate, coating on the blasted or ground substrate showed high durability for both R max= 0. 1 µm and 3. 0 µm. Coefficient of friction and oil film thickness were markedly influenced by the mating surface roughness but these were hardly affected by the substrate material. In addition, depending on the mating surface roughness, significant differences in the surface roughness of coated roller and depth of flaking on the coated roller were found...|$|E

30|$|Actuator loads {{were applied}} through a roller {{assembly}} {{consisting of two}} 152  ×  305  ×  51  mm thick <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> bearing plates and two <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> <b>rollers</b> of 51  mm diameter and 305  mm in length. This ensured uniform and frictionless load transfer from actuators to the girder surface. The bearing plates and rollers were heat-treated to maximum possible hardness, to minimize local deformations. Lead sheets were used between the load bearing plates and girder surface to aid in uniform loading. The MTS “MultiFlex” System precisely controlled the applied loads and displacements through the actuators. Each girder was first loaded using Actuators B and C under a load-control mode {{at a rate of}} 9  KN/min. As soon as the slope of load versus displacement curve for girder being tested dropped, the actuator control-mode was switched to a displacement-control at a rate of 5  mm/h until shear failure occurred {{at either end of the}} girder. The displacement-control mode was essential in capturing the ductility or brittleness behavior of the girder failing in shear.|$|R

40|$|Press <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> {{has become}} a much used {{material}} in car body manufacturing due to its excellent safety and lightweight potential.

However conventional press <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> based on the alloying concept 22 MnB 5 was designed originally not for automotive application. In spite of the high strength level, press <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> has generally low toughness due to the relatively high carbon content and its martensitic microstructure. Particularly important is the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature at low temperature, which might lead to unexpected failure in cold climate regions. Furthermore, hydrogen embrittlement is a major concern in press <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> as previous results indicated that only a few ppm of hydrogen could induce delayed cracking. Generally it is important that impact energy should be absorbed by the material to avoid unexpected disintegration of the structure. This material capability is usually characterized by the toughness. All these characteristics have not yet been systematically investigated in press <b>hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> Consequently, no {{attempts have been made to}} optimize conventional press <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> for obtaining better toughness, lower ductile-to-brittle transition temperature and reduced sensitivity to hydrogen induced cracking.
