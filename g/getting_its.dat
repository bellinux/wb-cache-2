5|$|Reinfeldt's {{first term}} in office was marked by the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis and recession. His popularity fell until the economy of Sweden {{emerged as one of}} the strongest in Europe; this brought a resurgence of support for him, resulting in his government's re-election in 2010. Despite the Moderate Party <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> highest share of the vote since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1921, Reinfeldt's government was reduced to a minority government, owing to the rise of Sweden Democrats; but he remained in power as the first centre-right Prime Minister since the Swedish-Norwegian Union to be re-elected.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the statues of Kossuth Square being in danger, {{the fate of the}} Ethnographic Museum that is across from the Parliament building is also uncertain because the newly reinstated Hungarian Supreme Court (Kúria) has recently expressed interest in <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> former building back. According to the local newspaper Népszava, just moving the museum, as well as the Institute of Political History that also occupies the same building, would cost at least 5 billion HUF, but constructing new premises for both would take at least 15 billion HUF, if not double the amount".|$|E
25|$|Since the Army {{was officially}} {{responsible}} {{for the security of}} the Pearl Harbor facilities and Hawaiian defense generally, and so of the Navy's ships while in port, Army actions are of particular interest. Short reported to Washington he had increased his alert level (but his earlier change in meaning for those levels was not understood in Washington and led to misunderstanding there about what he was really doing). In addition, Short's main concern was sabotage from fifth columnists (expected to precede the outbreak of war for decades preceding the attack), which accounts for his orders that Army Air Corps planes be parked close together {{near the center of the}} airfields. There seems to have been no increased Army urgency about <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> existing radar equipment properly integrated with the local command and control in the year it had been available and operational in Hawaii before the attack. Leisurely radar training continued and the recently organized early warning center was left minimally staffed. Anti-aircraft guns remained in a state of low readiness, with ammunition in secured lockers. Neither Army long-range bombers nor Navy PBYs were used effectively, remaining on a peacetime maintenance and use schedule. Short evidently failed to understand he had the responsibility to defend the fleet. In Short's defense, it should be noted he had training responsibilities to meet, and the best patrol aircraft, B-17s and B-24s, were in demand in the Philippines and Britain, both of which had higher priority.|$|E
25|$|German railway {{operator}} Deutsche Bahn {{at first}} limited {{the maximum speed}} of its trains to 200km/h (124mph), then all services on the domestic InterCity/InterCityExpress network {{as well as the}} local services in Northern and Western Germany were discontinued from 17:15 CET on 18 January onwards, as major main lines (Bremen-Hannover, Hamburg-Hanover, Bremen-Osnabrück) and many branch lines were affected by the storm. In an unprecedented move, Deutsche Bahn discontinued virtually all train services in Germany at 19:30 CET until further notice, with only very limited local services running on a per-line decision basis. Trains currently on the lines would stop at the next station and stay there, leaving passengers stranded all over Germany in the tens of thousands. Later, as the situation was worsening, trains were left open for those passengers unable to find a hotel to sleep in. In major affected stations, such as Münster and Hanover, air raid shelters in the stations were opened up for the night, with the Red Cross issuing blankets to stranded passengers. Train services were resumed on the morning of 19 January, but cancellations and delays continued during the weekend as 34,000kilometres (21,100mi) of track needed to be checked and cleared. The DB was faced by the massive challenge of <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> network into working order again after coming to a full stop during the night, the first such event ever to happen on the German railway network in peacetime. On 18 January, an InterCity train ran into a tree that had fallen onto the tracks between Elmshorn and Westerland. One of the locomotives was damaged, no casualties were reported. An InterCity train with 450 passengers on board was stuck near Diepholz and had to be evacuated, Duisburg Hauptbahnhof station was suffering from a power outage {{as the result of a}} grid failure.|$|E

[...] The field conditions kept Michigan from <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> [...] "fast play into correct motion".

Aside from the field conditions, Michigan's scoring was slowed by three fumbles and eight holding and offsides penalties. [...] The highlight of the game was a 75-yard punt return by Boss Weeks. Michigan scored six touchdowns, including two each by Bruce Shorts and Willie Heston and single touchdowns by Neil Snow and Walter W. Shaw. Shorts added three goals from touchdown.|$|E

The French type {{had received a}} separate national designation: AMX 30. The trials indicated that the German type, on 1 October also <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> own name Leopard, had a better mobility and acceleration. The French government decided {{that it could not}} procure a new tank until 1965, while the Germans refused to adopt the Franco-German [...] tank gun, in lieu of the British Royal Ordnance L7, of which they had already ordered 1,500 in the autumn of 1962, their plan having failed for Rheinmetall to produce in Germany a common type of munition of sufficient quality. Suggestions to save the project by combining the French turret with the German chassis failed. As a result, the program was cancelled and the French and Germans definitely decided to adopt their two separate tanks.|$|E

Homer tries to get his {{marriage}} to Amber annulled by the court, but Judge Constance Harm refuses, stating that Homer married Amber in Nevada and the marriage still stands, since Homer never officially divorced Amber. Marge is so angry that she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber. Homer still loves Marge and refuses to sleep with Amber, so he tries to sleep in Santa's Little Helper's kennel, but ends up <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> doorway stuck to his head and spends {{the rest of the}} night trying to get it off.

500|$|Dave Anderson of TV Guide {{called the}} episode first-rate, while praising the comedic Bree storyline and declaring the set-up for the Orson mystery storyline ingenious. He commended Marcia Cross' {{performance}} but opined that Longoria provided the best comedic relief. He also complimented Teri Hatcher's acting, commenting that she [...] "was awesome in the poignant scene where she asks the comatose Mike {{permission to go}} on the (almost) date with Ian." [...] Anderson identified the Scavo storyline as [...] "the weakest link" [...] in the episode and hoped that the Nora and Kayla characters would not remain on the show for too long. TV Guide writer Matt Roush shared similar sentiments regarding the Scavo storyline, stating that while the premiere overall was good, [...] "Lynette is trapped in a story line so desperately unamusing, one that makes her and everyone around her act so idiotic, that you have to pray that we'll soon see the last of the obnoxious Nora, mother of Tom's surprise daughter." [...] He described the storyline as [...] "painfully unpleasant and unfunny." [...] However, Roush praised the performances of Metcalf and Valerie Mahaffey, while concluding that Desperate Housewives [...] "shows encouraging signs of <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> act together." [...] In a separate review, Roush unfavorably compared the Orson character to Bree's former love interest, George Williams (Roger Bart), while also admitting to being [...] "a bit weary" [...] of the Gabrielle storyline.|$|E
500|$|Latour's {{inspiration}} {{for creating the}} character came {{when he realized that}} he was not familiar with Gwen Stacy outside of being a [...] "fridged" [...] character who was killed {{for the sake of the}} hero as a plot progression. Latour also felt he grew up in times where white males were dominant in superhero comics, and saw Gwen Stacy as a potential heroine to represent women in a better way, [...] "The fact that it's a woman does change the meaning and subtext of everything that's going on. As a creator, that's really enjoyable and it opens up the story to go in a lot of directions it wouldn't have gone before. In October 2014, Nick Lowe announced at New York Comic Con 2014 that the character would be <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> own ongoing series after much demand. The first issue of Spider-Gwen experienced commercial success and was the third best-selling comic of February 2015 with sales of over 250,000 copies.

After the conclusion of the event, a second volume by the same creative team began with the first issue as a part of Marvel's All-New, All-Different Marvel imprint entitled The Radioactive Spider-Gwen.

500|$|Ice's third studio album, Hard to Swallow, {{featured}} a darker sound and lyrics than Ice's previous {{work as well}} as various mixtures of different styles of hip hop and hard rock which caught the media's attention. Ice attracted a whole new audience when he started touring again, some who were even unfamiliar with his more mainstream sound. Despite <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> own audience and going Gold, reviews of the album were generally negative. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote [...] "The most earnest new song, Scars, condemns an abusive father. The sentiments would sound more genuine if Korn hadn't gotten there first." [...] Richard Torres of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while [...] "nothing, however, can redeem Ice's wack boasting," [...] the album [...] "isn't half-bad." [...] In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Kemp gave the album three out of five stars, writing that it contained Ice's [...] "most convincing music". A lot of executives at SonyBMG were predicting that the album would do better than 'To The Extreme'. In promotion of Hard to Swallow, Ice toured with a seven-piece live band which included bassist Scott Shriner. The band opened with rock-oriented material from Hard to Swallow and concluded with older hip hop songs. The setlist also included [...] "Power", based upon Led Zeppelin's [...] "Immigrant Song".

Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled [...] "Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991, Issues of Time Magazine", and [...] "The Story That Time Couldn't Tell". Prior to the advertising campaign, Scientologists distributed 88-page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar's article. The [...] "Fact vs. Fiction" [...] piece was a [...] booklet, which criticized Behar's article and asserted [...] "Behar's article omits {{the information on the}} dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists... which have been acknowledged by community officials". One of the advertisements in USA Today accused Time of promoting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, and featured a 1936 issue of Time which had Hitler's picture on the front cover. The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning Time [...] "horrible history of supporting fascism", and said that the article was written because Time had been pressured by [...] "vested interests". When asked by the St. Petersburg Times whether this was the case, Time Executive Editor Richard Duncan responded [...] "Good Lord, no". Heber Jentzsch, at the time president of Church of Scientology International, issued a four-page news release which stated [...] "Advertising is the only way the church could be assured of <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> message and its side of the story out to the public without the same vested interests behind the Time article distorting it".|$|E

He added that it [...] "allows us to see that Homer really does love Marge a lot without having to blatantly stamp sentimentality all over it. The episode is strange, goofy and fun." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said that [...] "the concept of Marge’s anger at Homer got old, but this episode managed to offer a reasonably entertaining affair. It was fun to see Homer treated like a party god, and this offered a few nice moments. The overall level of quality remained good throughout the show, but it didn’t rise to any great heights." [...] David Packard at DVD Verdict said {{in a review of}} The Simpsons [...] "Gone Wild" [...] DVD that [...] "this episode sports some of the awkward animation and voice work that is prevalent in episodes from the first season. That aspect isn't an issue to me; in fact, I quite enjoy season one as it shows the early efforts of the series <b>getting</b> <b>its</b> legs in making the transition from its origin on The Tracey Ullman Show.
