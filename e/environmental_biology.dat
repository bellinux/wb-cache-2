2500|$|An assay is {{an investigative}} (analytic) {{procedure}} in laboratory medicine, pharmacology, <b>environmental</b> <b>biology</b> and molecular biology for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence, amount, or functional activity {{of a target}} entity (the analyte). [...] The analyte can be a drug, a biochemical substance, or a cell in an organism or organic sample. The measured entity is generally called the analyte, the measurand or {{the target of the}} assay. The assay usually aims to measure an intensive property of the analyte and express it in the relevant measurement unit (e.g. molarity, density, functional activity in enzyme international units, degree of some effect in comparison to a standard, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|The term geobiology {{was coined}} by Lourens Baas Becking in 1934. In his words, geobiology [...] "is {{an attempt to}} {{describe}} the relationship between organisms and the Earth," [...] for [...] "the organism {{is part of the}} Earth and its lot is interwoven with that of the Earth." [...] Baas Becking's definition of geobiology was born of a desire to unify <b>environmental</b> <b>biology</b> with laboratory biology. The way he practiced it aligns closely with modern environmental microbial ecology, though his definition remains applicable to all of geobiology. In his book, Geobiology, Bass Becking stated that {{he had no intention of}} inventing a new field of study.Baas Becking's understanding of geobiology was heavily influenced by his predecessors, including Martinus Beyerinck, his teacher from the Dutch School of Microbiology. Others included Vladimir Vernadsky, who argued that life changes the surface environment of Earth in The Biosphere, his 1926 book, and Sergei Vinogradsky, famous for discovering lithotrophic bacteria.|$|E
