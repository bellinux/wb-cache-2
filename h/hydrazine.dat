5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are <b>hydrazine</b> (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and <b>hydrazine</b> as well. <b>Hydrazine</b> is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E

50|$|The {{propanone}} azine is {{an intermediate}} in the Atofina-PCUK process. Direct alkylation of <b>hydrazines</b> with alkyl halides {{in the presence}} of base yields alkyl-substituted <b>hydrazines,</b> but the reaction is typically inefficient due to poor control on level of substitution (same as in ordinary amines). The reduction of hydrazones to <b>hydrazines</b> present a clean way to produce 1,1-dialkylated <b>hydrazines.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydrazines</b> {{are known}} to undergo {{oxidative}} activation in several enzymatic systems in vitro. Free radicals or carbonium ions have been proposed as active intermediates during such activation. The toxic effects elicited by <b>hydrazines</b> have also been linked to free radical-mediated activation. In this report, {{we have reviewed the}} identification of organic free radicals from <b>hydrazines</b> by direct ESR and ESR-spin trapping...|$|R
50|$|Azines {{characteristically}} undergo hydrolysis to <b>hydrazines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Technetium can {{catalyse}} {{the destruction}} of <b>hydrazine</b> by nitric acid, and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies. This caused {{a problem in the}} separation of plutonium from uranium in nuclear fuel processing, where <b>hydrazine</b> is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state. The problem was exacerbated by the mutually-enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage, and required a process modification.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for the decomposition of <b>hydrazine</b> (into hot nitrogen and ammonia), and this is used in practice in low-thrust rocket engines; there are more details in the monopropellant rocket article.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen azide (HN3) {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous <b>hydrazine</b> by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell {{and is a}} potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the toxic constituents eluded researchers until 1968, when acetaldehyde N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone, better known as gyromitrin, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a volatile water-soluble <b>hydrazine</b> compound hydrolyzed in the body into monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Other N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel's toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three <b>hydrazine</b> thrusters. The satellite transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine attitude control with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E

The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space.|$|E
5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic {{boron nitride}} is {{produced}} by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or <b>hydrazine.</b> Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|The Italian {{catalyst}} manufacturer Acta {{has proposed}} using <b>hydrazine</b> {{as an alternative}} to hydrogen in fuel cells. As the <b>hydrazine</b> fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing it in a tank full of a double-bonded carbon-oxygen carbonyl, it reacts and forms a safe solid called hydrazone. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid <b>hydrazine</b> hydrate is released. <b>Hydrazine</b> breaks down in the cell to form nitrogen and hydrogen which bonds with oxygen, releasing water.|$|E

25|$|Mushrooms contain <b>hydrazine</b> derivatives, {{including}} agaritine and gyromitrin, {{that have}} been evaluated for carcinogenic activity. Agaritine, a <b>hydrazine,</b> poses no toxicological risk to humans when mushrooms are consumed in typical amounts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrazine</b> sulfate is toxic and {{potentially}} carcinogenic. Nevertheless, the short-term side effects reported in various clinical trials are relatively mild: minor nausea and vomiting, dizziness and excitement, polyneuritis (inflammation of the nerves) and difficulties in fine muscle control (such as writing). However, more serious, even fatal side effects {{have been reported}} in rare cases: one patient developed fatal liver and kidney failure, and another developed serious symptoms of neurotoxicity. These side effects and other reports of <b>hydrazine</b> toxicity are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>hydrazine</b> {{may play a role in}} the toxicity of the antibiotic isoniazid, which is thought to be metabolized to <b>hydrazine</b> in the body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrazine</b> {{may also}} cause steatosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} the azide moiety is sodium azide. As a pseudohalogen compound, sodium azide generally displaces an appropriate leaving group (e.g., Br, I, OTs) to give the azido compound. Aryl azides may be prepared by displacement of the appropriate diazonium salt with sodium azide, or trimethylsilyl azide; nucleophilic aromatic substitution is also possible, even with chlorides. Anilines and aromatic <b>hydrazines</b> undergo diazotization, as do alkyl amines and <b>hydrazines.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} between monosubstituted <b>hydrazines</b> and Ru(II) vinylidene complexes [RuCl(P∩N) ₂-(=C=CH(R)) ]BPh₄ (where R = Ph, n-Bu and P∩N = 3, 5 -dimethyl[1 -((2 -diphenylphosphino) ethyl) ]pyrazole (Me₂PyP)) afforded metallacyclobutene derivatives of {{the general}} formula [RuCl(κ¹P-Me₂PyP) (κ²P,N-Me₂PyP) (κ²N,C-NH₂N´(R¹) C(CH₂R²)) ]BPh₄ (where R¹, R² = Me, Ph, n-Bu). The new metallacyclic ruthenium complexes contain a four-membered ring (-Ru=C-N-N-) and one pendant P,N-donor ligand, Me₂PyP, bound through the P-donor atom. The solid-state and solution-state structures of these complexes were confirmed through X-ray crystallographic analysis and extensive 2 D NMR spectroscopic studies. The reactivity of [RuCl(Me₂PyP) ₂(=C=CH(R)) ]BPh₄ toward amines and disubstituted <b>hydrazines</b> was also investigated. The Me₂PyP ligand exhibited hemilabile behavior on reaction of [RuCl(Me₂PyP) ₂₋ (=C=CH(R)) ]BPh₄ with aniline. The mechanism {{of the formation of}} the four-membered metallacycle was investigated, and {{it was found that the}} formation of N-C bonds from <b>hydrazines</b> and vinylidene was only possible when facilitated by displacement of the N-donor atom of the P,N-donor ligand Me₂PyP by the -NH₂ group of the monosubstituted <b>hydrazines.</b> 9 page(s...|$|R
