30|$|The {{teeth were}} fixed in {{self-curing}} acrylic resin placed in <b>flexible</b> <b>molds</b> with the roots {{embedded in the}} acrylic and the crown exposed and oriented perpendicularly {{to the bottom of}} the mold.|$|R
50|$|The metal molds {{can produce}} an {{unlimited}} number of castings. Unlike the <b>flexible</b> <b>molds</b> used for resin casting, metal molds are not {{adversely affected by}} heat. The metal molds allow grouping of several parts in one mold cavity and several mold cavities in one mold for faster production.|$|R
25|$|Specialty polyols include {{polycarbonate}} polyols, polycaprolactone polyols, polybutadiene polyols, and polysulfide polyols. The {{materials are}} used in elastomer, sealant, and adhesive applications that require superior weatherability, and resistance to chemical and environmental attack. Natural oil polyols derived from castor oil and other vegetable oils are used to make elastomers, flexible bunstock, and <b>flexible</b> <b>molded</b> foam.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of a toy or figure start with the traditional sculpting process where the artist designs a clay sculpture. Where appropriate, for example when making a garage kit, the sculpture is dissected into several parts like head, torso, arms and legs. A <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> made from room temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber is made for each part.|$|E
50|$|After {{the mold}} has been made, a {{synthetic}} resin - such as polyurethane or epoxy - {{mixed with a}} curing agent, is poured into each mold cavity. Mixing the two liquid parts causes an exothermic reaction which generates heat and within minutes causes the material to harden, yielding castings or copies {{in the shape of}} the mold into which it has been poured. The molds are commonly half-divided (like the hollowed chocolate Easter eggs with candy inside) and a release agent may be used to make removal of the hardened/set resin from the mold easier. The hardened resin casting is removed from the <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> and allowed to cool.Due to aggressive nature of most compounds used for casting and the high temperature of the reaction the mold gradually degrades and loses small details. Typically, a <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> will yield between 25 and 100 castings depending upon the size of the part, the intensity of the heat generated.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} related to vacuum bag molding {{in exactly the same}} way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a {{flexible}} male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male <b>flexible</b> <b>mold.</b> The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite helmets due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet bag moulding machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.|$|E
40|$|Hydrostatic {{pressing}} {{was investigated}} {{as a method}} of fabricating long preforms made from uranium powder. A laboratory scale pressure vessel was constructed to evaluate the feasibility of this process. Various metal powders were loaded into <b>flexible</b> <b>molds</b> and subjected to pressure in an enclosed liquid. The high density of uranium caused the <b>flexible</b> <b>molds</b> to distort during filling and after pressing there was a tendency for the compact to adhere to the mold. Methods of minimizing these difficulties are suggested. Uranium powder, compacted in a plastic mold at 21 tsi had a density of 12. 5 g/cc. During the course of the investigation, it was found that hydrostatic pressing of other metal powders presented advantages over conventional steel die methods, especially in the ability to press experimental shapes using economical equipment. Recommendations were made for further development work on both cold and hot hydrostatic pressing. (auth...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} to mid-1980s, hobbyists began {{creating}} their own garage kits of movie monsters. There was a small but enthusiastic market for these new model kits. They were making <b>flexible</b> <b>molds</b> which could produce accurate reproductions of new figures which were sculpted more accurately and with more detail than the old plastic model kits, but often done without permission from copyright holders. They were usually produced in limited numbers and sold primarily by mail order and at toy and hobby conventions.|$|R
40|$|Since their invention, polyimides {{have found}} {{numerous}} uses in MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) technology. Polyimides {{can act as}} photoresist, sacrificial layers, structural layers, and even {{as a replacement for}} silicon as the substrate during MEMS fabrication. They enable fabrication of both low and high aspect ratio devices. Polyimides have been used to fabricate expendable <b>molds</b> and reusable <b>flexible</b> <b>molds.</b> Development of a variety of devices that employ polyimides for sensor applications has occurred. Micro-robotic actuator applications include hinges, thermal actuators and residual stress actuators. Currently, polyimides are being used to create new sensors and devices for aerospace applications.

30|$|Most of {{the other}} studies, however, use a simpler {{approach}} for fabrication of flexible molds for the R 2 R and R 2 P NIL processes, where a replica of a master mold is used as the <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> for the roller imprint process. In general, the desired structures are first patterned onto a silicon or quartz substrate using conventional nanolithography techniques such as EBL and followed by the RIE process, similar to its P 2 P variant. The replication of the master mold can then be conducted using several methods. One of the common techniques involves deposition of an anti-stick layer onto the master mold, followed by a layer of metal such as nickel directly onto the master mold, where it will then be peeled off {{to be used as}} a <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> in the roller nanoimprint process as observed in [32, 43, 46]. In some cases such as in [30], an imprint replica of the master mold is first obtained using nanoimprint lithography (step-and-repeat technique) onto a resist-coated wafer, where a nickel layer is then deposited onto the imprint and peeled off to be used as the <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> in the imprint process published in [42].|$|E
30|$|One of the {{important}} challenges of producing roller molds is the surface planarity of the attached <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> [51]. A similar uniformity is needed to achieve imprint rollers {{in order to prevent}} transmission of low-frequency and long-range surface waviness onto the replicated pattern.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} novel polymer based wafer level {{fabrication}} process for micro thermoelectric generators (µTEGs) {{for the application}} on non-planar surfaces. The generators are fabricated by subsequent electrochemical deposition (ECD) of Cu and Ni in a 190 µm-thick <b>flexible</b> polymer <b>mold</b> formed by photolithographic (PL) patterning of SU- 8. First generators were tested and characterized. The TEG generated a power of 12. 0 ± 1. 1 nW/cm 2 for a ∆T of 0. 12 K at the µTEG interface, which is equivalent to a thermoelectric powerfactor of 0. 83 µWK- 2 cm- 2...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To reduce {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) susceptibility distortion at the air/tissue interphase in animal experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the applicability of a body-adaptable <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> consisting of a fast-setting alginate.

40|$|The present work {{demonstrates}} an electro-optic polymer based Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulator fabricated utilizing advanced ultraviolet (UV) imprinting and aligned {{ink-jet printing}} technologies for patterning and layer deposition.

30|$|A full {{experimental}} {{detail of}} airbrushing {{is described elsewhere}} [12]. Briefly, an airbrusher (compressed propellant blown at the maximum pressure of 0.15  MPa) connected to a compressed air cylinder and resist material vessel is mounted vertically over the substrate with the 15  cm distance. For the substrate materials, we choose polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films and Si wafers as the representatives of flexible and rigid substrates, respectively. In this study, we use epoxy-silsesquioxane (SSQ) mixed with 3  wt% photoacid generator as a UV-curable resist material [13] whose concentration can be modulated (e.g., 2, 5, 10, and 20  wt%) by diluting in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA). Airbrushing time of the diluted SSQ resist onto the target substrate is varied (e.g., 1, 2, and 3  s). A R 2 R NIL processing is performed on the SSQ-coated substrate by using the custom-built 400  mm-wide R 2 R NIL instrument [14], at the imprinting pressure of ~ 5 psi, followed by UV curing. Here, <b>flexible</b> <b>molds</b> bearing the 700  nm-period and 500  nm-deep nanograting and the microscale dot array are prepared by the soft lithography method [15] using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The mold area can be scaled up as needed to wrap around the roll, by performing the tiling of master mold pieces in a slightly overlapped fashion [16].|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{fabrication}} method for large-area hybrid polymer microring resonators using a rib waveguide configuration with a minimum residual layer down to 40 nm by ultraviolet (UV) nanoimprint lithography. In a first step, a negative photoresist (SU 8 - 2) patterned by photolithography on an SiO 2 /silicon wafer {{was used as a}} master <b>mold.</b> <b>Flexible</b> soft <b>molds</b> using perfluoropolyether (PFPE) -based elastomers for high-resolution replica molding are explored in the imprinting process flow. High-quality devices with Q-factors up to 39000 and finesses up to F similar to 14 were demonstrated for very-near infrared wavelengths (around 900 nm). Finally, we report that the resonances can be thermooptically tuned by 0. 05 nm/degrees C at 896 nm, thus demonstrating that, at shorter wavelengths, the fabricated microring resonators are less sensitive to temperature change, compared with longer wavelengths. The results of this paper demonstrate the capability of our method to fabricate optical devices with high performance for operation in a single mode at wavelengths where cheap light sources are available and water absorption is much lower than at far-infrared wavelengths. Because of this, it is expected that the fabricated structures have high potential for biosensing applications...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} types of {{equipment}} used in isostatic powder compacting. There is the <b>mold,</b> which is <b>flexible,</b> a pressure <b>mold</b> that contains the mold, and the machine delivering the pressure.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of a large}} area mold {{is one of the}} most difficult challenges in the roll to roll nanoimprint field and eliminating the visible seams on a large areamold is evenmore difficult. We present a visually tolerable tiling (VTT) method to make large area micro/nano-patterns without visible seams and their applications. In this study, with small area micro/nano-pattern molds, the VTT method could produce a scaled up mold with the same features as the original mold without any visible seamlines. Also, a fabricated large sizemold was used in the roll to roll imprinting process as a <b>flexible</b> <b>mold.</b> By using the VTT method, large size metal wire grid polarizers and micro-prism sheets were fabricated and their potential was confirmed as feasible applications...|$|E
30|$|However, unlike P 2 P and R 2 P NIL {{processes}} which utilize a flat mold, continuous R 2 R and R 2 P (using {{a roller}} mold) NIL processes require a roller mold for imprinting. Out {{of all the}} available fabrication techniques, a <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> is generally used {{in the application of}} a roller mold. It is a challenge [35 – 37] as the mold has to be flexible enough to be bent and wrapped around the imprint roller yet has sufficient strength and modulus to imprint onto the polymer resists [40, 60]. The mold should also have good wear resistance properties as it will be used to imprint polymer resists over a large number of cycles in repetition. Hence, material selection is important as its properties determine the above requirements as well as several issues commonly observed in NIL processes.|$|E
40|$|A {{waveguide}} Bragg grating {{temperature sensor}} implemented using a hybrid inorganic-organic material (Ormocer) with a 25 -times higher temperature sensitivity than a typical silica fiber is presented. The sensor consists of second order gratings (1010 -nm pitch) in 5 mu m x 5 mu m waveguides fabricated on a planar substrate using the replication-based methods. The gratings were imprinted in the under-cladding layer, and the waveguide cores were patterned on top by capillary filling of microchannels, which were defined in a transparent and <b>flexible</b> <b>mold.</b> The somewhat larger, slightly multimode waveguides facilitate pigtailing with an optical fiber but lead to three reflection peaks {{corresponding to the}} different excited waveguide modes. The peak at the longest wavelength (Bragg wavelength at 1539 nm, corresponding to the fundamental mode) was tracked during temperature testing, and a sensitivity of - 249 pm degrees C- 1 was found...|$|E
30|$|Alternatively, {{the imprint}} {{replica of the}} master mold may also be {{produced}} via the polymer cast molding technique using non-sticking polymers such as PDMS or ETFE {{to be used as}} the <b>flexible</b> soft <b>mold</b> for the imprint process as observed in the work of a few research groups [7, 15, 35]. It is highlighted in the work of Ye et al. [59] that polymer cast molds (typically made of PDMS) are usually more preferable in the UV-based roller imprinting process due to their advantages of being low cost, low surface energy (fewer sticking issues), chemically inert, elastic, and simpler to produce as compared to metal molds.|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, vulcanization is {{a necessary}} step to prepare the uncured silicone mold for spin casting production. Under controlled heat and pressure the silicone slowly cures to a heat-resistant, <b>flexible,</b> permanent <b>mold.</b> The vulcanizing press or vulcanizer uniformly compresses the mold while exposing it to high temperature {{over a period of}} several hours. The vulcanizer consists of a pair of parallel heated platens mounted on a hydraulic press. Smaller or home-made vulcanizers may compress the mold via screws or a heavy duty clamp instead of hydraulic pressure. Some spin casting operations choose to forgo running their own vulcanizer and instead contract out their mold production.|$|R
5000|$|MidAmeriCon also {{presented}} another Worldcon first, a [...] "themed" [...] base {{used for the}} Hugo Award: [...] "The Dragon and the Rocket". Instead of being made out of finished wood in square or angled stacked shapes, as in the past, all bases were cast from <b>flexible</b> <b>molds</b> using a marbled effect achieved by combining contrasting tinted porcelain powder layers with resin and a hardener. When cured, a low-luster clear outer finish was then applied. Each example featured a sculpted, just-hatched dragon (representing the fantasy genre) wrapped half-way around each round 4.5" [...] tall base. The traditional 13" [...] tall, four-finned Hugo rocket (representing science fiction) was John Millard's newer 1973 design; a dozen examples had been machined from billet aluminum stock and then finished with an overall semi-gloss clear outer coat. The flat top of each base had a 4-inch diameter, quarter-inch thick, sand-blasted aluminum [...] "transition" [...] disk that each rocket sat upon. The rocket and disc where then friction tightened to the base through its center using a long threaded bolt and nut; each base's round, flat bottom was then covered with adhesive-backed black felt to hide the recessed attachment point. A curved black-and-silver engraved Hugo information plate was affixed by two screws to the base's side facing away from the wrapped dragon. The overall base design was by convention chairman Ken Keller, with the final finished design and casting master sculpted by three-time Hugo Award-winning fan artist Tim Kirk (who {{went on to win}} his fourth Hugo in the same category that year).|$|R
30|$|As for the R 2 R NIL process, {{an imprint}} roller with a {{patterned}} surface (or wrapped with a <b>flexible</b> <b>mold)</b> {{is used to}} imprint onto a flexible substrate on a supporting roller instead of a flat plate in R 2 P NIL processes. The entire process {{is based on the}} roll-to-roll manufacturing concept, which has the advantages of continuous process and high throughput [39, 40] and, hence, provides a highly promising solution for industrial-scale applications. While R 2 P methods have great advantages over conventional P 2 P NIL in terms of imprint force, throughput, and size of equipment, it still has several limitations in realizing a continuous imprinting process [36]. Even though studies have been conducted to allow continuous imprinting in R 2 P systems as observed in [36, 37], the throughput of the process remains lower in R 2 P NIL since time is needed to lift and return the imprint roller in position. This also requires an additional high-precision linear drive system for positioning and alignment, which makes it less favorable compared to R 2 R NIL.|$|E
30|$|Despite the advantages, it {{is noted}} that there are several {{challenges}} in realizing the continuous R 2 R NIL process. One of the main challenges is the fabrication of the special <b>flexible</b> <b>mold,</b> which will be discussed in further sections. In addition, an integrated continuous resist coating mechanism is also required in a continuous R 2 R NIL process as the substrate is continuously being fed for imprinting. This poses a challenge as it would require a more complicated mechanism and uniformity control [40] as compared to spin coating, which is much simpler and has been used in almost all studies on P 2 P and some non-continuous R 2 P systems [14, 18, 21 – 25, 35, 48 – 50]. Selection of resist material is also important as it needs to have good coating properties and low viscosity [4, 40]. The issue, however, is not observed in studies involving direct imprinting onto a polymer substrate [45], although such method tends to require higher imprinting force and elevated temperature as compared to their UV-based counterparts.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} degradation in commercial dental nanofilled adhesive resins using quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF). Three adhesives were selected: D/E resin (DR), Single Bond Plus (SB), and G-Bond (GB). The adhesives were mixed with porphyrin for the QLF analysis. Specimens were prepared by dispensing blended adhesives into a <b>flexible</b> <b>mold</b> and polymerizing. Then, the QLF analysis of the specimens was done and the porphyrin values (Simple Plaque Score and ΔR) were measured. After thermocycling of the specimens (5000 cycles, 5 to 55 °C) for the degradation, the specimens were assayed by QLF again. The porphyrin values were analyzed using paired t-test at a 95 % confidence level. A significant reduction in SPS was observed in all groups after thermocycling. The ΔR significantly decreased after thermocycling except area ΔR 30 of SB group. Overall, porphyrin values decreased after thermocycling which indicates that the degradation of the adhesive resins may be measured by the change of porphyrin value. The QLF method could be used to evaluate the degradation of adhesive resin...|$|E
