6000|$|Grant smiled, {{more with}} his lips than his eyes. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I taught you to shoot {{as well as}} most men, Hetty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She wouldn't {{go in the}} parlour, {{but come}} right out here in her fine clothes. I told her I didn't think she belonged in a kitchen--but I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> her an injustice," [...] said Euphrasia, slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, however, {{where he}} is. All I {{know is what}} I have communicated to you--the {{contents}} of this letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I callated," [...] he cried, {{still holding}} Wetherell's {{hand in a}} mild, but persuasive grip. [...] "So <b>I</b> callated. <b>Guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> you an injustice, Will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> then," [...] said a sulky man, who was {{preparing}} to wheel away Marian's trunk. [...] "He's about to shift his billet to the Gran' Central." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lemuel {{knew that}} his hour had come, if ever it were to come, and he said hoarsely: [...] "I guess if I made you take cold that day, it wasn't all I did. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> worse than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I--er--I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that night," [...] {{answered}} Will Jackson in some confusion. [...] "Anyway, I'm a great potato eater," [...] {{he added}} lightly. Later on the others {{found out that}} Spud had a vivid imagination and {{did not hesitate to}} [...] "draw the long bow" [...] for the sake of telling a good story.|$|E
6000|$|... "What if I did?" [...] the man replied gruffly. [...] "I can't help {{where the}} bush rangers pay their visits. Yes, {{they came in}} here and said they wanted some supper; and you may <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not keep them waiting long, for they were not in a {{particularly}} good temper. From what they said, three of their men had been killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jefferson {{looked at}} him curiously. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I'd mix myself a good strong pick-me-up if I were you. You have had {{something}} on your mind the last day or two." ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Mollified--with a smile.] Well, I wouldn't blame you, at that. <b>Guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> look rotten--yust {{out of the}} {{hospital}} two weeks. I'm going to have another 'ski. What d'you say? Have something on me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true." [...] Mrs. Lander brightened and warmed again. [...] "I guess it's all right. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> right, and <b>I</b> {{got to be}} satisfied. I presume I {{could get}} the consul to make me a will any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was {{the major}} motif," [...] he hurriedly explained, [...] "the big underrunning motif, the cosmic and {{universal}} thing. I {{tried to make it}} keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial after all. I was on the right scent, but I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it badly. I did not succeed in suggesting what I was driving at. But I'll learn in time." ...|$|E
60|$|The Duchess. Thankee, miss. You see, thar's no one {{the boy has}} {{any claim}} on but me, and I ain't the proper person to bring him up. I did allow {{to send him to}} 'Frisco, last year; but when I heerd talk that a schoolma'am was comin' up, and you did, and he sorter tuk to ye natril from the first, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> well to keep him yer. For, oh, miss, he loves ye so much; and, if you could hear him talk in his purty way, ye wouldn't refuse him anything.|$|E
6000|$|Bolton sighed deeply, and {{continued}} in a strain whose diffusiveness at last became perceptible to Miss Kilburn through her own humiliation. [...] "There's some in every community that's bound to complain, I don't {{care what you}} do to accommodate 'em; and what I done, I done as much to stop their clack as anything, and give him the right sort of a start off, an' I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But Mis' Bolton she didn't know but what you'd look at it in the light of a libbutty, and I didn't know but what you would think I no business to done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jimmy, reflectively, [...] "if it's the {{one that}} was Barbara last time, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You have been finding out the rest of it since you met her at the ranch? She was up yonder ten minutes ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{can they}} be going to do now?" [...] Tom said. [...] "Some fresh piece of homage, <b>I</b> should <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> wish they would leave us alone. It is {{annoying}} enough {{to be treated as}} a god, without being disturbed by these constant worshippings." ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Deeply {{moved and}} troubled--forcing a {{trembling}} laugh.] So {{you told him}} that, Mat? No wonder he was mad. [Forcing out the words.] Well, maybe it's true, Mat. Maybe <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> been thinking and thinking--I didn't want to, Mat, I'll own up to that--I tried to cut it out--but--[She laughs helplessly.] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can't help it anyhow. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> Mat. [Then with a sudden joyous defiance.] Sure <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> What's the use of kidding myself different? Sure I love you, Mat! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next morning}} I had my breakfast {{brought up on}} deck instead of going down, for, as you may <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not want to have}} your mother {{questioning}} me; but presently your sister came up with a message to me that Mistress Martin would be glad to have a quarter of an hour's conversation with me as soon as duty would permit me to leave deck. So after awhile I braced myself up and went below, but I tell you that I would rather have gone into action again with the Don Pedro. She began at once, without parley or courtesies, by firing a broadside right into me.|$|E
60|$|We circled him {{and drew}} the flying-fish bait {{so that he would}} swim near it. As it was, I had to reel in some. Presently we had the bait some twenty yards ahead of him. Then Captain Dan slowed down. The broadbill wiggled his tail and slid out of sight. Dan said he was going for my bait. But I did not believe so. Several moments passed. I had given up any little hope I might have had when I {{received}} a quick, strong, vibrating strike--different from any I had ever experienced. I suppose the strangeness was due to the shock he gave my line when he struck the bait with his sword. The line paid out unsteadily and slowly. I looked at Dan and he looked at me. Neither of us was excited nor particularly elated. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not realize what was actually going on.|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} a {{pleasant}} room, with deep divans upholstered in pale colours, and palm-trees standing behind little tables, and a black upright piano. Our bounder sat on the piano-stool and gave us an exhibition. He splashed out noise on the piano in splashes, like water splashing out of a pail. He lifted his head and shook his black mop of hair, and yelled out some fragments of opera. And he wriggled his large, bounder's back upon the piano stool, wriggling upon his well-filled haunches. Evidently {{he had a great}} deal of feeling for music: but very little prowess. He yelped it out, and wriggled, and splashed the piano. His friend the other bounder, a quiet one in a pale suit, with stout limbs, older than the wriggler, stood by the piano whilst the young one exhibited. Across the space of carpet sat the two brother jewellers, deep in a divan, their lean, semi-blond faces quite inscrutable. The q-b sat next to me, asking for this and that music, none of which the wriggler could supply. He knew four scraps, and a few splashes--not more. The elder bounder stood near him quietly comforting, encouraging, and admiring him, as a lover encouraging and admiring his ingénue betrothed. And the q-b sat bright-eyed and excited, admiring that a man could perform so unself-consciously self-conscious, and give himself away with such generous wriggles. For my part, as you may <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not admire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Know him? jest <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> His name is Jim Haskett, {{and he used}} to be {{the mate}} of the Sunflower, a three-master from Penobscot. I sailed under him once, and he was the hardest man on {{shipboard}} I ever got next to. If he gets in the navy, he'll make everybody under him dance to his pipings, and worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Laura,' said Philip, with a smile, 'I am equally {{far from}} <b>guessing</b> what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> {{if my mother}} had been {{anything}} but what she was, as from <b>guessing</b> what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> if <b>I</b> had a talent for music.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did. He {{slapped me}} in the face. That angered me so greatly that I pitched into him without {{thinking}} twice. It was all done in a few seconds. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I'd <b>do</b> it again," [...] added Jack. [...] "I wouldn't let anybody slap me without getting back at him. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that I'd make a mighty poor soldier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{not much}} like his son. There's no sort of {{business}} about him. I don't {{know just how}} you'd describe him. He's tall; and he's got white hair and a moustache; and his fingers are very long and limber. I couldn't help noticing them as he sat there with {{his hands on the}} top of his cane. Didn't seem to be dressed very much, and acted just like anybody. Didn't talk much. <b>Guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> most of the talking. Said he was glad I seemed to be getting along so well with his son. He asked after you and Irene; and he said he couldn't feel just like a stranger. Said you had been very kind to his wife. Of course I turned it off. Yes," [...] said Lapham thoughtfully, with his hands resting on his knees, and his cigar between the fingers of his left hand, [...] "I guess he meant to do the right thing, every way. Don't know as I ever saw a much pleasanter man. Dunno but what he's about the pleasantest man I ever did see." [...] He was not letting his wife see in his averted face the struggle that revealed itself there--the struggle of stalwart achievement not to feel flattered at the notice of sterile elegance, not to be sneakingly glad of its amiability, but to stand up and look at it with eyes on the same level. God, who made us so much like himself, but out of the dust, alone knows when that struggle will end. The time had been when Lapham could not have imagined any worldly splendour which his dollars could not buy if he chose to spend them for it; but his wife's half discoveries, taking form again in his ignorance of the world, filled him with helpless misgiving. A cloudy vision of something unpurchasable, where he had supposed there was nothing, had cowed him in spite of the burly resistance of his pride.|$|E
5000|$|According to Kyuss tribute Blog Hugo Garcia, the {{producer}} of this album, said [...] "In 2005 I released a Kyuss Tribute album called [...] "Listen Without Distraction". It was a CD full of 16 Kyuss cover songs done by 16 bands from my country, Argentina. As you can <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that tribute CD to show my love for Kyuss, a band that was not very well known in my country. Time has passed and Kyuss popularity has grown a lot in my country... I guess you can {{blame it on the}} internet".|$|E
5000|$|In 2006 {{she took}} {{on the task of}} {{building}} the Alwaleed bin Talal foundation, previously known as Kingdom Foundation. This foundation is the philanthropic arm of the Kingdom Holding company. In this capacity, she is developing and implementing the foundation’s mission, vision, and operations for strategic philanthropy and humanitarian assistance. She is responsible for the global philanthropic activities, projects, and donations that reach the globe. When asked about getting this job {{she said in an interview}} with Aljazeera English [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> such a good job that he offered me the foundation".|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> like it! {{and cried}} {{because no one}} was ever so good to me before, and I couldn't help it. As for patronising, you may walk on me if you want to, and I won't mind," [...] said Phebe, {{in a burst of}} gratitude, for the words, [...] "we are sisters" [...] went {{straight}} to her lonely heart and nestled there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Nome, [...] "I {{knew all the}} Oz people, and you can <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not love them. All during my wanderings I have brooded on how I can be revenged on them. Now that I've met you I can see a way to conquer the Land of Oz and be King there myself, which is better than being King of the Nomes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes,"--he {{took it from}} her--"the biggest {{that has}} been thrown into the arena for quite a while. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> with it for that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Neil Storey, Dragon's drummer, died of {{a heroin}} {{overdose}} in September 1976. The group considered disbanding but continued with Kerry Jacobson on drums as their single, [...] "This Time", reached the Kent Music Report top 40 singles chart. Hunter later detailed their performance style, [...] "its hard to describe Dragon because what the songs were and what the band did live on stage were so opposed to each other, it was quite schizo really. We had nice happy songs but mock rape scenes happening on stage, people vomiting into buckets. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> approach performing in a living theatre way. I {{used to think that}} if people wanted something then give it to them and let them decide if they like it or not." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of Disco Demolition Night, Dahl {{attained}} national recognition and his popularity increased significantly. He established a syndicate and the Steve and Garry show began airing in Detroit and Milwaukee, where it performed well. However, in February 1981, WLUP fired Dahl, citing [...] "continued assaults on community standards". [...] "It {{was going on in}} El Paso and Los Angeles, like, on Monday, and on Friday they fired me," [...] Dahl later said. Meier was offered the opportunity to continue the show by himself, but he refused. I always used to get ticked off when I would get lumped in with Howard Stern as being a shock jock. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> shock people, but I did it unintentionally. It comes out of who I am. Steve Dahl ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{was a bit}} {{surprised}} to go early {{because there are a}} lot of great players here, but I'm a pretty happy kid right now," [...] Ward said. [...] "I was hoping to go in the first round but you never know what's going to happen. It was a pretty open field and I guess Devils liked me. They flew me to Toronto for a physical test and an interview month and I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> well." [...] Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello was impressed with Ward's potential to be yet another hard-hitting New Jersey blueliner, stating [...] "We liked Ward's potential as far as his upside is concerned," [...] Lamoriello said. [...] "We have guys like Scott Stevens and Ken Daneyko on our team and this young man like them. He's strong now, he's mean, and he's got skills." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Guess I do!" [...] was the snorted-out reply. [...] "They {{came around}} to my place yesterday, and stole my apples and pears, and talked sassy to my darter an' the hired man. I saw 'em, but they ran, away before I could git my hands on 'em. I vowed I take 'em down a peg when I met 'em, an' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> it," [...] added the old farmer, with evident satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|The King. He'll take no harm of it. I'll follow presently..... He's all his mother's now {{and none}} of mine-- Her very face on the bride-pillow. Yet I tricked her. But that was later--and she never <b>guessed.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think he sinned much--he's too young-- Much {{the same age as}} my Queen. God must not judge him Too hardly for such slips as youth may fall in. But I'll entreat that Throne.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that was}} what I was thinking. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> sha'n't <b>do</b> it, though. <b>I</b> sh'd neva have the courage." [...] Clementina laughed and then fell rather seriously silent again.|$|R
