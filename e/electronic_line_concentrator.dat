40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{personal}} handyphone system (PHS) service {{began in}} Japan in 1995. As this new communication service matched social needs well, {{the number of}} subscribers quickly reached 7 million in just two years. The changes of the social needs for telephone services progressed {{from the age of}} “phones to more homes ” to one of “a phone for each person. ” This means that we have entered the age of personal communication. In addition, a user’s needs for anytime, anywhere voice and data communication have also increased recently. Against the backdrop of this, the recent immense strides in multimedia, mobile switching and radio communication technologies are attracting attention for the implementation of personal land mobile communications.

40|$|The solar photospheric carbon {{abundance}} {{has been}} determined from [C I], C I, CH vibration-rotation, CH A-X electronic and C 2 Swan <b>electronic</b> <b>lines</b> {{by means of a}} time-dependent, 3 D, hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. Departures from LTE have been considered for the C I lines. These turned out to be of increasing importance for stronger lines and are crucial to remove a trend in LTE abundances with the strengths of the lines. Very gratifying agreement is found among all the atomic and molecular abundance diagnostics in spite of their widely different line formation sensitivities. The mean of the solar carbon abundance based on the four primary abundance indicators ([C I], C I, CH vibration-rotation, C_ 2 Swan) is log C = 8. 39 +/- 0. 05, including our best estimate of possible systematic errors. Consistent results also come from the CH <b>electronic</b> <b>lines,</b> which we have relegated to a supporting role due to their sensitivity to the line broadening. The new 3 D based solar C abundance is significantly lower than previously estimated in studies using 1 D model atmospheres. Comment: Accepted for A&A, 13 page...|$|R

40|$|Centralized {{computer}} networks are hierarchical communication infrastructures {{in which a}} central computer services {{a large number of}} terminals or workstations. For a large network, some concentrators are commonly used to increase the cost efficiency. Several terminals are connected to a concentrator via low capacity <b>lines,</b> and each <b>concentrator</b> is connected to the central computer via a high capacity <b>line.</b> A <b>concentrator</b> is generally subject to technological constraints on the amount of traffic it can manage, and each terminal has its capacity requirement. The problem then is to determine the number and location of concentrators and to allocate the terminals to these concentrators at minimum cost. This is known as the concentrator location problem. If the number and location of concentrators are already known beforehand, the problem then reduces to determining the allocation of terminals only. This is known as the terminal assignment problem. These problems are NP-complete. Therefore, finding a polynomial time algorithm to solve them to optimality is highly unlikely. This study aims to develop some efficient algorithms based on simulated annealing to solve these problems. The results are compared to those given by some existing heuristics...|$|R
