40|$|Abstract — Ceiling {{fans are}} one of the mostly used comfort device in {{domestic}} use. Air <b>delivery</b> produced from <b>fan</b> is multiple of the rotational frequency of the <b>fan.</b> Air <b>delivery</b> {{is one of the most}} important parameter. To analyze the air delivered from the fan was important to identify the parameters affecting it. Ceiling fans are extensively used to create an indoor breeze, improve the space air distribution and hence enhance the feeling of comfort. The fan speed, room size, number of blades and downrod length all play an important role in deciding the induced flow pattern features in space. Few previous studies have investigated fan induced flow and its characteristics under different geometric and operating conditions. In this study,response surface methodology was used to predict air <b>delivery</b> from the <b>fan.</b> The experiments were conducted based on three different Fan Blade, three different room volume, three different downrod lengths, three different fan speeds and mathematical model was developed. For targeted air delivery optimum levels of input parameters were selected using optimization analysis...|$|R

The project has reviewed the variety of inertisation system available in Australia and their technical specifications. Particular {{attention has been given}} to the GAG, Mine Shield, Tomlinson and Floxel approaches. Exercises which involved “evaluation or auditing ” of selected mines as to the ability to deliver inert gases generated from GAG units to high priority underground fire locations have been undertaken in a number of mines. These exercises have been built around the use of the fire simulation computer program “Ventgraph ” and modelling of fire scenarios in selected different mine layouts. A coding system has been developed from these audit exercises. Designs have been developed of high pressure/compressor <b>fans</b> to allow <b>delivery</b> of high volumes of inert gases down “emergency drilled ” mine bore holes of 200 to 3, 000 mm diameter.

40|$|Sound {{pressure}} measurements were recorded for {{a prototype of}} a spacecraft cabin ventilation fan in a test in the NASA Glenn Acoustical Testing Laboratory. The axial fan is approximately 0. 089 m (3. 50 in.) in diameter and 0. 223 m (9. 00 in.) long and has nine rotor blades and eleven stator vanes. At design point of 12, 000 rpm, the fan was predicted to produce a flow rate of 0. 709 cu m/s (150 cfm) and a total pressure rise of 925 Pa (3. 72 in. of water) at 12, 000 rpm. While the fan {{was designed to be}} part of a ducted atmospheric revitalization system, no attempt was made to throttle the flow or simulate the installed configuration during this test. The fan was operated at six speeds from 6, 000 to 13, 500 rpm. A 13 -microphone traversing array was used to collect sound {{pressure measurements}} along two horizontal planes parallel to the flow direction, two vertical planes upstream of the fan inlet and two vertical planes downstream of the fan exhaust. Measurements indicate that sound at blade passing frequency harmonics contribute significantly to the overall audible noise produced by the <b>fan</b> at free <b>delivery</b> conditions...|$|R
40|$|Branched {{glycerol}} dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are membrane lipids ofbacteria. The {{number of}} methyl {{groups of the}} alkyl chains in brGDGTs correlates with the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and soil pH, {{while the number of}} cyclopentane moieties correlates with soil pH. Based on this observation the methylation index of branched tetraethers (MBT) and the cyclisation index of branched tetraethers (CBT) were introduced. Since brGDGTs are found in large quantities in soil, it was assumed that they are washed into rivers by erosion and transported to the ocean. Hence, the MBT/CBT proxy can be used in river influenced marine settings to reconstruct past MAAT and soil pH of the river basin. In this study the applicability of the MBT/CBT proxy in diverse river systems was assessed, by detailed studies of two river systems that are different in terms of river size and climate setting (Amazon River and Tagus River). BrGDGTs in drainage basin, soils and river suspended particulate matter (SPM) were compared to those in marine SPM and surface sediments. Core lipid (CL) and intact polar lipid (IPL) -derived brGDGTs were analyzed, in order to distinguish recently produced (IPL-derived) GDGTs from older (CL) GDGTs. The majority of brGDGTs in the Amazon River is derived from lowland basin soils. However, the distribution of CL and IPL-derived brGDGTs was slightly different to that of the soils, which showed that in-situ production of brGDGTs also played a role. The influence of seasonal variation on the brGDGT distribution is relatively small, but significant differences were detected. During the high water season the input of brGDGTs from soil increased, which was seen in increased brGDGT concentrations and a brGDGT distribution that was most similar to that of soil. During the other seasons the influence of in-situ production of brGDGTs increased. In the Amazon shelf and <b>fan,</b> the <b>delivery</b> of brGDGTs from the Amazon River was evident. However, further away from the river, the distributions of CL brGDGTs in marine SPM and sediments varied widely, since this difference was also found in IPL-derived brGDGTs it is most likely due to marine in-situ production. In the Tagus basin soils the brGDGT distributions were very variable and did not reflect the local MAAT and soil pH. The concentrations of brGDGTs in river SPM were substantially higher and the distributions were different compared to those of the drainage basin soils. This indicates that brGDGTs are mainly produced in the river itself. Therefore, the MAAT and soil pH cannot be reconstructed with the commonly used soil calibrations. Along the Portuguese margin the brGDGT concentrations rapidly decreased with increasing distance from the shore. The brGDGT distributions in marine SPM and surface sediments also changed, indicating that marine in-situ production takes place. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of a detailed study of a river basin to interpret the MBT/CBT records for paleoreconstructions in adjacent marine setting. In general, it is recommendable to apply the MBT/CBT proxy only to sediment which was under strong river influence...|$|R
