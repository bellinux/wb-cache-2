25|$|Species-specific defense {{reactions}} (SSDRs) or avoidance {{learning in}} nature is the specific tendency to avoid certain threats or stimuli, {{it is how}} animals survive in the wild. Humans and animals both share these species-specific defense reactions, such as the flight, fight, which also include pseudo-aggression, fake or intimidating aggression, freeze response to threats, which {{is controlled by the}} sympathetic nervous system. These SSDRs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species, other species, and interaction with the environment. These acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten. The animal that survives is the animal that already <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> fear and how to avoid this threat. An example in humans is the reaction to the sight of a snake, many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they are jumping away from, and in some cases it is a stick rather than a snake.|$|E

What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then someone said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We’ve just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we’ve had such pain getting to that place, I’m not sure anyone quite <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with it anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega." ...|$|E

500|$|While some {{of these}} {{problems}} were due to mechanical failures, and responsibility for some of the others is still being debated, Kraft did not hesitate to assign blame to Carpenter, and continued to speak out about the mission for decades afterwards. His autobiography, written in 2001, reopened the issue; the chapter that dealt with the flight of Mercury-Atlas 7 was titled [...] "The Man Malfunctioned." [...] In a letter to the New York Times, Carpenter called the book [...] "vindictive and skewed," [...] and offered a different assessment of the reasons for Kraft's frustration: [...] "in space things happen so fast that only the pilot <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, and even ground control can't help. Maybe that's why he is still fuming after all these years." ...|$|E
500|$|Dean {{considers}} that José {{is the central}} figure of the opera: [...] "It is his fate rather than Carmen's that interests us". The music characterizes his gradual decline, act by act, from honest soldier to deserter, vagabond and finally murderer. In act 1 he is a simple countryman aligned musically with Micaëla; in act 2 he evinces a greater toughness, {{the result of his}} experiences as a prisoner, {{but it is clear that}} by the end of the act his infatuation with Carmen has driven his emotions beyond control. Dean describes him in act 3 as a trapped animal who refuses to leave his cage even when the door is opened for him, ravaged by a mix of conscience, jealousy and despair. In the final act his music assumes a grimness and purposefulness that reflects his new fatalism: [...] "He will make one more appeal; if Carmen refuses, he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do".|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, the band were approached by their management about whom they wanted to produce their debut full-length album. They requested Colin Richardson; initially sceptical about their chances, Richardson agreed to collaborate after he listened to their demos. Fightstar entered studios in west London and Surrey with Richardson in October 2005. Richardson, who had previously produced albums for Funeral for a Friend, Machine Head and Fear Factory, was meticulous during pre-production and took five days to tune the drums. When recording began, he called the band [...] "very focused" [...] and {{said that there was}} a [...] "real buzz because nobody <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect." [...] Grand Unification is a loose concept album, influenced by and based on the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series. With lyrics loosely based on the personal experiences of Charlie Simpson and Alex Westaway, its underlying concept revolves around two people who experience the last few days of their lives {{before the end of the}} world.|$|E

500|$|The title track, {{which was}} not {{featured}} on the original LP, was recorded after the album's release {{at the suggestion of}} Peggy Harris, the artist who designed the Winter collage for the inner sleeve of the LP. Initially, Scott-Heron and Jackson meant for Winter in America to lack a title track, which contrasted their previous label's trend of having their work include title tracks. The album title's purpose meant only to describe the general theme of Winter in Americas songs. According to Scott-Heron, a title track [...] "separates {{from the rest of the}} lyrics, better, or worse or different." [...] The studio version of [...] "Winter in America" [...] was released on his following album, The First Minute of a New Day (1975), while a live version, recorded in 1982 at Washington, D.C.'s Black Wax Club, was included on the 1998 CD reissue of Winter in America. The song features Scott-Heron's poetic references and lyrics that portray America in a dystopian state where [...] "democracy is rag-time on the corner", [...] "the forest is buried beneath the highway", [...] "robins are perched in barren treetops", and, in conclusion, [...] "no one is fighting because no one <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|E
500|$|Continuing {{from the}} ending of [...] "Space", the other Amy reveals that she is from a few moments in the future, {{and is able to}} come into the current outer TARDIS because [...] "the {{exterior}} shell of the TARDIS has drifted forwards in time". The other Amy <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say and do because, from her perspective, she is repeating what she heard herself say earlier on. The Doctor sends the current Amy into the TARDIS within the current TARDIS, in order to [...] "maintain the timeline". The two Amys take a moment to flirt with each other before the current one departs, much to the Doctor's exasperation. However, not long after the current Amy has left, Rory and Amy enter through the door of outer TARDIS [...] explaining that the Doctor, from their perspective, has just sent them into the inner TARDIS. The current Doctor promptly sends the current Rory and the now-current Amy through the inner TARDIS. The Doctor then explains that he will set up a [...] "controlled temporal implosion" [...] in order to [...] "reset the TARDIS", but in order to do so he must know which lever to use on the control panel. Moments after he speaks, another Doctor enters though the outer TARDIS door and tells him to use [...] "the wibbly lever", which he quickly operates, then steps into the inner TARDIS to tell his past self which lever to use. The inner TARDIS dematerialises while the outer TARDIS (being the same TARDIS) does the same, and the Doctor assures Amy and Rory that they are now back in [...] "normal flight", and then advises Amy to [...] "put some trousers on".|$|E

2500|$|On {{merchant}} ships, it {{is taught}} at the various maritime academies that {{the proper way to}} relieve the helm is for the helmsman being relieved to call out loudly the ship's course per gyro, course per standard magnetic compass, steering mode, rudder angle, and the pump the vessel is steering off of.

[...] "She’s always calm with him; she doesn’t try to force anything," [...] Burton points out. [...] "She always <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do: when to push, and when to back off.

2500|$|The United States treaty negotiators had overtly {{misrepresented}} {{the purpose}} and effect of the proposed treaty as merely conveying a [...] "right of passage" [...] over the Ojibwe lands to the United States. [...] The United States intention to bring in settlers {{as well as the}} railroad had been an established policy for years, as was plainly stated in newspapers and governmental reports of the time. [...] Governor Ramsey's journal of the treaty negotiations contained his speech to the assembled Ojibwe in which he, as a trained lawyer and experienced politician and Indian negotiator, directly misrepresented {{the purpose and}} intent of the treaty: Now, there is growing up a trade of considerable importance between the British settlements on the north and the American settlements on the south. ... Now, this is a trade which cannot and must not be interrupted. [...] And their Great Father, feeling this, and desirous to prevent any trouble between his white and red people, has sent us here to come to some understanding with you about it. [...] Their Great Father has no especial desire to get possession of their lands. [...] He does not want their lands at all if {{they do not want to}} part with them. [...] He has more land now than he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with. [...] He simply wishes that his people should enjoy the privilege of traveling through their country on steamboats and wagons unmolested Even after the initial proposal for a mere right of way was rejected, he was representing that if they sold their land, the Ojibwe could still occupy it and hunt on it for a long time.|$|E
