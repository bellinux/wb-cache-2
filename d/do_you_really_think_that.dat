6000|$|The man in gray {{glanced at}} the young clergyman a moment, then quietly whispered to him, [...] "I thought you {{represented}} your friend here as a very distrustful sort of person, but he appears endued with a singular credulity.--Tell me, sir, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a white could look the negro so?

6000|$|... "Why, it's like this," [...] said Father Brown, in his frankly {{doubtful}} way: [...] "We {{are taught}} {{that if a}} man has really bad first principles, that must be partly his fault. But, for all that, we can make some difference between a man who insults his quite clear conscience and {{a man with a}} conscience more or less clouded with sophistries.

6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> Rupert,' she asked, as if Ursula {{were not}} present, 'do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{it is worth}} while? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> the {{children}} are better for being roused to consciousness?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But look here, Mrs. Houseley, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{it makes}} much {{difference}} to a man, {{whether he can}} hold a serious conversation or not?" [...] asked the doctor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I {{had nowhere}} so keen a friend," [...] he said; [...] "but, Mr. Ogilvy, it is devil's work you are pleading. Am I {{to return to}} my people to act a living lie before them {{to the end of}} my days? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> God devastated a glen to give me a chance of {{becoming}} a villain? No, sir, I am in His hands, and I will do what I think right." ...|$|E
6000|$|Amazed at his earnestness, {{and hardly}} able {{to account for}} it altogether, I stood silent a moment; then said, [...] "Why, Frank, this {{midshipman}} is your own brother, you say; now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your {{own flesh and blood}} is going to give himself airs over you, simply because he sports large brass buttons on his coat? Never believe it. If he does, he can be no brother, and ought to be hanged--that's all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{respect that}} women, even well-educated, very able women, have for men," [...] he went on. [...] "I believe {{we must have}} the sort of power over you that we're said to have over horses. They see us three times as big as we are or they'd never obey us. For that very reason, I'm {{inclined}} to doubt that you'll ever do anything even {{when you have the}} vote." [...] He looked at her reflectively. She appeared very smooth and sensitive and young. [...] "It'll take at least six generations before you're sufficiently thick-skinned to go into law courts and business offices. Consider what a bully the ordinary man is," [...] he continued, [...] "the ordinary hard-working, rather ambitious solicitor or man of business with a family to bring up and a certain position to maintain. And then, of course, the daughters have to give way to the sons; the sons have to be educated; they have to bully and shove for their wives and families, and so it all comes over again. And meanwhile there are the women in the background. [...] . <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the vote will do you any good?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> Susan," [...] said Anne, looking solemn enough, [...] "that either Myra Murray or I {{could look}} solemn and holy all the time--ALL the time, Susan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I can come, then?" [...] And Johnny {{stood up}} to try his legs; for he dreaded the long walk, as it seemed to him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Think! That you {{are very}} likely to succeed,' replied Mr. Pickwick, {{with one of his}} beaming smiles. 'Ah!' said Mr. Magnus. 'But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> so, Mr. Pickwick? <b>Do</b> <b>you,</b> though?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{does not}} free the poor gambler from the dishonourable act of risking money {{which was not}} his own; and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if the rich one did know it he would return the money? I think not. The history of {{gambling}} does not point to many, if any, such cases of self-sacrifice. The truth is that selfishness in its meanest form {{is at the bottom}} of all gambling, though many gamblers may not quite see the fact. I want your money. I am too proud to ask it. I dare not demand it. I cannot cajole you out of it. I will not rob you. You are precisely in the same mind that I am. Come, let us resort to a trick, let us make an arrangement whereby one of us at least shall gain his sneaking, nefarious, unjust end, and we will, anyhow, have the excitement of leaving to chance which of us is to be the lucky man. Chance and luck! Dick Sharp, there is no such condition as chance or luck. It is as surely fixed in the mind of God which gambler is to gain and which to lose as it is that the morrow shall follow to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|I must {{trouble you}} with another letter of thanks, dear Mr. Chorley, now that I {{have to thank}} you for the value of the work as well as the {{kindness}} of the gift, for I have read your three volumes of 'Pomfret'[137] with interest and moral assent, and with great pleasure in various ways: it is a pure, true book without effort, which, in these days of gesture and rolling of the eyes, is an uncommon thing. Also you make your 'private judgment' work itself out quietly as a simple part of the love of truth, instead of being the loud heroic virtue it is so apt in real life to profess itself, seldom moving without drums and trumpets and the flying of party colours. All these you have put down rightly, wisely, and boldly, and it was, in my mind, no less wise than bold of you to let in that odour of Tyrrwhitism into the folds of the purple, and so prevent the very possibility of any 'prestige.' If I complained it might be that your 'private judgment' confines its reference to 'public opinion,' and shuns, too proudly perhaps, the higher and deeper relations of human responsibility. But there are difficulties, I see, and you choose your path advisedly, of course. The best character in the book I take to be Rose; I cannot hesitate in selecting him. He is so lifelike with the world's conventional life that you hear his footsteps when he walks, and, indeed, I think his boots were apt to creak just the soupçon of a creak, just as a gentleman's boots might, and he is excellently consistent, even down to the choice of a wife whom he could patronise. I hope you like your own Mr. Rose, and that you will forgive me for jilting Grace for Helena, which I could not help any more than Walter could. But now, may I venture to ask a question? Would it not have been wise of you if, on the point of reserve, you had thrown a deeper shade of opposition into the characters or rather manners of these women? Helena sits like a statue (and could Grace have done more?) when she wins Walter's heart in Italy. Afterwards, and by fits at the time, indeed, the artist fire bursts from her, but {{there was a great deal}} of smouldering when there should have been a clear heat to justify Walter's change of feeling. And then, in respect to that, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your Grace was generous, heroic (with the evidence she had of the change) in giving up her engagement? For her own sake, could she have done otherwise? I fancy not; the position seems surrounded by its own necessities, and no room for a doubt. I write on my own doubts, you see, and you will smile at them, or understand all through them that if the book had not interested me like a piece of real life, I should not find myself backbiting as if all these were 'my neighbours.' The pure tender feeling of the closing scenes touched me to better purpose, believe me, and I applaud from my heart and conscience your rejection of that low creed of 'poetical justice' which is neither justice nor poetry which is as degrading to virtue as false to experience, and which, thrown from your book, raises it into a pure atmosphere at once.|$|E
