Gold Certificates, issued upon the government receiving a deposit of gold, were dated by hand, and also the depositor was identified. Only the depositor could redeem an early gold certificate. Starting with the Series of 1882, Gold Certificates were made payable to the bearer.|$|R
5000|$|Treasury Notes {{were issued}} from 1812 to 1913, and were <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>notes</b> {{issued by the}} United States {{in times of war}} or {{financial}} unrest. Various notes of various denominations were issued during the War of 1812 (large and small size notes), the Panic of 1837, the Mexican-American War, the Panic of 1857, the Civil War and the Panic of 1907. From the Civil War through the Panic of 1907 they were known as [...] "Certificates of Indebtedness".|$|R
2500|$|There {{are a few}} {{regulations}} to which the U.S. Treasury must adhere when redesigning banknotes. The national motto [...] "In God We Trust" [...] must appear on all U.S. currency and coins. [...] Though the motto had periodically appeared on coins since 1865, it did not appear on currency (other than <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>notes</b> in 1861) until a law passed in 1956 required it. [...] It began to appear on Federal Reserve Notes delivered from 1964 to 1966, depending on denomination.|$|R

50|$|From {{almost the}} very {{beginning}} of its operations, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing designed and printed a variety of products in addition to currency. As early as 1864, the offices which would later become the BEP made passports for the State Department and money orders for the Post Office Department. Passports are now produced by the Government Publishing Office. Other early items produced by the BEP included various government debt instruments, such as <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>notes,</b> refunding certificates, compound interest Treasury notes, and bonds. The production of postage stamps began in 1894, and for almost the next century the BEP was the sole producer of postage stamps in the country.|$|R
40|$|During the "free banking" era in eighteenth- {{and early}} nineteenth-century Scotland, {{there were a}} number of legal {{restrictions}} affecting the evolution of the system. Scottish banking was characterized by restrictions on small-denomination and <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>notes.</b> There were also restrictions inhibiting the development of capital markets and entry into banking. Furthermore, the Bank of England operated as a "shadow" central bank for the Scottish system. These considerations call into question the use of the Scottish banking experience as the appropriate model for laissez-faire and as evidence against the "legal restrictions theory of money" and the "new monetary economics.

40|$|James Gherity (1993) reports an {{experience}} that falsifies predictions of the legal restrictions theory of the demand for money. He concludes that this failure is explained by Lawrence H. White's (1987) rather than Gail E. Makinen and G. Thomas Woodward's (1986) hypothesis of why interest-free money is a superior circulating medium. Gherity's conclusion depends on the erroneous proposition that transactions costs of using post-dated <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>notes</b> are avoided by tendering them at par. The experience cannot discriminate between the White explanation and that of Makinen and Woodward. For some of the note issues concerned, neither the legal restrictions theory, White, nor Makinen and Woodward explains the behavior that occurred.

25|$|Large-denomination {{currency}} (i.e., banknotes with a {{face value}} of $500 or higher) {{had been used in}} the United States since the late 18th century. The first $500 note was issued by the Province of North Carolina, authorized by legislation dated May 10, 1780. Virginia quickly followed suit and authorized the printing of $500 and $1,000 notes on October 16, 1780 and $2,000 notes on May 7, 1781. High-denomination treasury notes were issued, for example during the War of 1812 ($1,000 notes authorized by an act dated June 30, 1812). During the American Civil War Confederate currency included $500 and $1,000 notes. During the Federal banknote issuing period (1861 to present), the earliest high-denomination <b>notes</b> included three-year <b>Interest-bearing</b> <b>notes</b> of $500, $1,000, and $5,000, authorized by Congress on July 17, 1861.

50|$|Prior to the Civil War, the United States faced a {{financial}} depression {{subsequent to the}} Panic of 1857, an event facilitated by over-expansion of the domestic economy and a European financial meltdown. In the three years preceding the Civil War, the Federal Government incurred a budget deficit exceeding $40 million. Coupled {{with the threat of}} secession, the Federal deficit placed the US government under considerable financial strain. In 1860, the US Treasury paid between 8 and 12 percent interest on government bonds in order to raise additional funds and meet public expenditures. In December 1861, the US Treasury attempted to sell five millions of <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>notes</b> at 12 percent but found itself able to dispose of only four millions. The Treasury's struggles illustrate the precarious nature of the US government's financial state. As the nation edged closer to war, the need to mobilize a volunteer force placed an additional financial burden upon the Federal government. While treasury notes with enticing interest rates allowed the US government to raise revenue quickly, they also established a need for additional revenue streams with which to pay off interest.|$|R
500|$|With the {{financial}} crisis abated, many in Congress wanted the greenbacks to be withdrawn from circulation. The public had never seen greenbacks as equivalent to specie, and by 1866 they circulated at a considerable discount, although their value had risen {{since the end of}} the war. Hugh McCulloch, the Treasury Secretary under Lincoln and Johnson, believed the notes were an emergency measure only and thought they should be gradually withdrawn. McCulloch proposed a bill, the Contraction Act, to convert some of the greenbacks from notes redeemable in bonds to <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>notes</b> redeemable in coin. Most Senate Finance Committee members had no objection, and Sherman found himself alone in opposition to it, believing that withdrawing greenbacks from circulation would contract the money supply and harm the economy. Sherman instead favored leaving the existing notes in circulation and letting the growth in population catch up to the growth in money supply. He suggested an amendment that would instead just allow the Treasury to redeem the notes for lower-interest bonds, now that the government's borrowing costs had decreased. Sherman's amendment was voted down, and the Contraction Act passed; greenbacks would be gradually withdrawn, but those still circulating would be redeemable for the high-interest bonds as before. In his memoirs, Sherman called this law [...] "the most injurious and expensive financial measure ever enacted by Congress," [...] as the continued high-interest payments it required [...] "added fully $300,000,000 of interest" [...] to the national debt.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Farmer cooperatives {{have often}} {{maintained}} inflexible capital structures which severely restrict members' freedom to allocate their own capital {{in a most}} profitable manner. This {{study was conducted to}} provide insights into how cooperative finance programs might be modified to provide increased capital and, at the same time, be more acceptable to members. The revolving equity certificate means of finance was examined in depth. Of particular interest was the option of certificate transferability which would allow "capital-short" certificate holders the opportunity to reallocate at least a part of their investment in the cooperative association to more preferred investments on their own farms. An anlysis was designed to determine which types of farmers, according to selected farmer characteristics, would be most likely to 1) possess the highest opportunity costs for capital investments on their farms and 2) buy and/or sell revolving equity certificates at some discounted present value of the certificates' specified face amounts. Cooperative member and nonmember preferences for selected means of finance were also examined. The acceptability of alternatives such as long-term <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>notes,</b> stock certificates, revolving equity certificates, and high member ship fees was rated by the farmers in the sample. Conclusions were then reached regarding the general acceptability among farmers of selected means of cooperative finance. Several groups of farmers, according to selected farmer characteristics, expressed a desire to participate in a market for transferable revolving equity certificates. It was concluded that transferability of certificates would provide an opportunity for many farmers to allocate their own capital in a more profitable fashion. Examination of the potential buyer-side of the equity certificate market revealed a relatively thin participation except at high rates of discount. In general, cooperatives could better serve their memberships by carefully planning their alternative means of finance, with. special consideration of those alternatives which would allow the members a reasonable degree of investment flexibility...|$|R

By September 1728, the Bank of Scotland was able to start redeeming its notes again, with interest, and in March 1729, it resumed lending. To prevent similar attacks in the future, the Bank of Scotland put an [...] "option clause" [...] on its notes, giving it {{the right to make}} the <b>notes</b> <b>interest-bearing</b> while delaying payment for six months; the Royal Bank followed suit. Both banks eventually decided that the policy they had followed was mutually self-destructive and a truce was arranged, but it still took until 1751 before the two banks agreed to accept each other's notes.|$|R
40|$|Instances of {{interest-bearing}} currency {{are relatively}} rare. The Southern Confederacy issued both <b>interest-bearing</b> and non-interest-bearing <b>notes</b> during the Civil War.

40|$|In {{the article}} - Planning Buy-Sell Agreements In The Hospitality Industry - by John M. Tarras, Assistant Professor, School of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management at Michigan State University, the author {{initially}} observes: “The {{vast majority of}} hospitality firms (restaurants, hotels, etc.) would be considered closely-held corporations. As such, they have unique planning problems compared to large, publicly-traded hospitality firms. One area of special concern to the closely-held hospitality firm is the planning and adoption of a buy-sell agreement. ” The above thesis statement outlines {{the heart of the}} article; the buy-sell agreement in regard to smaller [closely held, as Tarras calls them] corporations. The theory is narrow and pro-active, spanning the gap between personal-to-corporate stock manipulations. “The primary purpose of a buy-sell agreement is to contribute to the orderly transfer of a shareholder 2 ̆ 7 s stock in a hospitality firm upon some future incident [typically retirement, withdrawal of a shareholder, disability, or death], as Tarras defines the concept. “The hospitality firm or the other shareholders would be committed to purchase the departing shareholder 2 ̆ 7 s stock at an agreed upon price and method, and to ensure that ample cash will be obtainable for such an impending sale. The buy-sell agreement provides a market for the shareholder or the shareholder 2 ̆ 7 s estate for the sale of otherwise illiquid stock,” the author further provides as canons of buy-sell agreements. In defining the buy-sell agreement with restrictive clauses, Tarras demonstrates, “…many closely-held hospitality firms desire to limit ownership to those individuals, either family or principal corporate employees, who are essential to the well-being of the firm. ” Tarras says, another element of the buy-sell agreement is to furnish the departing shareholder with liquidity. “…there typically is some form of cash down payment with the remainder denoted by an <b>interest-bearing</b> promissory <b>note</b> [usually 5 to 15 years],” he informs. “The departing shareholders may require that the hospitality firm pledge the assets of the firm and that the remaining shareholders personally guarantee the promissory note. ” “…the most frequent reason for establishing buy-sell agreements is for estate planning purposes,” Tarras says. There are tax advantages and liabilities for both the seller and buyer of stock via the buy-sell agreement, and the author enumerates many of these. One, big advantage of the buy-sell agreement is that it provides for the running of the company with a minimum of disruption through the stock-cash transition process, Tarras offers...|$|R
