40|$|Is-a {{hierarchies}} {{form the}} foundation of ontologies. That is, is-a hierarchies in an ontology reflect how the ontology captures the essential conceptual structure of the target world. Therefore, in ontological theories, an <b>is-a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> should be single-inheritance because the essential property of things cannot exist in multiple. However, we cannot avoid multi-perspective issues when we build an ontology because the user often want to understand things from their own viewpoints. In order to tackle this multi-perspective issue, the authors take an approach of dynamically generating is-a hierarchies according to the viewpoints of users from an ontology using single-inheritance.

Three different types of value propagation, namely, invariant, transformational, and cumulative, allow for a high degree of expressiveness in the definition of such derived attributes. We also present the notion of a generalized derived attribute, which may be defined in terms of simultaneous value propagations across many part relationships.

Taxonomies were first used by biologists to group organisms into categories such as kingdom, phylum, genus, and species. Taxonomies are often represented as <b>is-a</b> <b>hierarchies</b> where each level is more specific (in mathematical language [...] "a subset of") the level above it. For example, a basic biology taxonomy would have concepts such as mammal, which is a subset of animal, and dogs and cats, which are subsets of mammal.

However, when a domain model is particularly complex, framebased representation may lead to complicated and sometimes awkward solutions. We have encountered such problems when developing the Digital Anatomist Foundational Model, an ontology aimed at representing comprehensively the physical organization of the human body. We show that traditional frame-based techniques such as <b>is-a</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> slots (roles) and role restrictions are not sufficient for a comprehensive model of this domain. The diverse modeling challenges and problems in this project required us to use such knowledge-representation techniques as reified relations, metaclasses and a metaclass hierarchy, different propagation patterns for template and own slots, and so on. We posit that even though the modeling structure imposed by frame-based systems may sometimes lead to complicated solutions, it is still worthwhile to use frame-based representation for very large-scale projects such as this one...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A domain {{ontology}} {{represents a}} shared {{understanding of a}} given sector of reality (for instance, mathematics, economics, tourism etc.). Many application fields like Information Retrieval, Information Extraction and so on, {{as long as the}} Semantic Web [2], the next Web generation, need this kind of structured domain knowledge in order to add the missing semantic layout. However, an accurate search through the Internet shows the lack of large domain ontologies available to the community. In fact, building such knowledge resources requires big efforts in terms of time, costs and work due to the difficulty in identifying and properly defining domain concepts and their inter-relationships. One primary problem in this process is to establish an appropriate <b>is-a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> for the ontology. To this end, general-purpose lexical resources like WordNet [3] can be of help because they code a massive, although nonspecific, quantity of knowledge.

40|$|Abstract. Emerging Patterns (EPs) are a {{data mining}} model that is {{useful as a}} means of {{discovering}} distinctions inherently present amongst a collection of datasets. However, current EP mining algorithms do not handle attributes whose values are asscociated with taxonomies (<b>is-a</b> <b>hierarchies).</b> Current EP mining techniques are restricted to using only the leaf-level attribute-values in a taxonomy. In this paper, we formally introduce the problem of mining generalised emerging patterns. Given a large data set, where some attributes are hierarchical, we find emerging patterns that consist of items at any level of the taxonomies. Generalised EPs are more concise and interpretable when used to describe some distinctive characteristics of a class of data. They are also considered to be more expressive because they include items at higher levels of the hierarchies, which have larger supports than items at the leaf level. We formulate the problem of mining generalised EPs, and present an algorithm for this task. We demonstrate that the discovered generalised patterns, which contain items at higher levels in the hierarchies, have greater support than traditional leaf-level EPs according to our experimental results based on ten benchmark datasets. ...|$|R
40|$|The Graphical Object Query Language (GOQL) is a {{graphical}} {{query language}} that {{complies with the}} ODMG 3. 0 standard and runs {{on top of the}} o 2 DBMS. GOQL provides users with the User's View (UV) and the Folders Window (FW), which serve as the foundation upon which end-users pose ad-hoc queries. The UV is a graphical representation of any underlying ODMG scheme. Among its advantages is that it hides from end-users most of the perplexing details of the object-oriented database model, such as methods, hierarchies and relationships. To achieve this, the UV does not distinguish between methods, attributes and relationships, it encapsulates <b>is-a</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and it utilises a number of desktop metaphors whose semantics can be easily understood by end-users. The FW is a condensed version of the UV and provides the starting point for constructing queries.

40|$|In {{conceptual}} design of engineering devices, a designer decomposes a required function into sub-functions, so-called functional decomposition, using {{a kind of}} functional knowledge representing achievement relations among functions. However, such knowledge about functionality of engineering devices is usually left implicit because each designer possesses it.

Categorization of typical representations of the knowledge and its organization as <b>is-a</b> <b>hierarchies</b> are also discussed. The generic concepts representing functionality of a device in the functional knowledge are provided by the functional concept ontology, which makes the functional knowledge consistent and applicable to other domains.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} a knowledge-based system for the recognition of time varying vital signals, such as electrocardiograms. This paper discusses its causal model approach. A prototype system exhibits {{the efficacy of the}} method of knowledge base stratification, where each knowledge base (KB) represents a distinct perspective to the phenomenon, such as the observable waveform knowledge and the causal knowledge of the physiological entity. Projection links in our frame representation relate corresponding concepts in different KBs, e. g., abnormalities in shape or temporality are mapped into abnormalities in physiological causality. The role of projections in the recognition process is to transduce established waveform hypotheses into corresponding event hypotheses and to form more global hypotheses using the causal model of entity. Several types of one-shot causal links have been introduced to represent causal relationships among underlying physiological events. A causal link includes the existential dependency and the implicit temporal constraints between the effect and the cause events. Using the causal knowledge with event statistics, the recognition system makes expectations for unseen events in relation to already-observed events when partial input information is given. Statistical information defined coherently through metaclasses of the PSN language supports a default reasoning process. The overall recognition framework is based on the hypothesize-and-test paradigm and the specializationand-aggregation of hypotheses using similarity links in <b>IS-A</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and causal links in PART-OF hierarchies. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{hierarchical}} semantic net is a graph whose nodes represent {{concepts and}} whose links represent semantic hierarchical relationships, i. e., ones that satisfy the partial order property. Manually-built hierarchical semantic nets, such as thesauri, exist that support traditional information systems applications. The problem of automatically building and maintaining hierarchical semantic nets {{led us to}} explore the semantics of hierarchical relations. We argue that hierarchical relations between concepts imply—and depend on—consistent patterns {{in the way that}} concepts' properties relate to each other. Mathematically, these patterns—which we call regularity—are characterized by the fact that properties define graph homomorphisms from a hierarchy of concepts to graphs of property values for those concepts. Inheritance, which is used to characterize taxonomic (<b>is-a)</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> is a type of regularity. In this paper, we discuss the semantic implications of regularity and show instances of regularity for different hierarchical relations. In the same way that inheritance enables us to infer property values when those are not known, regularity enables us to infer property values through some sort of bidirectional inheritance—called expansion. However, to place a concept in a hierarchy based on its property values, we need an isomorphism between the hierarchy of concepts and the graphs of property values. Roughly speaking, such an isomorphism may be obtained by combining properties into a single mapping called description, and the corresponding relationship between descriptions is a combination of relations between property values—called context relation. In this paper, we describe the resulting Description-Context (DC) model of hierarchies, and a classification algorithm for DC hierarchies. Regularity, expansion, and classification were tested on two actual hierarchies built by librarians to support a biomedical bibliographic retrieval system. The results, which validated our models, are briefly described...|$|R
