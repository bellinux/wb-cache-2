5000|$|The {{best known}} IEC device is the fusor. [...] This device {{typically}} {{consists of two}} wire cages inside a vacuum chamber. These cages {{are referred to as}} grids. The inner cage is held at a negative voltage against the outer cage. A small amount of fusion fuel is introduced (deuterium gas being the most common). The voltage between the grids causes the fuel to ionize. The positive ions fall down the voltage drop towards the negative inner cage. As they accelerate, the electric field does work on the ions, heating them to fusion conditions. If these ions collide, they can fuse. Fusors can also use <b>ion</b> <b>guns</b> rather than electric grids. Fusors are popular with amateurs, because they can be easy to construct, can regularly produce fusion and are a practical way to study nuclear physics. Fusors have also been used as a commercial neutron generator for industrial applications.|$|R
40|$|Depth {{profiling}} using {{secondary ion}} mass spectrometry (SIMS) provides profiles of high sensitivity and depth resolution. To obtain the greatest depth resolution, low energy probes must {{be employed to}} minimize the redistribution of the sample. However, there is a lower limit beyond which further reduction in energy causes a decrease in ion and sputter yields {{to a point where}} sensitive SIMS is no longer possible. Also, with most <b>ion</b> <b>guns,</b> a reduction in energy brings a dramatic loss of current leading to unrealistically long analysis times. To overcome these problems a deconvolution method may be employed to extract the maximum amount of information from data acquired at a higher energy.

50|$|Three {{types of}} ion guns are employed. In one, ions of gaseous {{elements}} are usually generated with duoplasmatrons or by electron ionization, for instance noble gases (40Ar+, Xe+), oxygen (16O−, 16O2+, 16O2−), or even ionized molecules such as SF5+ (generated from SF6) or C60+ (fullerene). This type of <b>ion</b> <b>gun</b> {{is easy to}} operate and generates roughly focused but high current ion beams. A second source type, the surface ionization source, generates 133Cs+ primary ions. Cesium atoms vaporize through a porous tungsten plug and are ionized during evaporation. Depending on the gun design, fine focus or high current can be obtained. A third source type, the liquid metal <b>ion</b> <b>gun</b> (LMIG), operates with metals or metallic alloys, which are liquid at room temperature or slightly above. The liquid metal covers a tungsten tip and emits ions under influence of an intense electric field. While a gallium source is able to operate with elemental gallium, recently developed sources for gold, indium and bismuth use alloys which lower their melting points. The LMIG provides a tightly focused ion beam (<50 nm) with moderate intensity and is additionally able to generate short pulsed ion beams. It is therefore commonly used in static SIMS devices.|$|E

Recent instrumentation advancements in combination with newly developed cluster <b>ion</b> <b>guns</b> allow 3 -dimensional reconstruction of single cells together with a spatially resolved compound location and quantification on nanoscale depth level. The exact location and quantification of a single compound or even of a set of compounds is no longer restricted to the two dimensional space within single cells, but is available for voxels, a cube-sized 3 -dimensional space, rather than pixels. The information gathered from one voxel is further analysed using multivariate statistical methodology like maximum autocorrelation factors to co-locate the compounds of interest within intracellular organelles like nucleus, mitochondria or golgi apparatus. Furthermore, the cell membrane may be resolved, including adhering compounds and potential changes of the lipid patterns. The generated information can be used further for a first evaluation of intracellular target specifity of new drug candidates or for the toxicological risk assessment of environmental chemicals and their intracellular metabolites.

50|$|The {{choice of}} the ion species and <b>ion</b> <b>gun</b> {{respectively}} depends on the required current (pulsed or continuous), the required beam dimensions of the primary ion beam and on the sample {{which is to be}} analyzed.

For short pulsed ion beams in static SIMS, LMIGs are most often deployed for analysis; they can be combined with either an oxygen gun or a caesium gun during elemental depth profiling, or with a C60+ or gas cluster ion source during molecular depth profiling.|$|E

50|$|Depending on the SIMS type, {{there are}} three basic analyzers available: sector, quadrupole, and time-of-flight.

A quadrupole mass analyzer separates the masses by resonant electric fields, which allow only the selected masses to pass through. The time of flight mass analyzer separates the ions in a field-free drift path according to their velocity. Since all ions possess the same kinetic energy the velocity and therefore time of flight varies according to mass. It requires pulsed secondary ion generation using either a pulsed primary <b>ion</b> <b>gun</b> or a pulsed secondary ion extraction. It is the only analyzer type able to detect all generated secondary ions simultaneously, and is the standard analyzer for static SIMS instruments.|$|E
