5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was unusual for the younger son of a <b>family</b> <b>living</b> in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a bookseller. Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E

5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native <b>family</b> <b>living</b> in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E

Growing up, his favorite athletes were the 76ers' Allen Iverson and the Eagles' Brian Dawkins. In eighth grade, Arcidiacono trained with former Penn State player Ben Luber.|$|E
5|$|Jane Elizabeth Manning James {{was born}} in Wilton, Connecticut, to Isaac and Eliza Manning. Although, late in James' life her brother Isaac gave her {{birthday}} as 1813, there are source discrepancies that place her birthday anywhere from September 22, 1812, to the year 1820. The Mannings were a free <b>family</b> <b>living</b> in rural Connecticut, and James had at least five siblings including Isaac, Lewis, Peter, Sarah, and Angeline. At the age of six, James was sent away {{to live with the}} Fitches, a wealthy Caucasian family. She was raised by the Fitches' daughter and lived with them for the next thirty years. Little is known about James' life with the Fitches other than she worked as a servant: cooking, cleaning, and ironing, etc. While with the Fitches, James was also brought up as a Christian. She was baptized into the Presbyterian Church when she was about 14 years old. On March 1, 1835, James gave birth to a son, Sylvester.|$|E

5|$|The main <b>family</b> <b>living</b> {{quarters}} {{are located}} in the 1752 addition. The staircase hall is the only room in the 1752 house to have kept its original, Georgian interior. The rococo plaster ceiling is attributed to Shrewsbury-born architect, Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who also designed interiors at Tatton Hall, Powis Castle and Croft Castle. Facing the gardens, {{on the north side of}} the house, is the library. Remodelled in the early 1800s, this room was previously used by the family as a dining room. It features fitted 19th-century mahogany bookcases, decorated with small acanthus friezes. The white marble fireplace is flanked on either side by family coats of arms. Connecting the library to the staircase hall and the drawing room is the ante-room, which is furnished with pieces commissioned by the family in the late 18th century. Originally, an entrance into the hall was located in this octagonal room, until Randle Wilbraham III relocated it. The room features copies of works by Raphael, attributed to Michelangelo Maestri.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary <b>family</b> <b>living</b> near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks.|$|E
5|$|Louis Antoine de Saint-Just {{was born}} at Decize in the former Nivernais {{province}} of central France. He was the eldest child of Louis Jean de Saint-Just de Richebourg (1716–1777), a retired French cavalry officer, knight of the Order of Saint Louis, and of the 20-years younger Marie-Anne Robinot (1736–1811), {{the daughter of a}} notary. He had two younger sisters, born in 1768 and 1769. The family later moved north and in 1776 settled in the village of Blérancourt in the former Picardy province, establishing themselves as a countryside noble <b>family</b> <b>living</b> out of the rents from their land. A year after the move, Louis Antoine's father died leaving his mother with the three children. She saved diligently for her only son's education, and in 1779 he was sent to the Oratorian school at Soissons. After a promising start, Saint-Just acquired a reputation as a troublemaker, augmented by infamous stories (almost certainly apocryphal) of how he led a students' rebellion and tried to burn down the school. Nonetheless, he earned his graduation in 1786.|$|E

5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the <b>family</b> <b>living</b> in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E
5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had {{turned a blind eye}} to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel <b>family,</b> <b>living</b> in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E
5|$|The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West {{about the}} sleeper agent, but they {{discover}} that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a homing beacon on Mayor West's leg. West escapes to Russia and the four follow him. They are quickly captured under orders of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent plan would be an embarrassment to their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission. When the four find West, they see him launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before he snaps out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him {{with the knowledge that}} West was not in control of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US. The fuselage, though, crashes into Cleveland's house in Stoolbend, Virginia, while Cleveland was taking a bath, eliciting confusion from his neighbor, Tim the Bear. The episode ends with Brian and Stewie in the <b>family</b> <b>living</b> room as they recount their adventure and repeat the activation phrase, which reveals Meg to be another sleeper agent.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MCur) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Some {{families}} in the Free State Province, specifically in Thabo-Mofutsanyana district, are <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mentally ill family members. The families accompany the mentally ill family members to designated clinics which offer primary, secondary and tertiary mental health services, and all these levels of care provide care, treatment and rehabilitation of mentally ill persons (SA, 2002 : 2). Despite the care that these families give to their mentally ill family members, it seemed that they {{find it difficult to}} cope living with a mentally ill family member. This is supported by Zergaw, Hailemariam, Alem and Kebed (2008 : 191) who indicate the economic impact, disruption of daily life, work and family relationships experienced by <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with a mentally ill family member. This was also evident in a study by Du Plessis, Greeff and Koen (2004 : 4), that, {{because of a lack of}} a formal support system for <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mentally ill family members, and lack of necessary skills to take on the responsibility of caring for mentally ill relatives, mentally ill family members relapse and are readmitted in the mental health care institutions. Adding to this, in most of the <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mentally ill family members in the Thabo-Mofutsanyana district, it is not known how they cope and are supported. Once there is a clear understanding of how <b>families</b> experience <b>living</b> with mentally ill family members, health care practitioners can give better support to <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mentally ill family members. The research objective of this study was to explore and describe the experiences of <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with a mentally ill family member in the Thabo-Mofutsanyana district, to explore and describe the strengths of <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with a mentally ill family member, and to formulate guidelines to support <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mentally ill family members. A qualitative, phenomenological design was used which enabled the researcher to understand the way in which the <b>families</b> experience <b>living</b> with a mentally ill family member. The population studied in this research consisted of <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mentally ill family members in the Thabo-Mofutsanyana district in South Africa. The purposive sampling was used to select participants with the assistance of a mediator. Permission to conduct research was negotiated with the district manager. Voluntary and informed consent in writing was obtained from all the participants. The sample size was determined by data saturation, which was reached after 14 interviews. Data analysis was carried out simultaneously with data collection. In consensus discussions, the researcher and the co-coder reached consensus on the main and sub themes. From the research findings, five main themes were identified. The first two themes are the positive and negative experiences of living with a mentally ill family member. The third theme is the concerns of family in staying with a mentally ill family member. The fourth theme is the strengths in coping with a mentally ill family member. The last theme is ways in which family members as families wanted to be supported. It could be concluded that the experience of <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mentally ill family members in Thabo-Mofutsanyana district need to be supported. In order to address this support holistically and to enhance quality of life and to lessen the burden the <b>families</b> experience in <b>living</b> with a mentally ill family member, the support should firstly be addressed individually and then as a family. Following that, the collective support can be addressed by a support network system through involvement of the department of health, clinics, rehabilitation centres, community, mental health care workers, giving of medication and establishment support of groups of <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mental health care users. From these findings the researcher proposed guidelines to support <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mentally ill family members, and to increase knowledge in these families on how to handle a mentally ill family member. The researcher also compiled recommendations for nursing practice, nursing education and nursing research in <b>families</b> <b>living</b> with mental health care users. Master...|$|R
