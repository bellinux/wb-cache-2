40|$|The {{building}} {{sector accounts}} for {{a significant proportion of}} industrial countries total energy use, thus a cut in this sector has been regarded necessary to reach future climate goals. An important measure in this context is the introduction of zero emission buildings, buildings which can be defined as having a net zero annual energy demand. This master thesis is centered around finding cost optimal energy supply systems for zero emission buildings at an early stage of the building process. This thesis is closely linked to the &# 197;dland project, currently the largest pilot project for the Research Center on Zero Emission Buildings. The testing was performed on a four floor building block located in Bergen. The ZEB-definition used was net zero primary energy consumption, where primary <b>energy</b> <b>factors</b> were used as weighting factors for the various energy carriers. Two types of primary <b>energy</b> <b>factors</b> were tested; total primary <b>energy</b> <b>factors</b> and non-renewable primary <b>energy</b> <b>factors.</b> Five different <b>energy</b> supply packages were investigated: Bio+PV, CHP+PV, DH+PV, HP+ST+PV and CHP+ST+PV. The base heating systems were dimensioned to cover the heating demand (space heating and domestic hot water), while PV was dimensioned so that the building reached the ZEB balance. Excess electricity was exported to the grid and sold to the local power company. The simulation tool IDA-ICE was used both for modeling the building and performing the energy simulations. The cost calculations followed the European Cost Optimal Methodology, calculating the net present value of all costs attributed to the implementation of the different packages (investments, annual costs and residual values) over a calculation period of 30 years. Both a pure financial and a macroeconomic calculation were performed for all packages. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the energy price escalation as well as investment costs. When total primary <b>energy</b> <b>factors</b> were used, the package HP+ST+PV proved to be the optimal package in all the different scenarios considered. The macroeconomic and the financial results were almost identical, mainly because of the low CO 2 -prices. The sensitivity analyses showed that the result is very stable with respect to uncertainties in both investment costs and future energy costs. For non-renewable primary <b>energy</b> <b>factors</b> the results showed that the package HP+ST+PV is best for both normal and high future energy price development, while the package Bio+PV was the best alternative for low energy price developments. The sensitivity analysis on investment cost showed the result for low energy price development was very sensitive for changes in investment costs, while for medium and high energy price development the result were more stable. Overall, for the energy supply packages considered and the primary <b>energy</b> <b>factors</b> used in this thesis, the conclusion is that HP+ST+PV is the cost optimal energy supply solution for the evaluated building. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to present a {{hierarchical}} framework for evaluating and ranking the important key energy-saving technologies and solutions in the 10 biggest Iranian hotels through integrating fuzzy set theory, as well as qualitative and quantitative approaches. The important key <b>energy</b> <b>factors</b> for the evaluation of energy saving technologies and solutions are gathered through a literature survey. This paper proposes a framework based on the fuzzy Delphi method, fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making, including fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy techniques for order performance by similarity to ideal solution. In the fuzzy Delphi method step of the study, 17 key <b>energy</b> <b>factors</b> were selected from among a total of 40 <b>energy</b> <b>factors</b> and categorised into five groups. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was used for the ranking of 17 key <b>energy</b> <b>factors,</b> and fuzzy techniques for order performance by similarity to ideal solution employed for ranking of the 10 biggest Iranian hotels in different provinces. The results of this study revealed that the first rank of main groups was equipment efficiency (0. 403), system efficiency (0. 225) had the second rank, third rank was related to reduction of heating and cooling demands (0. 151) and energy management (0. 091) and renewable energy (0. 083) had the fourth and fifth ranks respectively. In the ranking weights of 17 sub-groups of energy saving technologies and solutions, the results of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process showed that efficient solutions for active space cooling (0. 662) was as first rank, building insulation had the second rank with score (0. 541) and third rank was European Ecolabel for tourist accommodation service (0. 532) ...|$|R

5000|$|Under the 2015 standard, for {{the first}} time, storage water heaters with {{capacities}} of 55 US gallons or larger now face stricter efficiency requirements than those of 50 US gallons or less. Under the pre-2015 standard, a 75 gal gas storage water heater with a nominal input of [...] or less was able to have an <b>energy</b> <b>factor</b> as low as 53%, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum <b>energy</b> <b>factor</b> for a 75-US-gallon gas storage tank water heater is now 74%, {{which can only be}} achieved by using condensing technology. Storage water heaters with a nominal input of 75,000 btu or greater are not currently affected by these requirements, since <b>energy</b> <b>factor</b> is not defined for such units. An 80 gal electric storage tank water heater was able to have a minimum <b>energy</b> <b>factor</b> of 86% under the pre-2015 standard, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum <b>energy</b> <b>factor</b> for an 80-gallon electric storage tank water heater is now 197%, which is only possible with heat pump technology. It should be noted that this efficiency rating measures efficiency at the point of use. Depending on how electricity is generated, overall efficiency may be much lower. For example, in a traditional coal plant, only about 30-35% of the energy in the coal ends up as electricity {{on the other end of}} the generator. Losses on the electrical grid (including line losses and voltage transformation losses) reduce electrical efficiency further. According to data from the Energy Information Administration, transmission and distribution losses in 2005 consumed 6.1% of net generation. In contrast, 90% of natural gas’ energy value isdelivered to the consumer. (In neither case is the energy expended exploring, developing and extracting coal or natural gas resources included in the quoted efficiency numbers.) Gas tankless water heaters shall have an <b>energy</b> <b>factor</b> of 82% or greater under the 2015 standards, which corresponds to the pre-2015 Energy Star standard.|$|E
