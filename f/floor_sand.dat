40|$|Development of {{aggregate}} {{resources for}} use in structural concrete has been encouraged in Japan to support infrastructure improvement and national land conservation. Natural aggregate is a valuable resource necessary for sound economic development and its importance is growing. However, {{against the backdrop of}} the ongoing depletion of resources, growing concern over nature conservation and increasingly tightened control over resource use, the supply of natural aggregates such as sea/river/pit sand and sea/river gravel has been decreasing. The number and scale of public works and construction of buildings have been decreased due to the recent recession and the critical public opinion about public works. However, the necessary public works have been done as in the past. The lack of high quality aggregates has become a serious problem in Japan. Dredging of sea <b>floor</b> <b>sand</b> and development of new sand quarries for securing good quality sand have become the target of criticism from the viewpoint of environmental protection. This paper describes the present situation and future prospects of environmental and safety measures in suburban aggregate mines in Japan...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the substrate preference of laying hens {{with respect to}} dustbathing and foraging behaviour, {{in order to determine}} which resources should be provided in laying hen housing systems for the expression of these behaviours. The consumer demand approach was used to study the strength of preference. Hens had to push a weighted door to enter choice pens with either a wire <b>floor,</b> <b>sand,</b> wood shavings or peat moss as substrate. Twelve Isa-Brown hens, reared on battery cages, successfully learned to open the push door. Most of the hens worked for getting access to all choice pens. The slopes of the demand curves for the number of entries to the choice pens were steep and not significantly different. Also no differences were found in the maximum price paid and the total expenditure. These data indicate that {{there seems to be no}} preference for wire or any substrate per se. However, with respect to dustbathing, almost all hens worked for getting access to peat moss to take a dustbath whereas only some hens worked for sand or wood shavings. The slope of the demand curve for dustbathing in peat moss was relatively shallow and the maximum price paid and the total expenditure to take a dustbath in peat moss were significantly higher as compared to dustbathing in sand or wood shavings. With respect to foraging no clear substrate preference was found. We conclude that the value of a particular substrate varies with the behaviour performed in the substrate and that there is a strong demand for peat moss for dustbathing...|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} floor {{materials}} can be sanded, including timber, cork, particleboard, and sometimes parquet. Some floors are laid and designed for <b>sanding.</b> Many old <b>floors</b> are <b>sanded</b> after the previous coverings are removed and suitable wood is found hidden beneath. <b>Floor</b> <b>sanding</b> usually involves three stages: Preparation, sanding, and coating with a protective sealant.|$|R

50|$|Subsequent changes {{included}} the enclosure {{of part of}} the front verandah {{and the construction of}} a lean-to laundry building on the west. These additions have recently been removed. Nothing remains of the laundry except for an area of concrete slab on the ground {{at the foot of the}} steps. Sheet lining to the early bathroom and to the ceiling of the rear verandah has been removed, <b>floors</b> <b>sanded</b> and the whole building painted. The early timber outhouse and shed remain.|$|R
50|$|Sanding {{provides}} {{a method for}} smoothing an installed floor, compensating for unevenness of the subfloor. Additionally, sanding is used to renew the appearance of older <b>floors.</b> <b>Sanding</b> using successively finer grades of sandpaper is required to ensure even stain penetration when stains are used, {{as well as to}} eliminate visible scratches from coarser sandpaper grades used initially. Prior to modern polyurethanes, oils and waxes were used in addition to stains to provide finishes. Beeswax and linseed oil, for example, are both natural crosslinking polymers and harden over time.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to study why blue foxes change floor {{material}} between a mesh <b>floor</b> and <b>sand</b> <b>floor.</b> We measured latencies of various behaviours after the fox entered the <b>sand</b> and mesh <b>floor.</b> Our Blue foxes could use two cages, one with mesh floor and one with <b>sand</b> <b>floor.</b> The cages were connected with two one-way doors, to which weight could be added. The latencies for various behaviours were measured after entrance to a cage with 0 and 2. 5 kg of extra weight on the door in 15 foxes. The first behaviours after entering either of the cages were related to inspection of the surroundings outside and inside the cage, suggesting that the behaviours have certain order irrespective of the <b>floor</b> material. The <b>sand</b> was used more for elimination and caching of food leftover than the mesh floor, and in resting and contact with neighbour fox the trend was opposite. The latency to start sniffing sand was shorter than that of digging. Our results show that latency may provide a good tool to evaluate resource use. vo...|$|R

40|$|Farmed blue foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are {{traditionally}} housed on mesh floors {{where they are}} unable to perform certain species-specific behaviours, such as digging, which may compromise the animals' welfare. This study describes how a possibility to use in-cage <b>sand</b> <b>floor</b> affects welfare-related variables like growth of the claws, adrenal cortex function, and fur properties in juvenile blue foxes. The foxes (N= 32) were housed in male-female sibling pairs in an outdoor fur animal shed in cage systems consisting of two traditional fox cages. For the eight male-female sibling pairs of the Control group, there was a mesh floor in both cages of each cage system, whereas for the eight pairs of the Sand group there was a mesh floor in one cage and a 30 – 40 [*]cm deep earth floor in the other cage. The results show that <b>sand</b> <b>floor</b> is beneficial for the wearing of the claws of foxes. Furthermore, an early experience of <b>sand</b> <b>floor</b> may have positive effects on the foxes' fur development. The results, however, also suggest that there might appear welfare problems observed as disturbed claw growth and increased adrenal cortex activation if foxes that are once provided with clean and unfrozen <b>sand</b> <b>floor</b> are not allowed to enjoy this floor all the time...|$|R

25|$|The Akapana East {{was built}} on the eastern side of early Tiwanaku. Later it was {{considered}} a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area. It was made of a thick, prepared <b>floor</b> of <b>sand</b> and clay, which supported a group of buildings. Yellow and red clay were used in different areas for what seems like aesthetic purposes. It was swept clean of all domestic refuse, signaling its great importance to the culture.|$|R

It is found near the ocean <b>floor</b> over <b>sand,</b> rock, coral reefs, and kelp and seagrass beds at depths down to 180 m. It is almost exclusively seen at night and spends the day hidden in caves or camouflaged on the ocean floor.|$|R

On the least barren hills they pasture their cattle, while the goats, adventurers by nature, explore the far inland solitudes for a scanty livelihood of lofty herbage.

50|$|As noted above, the Mu Us Sandy Land forms part of Ordos Plateau and {{includes}} {{part of the}} Loess Plateau alluvial plain with a concave <b>floor.</b> Exposed <b>sands</b> in the area come from Cretaceous red and grey sandstone. Quaternary sediments include a variety of sand types which are easily moved by the wind.

The Negro came to wait on Neale, and, receiving an order, went to the kitchen. The Irishman sidled over to Neale.|$|R
