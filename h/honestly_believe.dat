I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person at that point in our lives... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{suggest that}} an angakkuq could be honest in his tricks, {{believing in the}} {{phenomena}} he himself mimicked, moreover, he could consciously cheat and <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> at the same time. Knud Rasmussen mentioned Arnaqaoq, a young Netsilik Inuit living in King William Island. He smeared himself {{with the blood of}} a seal or reindeer, telling people that he had a battle with spirits. Rasmussen conjectured that he could <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> in this spirit battle experience which he mimicked with smearing blood. The personal impression of Rasmussen about this man was that he believed in the forces and spirits. As Rasmussen asked him to draw some pictures about his experiences, even his visions about spirits, Arnaqaoq was first unwilling to do so (having fear of the spirits). Later he accepted the task, and he spent hours to re-experience his visions, sometimes so lucidly that he had to stop drawing when his whole body began to quiver.|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} {{would allow for}} a more efficient distribution of climate change risks. They would also allow for different beliefs over future climate outcomes. For example, {{it has been suggested}} that these markets might provide an objective test of the honesty of a particular country's beliefs over climate change. Countries that <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> that climate change presents little risk would be more prone to hold securities against these risks.|$|E

500|$|Bosnian media, {{political}} parties and Srebrenica survivors were likewise strongly critical. The Sarajevo-based newspaper Dnevni Avaz described the report as {{an attempt by the}} Bosnian Serb government to deny that genocide had taken place. The Srebrenica and Zepa Mothers Association condemned the report as [...] "false, [...] shameful and utterly amoral." [...] The Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina denounced it as [...] "yet another attempt by the Serb Republic authorities in an unscrupulous and brutal way to negate what probably is the worst crime in Europe after WW2." [...] Alija Behmen, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, called it [...] "a surprising forgery which is trying to delude the public and especially the Serbs in BiH. I <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> that this is the last attempt to enliven the policy which marked the tragic past of BiH. Negating the genocide cannot {{be a part of the}} election campaign." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Gay {{had been}} bullish in victory on the track, the {{achievement}} {{did not change}} him—he remained humble and appreciative to his rivals. In November he {{was chosen as the}} IAAF Male World Athlete of the Year for 2007 and in his acceptance speech he paid tribute to his peers, encouraging Powell to remain focused and saying that he highly regarded the Jamaican. He also dismissed comparisons to his forebears, commenting: [...] "I <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> that I need to have the World record like some of the other great sprinters like Carl Lewis, Maurice Greene. I think that sets you apart, having medals and having the World record." [...] At {{the end of the season}} Gay was elected 2007 Men's Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News (topping the year's list as the fastest 100m and 200m sprinter), and he won the USATF's Harrison Dillard award as the top US male sprinter.|$|E
500|$|IGN writer Roth Cornet {{awarded the}} episode a 6.9, {{denoting}} a [...] "okay" [...] episode. She called the episode [...] "the real {{beginning of the}} end". Cornet, however, was critical of the episode's length, specifically pin-pointing the Philadelphia scenes, noting that they [...] "went on too long". She concluded that [...] "I feel for the writers, who I <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> were forced to stretch their content this season", {{as well as for}} the episode. Nick Campbell of TV.com was unhappy that the episode did not show or comment on Pam and Jim's fight in the previous episode. He felt that the beginning of the dinner scene was nice, due to the two's banter. However, he felt that the end pretended as if they had not discussed the move in any previous episodes. Campbell felt that Odenkirk was used in a good way, but that was [...] "a waste of amazing talent at the real estate office". He also felt that Dwight and Angela's kiss was a good progression for their story.|$|E

After a [...] "disastrous" [...] election by the Liberal Party, its leader Lars Sponheim blamed Solberg for the bad results, accusing her of [...] "tearing the party apart". Solberg responded with [...] "He can't <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> that having political differences is to tear apart the Liberal Party".|$|E
2500|$|O'Brien did {{not seriously}} respond {{for several days}} after the announcement, then drafted a press release {{explaining}} why {{he felt it was}} unfair to him, his staff, Fallon, and the legacy of The Tonight Show to move the show past midnight. He concluded by saying that he [...] "cannot participate in what I <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> is [...] destruction." [...] O'Brien received an outpouring of celebrity and viewer support for rejecting the move, while Leno received heavy criticism. On January 21, O'Brien signed a $45 million deal allowing him to leave the network, and aired his final episode of Tonight on January 22; Leno returned as host of Tonight on March 1.|$|E
2500|$|The legal representatives for the arrested 270 miners {{said their}} {{continued}} incarceration was [...] "unlawful" [...] {{as a special}} judicial inquiry that had been formed by Zuma was conducting its investigation. The law firm Maluleke, Msimang and Associates wrote {{an open letter to}} Zuma, on 30 August, saying that it would file an urgent petition with the High Court for the release of those imprisoned if he does not order their immediate release. [...] "It is inconceivable that the South African state, of which you are the head, and any of its various public representatives, officials and citizens, can genuinely and <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> or even suspect that our clients murdered their own colleagues and in some cases, their own relatives." ...|$|E

2500|$|For 60 {{years the}} Tonight Show has aired {{immediately}} following the late local news. I sincerely believe that delaying the Tonight Show into {{the next day to}} accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn’t the Tonight Show. [...] So it has come to this: I cannot express in words how much I enjoy hosting this program and what an enormous personal disappointment it is for me to consider losing it. My staff and I have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of The Tonight Show. But I cannot participate in what I <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> is its destruction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{availability}} of multiple shots offered by Colt's rifle {{was seen as}} an advantage against the Seminole warriors, who had learned the vulnerability of troops who had already fired the conventional single-shot military arms of the day. [...] Reports of use in combat illustrated the delicate and complicated construction of the rifles, which easily put them out of service. [...] Although the guns were not perfect and prone to defect, the use of the new weapons against the Seminoles yielded significant gains. [...] In 1839, nearly a year after acquiring fifty First Model rifles, Colonel Harney remarked that all but two were in good working order. [...] Later in July 1839, however, a surprise Seminole attack led to the loss of thirty Ring Lever rifles, though fourteen were eventually recovered. [...] In spite of the rifle's reliability problems, support for Colt's rifles was garnered from field officers, especially from Lieutenant Colonel Harney. [...] Harney commented on Colt's Ring Lever rifle favorably, stating: [...] "I <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> that, but for these arms, the Indians would now be luxuriating in the Everglades of Florida." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} lists summarise the discography of the Australian hard-rock band AC/DC. [...] AC/DC released 17 studio albums (15 available {{worldwide and}} 2 released only in Australia), 2 soundtrack albums, 4 live albums, 11 video albums, and 2 box-set albums. Although {{a large number}} of AC/DC singles have been released, the band always refused to release any greatest-hits type packages; Who Made Who (which served as the soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive), Iron Man 2, and the band's various live recordings are as close as the group have come to such a compilation. Verizon makes AC/DC albums available to download, but for several years the band refused to release their albums on iTunes, as iTunes normally allows downloading of individual tracks; AC/DC publicly stated, [...] "Our...reason is that we <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> the songs on any of our albums belong together. If we were on iTunes, we know a certain percentage of people would only download two or three songs from the album – and we don't think that represents us musically." [...] However, the band finally released their entire discography to iTunes in November 2012. On June 30, 2015, their catalog appeared on Spotify for the first time.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the gravest}} {{potential}} obstacles to a coup {{were in the}} army. Some generals, such as Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, <b>honestly</b> <b>believed</b> in republicanism; others, such as Jean Bernadotte, believed themselves capable of governing France. Napoleon worked on the feelings of all, keeping secret his own intentions.|$|R
50|$|The {{trial judge}} {{directed}} {{the jury that}} the defendants would not be guilty of rape if they <b>honestly</b> <b>believed</b> that the woman was consenting and that belief in consent was reasonably held. On 24 January 1974 the jury convicted all four and they appealed.|$|R
50|$|Żeligowski, like Piłsudski himself—may {{have been}} one of many who were torn between Lithuanian and Polish identities; possibly, in proclaiming a Central Lithuania, he <b>honestly</b> <b>believed</b> that he was {{creating}} a Lithuania even if it that was dominated by Polish culture rather than Lithuanian culture.|$|R
2500|$|Warwick {{weathered}} the British Invasion {{better than most}} American artists. Her UK hits were most notably [...] "Walk On By" [...] and [...] "Do You Know the Way to San Jose?" [...] In the UK, a number of Bacharach-David-Warwick songs were recorded by British singers Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw and Dusty Springfield, most notably Black's [...] "Anyone Who Had a Heart" [...] which went to No. 1 in the UK. This upset Warwick, who described feeling insulted when told that in the UK, record company executives wanted her songs recorded by someone else. Warwick even met Cilla Black while on tour in Britain. She recalled what she said to her: [...] "I told her that [...] "You're My World" [...] would be my next single in the States. I <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> that if I'd sneezed on my next record, then Cilla would have sneezed on hers too. There was no imagination in her recording." [...] Warwick later covered two of Cilla's songs - [...] "You're My World" [...] appeared on Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls, released in 1968 and on the soundtrack to Alfie.|$|E
2500|$|According to Morris, {{the goal}} of a [...] "secular {{democratic}} Palestine" [...] was invented to appeal to Westerners, and while a few supporters of the one-state solution may <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> in such an outcome, the realities of Palestinian society mean that [...] "the phrase objectively serves merely as camouflage for {{the goal of}} a Muslim Arab–dominated polity to replace Israel." [...] Morris argued that should a binational state ever emerge, many Israeli Jews would likely emigrate to escape the [...] "stifling darkness, intolerance, authoritarianism, and insularity of the Arab world and its treatment of minority populations", with only those incapable of finding new host countries to resettle in and Ultra-Orthodox Jews remaining behind. It has even been argued that Jews would face the threat of genocide. Writing on Arutz Sheva, Steven Plaut referred to the one-state solution as the [...] "Rwanda Solution", and wrote that the implementation of a one-state solution in which a Palestinian majority would rule over a Jewish minority would eventually lead to a [...] "new Holocaust". Morris argued that while the Palestinians would have few moral inhibitions over the destruction of Israeli-Jewish society through mass murder or expulsion, fear of international intervention would probably stymie such an outcome.|$|E
2500|$|Two months later, {{criticism}} of the perp walk resumed when Strauss-Kahn's bail terms were reduced from house arrest to his own recognizance after the office of Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. found the housekeeper had been dishonest with them about other aspects of her story than the attack. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had earlier defended the perp walk, criticized it as [...] "outrageous". City Councilman David G. Greenfield introduced legislation that would ban perp walks. [...] "I <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> it's unconstitutional," [...] he said. [...] "If we banned it here we could {{send a message to}} the country." [...] Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the media was to blame, not his department. [...] "If they make a decision to stake out a location when someone is walked out of the front of a precinct ... it's not a decision that the Police Department makes", he said. [...] "We have been walking prisoners out of the front doors of stationhouses for 150 years in the Police Department ... This is how we transport people to court ... I don't think the genie's ever gonna be put back inside the bottle. That's the way it is." [...] The legislation was seen as unlikely to pass.|$|E
