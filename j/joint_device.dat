Its advantages include remote actuation, independent control of compliance and equilibrium, and in future versions, {{the ability to}} span multiple joints. This cable-driven, compliant mechanism should prove very useful {{in a variety of}} human-robot interactions. Here we present a single <b>joint</b> <b>device</b> evaluated in terms of its position and torque step responses, its ability to follow a minimum jerk trajectory, and its ability to create torque fields.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} problem of joint {{equalization}} and cancellation of the multipath and multiple access interference for multitone CDMA introduced by Vandendorpe (see IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, vol. 44, no. 2, p. 327, 1995). A linear structure is investigated for an MMSE criterion. In {{order to understand the}} potential of the system we first study the steady-state behaviour of the joint equalizer-canceller. The investigation is carried out for a <b>joint</b> <b>device</b> following a receiver made of a bank of matched filters and assuming perfect carrier phase and timing recovery. The scenario is asynchronous. An exact expression {{in the form of an}} integral is obtained for the bit error probability of the BPSK symbols before and after cancellation, by means of the characteristic function method. The performance of different systems is obtained for a constrained comparison and the near-far resistance of the detector is demonstrated. Anglai...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effects {{of carbon}} fiber on {{strength}} were {{studied in the}} carbon fiber reinforced Cu- 33 at%Al alloy-joint device of aluminum to copper. Although chemical reactions induced the strong bonding of interface, they decayed the strength of fine fibers, resulting in occurrence of the welding brittleness. To enhance the fracture resistance, the carbon fiber reinforced metal (CFRM) <b>joint</b> <b>device</b> was successfully developed by using a duplex-coated carbon fiber felt. The high joint strength was obtained. The carbon fiber acted as a deformation resistance by fiber-reinforced mechanics. Static and dynamic frictions at the joint interface probably prevented the pullout of fibers from matrix. Introduction. Airplanes and racing cars are dream worthy mover machines. In order to save their energy and to enhance their mobility, strengthening and their reliability of fiber-reinforced metals (FRM) have been useful tools. In general, chemical reactions induce the strong bonding of their interfaces. However, they decay the strength of fine fibers, resulting in brittleness at or near joint parts. I...|$|E
