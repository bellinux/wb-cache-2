25|$|The {{original}} {{designers of}} gross product accounts (such as Simon Kuznets, Colin Clark, Edward Fulton Denison and Richard Stone) aimed precisely to exclude any capital gains (or other income from asset transactions and revaluations) from their measure of gross output, just like transfer payments. They wanted a reliable standard {{measure that would}} indicate changes {{in the value of}} the net new addition to wealth per year or per quarter: roughly, the total sales revenue from production less intermediate costs, or, the value of total outputs produced less the value of goods and services used up to produce them, or, the sum of factor incomes directly generated by production. The issue then is, how exactly the grossing and netting must be done to obtain the value of total output, and it is done in a different way than business itself would <b>do</b> <b>it</b> (<b>to</b> eliminate non-production income/expenditure, ensure uniform valuation, and remove double counting; from the point of view of national accounts, in fact real credits can become theoretical debits, and real debits can become theoretical credits).|$|E

They wrote almost the entire album and said this work {{is so much more}} mature and themselves than their unreleased previous work. The album had productions from Jermaine Dupri, Don Vito, and Jazze Pha. On March 21, 2006, Cherish released their first single in three years, titled <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> It. The single featured Sean P on guest vocals. The single was met to a positive critical reception, as well as a strong commercial reception. The single was met with a large amount of success in the US, charting on several Billboard charts. The single became their first to reach the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, when it peaked at number 12. The single was also success on the Pop 100 chart, where it peaked at number 2, as well as the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart, reaching a peak of number 10 on that chart. The single also was a major hit in New Zealand, peaking at number 3 on the official singles chart. The song also climbed to the top 40 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, peaking at number 30 and 34 respectively. The song also charted in countries such as Australia, peaking at number 67, Germany, peaking at number 87, and France, reaching a peak of number 48.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect it too much.

[...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000. [...] While he refused to seek professional help, Rudolph cut back on his gambling habit later in his life.|$|E

500|$|When {{he began}} work on the score for A New Beginning, Manfredini created a theme just for the {{character}} of Tommy Jarvis. The idea was {{to suggest that there}} was [...] "madness afoot", which he believed helped to [...] "'point the finger' at various characters [...] to suggest that things were not as you might expect". For Jason Lives, Tom McLoughlin instructed Manfredini to create a score that would not alert the audience about what was happening or about to happen, [...] "but instead allow the audience to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> themselves". McLoughlin took this idea from John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween, which would always follow any shock in the film with Carpenter's [...] "Eeeeeeee!" [...] sound.

500|$|By February 1671, John Churchill {{was back}} in London and duelling with Sir John Fenwick. Churchill's {{handsome}} features and manner – described by Lord Chesterfield as [...] "irresistible to either man or woman" [...] – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions {{of one of the}} King's most noteworthy mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon the King's appearance Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid in the cupboard, but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill, who promptly fell to his knees. [...] "You are a rascal", said Charles, [...] "but I forgive you because you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> get your bread". The story may be apocryphal – another version has Churchill jumping out of the window – but it is widely accepted that he was the father of Cleveland's daughter, Barbara, born on 16 July 1672 (O.S.). However, Churchill never formally acknowledged her.|$|E

[...] Somerset's president, Colin Atkinson spoke to representatives from Worcestershire the day after the game and offered to play the match again, but his suggestion was rejected. The TCCB chairman, Carr, made a statement after the game that [...] "Somerset's action is totally contrary to the spirit of the competition, but is not in breach of the rules as they are written" [...] and announced that an inquiry would be held at season's end. However, due to the strength and volume of complaints, a special meeting of the TCCB was called for 1 June. At that meeting, Somerset were disqualified from the competition by seventeen votes to one. Only the representative from Derbyshire opposed it, with even Somerset voting for the expulsion. Due to Somerset's disqualification, Glamorgan joined Worcestershire in the quarter-finals. As it turned out, had Somerset played the game as normal, they would have qualified, as Glamorgan's match against the Minor Counties ended with no result due to rain, leaving them two points behind Somerset and Worcestershire.|$|E

[...] The strict parenting role is played once again with Eric, and Halfpenny branded the moment as Amy [...] "meeting her match." [...] As [...] "nothing is straight forward with Amy", she returns home but finds telling the truth hard.

500|$|The final {{confrontation}} between {{husband and wife}} played out during the special episode marking the show's 20th anniversary. Such was public interest in the storyline that the production team reportedly took to [...] "fiercely guarding" [...] scripts, [...] "so that even the cast weren't sure how they would play out", with [...] "the show's producers shooting multiple endings to ensure the cast couldn't leak the plot." [...] During the hour-long broadcast Chrissie leads Sam and Zoe into facing Den, with 14.34 million people watching her deliver the fatal blow to her husband after a violent struggle. Oberman [...] "begged the producers to let Chrissie <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> prove she wasn't a sap", adding [...] "It was a real rush for me." [...] In the aftermath of Den's death, Chrissie became an increasingly [...] "transformed" [...] and colder figure, as the character [...] "played" [...] and [...] "spun" [...] her way [...] "out of every situation". She proceeds to trick Zoe into taking the blame for Den's murder, and continuously outmanoeuvres Sam in the latter's efforts to get back the Vic. Oberman felt this to be a noticeable shift in Chrissie's characterisation, with the show's writers taking [...] "her down a darker route", as in one notable scene depicting Chrissie standing over Den's grave, and confiding to him of her plans.|$|E
500|$|On {{creating}} the character, Fazekas said the writers [...] "wanted {{to be really}} specific about who the woman is that Jarvis is just madly in love with" [...] in order to highlight the strong, platonic relationship Jarvis has with Carter. Fazekas added, [...] "It makes sense in that, Jarvis likes Peggy Carter, so of course the woman he's in love with {{would not be a}} quiet, prim and proper lady ... We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other people coming in and out of their lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had I walk in and I smack him on his ass, which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have. That's not something he would do, that's something she does, and he loves it." [...] D'Arcy later revealed that Verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set, after having [...] " [...] flown in", calling it [...] "brilliantly courageous ... to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> an actor you don’t know" [...] and [...] "so perfectly what they were hoping that Ana would be like." ...|$|E

500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{the best of my ability}} and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E
500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Scudamore {{defended the}} plan as {{consolidating}} the Premier League's global reputation, saying [...] "if we didn't do it, another sport {{will come and}} <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> us". Scudamore said that the chairmen of all 20 Premier League clubs supported the proposal, and disputed claims by the Daily Mail that Randy Lerner of Aston Villa and Dave Whelan of Wigan Athletic were opposed. David Gold, chairman of Birmingham City, endorsed the plan {{in part because the}} larger clubs have in any case already been exploiting foreign markets, with pre-season and even mid-season tours; Game 39 would distribute its revenue among all the clubs. [...] On 15 February, Liverpool F.C. chief executive Rick Parry stated that the proposal had [...] "never been on Liverpool's club agenda" [...] and acknowledged the concern of the club's fans and manager. [...] Paul Hayward, writing in The Guardian, said that the proposal would destroy the balance of the home-and-away round-robin league. The Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) condemned the proposal as being motivated by money, and dubbed it Gam£39. [...] It launched a petition, {{with the support of the}} Daily Mail, to oppose the [...] "outrageous desecration of the national game". In March 2008, the campaign was ended as the FSF declared the proposal [...] "effectively dead". [...] Many die-hard fans who pride themselves on travelling to all their teams' away matches would have been unable to travel abroad for [...] "Game 39". [...] On the other hand, exotic foreign venues would potentially be more appealing destinations for fans than a mundane English city. [...] Managers of Premier League clubs reported to be opposed to or sceptical of the plans included Steve Bruce, Roy Hodgson, Gareth Southgate, and Rafael Benítez. [...] Alex Ferguson criticised the club owners for lack of consultation with managers. [...] Arsène Wenger, Roy Keane, Kevin Keegan, and Avram Grant supported the proposal. [...] 'Game 39' was also defended as a move to head off plans for a World League involving only elite clubs such as those formerly in the G-14 group.|$|E
