Gamification <b>helps</b> <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> and creates positive, but challenging learning experiences. Programming can be a tough skill to learn: those who excel at it have started early. Most have spent countless nights doing detective work to figure out why their pro-gram doesn’t work right. Programming takes a range of abilities beyond robust gen-eral computing skills: learning the syntax of an artificial language, the creative use of algebra, and an intuition when to plan ahead and when to try out ideas in practice. Programmers read and write technical documentation, research tricky questions and relate their work to business requirements. Learning these skills is a frustratin...|$|R

The study produced unanticipated results due to the fact that students started using ILE at the beginning of the school year. This early start could have affected the data and their overall motivation towards reading. The data also suggests that majority of the students had a favorable attitude towards reading and using ILE because they wrote about their experiences in their notebook and made a lot of positive comments about it during whole-class discussions...|$|E
40|$|After {{teaching}} {{undergraduate students}} {{for several years}} at West Point and Messiah College it has become apparent that in many courses the weight being allocated to students "effort " has gradually increased from minimal amounts of 5 - 10 % to a substantial 35 - 50 %. Under traditional grading approaches, where all graded activities are averaged together, this increased percentage tends to create three distinct groups of students. One group tries {{to do well in}} both "effort " and "results " activities. A second group focuses almost exclusively on "effort " activities.

My work investigates students ' social goals to understand how they <b>help</b> <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> to acquire cultural understanding in BiLAT, one such system designed to teach cross-cultural negotiation skills. In previous work, I hypothesized that students who were given explicit social goals (e. g., “Come to understand your partner’s point of view”) would be more successful in learning from the game than students who were given task-focused goals only. The results did not confirm our hypothesis – the group without the explicit (externally-imposed) social goal learned more according to most measures. However, on further investigation, students who reported having social goals in a manipulation check, {{regardless of whether they}} were externally imposed, seemed to learn the most.

40|$|Objectives: To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} {{the impact of a}} module discussing the patient’s perspective on medication errors in a required medication safety course at a college of pharmacy. Methods: Students were required to read Josie’s Story, a true story written by a mother after her daughter died from a medical error, and attend an in-class discussion regarding the book. A questionnaire, which employed a pre-post retrospective method and extracted items from the Caring Ability Inventory, was then administered to measure the change in students’ perceptions of patient care. Additional questions gathered students’ perceptions of the assignment, their personal experiences with the topic, and the importance of medication safety. Results: 120 out of 138 students (response rate = 87 %) completed the questionnaire. 56 % of students indicated they {{would be more likely to}} speak with a patient directly about a medication error after reading the book, whereas only 3 % were less likely, and 42 % indicated they were just as likely. Most students (59 %) reported that they felt more motivated to learn about medication safety after reading Josie’s Story. Implications: This course previously addressed strategies to prevent medication errors. Successfully adding a component that introduces how a medication error impacted a patient and her family may <b>help</b> <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> to recognize the importance and need for a culture of safety, personalize how medication errors impact patients, and provide a venue for students to gain patient centeredness and caring skills...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Biochemistry has {{traditionally}} been taught through lectures and rote memorization paying little attention to nurturing key problem solving skills. The literature on clinical case studies utilized in health education indicates that case studies facilitate and promote active learning, help clinical problem solving and encourage the development of critical thinking skills. Methods: This paper describes a method of using clinical case studies to deepen and solidify the students understanding of biochemical facts and concepts as related to clinical medicine. Discussion: Clinical case studies can be a helpful adjunct for teaching the content of human biochemistry that complements the traditional approach of lecture, textbook and laboratory. The learning issues presented to the students required them to reformulate biochemical concepts in their own words, integrate diverse principles and decide what information was important and what was superfluous. Limitations include a small subset of students riding the coat tails of their more ambitious peers, and biochemistry professors not having the confidence to take the students through a clinical case study because they may feel like {{they do not have}} sufficient “clinical expertise”. Conclusion: Clinical case studies are a valuable addition to the traditional methods of lecture, textbook reading and laboratory for teaching biochemistry. More importantly clinical case studies help remind students that what they are learning has relevance in the real world, and may <b>help</b> <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> {{to pay more attention to}} the numerous facts faced in biochemistry...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{qualitative}} multiple case study design, {{this study investigated}} the ways that teachers’ pedagogical beliefs about learning: 1) affect students’ access to and use of one-to-one technologies and 2) shape one-to-one learning environments. Results indicate that teachers’ pedagogical beliefs are not a predictor of student access to computing devices, but do impact how students use the devices in the classroom. Also, teachers’ use of technology resources reflects their pedagogical beliefs. Teachers in the study reported that the increased access to technology via a one-to-one program positively impacted the learning environment by: facilitating better communication with students; empowering students; providing better feedback to students; making the teachers’ job easier; providing teachers and students with better access to resources; allowing more ways to differentiate student learning; developing 21 st century technology skills; providing variety; and <b>helping</b> <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> to learn. Teachers’ perceived negative impacts of the one-to-one program centered on the difficulties of shifting to new classroom management methods that accommodate technology devices and the distractions associated with the computing devices. Teachers also reported that they need better professional development to successfully integrate technology into their classrooms. Future professional development for one-to-one programs should be directed towards developing student-centered pedagogies {{with a focus on}} collaboration and integration of technology into the educational curriculum...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of teaching social and cultural architecture courses {{is to improve the}} design of buildings for inhabitants. To achieve this goal, the authors combine what anthropologists called the etic (outsider) and emic (insider) points of view in assigning an ethnographic field research project to learn from inhabitants’ experiences of buildings. Literally, ethnography means describing (graphing) the people (ethno), and in practice this means describing the behavioral and material expressions of culture, including architecture. Combining the etic and emic perspectives is accomplished through photo-elicitation, an ethnographic interview technique that relies on photographs to elicit inhabitants’ points of view. Students provide this information to administrators responsible for managing a building and to the architects who designed it. Giving feedback to architects makes them more aware of inhabitant experiences in designing future buildings, while helping facility managers make appropriate adjustments. This field project has consequences for architectural education, professional practice, and social science research. Research becomes useful beyond the confines of the classroom by providing data from the field and literature reviews to the research sponsor who uses and evaluates it, thereby demonstrating to students the value of social and cultural research in practice. Architect sponsors facilitate student research by providing scale drawings and insights into initial design considerations, commenting on program changes after the building went into operation, and helping gain access to administrators who run the building. The architects’ involvement also <b>helps</b> <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> to do their best work. In return, <b>student</b> work <b>helps</b> <b>motivate</b> busy architects to find time to meet with students...|$|R
