5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is strong, but the exact triggers for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be multiple and varied <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> the next. This suggests {{that there are a number}} of possible triggers, each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person. It is transmitted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another primarily through prolonged face-to-face {{contact with an}} infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried {{in the air in}} enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross the placenta, but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes {{three to four weeks}} before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E

25|$|Campylobacter {{can spread}} through contact with dog feces. It usually does not spread <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another. However, {{activities}} such as changing an infected person's diapers or sexual contact with an infected person can lead to infection. Regardless of where they are from, any puppies and dogs may carry Campylobacter germs.|$|E
25|$|Barnett was {{the head}} of the Grand Trunk Railway Literary and Scientific Institute during the many years he worked for the GTR. Barnett was a strong {{advocate}} for the teaching of mechanics.

25|$|The {{infection}} is usually spread <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Men have a 20% {{risk of getting}} the infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected woman. The risk for men that {{have sex with men}} (MSM) is higher. Active MSM may get a penile infection, while passive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. Women have a 60–80% risk of getting the infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected man. A pregnant women can pass on the infection to her unborn infant.|$|E
25|$|Adenoviruses {{are often}} {{transmitted}} by expectorate, {{but can also}} be transmitted by contact with an infected person, or by virus particles left on objects such as towels and faucet handles. Some people with adenovirus gastroenteritis may shed the virus in their stools for months after getting over the symptoms. The virus can be passed through water in swimming pools {{that do not have}} enough chlorine in them. As with many other illnesses, good handwashing is one way to inhibit the spread of adenoviruses <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another. Heat and bleach will kill adenoviruses on objects.|$|E
25|$|As may {{be noted}} from the name, sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are transmitted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another by certain sexual activities rather than being actually caused by those sexual activities. Bacteria, fungi, protozoa or viruses are still the causative agents. It {{is not possible to}} catch any sexually transmitted disease from a sexual activity with a person who is not carrying a disease; conversely, a person who has an STI got it from contact (sexual or otherwise) with someone who had it, or his/her bodily fluids. Some STIs such as HIV can be transmitted from mother to child either during pregnancy or breastfeeding.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{unprocessed}} {{human feces}} as fertilizer {{is a risky}} practice as it may contain disease-causing pathogens. Nevertheless, in some developing nations it is still widespread. Common parasitic worm infections, such as ascariasis, in these countries are linked to night soil use in agriculture, because the helminth eggs are in feces and can thus be transmitted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> infected <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another <b>person</b> (fecal-oral transmission of disease).|$|R

25|$|Human {{soft tissue}} is highly deformable, and its {{mechanical}} properties vary significantly <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another. Impact testing {{results showed that}} the stiffness and the damping resistance of a test subject’s tissue are correlated with the mass, velocity, and size of the striking object. Such properties may be useful for forensics investigation when contusions were induced. When solid object impact a human soft tissues, the energy of the impact will be absorbed by the tissues to reducing effect of the impact or the pain level, therefore; subjects with more soft tissue thickness tended to absorb the impacts with less aversion.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Vermont Governor John E. Weeks invited Flanders to {{join the}} Committee on Traditions and Ideals of the Vermont Commission on Country Life. That {{committee}} asked her to collect Vermont folk songs, which were passed along orally <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another. In the 1930s, people in New England were turning to music on the radio; as a result, interest in traditional songs was on the wane. Flanders understood that unless these songs were collected and recorded for posterity, they would die along {{with the people who}} sang them. What began as a committee assignment became not just a hobby, but a passion. She continued collecting for three decades.|$|E

Olivia interviews Massive Dynamic executive Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who tells her the substance {{has been seen}} in an attack before. [...] Walter suspects Roy is psychic and runs tests on him before realizing Roy {{has some kind of}} magnetic compound in his blood. This leads Walter to recall he and his old lab partner William Bell had conducted research on creating a [...] "Ghost Network" [...] to secretly communicate messages <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> another in an otherwise undetectable frequency range. During this research, Roy was one of his past test subjects. Walter further theorizes that someone else has perfected his research, and that Roy is overhearing secret messages from some of the people behind the terrorist attacks. Olivia and Peter (Joshua Jackson) arrive at his old house to find equipment needed to tap into Roy's mind.|$|E
50|$|Since the 13th {{century the}} Catholic Church has {{measured}} consanguinity {{according to what}} is called, perhaps confusingly, the civil-law method. Under this method, the degree of relationship between lineal relatives (i.e., {{a man and his}} grandfather) is simply equal to the number of generations between them. However, the degree of relationship between collateral (non-lineal) relatives equals the number of links in the family tree <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>person,</b> up <b>to</b> the common ancestor, and then back <b>to</b> the other <b>person.</b> Thus brothers are related in the second degree, and first cousins in the fourth degree.|$|R
