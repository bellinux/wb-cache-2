5|$|At the 2017 G9 USN Gathering knife show in Las Vegas, Emerson {{made the}} debut of the most coveted CQC6 to date, a black CQC6 <b>Flipper.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{receiving}} {{yards in a}} single game in regulation (329). Johnson's 329 {{receiving yards}} are the 2nd most overall in NFL history behind <b>Flipper</b> Anderson (336).|$|E
5|$|One notable {{establishment}} {{destroyed by}} Union soldiers was the Potter (or Ponder) House, built in 1857, and owned by Ephraim G. Ponder, a holder of 65 slaves before the war. In the battle, {{it was used}} by Confederate sharpshooters until Union artillery inflicted heavy damage. It was never rebuilt. One of Ponder's slaves, Festus <b>Flipper,</b> {{was the father of}} Henry Ossian <b>Flipper,</b> who later became the first African American cadet to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point.|$|E
50|$|Among mammals otariids (fur seals) swim {{primarily}} with their front <b>flippers,</b> using the rear <b>flippers</b> for steering, and phocids (true seals) move the rear <b>flippers</b> laterally, pushing the animal through the water.|$|R
50|$|Weihnachten mit den <b>Flippers</b> (Christmas With the <b>Flippers)</b> is a Christmas album {{released}} by German Schlager group Die <b>Flippers.</b> The album features fourteen traditional German Christmas songs. It was certified Gold in 1988.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} script featured Jerry {{watching the}} TV series <b>Flipper.</b> It was changed due to concerns over music rights.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the hawksbill sea turtle distinguish it from other sea turtle species. Its elongated, tapered head ends in a beak-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), and its beak is more sharply pronounced and hooked than others. The hawksbill's forelimbs have two visible claws on each <b>flipper.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Pliocene, {{larger and}} more {{advanced}} cetaceans appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies to cope with these large whales. Numerous fossilized <b>flipper</b> bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, which suggests that megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its fins before killing and feeding on it.|$|E
50|$|Leatherback turtles {{have the}} most {{hydrodynamic}} body design of any sea turtle, with a large, teardrop-shaped body. A large pair of front <b>flippers</b> powers the turtles through the water. Like other sea turtles, the leatherback has flattened fore limbs adapted for swimming in the open ocean. Claws are absent from both pairs of <b>flippers.</b> The leatherback's <b>flippers</b> are the largest in proportion to its body among extant sea turtles. Leatherback's front <b>flippers</b> can grow up to 2.7 m in large specimens, the largest <b>flippers</b> (even in comparison to its body) of any sea turtle.|$|R
5000|$|Die <b>Flippers</b> (The <b>Flippers)</b> is {{the first}} studio album {{released}} by German Schlager group Die <b>Flippers.</b> It includes their first single [...] "Weine nicht, kleine Eva" [...] {{as well as one}} of their trade mark songs [...] "Sha La La, I Love You".|$|R
50|$|Triple Action was {{the first}} game to feature just two <b>flippers</b> {{at the bottom of}} the playfield. Unlike in modern machines, the <b>flippers</b> faced outwards. These more {{powerful}} <b>flippers</b> were facilitated by the addition of a DC power supply. These innovations were some of many by designer Steve Kordek.|$|R
5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. <b>Flipper</b> movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} <b>Flipper.</b> They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E
5|$|On October 27, 2013, in a 3130 {{win over}} the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson caught 14of16 passes thrown in his direction; he {{finished}} the game with 329 receiving yards and one touchdown. In addition to breaking the Lions' franchise record of 302receiving yards set by Cloyce Box on December 3, 1950, it was the highest receiving yardage ever in a regulation-length game and the second-highest overall single-game yardage in NFL history, behind <b>Flipper</b> Anderson's 336-yard performance in a 1989 overtime win (Anderson accumulated 40of those yards in overtime). In this same game, Calvin also tied Lance Alworth for the most career games with at least 200yards receiving(5).|$|E
50|$|Fins or <b>flippers</b> {{of varying}} forms and at varying {{locations}} (limbs, body, tail) have also evolved {{in a number}} of other tetrapod groups, including diving birds such as penguins (modified from wings), sea turtles (forelimbs modified into <b>flippers),</b> mosasaurs (limbs modified into <b>flippers),</b> and sea snakes (vertically expanded, flattened tail fin).|$|R
50|$|Tubercles {{found on}} the leading edge of {{humpback}} whale's <b>flippers</b> were demonstrated to improve fluid flow over the <b>flipper's</b> surface, exhibiting the tubercle effect of fluid dynamics.|$|R
50|$|Analysis {{of bones}} {{from the four}} <b>flippers</b> suggest that the animal cruised using only the fore-flippers, using the back <b>flippers</b> for extra speed when {{pursuing}} and capturing prey.|$|R
5|$|On a 12-battle victory streak, Razer {{fought in}} the {{eleventh}} heat of the fifth series of Robot Wars. Therein, it defeated BigNipper, Widow's Revengea machine reportedly constructed by the Razer team's wivesand Rick to reach its first series semi-final. Their next opponent was Spawn Again, which was armed with a pneumatic <b>flipper.</b> Equipped with a new lower front wedge, Razer {{was able to get}} underneath Spawn Again and crush it until it broke down. In the quarter finals, Razer faced S3, a cylindrical robot with a vertical spinning blade. Razer's arm sliced into S3's weapon controls, stopping the disc, which allowed Razer to dominate the fight and win on a judges' decision.|$|E
5|$|The Giants' 12–4 {{record in}} 1989 was the NFC's second-best (only to San Francisco's 14–2 record) They lost their divisional playoff game in {{overtime}} to the Rams, 19–13. The {{highlight of the}} game was wide receiver <b>Flipper</b> Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass. After catching the ball, Anderson made a long run to the end zone, silencing the crowd in attendance. In 1989, free-agent acquisition Ottis Anderson ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Rookie Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531 yards, and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The walrus has {{a diverse}} and {{opportunistic}} diet, feeding {{on more than}} 60 genera of marine organisms, including shrimp, crabs, tube worms, soft corals, tunicates, sea cucumbers, various mollusks, and even parts of other pinnipeds. However, it prefers benthic bivalve mollusks, especially clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active <b>flipper</b> movements. The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic {{reptiles}} such as {{sea turtles}} and extinct species like Pliosauroids predominantly use their pectoral <b>flippers</b> to propel themselves {{through the water}} and their pelvic <b>flippers</b> for maneuvering. During swimming they move their pectoral <b>flippers</b> in a dorso-ventral motion, causing forward motion. During swimming, they rotate their front <b>flippers</b> to decrease drag through the water column and increase efficiency. Newly hatched sea turtles exhibit several behavioral skills that help orientate themselves towards the ocean as well as identifying the transition from sand to water. If rotated in the pitch, yaw or roll direction, the hatchlings are capable of counteracting the forces acting upon them by correcting with either their pectoral or pelvic <b>flippers</b> and redirecting themselves towards the open ocean.|$|R
50|$|Cadborosaurus willsi is said by {{witnesses}} {{to resemble a}} serpent with vertical coils or humps in tandem behind the horse-like head and long neck, {{with a pair of}} small elevating front <b>flippers,</b> and either a pair of hind <b>flippers,</b> or a pair of large webbed hind <b>flippers</b> fused to form a large fan-like tail region that provides powerful forward propulsion.|$|R
50|$|The Australian {{sea lion}} is a pinniped, most {{closely related to}} other species of sea lions and fur seals making up the family Otariidae. These mammals use their <b>flippers</b> to propel {{themselves}} in water and can walk on land with their <b>flippers.</b> Australian sea lions share distinct features with other sea lions. These include short fur, short <b>flippers</b> and a bulky body.|$|R
5|$|When swimming, baleen whales rely {{on their}} {{flippers}} for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. <b>Flipper</b> movement is continuous. While doing this, baleen whales use their tail fluke to propel themselves forward through vertical motion while using their flippers for steering, much like an otter. Some species leap out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Because of their great size, right whales are not flexible or agile like dolphins, and none can move their neck because of the fused cervical vertebrae; this sacrifices speed for stability in the water. The hind legs are enclosed inside the body, and {{are thought to be}} vestigial organs. However, a 2014 study suggests that the pelvic bone serves as support for whale genitalia.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in 1988, the Giants started the 1989 season 8–1 and did not allow more than 24 points in any game. After {{suffering}} through a 1–3 stretch, including a 31–10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in Anaheim, the Giants rallied to win their final three games to secure the second {{best record in the}} NFC at 12–4. The division clinching season finale was highlighted by kick returner Dave Meggett's first career punt return for a touchdown. Though many people predicted an NFC Championship showdown between the Giants and the 49ers, the Giants lost their divisional playoff game to the Rams 19–13 in overtime. The highlight of the game was wide receiver <b>Flipper</b> Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass over cornerback Mark Collins. After he caught the pass, Anderson raced down the sideline, through the end zone, and into the tunnel that led to the locker rooms, silencing the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} <b>flipper,</b> {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5000|$|The player {{controls}} the <b>flippers</b> by tapping {{the left or}} right of the screen. The player can also hold the <b>flippers</b> to [...] "catch" [...] the ball, for a more precise shot.|$|R
50|$|The dugong's tail flukes and <b>flippers</b> {{are similar}} to those of dolphins. These flukes are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like <b>flippers</b> which aid in turning and slowing. The dugong lacks nails on its <b>flippers,</b> which are only 15% of a dugong's body length. The tail has deep notches.|$|R
50|$|While otariids {{are known}} for speed and maneuverability, phocids {{are known for}} efficient, {{economical}} movement. This allows most phocids to forage far from land to exploit prey resources, while otariids are tied to rich upwelling zones close to breeding sites. Phocids swim by sideways movements of their bodies, using their hind <b>flippers</b> to fullest effect. Their fore <b>flippers</b> are used primarily for steering, while their hind <b>flippers</b> are bound to the pelvis {{in such a way}} that they cannot bring them under their bodies to walk on them. They are more streamlined than fur seals and sea lions, so can swim more effectively over long distances. However, because they cannot turn their hind <b>flippers</b> downward, they are very clumsy on land, having to wriggle with their front <b>flippers</b> and abdominal muscles.|$|R
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and <b>flipper</b> movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the Civil War, the academy enjoyed unprecedented fame {{as a result}} of the role its graduates had played. However, the post-war years were a difficult time for the academy as it struggled to admit and reintegrate cadets from former confederate states. The first cadets from Southern states were re-admitted in 1868, and 1870 saw the admission of the first black cadet, James Webster Smith of South Carolina. Smith endured harsh treatment and was eventually dismissed for academic deficiency under controversial circumstances in 1874. As a result, Henry O. <b>Flipper</b> of Georgia became the first black graduate in 1877, graduating 50th in a class of 76. Two of the most notable graduates during this period were George Washington Goethals from the class of 1880, and John J. Pershing from the class of 1886. Goethals gained prominence as the chief engineer of the Panama Canal, and Pershing would become famous for his exploits against the famed Pancho Villa in Mexico and later for leading American Forces during World War I.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941 the LRDG, {{now under}} {{command of the}} newly formed Eighth Army, moved from Kufra to Siwa (central Libya). The patrols were given the task of {{watching}} the desert tracks south of Jebel Akhdar and report any signs of reinforcements and withdrawals. 'R1' Patrol was to pick up Captain David Stirling and 30 men who had parachuted behind the lines to raid airfields {{to the west of}} Tobruk. Only 21 men arrived at the rendezvous and were returned to the British lines, later becoming the nucleus of the Special Air Service (SAS). One of the other roles assigned to the LRDG was to transport SAS units behind enemy lines; this continued until the SAS were issued with their own transport in 1942. In early November 'T2' Patrol took four British officers to the Gebel and was to return and collect them three weeks later. The officers were the advance land party of Operation <b>Flipper,</b> which had planned to kill General Rommel.|$|E
