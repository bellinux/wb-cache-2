40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the theme of methanol intoxication. This issue has been known by people for years. However, it came into the consciousness of people and medias at 2012, thanks to the infamous methanol affair. Methanol is extremely dangerous to people, especially because of its properties and its toxicity. Toxic metabolites are mainly: formic acid and formaldehyde. A man is almost unable to recognize the difference between methanol and ethanol- which {{is a part of}} many popular alcoholic beverages. During the methanol intoxication, particularly the basal ganglia and optic nerve are affected. Clinical symptoms of methanol intoxication are <b>ebrieta,</b> gastrointestinal problems such as: abdominal pain and diarrhea. Furthermore: visual disturbances, quantitative disturbance of consciousness, convulsions and acidosis. The severity of poisoning depends mainly on the amount of methanol consumed. Minimal toxic dose is 0. 1 mg per a kilogram of a body weight. The most efficient way, when providing the first aid, is to provide the patient with some ethanol. The most important steps for hospital treatment include administering antidotes of ethanol or fomepizole and hemodialysis. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore the knowledge of paramedics about taking care of a patient who is suspected with methanol poisoning. Qualitative research was conducted through interviews with medical rescuers of the South Bohemian Emergency Medical service. The research sample was given to 10 respondents of different gender, age and length of service. Respondents research group was chosen at random. Respondents were laid a total of 18 questions, which should determine whether paramedics have enough information about the intoxication and ways of how to take care about a patient suspected with methanol intoxication. The results are presented in a box, for better clarity. It showed, during interviews, that only a small part of the respondents have an experience with methanol intoxication. Furthermore, it appeared that the respondents have basic knowledge about methanol intoxication and they should be able to provide the patient, suspected to have intoxication with methanol, with proper first aid and take care of him without hesitation, especially in prehospital emergency care. Further details concerning the research are presented in the discussion. The objective was achieved. We managed, to reply positively on the question: Do paramedics have enough of new knowledge when taking care of patients being suspected with methanol poisoning. Paramedics, employees of the South Bohemian Medical Service have enough knowledge about taking care of a patient, intoxicated by methanol. On the other hand, the rescuers were missing the knowledge about the precise toxic doses of methanol and precise dosage of ethanol as an antidote. Most paramedics also did not know the subsequent exact procedure of hospital treatment, and new types of antidotes. The auxiliary leaflet about metanol intoxication was created on the basis of explored results of practical part of this bachelor thesis to help paramedics. Intoxication with methanol is not so frequent, but it is very dangerous and it is very difficult to diagnose it on the spot. When occured, it is important to know the first aid and the way of how to take care of a patient suspected to be intoxicated with methanol. People should learn from the cases described in the media and also they should stop buying alcoholic products from unknown manufacturers. It would be the prevention of further disaster.

40|$|The {{so-called}} Prima Prattica {{style of}} sixteenth-century polyphonic music was largely codified through {{the music of}} Adriano Willaert and the theoretical writings of his protege Gioseffo Zarlino, both musicians attached to the Chapel of San Marco, the central musical organization of the Republic of Venice. As the century progressed, however, the elements of Willaert's style that were emphasized and emulated by subsequent generations of Venetian musicians took the ceremonial music of the Republic in an aesthetic direction that prioritized expression over balance, sonic effects over contrapuntal clarity, and, at times, bombast over contemplation. The stylistic chasm that developed between this specifically Venetian music {{and what could be}} heard elsewhere in Europe at the time has yet to be adequately acknowledged or explained, a problem for music history especially due to the profound international influence wielded by later Venetian or Venice-adjacent composers such as Gabrieli, Monteverdi, Schütz, and Vivaldi. 	In this dissertation I explore {{the ways in which the}} distinctive cultural, political, religious, and artistic background of the Venetian republic created particular demands which, in conjunction with the unique background and inclinations of Adriano Willaert, led to the creation of this Venetian musical style. In my first chapter, through a brief examination of the foundational preoccupations of the republic and Church of Venice, I establish broad, categorical differences between the cultural demands of it and neighboring states. Next, in chapter two, I more closely investigate the historical circumstances of Venice in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries in order to show how material factors influenced the creation of the Venetian style to occur when and how it did. My third chapter looks specifically at the role of literary humanism in the Venetian cultural florescence of the early sixteenth century and in the work of Willaert, through the composer's own humanistic activities, particularly his Horatian secular motet Quid non <b>Ebrietas</b> Designat. Finally, in chapter four I examine Willaert's music for the Church of Venice, specifically his dual-choir, coro spezzato psalm settings, as a response to the specifically Venetian aesthetic demands set up in the previous chapters...|$|E
