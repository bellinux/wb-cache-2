25|$|CCR5 {{is one of}} {{the cell}} entry co-factors {{associated}} with HIV, most frequently involved with nonsyncytium-inducing strains, is most apparent in HIV patients as opposed to AIDS patients. A 32 base pair deletion in CCR5 has been identified as a mutation that negates the likelihood of an HIV infection. This region on the open reading frame ORF contains a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon. This leads to the loss of the HIV-coreceptor function in vitro. CCR5-1 is considered the wild type and CCR5-2 is considered to be the mutant allele. Those with a heterozygous mutation for the CCR5 were less susceptible to the development of HIV. In a study, despite <b>high</b> <b>exposure</b> to the HIV virus, there was no one homozygous for the CCR5 mutation that tested positive for HIV.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during the}} course of cultivation, the land was {{stripped}} of its natural vegetation where shrubs were usually processed into charcoal, and the soil disc-ploughed and seeded. Although yields were initially <b>high,</b> <b>exposure</b> of the topsoil to deflation and erosion, combined with nutrient depletion in the absence of crop rotation schemes, led to drastic declines within just a few years and rapid deforestation. The cultivators then were forced to relocate to virgin plots and the process was repeated. The abandoned land- meanwhile became useless not only for cultivation, but also as grazing ground because of the destruction of the native vegetation. By the end of the 1970s, eight million feddans (34,000km2) had already come under cultivation (Shepherd, 1983). The attendant processes of desertification have been well documented and shown to have led to a significant expansion of the desert to the south (Ibrahim, 1978)..|$|E
25|$|Evidence from {{research}} on the Christchurch earthquakes reveals that increased trauma exposure is not exclusively correlated with negative outcomes. Those with relatively <b>high</b> <b>exposure</b> to earthquake damage show an increase in positive effects, including an increase in personal strength, growth in social relationships, the bringing of families closer, and realizing what's important in life. It's thought that natural disasters, such as earthquakes, are able to induce these positive effects because they affect an entire community, in comparison to an event that targets only an individual. The damage on a community can lead members to engage in pro-social behaviors which are driven by empathy and desire to support others who have endured a similar traumatizing experience. Positive effects, such as {{a greater sense of}} community connection, can aide in helping the community heal as a whole. Implemented programs can use this knowledge to help survivors focus on the positive effects, possibly working with families to help them get through the disaster with the people they feel closest with.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} past <b>high</b> sun <b>exposure</b> is {{associated}} with a reduced risk of multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: Population based case-control study. SETTING: Tasmania, latitudes 41 - 3 degrees S. PARTICIPANTS: 136 cases with multiple sclerosis and 272 controls randomly drawn from the community and matched on sex and year of birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Multiple sclerosis defined by both clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria. RESULTS: <b>Higher</b> sun <b>exposure</b> when aged 6 - 15 years (average 2 - 3 hours or more a day in summer during weekends and holidays) was associated with a decreased risk of multiple sclerosis (adjusted odds ratio 0. 31, 95 % confidence interval 0. 16 to 0. 59). <b>Higher</b> <b>exposure</b> in winter seemed more important than <b>higher</b> <b>exposure</b> in summer. Greater actinic damage was also independently associated with a decreased risk of multiple sclerosis (0. 32, 0. 11 to 0. 88 for grades 4 - 6 disease). A dose-response relation was observed between multiple sclerosis and decreasing sun exposure when aged 6 - 15 years and with actinic damage. CONCLUSION: <b>Higher</b> sun <b>exposure</b> during childhood and early adolescence {{is associated with}} a reduced risk of multiple sclerosis.

30|$|Currently, {{treatment}} of metastatic RCC with the TKI sunitinib is recommended {{as one of}} the first therapy options [7],[15],[16]. Sunitinib causes reduced tumor size or growth rate. In the current study, smaller Caki- 1 tumor sizes were observed in the treated mice. Meta-analysis of metastatic RCC studies has shown that <b>higher</b> <b>exposure</b> to sunitinib is correlated with improved treatment outcomes. Patients with the <b>highest</b> <b>exposure</b> to sunitinib had longer times to progression, and the probability of decreases in tumor size or of halting tumor growth was higher in patients with the <b>highest</b> <b>exposure</b> to sunitinib [16],[43]. However, after therapy, Caki- 1 tumors reached similar sizes again, indicating that the tumors regained their molecular characteristics which are essential for tumor development and growth. Changes occurring during therapy with sunitinib seem to be reversed after treatment disruption, leading to further tumor progression. The goal in patients would be to have a maximum exposure time to sunitinib which is associated with longer time to tumor progression, longer overall survival, and greater decrease in tumor size [43].|$|R
