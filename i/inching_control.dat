40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a methodology to predict the reactivity impact as a function of outage time between cycles of 3 He, 6 Li, and other poisons in the High Flux Isotope Reactor s (HFIR) beryllium reflector. The reactivity worth at startup of the HFIR has been incorrectly predicted in the past after the reactor has been shut-down for long periods of time. The incorrect prediction was postulated to be due to the erroneous calculation of 3 He buildup in the beryllium reflector. It is necessary to develop a better estimate of the start-of-cycle symmetric critical control element positions since if the estimated and actual symmetrical critical control element positions differ by more than $ 1. 55 in reactivity (approximately one-half <b>inch</b> in <b>control</b> element startup position), HFIR is to be shutdown and a technical evaluation is performed to resolve the discrepancy prior to restart. 3 He is generated and depleted during operation, but during an outage, the depletion of 3 He ceases because it is a stable isotope. 3 He is born from the radioactive decay of tritium, and thus the concentration of 3 He increases during shutdown. SCALE, specifically the TRITON and CSAS 5 control modules including the KENO V. A, COUPLE, and ORIGEN functional modules were utilized in this study. An equation relating the down time (td) to the change in symmetric control element position was generated and validated against measurements for approximately 40 HFIR operating cycles.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the effectiveness of four methods of incorporating the herbicide trifluralin into the soil, and to determine the interaction between depth of incorporation of trifluralin and depth of weed seed germination. Field experiments on green and dry peas were established in Oregon and Idaho. Trifluralin, applied at four rates, was incorporated by a rototiller, tine-tooth harrow, spike-tooth harrow or double-disked, prior to planting. At time of harvest, yields were taken and plots were evaluated for weed control. On dry peas, only the tine-tooth harrow gave unsatisfactory incorporation of trifluralin. Increasing the rate of trifluralin, regardless of the method of incorporation, reduced the yield of dry peas, indicating injury. On green peas, both the double-disk and rototiller satisfactorily incorporated trifluralin. However, yields from the rototiller plots were slightly less than those from the disk plots. No injury was noted with increasing rates of trifluralin. Greenhouse experiments were conducted at Corvallis to determine the effect of increasing the depth of incorporation and depth of weed seed germination on the herbicidal activity of trifluralin. Trifluralin, applied at three rates, was incorporated to four depths and planted at three depths to pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.). Pigweed was not affected when planted below the trifluralin-treated zone. Only pigweed plants whose roots grew into the trifluralin were controlled. Shoot uptake appeared to be more effective than root uptake by barn-yardgrass.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) System designed by General Electric and {{tested in the}} NASA Lewis Research Center's (LERC) 48 <b>inch</b> Active Noise <b>Control</b> Fan (ANCF). The goal {{of this study is}} to assess the feasibility of using wall mounted secondary acoustic sources and sensors within the duct of a high bypass turbofan aircraft engine for global active noise cancellation of fan tones. The GE ANC system is based on a modal control approach. A known acoustic mode propagating in the fan duct is canceled using an array of flush-mounted compact sound sources. The canceling modal signal is generated by a modal controller. Inputs to the controller are signals from a shaft encoder and from a microphone array which senses the residual acoustic mode in the duct. The key results are that the (6, 0) was completely eliminated at the 920 Hz design frequency and substantially reduced elsewhere. The total tone power was reduced 6. 8 dB (out of a possible 9. 8 dB). Farfield reductions of 15 dB (SPL) were obtained. The (4, 0) and (4, 1) modes were reduced simultaneously yielding a 15 dB PWL decrease. The results indicate that global attenuation of PWL at the target frequency was obtained in the aft quadrant using an ANC actuator and sensor system totally contained within the duct. The quality of the results depended on precise mode generation. High spillover into spurious modes generated by the ANC actuator array caused less than optimum levels of PWL reduction. The variation in spillover is believed to be due to calibration procedure, but must be confirmed in subsequent tests...|$|R

Keys to success in perennial weed control with herbicides are good {{growing conditions}} and correct growth stage of the weed. Flower bud through flowering stages are ideal for treatment of perennial weeds with 2, 4 -D, Banvel, and Roundup. Canada thistle, field bindweed, hemp dogbane, and common milkweed on undisturbed sites are at or approaching these growth stages. Swamp smartweed will be later in reaching treatment stage. ACR acres are an opportunity to deal with these weeds without a crop involved. Poast Cleared For Use on Dry Edible Beans The Environmental Protection Agency has granted Nebraska a specific exemption under the provisions of Section 18 to use Poast for the control of wild proso millet and volunteer corn in dry edible beans. Poast can be applied at a maximum rate of 1 1 / 2 pints per acre and may be applied twice during the growing season. The total amount of Poast applied during the growing season should not exceed 2 2 / 3 pints per acre. Applications of Poast should be made at least 60 days before harvest. Wild proso millet and volunteer corn should be treated when they are between 4 to 10 and 6 to 20 inches tall, respectively. Fieldbeans at all stages of growth are tolerant to Poast. Poast can be applied by air or ground in a minimum of 5 gallons of water per acre. A permit system will be in effect for the use of Poast on dry edible beans and, therefore, the grower should contact his local pesticide dealer for the appropriate permit.
