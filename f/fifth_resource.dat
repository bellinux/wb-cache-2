40|$|The main {{research}} question: "Which {{real estate}} strategies {{have been successful}} for Dutch multinationals, {{and what can be}} learned from these successful strategies for the future"? Methodology: In order to answer this research question, both theoretical and empirical research is necessary. The theoretical research consists out of three chapters: business strategy, real estate strategy and economic context. The empirical research is based on four Dutch multinationals: Royal Ahold, AkzoNobel, Royal Shell and ING Group. This empirical research is a combination of document analysis, observations and multiple interviews, resulting in case descriptions. Subsequently, a cross case analyses will be made which, together with the theoretical research, will form the basis for the conclusions and recommendations. Conclusions: This research shows that when using a pro-active alignment, real estate is used as <b>fifth</b> <b>resource</b> in order to achieve organizational objectives. When a pro-active alignment is used, the chances increase that real estate strategies are more successful. Main reason is that real estate is used as <b>fifth</b> <b>resource,</b> and the fact that pre-determined organization- and real estate strategies are consistent and have a clear process and content, which makes real estate used more efficiently, provided that the context is supportive. However, this is not always the case. The research also shows that when using a re-active alignment, real estate is not used as <b>fifth</b> <b>resource</b> in order to achieve organizational objectives. Yet, the real estate strategies could still be successful. Research shows that sometimes, dependent on the combination of high contextual influences and type of organization, a re-active alignment is preferable. The research shows that the contextual influences are very important and always have to taken into consideration. The research shows that the context influences both the process and the content of both organizational- and real estate strategies. Based on this research, several context aspects that influence the organization could be presented: the 4 th and 5 th Kondratiev wave, market tendencies, governmental regulations, product demands, corporate image, and customers-whishes. It could be concluded that a successful real estate strategy does not have to consist out of certain pre determined themes. Successful real estate strategies are strategies that support the organizational objectives. The research shows that well-organized strategies with explicit themes (Like Ahold and Shell) often have a greater chance of success. In the case of AkzoNobel, the real estate strategies are context based and do not contain clear themes. Nevertheless, these strategies were successful too. For future successful real estate strategies, it could be stated that when designing a real estate strategy, one should investigate the context and possible future developments (for example scenario planning) and determine the possible threads and opportunities. Depending on the type of organization, branch and context influences, the decision should be made whether or not to use pro-active or re-active alignment. Architectur...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this paper is}} the {{physical}} resource base that supports any business: corporate operational real estate assets. In order to achieve the much-needed alignment between business strategic direction and its real estate infrastructure, the organization's strategic intent must clearly reflect its facilities requirements in its strategic business plans. The significance of the strategic role of real estate assets to corporate performance can be seen in a recent influential research report by The Industrial Development Research Foundation in which corporate real estate assets are termed the <b>fifth</b> <b>resource,</b> after the traditional resources of people, technology, information, and capital. Based on a comprehensive survey of published literature and a series of in-depth interviews of corporate real estate/facilities managers, an integrating resource management framework was developed to model the nature of interactions between strategic business planning and operational asset management in an organizational setting. The proposed framework is grounded on an understanding of the nature and demands of core business requirements from which the requirements for real estate and facility services provisions are derived. The study supports the view that research efforts aimed at improving management effectiveness of the operational real estate asset base should be channeled to provide models or frameworks that promote understanding of all parties involved in the process.

On the other hand, {{this kind of}} information is useful in language processing systems. While semantic relatedness has been extensively studied for English using numerous language resources, such as associative norms, human judgements and datasets generated from lexical databases, no evaluation resources of this kind have been available for Russian to date. Our contribution addresses this problem. We present five language resources of different scale and purpose for Russian semantic relatedness, each being a list of triples (wordi, wordj, similarityij). Four of them are designed for evaluation of systems for computing semantic relatedness, complementing each other in terms of the semantic relation type they represent. These benchmarks were used to organise a shared task on Russian semantic relatedness, which attracted 19 teams.

This study is a comprehensive qualitative analysis of diversity as a socioeconomic force. Just what is diversity? Some say diversity is basic to the progress of civilization, a fundamental aspect of human existence. If diversity is such a defining characteristic of the human experience and society, then {{it stands to reason that}} it is also a basic feature of all complex organizations, such as institutions of higher education. The primary purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate that diversity is a fundamental socioeconomic force. As such, diversity is a foundational aspect of human capital and organizational performance. The concept of diversity capital is introduced as a means to describe these relationships. In support of this thesis, six thematic areas are progressively and cumulatively addressed, leading to an appreciation of diversity as a strategic human resource. First, the complexity of diversity is considered through the process of describing an appropriate research methodology and perspective. Second, the challenging issue of definition is investigated, leading to a contextually relevant description of diversity that is as thorough and comprehensive as possible. Third, three paradigms (compliance, social justice, and strategic performance), which demonstrate evolving management practices and organizational perspectives on diversity, are developed as a conceptual base and analytical tool. Fourth, the nature of diversity as a human resource is considered, resulting in the recognition of diversity capital as a fundamental form of human capital. <b>Fifth,</b> human <b>resource</b> development, organizational development, and human resource management are considered as integral methods for organizations to engage diversity as a strategic resource and competitive advantage, leading to a consideration of "best practices.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the role of Multilateral Development Institutions (MDIs) in {{promoting}} economic and social progress in Less Developed Countries (LDC). After examining the activities of the main MDIs (International Monetary Fund, WorldBank Group, Interamerican Development Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) we have come to some conclusions. First, MDIs loans play a catalytic effect in channeling flows of additional public or private resources to LDC. Second, MDIs emphasize both the role of the private sector and an efficient public sector to achieve its objectives (to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, etc.). Third, MDIs provide direct financing for private sector activities, restructuring and privatisation to encourage the development of market economies as well as funding for the infrastructure that supports these activities. Fourth, over the last few years the MDIs have increased their conditionalities on the borrowers, especially in environment and governance areas. <b>Fifth,</b> the <b>resources</b> provided by the MDIs are not enough to cope with the financial needs of LDC; furthermore, a low percentage of total loans are on concessional terms. Sixth, most of the MDIs resources go to the benefit of medium-income countries (South Korea, Mexico, Brazil, etc.) and only a small amount of credits go to the poorest countries; whatÂ´s more, in the last few last years MDIs are increasing their financial support of countries in the East. Seventh, MDIs have integrated social sector and environment as a first-order priority in their reports, but the lending reality is far from incorporating such an aim: one thing istheory, the other is practice. Eighth, MDIsâ institutional structures and decision-making processes are similar, as in most of them the principle of one dollar one vote holds. As a result, the MDIs are dominated by the developed countries, which use such institutions as tools to implement their foreign interests. Ninth, regional development banks work closely with many other international organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which have assumed the role of world development organizations without need of formal constitutional amendments: rather merely through introducing new institutional practices are changes effected. And tenth, since the economic growth and development model encouraged by MDIs in developing member countries is very unfair, the model has a negative social and environmental impact: transnational corporations end up the big winners...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between corporate ownership and radical boundary spanning of multinational corporations (MNCs). Hypotheses are developed based on a multi-theoretic approach that uses the concepts of boundary spanning exploration, resource dependence theory (RDT), and corporate ownership from the management literature with the resource triangle {{from the field of}} geology. It is hypothesized that the form of corporate ownership is associated with radical boundary spanning. Corporate ownership is also proposed {{to be associated with the}} firm 2 Ì 7 s commitment to radical boundary spanning. Finally, the location 2 Ì 7 s resource attractiveness is hypothesized to moderate {{the relationship between}} the form of corporate ownership and commitment to radical boundary spanning. A multilevel, two-part model is used to test the hypotheses. The data for this study are collected from international market-based transactions of petroleum resource deposits including buyers and sellers from the petroleum industry from the years 2005 - 2012, inclusively. The results of this study suggest family or individual owned buyer MNCs are significantly less likely to radically boundary span, corporate owned buyer MNCs are significantly less committed to radical boundary spanning than both state and financial owned buyer MNCs, and that miscellaneous owned MNCs are less committed to radical boundary spanning in target countries that are more resource attractive. This study offers three theoretical contributions. First, this study adds to RDT by suggesting that more progressive evaluation of external resources is needed. Second, in existing RDT, dependence is assumed to stem from a simple reliance on more powerful firms. The findings from this study suggest that dependence also stems from reliance on a functioning market in which external resources can be bought and sold. Finally, this study adds a <b>fifth</b> type of <b>resource</b> constraint, the availability of natural resources, and suggests that resource constraints can actually become greater because of firm activities. ...|$|R
40|$|D. P. H. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Increased {{prevalence}} of childhood obesity {{is a public}} health problem. From 1976 to 2010, the national prevalence has increased from 5 % to approximately 17 %, and Native Hawaiians youth {{are more likely to}} be obese than White and Asian youth. Obese children and adolescents are more likely than healthy-weight youth to maintain excess weight into adulthood and experience earlier onset of chronic disease. Based on the socio-ecological model, this dissertation examined three questions. The first question was: "Is there an association between weight status (healthy, overweight or obese) and dietary behaviors, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, smoking, and bullying victimization among HawaiÊ»i 's public school adolescents, and are there differences in association by ethnic-sex groups?" A secondary data analysis of the 2011 HYRBS was conducted. The second question was: "Is there a difference in engagement of healthy behaviors and weight status for 9 th grade Native Hawaiian students by school type (public vs. private) ?" Data were collected from Native Hawaiian 9 th graders in private school (N= 252) and compared to HYRBS data for Native Hawaiian 9 th graders in public school (N= 335). Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine if school type was a significant predictor of weight status. The third question was: "How do obese Native Hawaiian adolescents perceive supports and challenges to healthy eating and physical activity in their school and neighborhood environments?" Photovoice was used, through which students took photographs and wrote captions to illustrate their perceptions. Five key findings emerged. First, Native Hawaiian adolescents have a higher {{prevalence of}} obesity than White, Japanese, and Filipino adolescents, but a lower prevalence than Other Pacific Islanders. Second, females were less likely than males to have an obese weight status regardless of school type. Third, Native Hawaiian 9 th graders in private school had a lower prevalence of obesity than Native Hawaiian 9 th graders in public school. Fourth, students who engaged in physical activity at least 5 days a week had a greater healthy weight-to-obese ratio. <b>Fifth,</b> limitations in <b>resources</b> (financial, community, or school) contribute to increased weight status. These findings can help inform the tailoring of interventions to prevent and reduce obesity among Native Hawaiians adolescents...|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} {{revolution of}} cyberspace has forced various institutions to reinvent. In recent years, many {{colleges and universities}} have converted partially or wholly to distance education or 2 Ì 2 e-Iearning. 2 Ì 2 However, countless other schools and learning institutions (especially ministry training) remain firmly entrenched within site-based, seat-time, lecture-rooted, modern educational frames. And therefore, the problem arises: how can cyber technology and on-line educational delivery systems train and equip youth and family ministry students for professional or lay ministly? The purpose of this work is an investigation of electronic learning in order to propose alternative strategies for future youth ministry education. Ultimately, readers will {{gain a better understanding of}} a digital environment and its impact upon potential youth ministry e-training systems for future improvement and expansion of a ministry school 2 Ì 7 s youth worker education. In order to address this problem, it is proposed institutions of Christian higher learning proactively seek conversion of traditional site-based learning platforms to nontraditional distance learning strategies or risk future obsolescence. In particular, there is a need for entry-level youth ministry education that is available solely online; especially since many churches seek effective, affordable, flexible training for volunteers, lay teachers and ministry leaders. It is an obvious assumption that most current institution leaders in academics, especially within ministry training schools, remain firmly committed to seat-based, time-rooted educational approaches. E-learning, however, is a rising alternative that many Christian colleges are investigating. The project will be a designed distance learning course on Children 2 Ì 7 s Ministry available for use in multiple ministry schools.

40|$|Instead of {{catch-up}} development {{suggested by}} the predominant Modernization Theories, the global gap of incomes and resource consumption has further widened since World War II. The World Systems Theory finds unequal exchange within the global division of labour as a key mechanism to consolidate the polarisation between poor and rich. This dissertation analyses {{this aspect of the}} World Systems Theory of a global redistribution from poor to rich countries quantitatively in two dimensions: 1. The monetary unequal exchange â as monetary transfer â is calculated by using purchasing power parities, which show the different price levels between poor and rich countries. 2. The ecological unequal exchange â as ecological transfer â is calculated by the trade balances of ecological footprint, which measures the resource use for the traded goods. The methods used allow estimates of unequal exchange for the period from 1960 to 2003. The results confirm the assumption of a global redistribution and its effect on the development of countries. Unequal exchange between the world-system zones is substantial: The monetary transfer in the form of labour power from the peripheries to the core exceeds the reverse flow of development assistance and investment many times; and the ecological transfer to the core covers almost one <b>fifth</b> of its <b>resource</b> consumption. The semiperiphery and China suffer the biggest monetary transfer losses, since they are more deeply integrated into the global division of labour than the poorer countries of the periphery. Regarding the ecological transfer, likewise, the natural resource capacity has an important effect on the trade balance: Rich countries with low resource capacity gain and poor countries with high resource capacity lose most in turns of ecological transfer. Within the analysed period from 1960 to 2003, unequal exchange increased significantly. Particularly since 1980, when the monetary transfer increase accelerated, caused by growing world trade and especially the rising price differential between poor and rich countries. The latter is also confirmed by the trend of the terms of trade that are used as an alternative measure. Thus, unequal exchange seems to influence economic development: In very rare cases countries are able to improve their position within the world economy, even if they suffer losses from unequal exchange. However, in general countries that lose ecological and particularly monetary transfer reach much lower economic growth than those that gain transfers. Consequently the intensification of global division of labour promotes unequal development...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{education}} is pivotal to professional socialisation and mandatory registration of physiotherapy students. Traditionally, responsibility for student {{learning in the}} clinical environment resides with experienced physiotherapists in tandem with their other tasks, predominantly providing patient care. Competing stakeholder interests, however, converge on clinical educators. They are challenged to meet expectations and demands from, for example, patients, colleagues and academic staff. While crucial to the processes of clinical education, there is little known about clinical educators and their perspectives. This research, therefore, examined power interplay in clinical education in New Zealand {{from the perspectives of}} clinical educators, and contextualised by perceptions of associated stakeholders. It is located in the critical paradigm, and was underpinned by Bourdieuâs theories. Recommendations for change emerged which provide strategies for enhancing relationships to promote a more cohesive and unified approach to clinical education across organisations and the profession. Methodology, method and analysis were informed by Bourdieuâs research procedures; specifically three levels of interaction between habitus and field were applied. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 18 clinical educators and 18 stakeholders in clinical education. Participants included academic staff, managers, representatives of the profession, and students. Emergent themes were affirmed by, and further explored, with seven of the 18 clinical educators. Five key findings emerged. First, the framework verified and clarified power interplay in New Zealand clinical education. Second, clinical educators were identified as a distinctive and disadvantaged social class. Third, hierarchies were found, based on knowledge which valued âclinicalâ, âeducationâ and âresearchâ differently, and by association, those who imparted such knowledge. Fourth, competing value systems were symbolic of different organisation perspectives: stakeholders as service providers and consumers competed for <b>resources.</b> <b>Fifth,</b> services provided by clinical educators have become commodified, and located within the commercial world of healthcare. This was found to be contrary to the vocational origins of the physiotherapy profession, and professional obligation of physiotherapists to train the future workforce. It is recommended that the value of clinical educators and pedagogy is reappraised by organisations and the profession. Ways of increasing the visibility of pedagogy in undergraduate curricula warrants review. Career pathways in clinical education offer another review focus. In this thesis, several strategies are proposed to reduce the dissonance in knowledge and social hierarchies including simulated learning in the classroom, collaborative research, and joint lecturer-practitioner positions. Research is warranted that investigates the preparedness of physiotherapy graduates for the New Zealand workforce. The economic consequences of students in the workplace and the patientâs voice as consumer of clinical education should be investigated by future researchers...|$|R
