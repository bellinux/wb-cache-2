To address these issues we construct a new panel dataset linking Moody's data on <b>commercial</b> <b>paper</b> issues with Standard and Poor's Compustat. High credit quality is a requirement for entry into the <b>commercial</b> <b>paper</b> market, but long-term credit quality (bond rating) is not a sufficient statistic for short-term quality. These characteristics allow firms to issuenear-riskless short-term debt and supply a near-money asset to themarket, thereby reducing their interest costs by the amount of the" <b>commercial</b> <b>paper</b> liquidity premium.

Our data support three explanations for this apparent contradiction, all of which recognize that <b>commercial</b> <b>paper</b> issuers are atypical.
