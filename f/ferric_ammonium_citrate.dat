50|$|Different {{blueprint}} processes {{based on}} photosensitive ferric compounds have been used. The best known {{is probably a}} process using <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate</b> and potassium ferricyanide. In this procedure a distinctly blue compound is formed and the process {{is also known as}} cyanotype. The paper is impregnated with a solution of <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate</b> and dried. When the paper is illuminated a photoreaction turns the trivalent (ferric) iron into divalent (ferrous) iron. The image is then developed using a solution of potassium ferricyanide forming insoluble ferroferricyanide (Turnbell's blue identical to Prussian blue) with the divalent iron. Excess <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate</b> and potassium ferricyanide are then washed away.|$|R
40|$|Starter {{cultures}} for dairy fermentations {{are commonly}} made by anaerobic fermentation in New Zealand. Anaerobic fermentation involves glycolysis {{and it is}} a very inefficient pathway due to the formation of energy rich products such as lactic acid. This pathway only produces 2 moles of ATP per glycolysis and to conserve energy, the amount of biomass produced is less. Aerobic fermentation on the other hand can produce up to 36 moles of ATP per cycle, and the amount of biomass produced will be higher compared to anaerobic fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria do not possess a functional electron transport chain for aerobic respiration to be efficient. It requires the addition of heme, for the electron transport chain to work. The heme addition is a patented process. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimise the aerobic fermentation process for Lactococcus lactis for biomass production. An extensive literature search shows that there has been no study in optimising the heme concentration or using other alternatives for heme. Alternatives to heme, that are food grade, are an attractive option, as there is sourcing issues with heme in New Zealand. A series of shake flask trials were carried out to identify a possible heme replacement. The shake flask trials showed that <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate</b> is a possible alternative heme replacement. More shake flask trials were then evaluated to optimise the concentration of <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate.</b> Following that, 1 -L fermenter trials were evaluated to optimise heme concentration and to compare the effect of heme and <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate</b> addition on biomass and activity of the harvested biomass following a freeze and thaw cycle. It was shown that 44 µg/mL <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate</b> resulted in the most biomass of the concentrations tested. For heme, the optimum concentration was 1 µg/mL. It was found that fermentations using heme resulted in more biomass after 5 h compared to using <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate.</b> But, cells grown by adding <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate</b> was equally as active...|$|R

The control flask contained {{a combination of}} all nitrogen sources present into Asther medium.

2500|$|The citrate ion forms {{complexes}} with metallic cations. The stability constants for {{the formation}} of these complexes are quite large because of the chelate effect. Consequently, it forms complexes even with alkali metal cations. However, when a chelate complex is formed using all three carboxylate groups, the chelate rings have 7 and 8 members, which are generally less stable thermodynamically than smaller chelate rings. In consequence, the hydroxyl group can be deprotonated, forming part of a more stable 5-membered ring, as in <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate,</b> (NH4)5Fe(C6H4O7)2·2H2O.)5Fe(C6H4O7)2·2H2O ...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacteria {{are one of}} {{the richest}} sources of {{biomedical}} relevant compounds with extensive therapeutic pharmaceutical applications and are also known as producer of intracellular and extracellular metabolites with diverse biological activities. The genus Anabaena sp. is known to produce antimicrobial compounds, like phycocyanin and others. The goal {{of this study was to}} optimize the production of these bioactive compounds. The Plackett–Burman experimental design was used to screen and evaluate the important medium components that influence the production of bioactive compounds. In this present study, eight independent factors including NaNO 3, K 2 HPO 4, MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O, CaCl 2, citric acid, <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate,</b> ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium magnesium salt (EDTA-Na 2 Mg) and Na 2 CO 3 were surveyed and the effective variables for algal components production of Anabaena oryzae were determined using two-levels Plackett–Burman design.

50|$|Deliquescent {{materials}} are substances (mostly salts) {{that have a}} strong affinity for moisture and will absorb relatively large amounts {{of water from the}} atmosphere if exposed to it, forming an aqueous solution.

5000|$|Cyanotype, also {{referred}} to as [...] "blueprinting", is the oldest non-silver photographic printing process. It involves exposing materials which have been treated with a solution of potassium ferricyanide and <b>ferric</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> to a UV light source such as the sun. Negative or positive images can be obtained by blocking UV light from reaching the sensitized material. For example, a negative image can be produced by placing a leaf upon paper treated with this solution and exposing to sunlight for 10 to 20 minutes. The paper will retain the image of the leaf after it has been rinsed with water. Once the paper dries, parts that were exposed to the sun will turn a shade of Prussian blue (ferric ferrocyanide), while parts that were covered by the leaf will remain white.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{extracellular}} mycobacterial enzyme {{was identified}} in the ruminant pathogen Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. The enzyme was capable of mobilizing iron from different sources such as <b>ferric</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate,</b> ferritin, and transferrin by reduction of the metal. The purified reductase had a calculated Mr of 17, 000, was sensitive to proteinase K treatment, and had an isoelectric point of pH 9. Analysis of the amino acid composition revealed glycine, serine, asparagine (or aspartic acid), and glutamine (or glutamic acid) as the most frequently occurring residues.

When gonococci and spermatozoa were mixed together in media with and without AFC, the proportion of spermatozoa with adherent gonococci was approximately the same in each case.

It {{was found that}} the shell of the VGCFs consisted of densely-packed domains embedded in loosely-packed matrix, and both were highly amorphous. Regular edge planes as observed on the surface of fishbone nanofibers do not exist on VGCFs. Hence, surface treatment is more important for the deposition of catalysts. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>citrate</b> (AFC) was employed for the impregnation of iron, where the high viscosity of the aqueous solution of AFC is beneficial. Calcination was found to be a key step to improve the dispersion of the iron particles, which can be attributed to enhanced interactions between iron and carbon due to the gasification of carbon occurring at the iron-carbon interface. Quantitative analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the calcination of the supported AFC led to a higher atomic concentration of iron on the surface, indicating smaller particle size and higher dispersion. Secondary carbon nanofibers were grown subsequently on the VGCFs from cyclohexane.
