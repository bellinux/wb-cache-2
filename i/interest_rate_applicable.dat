It argues that, given recent developments in <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> spreads and the credit markets' increased sensitivity to risk, the <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>applicable</b> to the entire amount of Greece's external debt would tend to be higher with a fiscal expansion than without one. Moreover, it deduces from a simple model that the leakages associated with increased interest payments to foreign creditors could well cancel out any positive multiplier effects generated by a fi scal expansion, resulting in a failure to stimulate growth. The implications of this finding for policy is that Greece should continue to avoid the adoption of a fi scal stimulus package, not only out of respect to its fiscal obligations as an EU member but, ultimately, because such a package would be ineffective as an economic recovery tool. While the analysis focuses on the Greek economy, it may be of relevance to other EU economies suffering from serious macroeconomic imbalances...|$|R

5000|$|Although this {{is often}} {{overlooked}} by economists Marx himself used a uniform rate of profit for all industries in Capital Vol. 3 only for modelling purposes, to show in a simple way how the ruling profit rates on capital impacted {{on the development of}} production system, and he explicitly denied that a uniform rate of profit obtained in reality; he only argued that at any time there would exist an average [...] "minimum acceptable" [...] profit rate on capital invested in industries, and if there was no realistic possibility at all of reaching at least that profit rate sometime in the future, capital would very likely be disinvested after a while, since the relevant business would then simply lack commercial viability; alternatively, the business would be taken over, and restructured to restore an acceptable profit rate. This minimum profit rate applying to new investments is closely linked to the ruling <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>applicable</b> to producing enterprises.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the impact of the techniques foreseen in the Basel Agreement II (BII) for mitigating the risk of default on bank loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In particular, we will conduct an analysis of the effect of the guarantees that the Loan Guarantee Association (LGA) offer to the SMEs on the assignment of capital requirements of the financial entities under BII. At the same time, the study will examine the effect of this guarantee on the credit risk premium that the financial entities should charge their clients, and whether this foreseeable decrease in the <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>applicable</b> to the SMEs is compensated by the cost of the guarantee. The results show that, considering that the cost of the LGA guarantee in Spain is around 0. 68 %, it will be advantageous for an SME with the annual sales of less than or equal to € 5 million to request this guarantee whenever the probability of default (PD) of the LGA is < 1. 1 %, if the approach utilised by the financial entity is the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) and the SME is considered as corporate; however, if the SME is included in a regulatory retail portfolio, then the limit for the PD of the LGA decreases to 0. 71 %. On the other hand, when the approach utilised is the Standardised one, then will be profitable for an SME treated as retail to request this guarantee whenever the PD of the LGA is < 3. 35 % (3. 95 % for corporate exposures) ...|$|R

Changes in short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> after controlling for other crucial variables such as changes in the rates of inflation and economic activity, take a lead role in driving changes in the nominal yields of Indian government bonds.

40|$|The Cassation Bench of the Federal Supreme Court {{decided that}} a {{contract}} of loan with 10 per cent <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> per month establishes a crime of usury as provided under Article 712 of the Criminal Code. The court reasoned out that 10 % <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> per month violates the official <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and therefore the creditor has committed the crime of usury. The court does not expressly mention which official rate it is referring to –in its decisions. Nevertheless, considering {{that there is no}} any other official <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> that is provided by the law in Ethiopia, it can be easily inferred that the court was tacitly referring to the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> provided in the Civil Code. The question is therefore whether the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> provided under Article 2479 of the Civil Code overrides Proclamation No. 591 / 2008 (based on which the National Bank of Ethiopia issues directives on <b>interest</b> <b>rates).</b> Article 5 (4) of the Proclamation has empowered the National Bank of Ethiopia to determine official <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and {{it is clear from the}} provisions of the Proclamation that this mandate includes the power to determine <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> that are <b>applicable</b> in private loan agreements. Directive NBE/INT/ 11 / 2010 / has given financial institutions the authority to determine <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> freely; whereas, it remains silent about the <b>applicable</b> maximum <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> for private loans. I argue that Proclamation No. 591 / 2008 has repealed Article 2479 of the Civil Code and the silence of the directive with regard to private loans does not imply the revivification of Article 2479 of the Civil Code. Furthermore, the court has overseen the elements of Article 712 of the Criminal Code that establish the crime of usury. For a crime of usury to be established under the provision, the exorbitant <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> should be the result of debtor’s dependence on the creditor, material difficulty, inexperience, or weak character that is unfairly manipulated by the creditornrpages: 248 - 254 status: publishe...|$|R

The data required to analyze the transmission system of the TNC project and also to perform the economic analysis on the duplication of pipe lines were collected from the TNC project office, MIS Nihon Sudio consultants I Cey water consultants, NWS&DB and from the University of Moratuwa. The analysis of phase out options of the transmission system of TNC project was carried out by formulating 2 options based on the designs carried out by MIS Nihon Suido consultants. As per the designs carried out by the consultants, the nodal point demands and the bulk demands could be identified separately and the 10 th & 20 th year demand were rearranged to identify the nodal point demands of each options proposed. Then the "Water CAD" software was used to identify the diameters of transmission lines for the proposed phase out options. The supply and laying costs of DI pipes and specials were calculated and forecasted the future cost figures through reasonable justifications due to abnormal price variations appeared. Then the costs of each transmission line for the proposed options at their implementation stages and the cost of full transmission system were calculated.
