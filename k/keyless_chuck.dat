5000|$|... #Caption: Top: an {{assembled}} <b>keyless</b> <b>chuck.</b> This type of chuck is tightened by {{twisting the}} body using firm hand pressure only. While convenient, this feature {{can cause the}} chuck to loosen if too much torque is applied. Bottom: the widely used keyed type of drill chuck with its key. The arbor is shown separately to the right. These chucks require a toothed key to provide the necessary torque to tighten and loosen the jaws. When the key is turned its teeth mate with teeth on the chuck, turning an internal screw which in turn moves the threaded jaws in or out along a tapered surface. The taper allows the jaws to clamp drill shanks {{of a range of}} diameters. The end view shows the three small jaws that slide within the body.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of power {{screwdrivers}} range from a simple 'stick'-type with batteries, a motor, and a tip holder all inline, to powerful [...] "pistol" [...] type VSR (variable-speed reversible) Cordless drills that also function as screwdrivers. This is particularly useful as drilling a pilot hole before driving a screw is a common operation. Special combination drill-driver bits and adapters let an operator rapidly alternate between the two. Variations include impact drivers, which provide two types of 'hammering' force for improved performance in certain situations, and [...] "right-angle" [...] drivers for use in tight spaces. Many options and enhancements, such as built-in bubble levels, high/low gear selection, magnetic screw holders, adjustable-torque clutches, <b>keyless</b> <b>chucks,</b> 'gyroscopic' control, etc., are available.|$|R
