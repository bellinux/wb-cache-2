5|$|Beginning {{with the}} pilot, Miller {{structured}} each episode by telling two {{stories in the}} episode. The first was a traditional procedural plotline. The second story was a <b>flashback</b> from Henry's past. The <b>flashback</b> either related to the episode's main present-day storyline, such as Henry's involvement in investigating the Jack the Ripper case, or was a scene from Henry's backstory, such as {{his life in the}} Lower East Side's tenements in the 1890s.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the phenomenon <b>flashbacks,</b> often named the Proust phenomenon, {{through the lens}} of experience design. The research question is Can <b>flashbacks</b> be triggered through experience design? It would then be possible to call <b>flashbacks</b> memories recycled memories. To answer the question former studies were researched, mainly from the standpoint of cognitive psychology. The thesis discusses how different senses produce <b>flashbacks</b> and how they can be used as triggers. The difference between the connection of sight, sound, touch, taste and smell to experiences and <b>flashbacks</b> are examined, especially the extraordinary connection between <b>flashbacks</b> and the olfactory sense. This topic can not be completed without looking into Marcel Proust‘s texts in À la recherche du temps perdu and his poetic description on how <b>flashbacks</b> work. Through the lens of Proust, <b>flashbacks</b> are discussed as narratives and the thesis looks into the significance of the memories as a building block for our sense of ourselves. Several Icelandic storytellers are interviewed about their memories. Through their interviews the storytelling aspect of sharing memories becomes prominent, leading to a discussion on the social aspect of memory sharing. The thesis ends with a study in triggering <b>flashbacks</b> through an experience. An exhibition presenting memories of others through sensory stimuli is used to see the effects of memory sharing through appealing to our senses. ...|$|R

5000|$|Isabelle Khoo of The Huffington Post said {{regarding}} the <b>flashbacks</b> [...] "While I was intrigued {{to find out}} more about this strong character, I felt a little disappointed by the <b>flashbacks</b> sprinkled throughout the episode.

Nonetheless, the <b>flashbacks</b> gave us a tease of Abraham’s past." ...|$|R
40|$|Posttraumatic <b>flashbacks,</b> {{consisting}} of the intrusive re-experiencing of traumatic experiences in the present, have been more clearly defined {{for the first time}} in DSM- 5 and have been identified as a unique symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder in the proposed ICD- 11 diagnostic criteria. Relatively little research into <b>flashbacks</b> has been conducted, however, and new research efforts are required to understand the cognitive and biological basis of this important symptom. In addition, there is considerable scope for research into how <b>flashbacks</b> should be assessed and into <b>flashbacks</b> occurring in different contexts, such as psychosis or intensive care...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Flashbacks</b> — always {{introduced}} {{from the}} Neutral Space — were frequently used for character development and background. <b>Flashbacks</b> generally {{went back to}} one of three time periods: when Titus was five, ten, or seventeen. Three different child actors played the five- and ten-year-old versions of Titus, the latter sometimes joined by five-year-old and ten-year-old versions of Dave and Tommy. <b>Flashbacks</b> to high school with the seventeen year old Titus had all of the current actors playing the younger versions of themselves. To compensate for being too old to believably play the roles, the actors have humorously exaggerated costumes and mannerisms. Except for a few <b>flashbacks</b> in [...] "Grandma Titus" [...] that featured Ken as a child, Stacy Keach is the only one to appear in all of his character's flashbacks; only his hair and clothes change with the times. The <b>flashbacks</b> themselves had no specific format other than being quick, one laugh gags. They frequently showcased Ken Titus's unique approach to parenting, relationships, and drinking. The women that Ken is shown dating (or even married to) in these <b>flashbacks</b> are frequently not given a name, and their faces are rarely shown. Episodes with guest characters who had any connection with the main characters, like Tommy or Erin's families, frequently appeared in <b>flashbacks</b> as well.|$|R
