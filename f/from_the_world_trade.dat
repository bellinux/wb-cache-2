25|$|Bush's {{imposition}} of a tariff on imported steel and on Canadian softwood lumber was controversial {{in light of his}} advocacy of free market policies in other areas; this attracted criticism both from his fellow conservatives and from nations affected. The steel tariff was later rescinded under pressure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Organization. A negotiated settlement to the softwood lumber dispute was reached in April 2006, and the historic seven-year deal was finalized on July 1, 2006.|$|E

Medications such as NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, L-tryptophan, daptomycin and ampicillin and drugs of abuse such as inhaled heroin and cocaine may trigger an allergic response {{which results in}} EP.

25|$|In August 2001, landowners {{that were}} {{shareholders}} {{of the route}} filed a lawsuit, claiming that profits and traffic usage were less than expected. The failure of the route was attributed to the price for truck traffic ($16), the continuation of U.S. government policies banning Mexican trucks from {{the interior of the}} United States (which had been expected to be abolished under the North American Free Trade Agreement), and the approval of a new freeway connecting route <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> International Bridge crossing along Loop 20 to Interstate 35.|$|E

5000|$|Aru Kingdom {{steadily}} grew weaker in the 16th century, {{caught in}} a regional rivalry between the more powerful neighbours — Portuguese Malacca and the Sultanate of Aceh. Because of <b>the</b> incessant pressure <b>from</b> Aceh, circa early 16th century, the capital of Aru moved inland, from coastal Kota Rentang shifted southward to Benteng Putri Hijau. The fall of coastal Kota Rentang port city to Aceh probably took place in 1539, some historian suggested that this event {{marked the end of}} Aru kingdom as a maritime power. Aru's influence fell and reduced to become a regional small polity, and ceased to exist around early 17th century due to various factors. Among others are the rivalry with Aceh and other neighboring polities in Sumatra and Malay peninsula, coupled with the loss of its coastal port that rendered <b>the</b> kingdom isolated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> network.|$|R
50|$|While {{the other}} major powers were {{primarily}} motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and the House of Hohenzollern), Britain had {{a different set of}} primary interests. Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting <b>the</b> homeland <b>from</b> invasion) was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers. This required a hegemonic Royal Navy so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> <b>trading</b> routes, or invade the British Isles. The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the Muscovy Company set up in 1555 to trade with Russia. Other prominent enterprises included the East India Company, and the Hudson's Bay Company in Canada.|$|R

25|$|When {{they were}} finally {{allowed to return}} to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted. Upon {{residents}}' return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center fires that persisted until December, 2001. More than half of the area's residents moved away permanently from the community after the adjacent World Trade Center towers collapsed and spread toxic dust, debris, and smoke. Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. Temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.|$|E
500|$|Building the World Trade Center {{involved}} excavating [...] of material. [...] Rather than transporting {{this material}} at great costs {{out to sea}} or to landfills in New Jersey, the fill material was used to expand the Manhattan shoreline across West Street. [...] Work to demolish the piers began on January 5, 1967, including Pier 7 to Pier 11 which were all constructed around 1910. [...] The demolition work moved forward, despite conflicts between David Rockefeller, Governor Nelson Rockefeller, and Mayor John Lindsay regarding plans for Battery Park City. [...] Landfill material <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center was used to add land, and a cellular cofferdam was constructed to retain the material.

500|$|The new {{building}} is [...] {{from the site}} of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed on September 11, 2001. The school was evacuated during the attack. Although the smoke cloud coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center engulfed the building at one point, there was no structural damage to the building, and there were no reports of physical injuries. Less than an hour {{after the collapse of the}} second WTC tower, concern over a bomb threat at the school prompted an evacuation of the surrounding area, as reported live by NBC news reporter Pat Dawson on the Today show. When classes resumed on September 21, 2001, students were moved to Brooklyn Technical High School while the Stuyvesant building served as a base of operations for rescue and recovery workers. This caused serious congestion at Brooklyn Tech, and required the students to attend in two shifts, with the Stuyvesant students attending the evening shift. Normal classes resumed three weeks later on October 9.|$|E
