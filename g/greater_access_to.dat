5|$|The feminist {{movement}} has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> education; more nearly equitable pay with men; {{the right to}} initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); {{and the right to}} own property.|$|E
5|$|In {{a country}} in which few women may take out loans from large {{commercial}} banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; 97% of its members are women. While a World Bank study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> resources and increase their reproductive success.|$|E

5|$|The {{initiative}} {{to construct a}} citywide wireless internet network, initiated in 2003 by city councilmember Gary Schiff, aimed to both offer city residents with wireless access for around $20 per month, and also to improve city services such as fire and police by giving them <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> information while en route or on-site anywhere in the city. Bridging the digital divide in the city was also a stated goal for the network.|$|E

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|Amanita rubrovoltata {{mushrooms}} grow {{in groups}} on the ground. Amanita species form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> soil nutrients. The original Japanese collections were made in forests dominated by Japanese beech (Fagus crenata), {{but it has also}} been found growing near Quercus luecotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum, and Myrica esculenta in India, in Castanopsis-Schima forest in Nepal, and in Castanopsis indica plantations in the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E
5|$|As {{construction}} {{of schools and}} hiring of teachers continued in Ravalomanana's second term, additional measures were adopted to improve education quality, including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades one to five, expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> lower secondary schooling and {{an overhaul of the}} national curriculum, which had been modified piecemeal since independence from France in 1960. In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.|$|E

5|$|By the 1820s, an {{extensive}} canal system had been constructed, giving <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> {{natural resources and}} fuel for industries. During the Victorian era, the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England. Birmingham was granted city status in 1889 by Queen Victoria. Joseph Chamberlain, mayor of Birmingham and later an MP, and his son Neville Chamberlain, who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham and later the British Prime Minister, {{are two of the}} most well-known political figures who have lived in Birmingham. The city established its own university in 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the {{government}} adopted a National Export Strategy to diversify the country’s exports. Production facilities {{are to be}} established {{for a wide range}} of products within the three selected clusters: oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi’s exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country’s Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.|$|E

5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E
5|$|At {{least as}} far back as the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka were {{established}} as a technologically sophisticated and prosperous people who provided slaves to slave traders supplying the plantations of the Mascarene Islands. To protect themselves and their wealth, Sihanaka villages were often fortified by earthen walls (tamboho) of the type also prevalent in the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina. Around 1700, the Sihanaka were a major trading partner of the Betsimisaraka, to whom they traded rice and zebu. The Betsimisaraka, desirous of <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Sihanaka wealth, successfully negotiated for French assistance to bring the Sihanaka under their control. French militiamen launched several attacks against Sihanaka communities. This incursion was foiled through a combination of firepower - the Sihanaka having obtained numerous firearms through trade with the Sakalava to the west - and the prevalence of malaria and other tropical diseases that decimated the French soldiers.|$|E

5|$|IMF members {{signed the}} Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which {{ratified}} {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Amanita species, A.bisporigera {{is thought to}} form {{mycorrhizal}} relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and giving the tree <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> soil nutrients. Fruit bodies of Amanita bisporigera are found on the ground growing either solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests; they tend to appear during summer and early fall. The fruit bodies are commonly found near oak, but {{have been reported in}} birch-aspen areas in the west. It is most commonly found in eastern North America, and rare in western North America. It is widely distributed in Canada, and its range extends south to Mexico. The species has also been found in Colombia, where it may have been introduced from trees exported for use in pine plantations.|$|E
5|$|Like other Lactarius species, L.repraesentaneus {{is thought}} to form {{mycorrhizal}} relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, forming a sheath of tissue. This enables the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affords the tree <b>greater</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> soil nutrients. The fruit bodies of L.repraesentaneus are found scattered or in groups on the ground under spruce from August to September. The fungus is distributed in higher elevations in the northern USA and southern Canada where spruce is present. It has also been reported from Alaska, California, and the Rocky Mountains. The frequency of its appearance is described as occasional to fairly common. In Europe, where it is fairly rare, it is found mainly underneath sallows (Salix capraea) in forests {{at the foot of}} mountains on non-calcareous soil. It has been collected in Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, the French Alps and England; overall, it is widely distributed throughout the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. The fungus has also been collected under birch (B.pubescens, B.nana, and B.glandulosa) in Greenland.|$|E
