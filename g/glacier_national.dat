5|$|In 1974, a {{wilderness}} study was submitted to Congress which identified 95% {{of the area}} of the park as qualifying for wilderness designation. Unlike a few other parks, <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park has yet to be protected as wilderness, but National Park Service policy requires that identified areas listed in the report be managed as wilderness until Congress renders a full decision. Ninety-three percent of <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park is managed as wilderness, even though it has not been officially designated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park has a fire {{management}} plan which ensures that human-caused fires are generally suppressed. In {{the case of}} natural fires, the fire is monitored and suppression {{is dependent on the}} size and threat the fire may pose to human safety and structures.|$|E

5|$|<b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park is one {{of seven}} {{national}} parks in British Columbia, and {{is part of a}} system of 43 parks and park reserves across Canada. Established in 1886, the park encompasses , and includes a portion of the Columbia Mountains. It also contains the Rogers Pass National Historic Site.|$|E
5|$|Historic wooden tour boats, some {{dating back}} to the 1920s, operate on some of the larger lakes. Several of these boats have been in {{continuous}} seasonal operation at <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park since 1927 and carry up to 80 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is popular}} in the park. Some of the finest fly fishing in North America {{can be found in}} the streams that flow through <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park. Though the park {{requires}} that those fishing understand the regulations, no permit is required to fish the waters within the park boundary. The threatened bull trout must be released immediately back to the water if caught; otherwise, the regulations on limits of catch per day are liberal.|$|E

5|$|<b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park {{has almost}} all its {{original}} native {{plant and animal}} species. Large mammals such as Grizzly bears, moose, and mountain goats, as well as rare or endangered species like wolverines and Canadian lynxes, inhabit the park. Hundreds of species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species, and a few reptile and amphibian species have been documented. The park has numerous ecosystems ranging from prairie to tundra. Notably, the easternmost forests of western redcedar and hemlock grow in the southwest portion of the park. Large forest fires are uncommon in the park. However, in 2003 over 13% of the park burned.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin (which, at , {{is about the}} size of France) lies roughly between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Cascade Mountains on the west. In the United States and Canada the term watershed is often used to mean {{drainage basin}}. The term Columbia Basin is used to refer not only to the entire drainage basin but also to subsets of the river's full watershed, such as the relatively flat and unforested area in eastern Washington bounded by the Cascades, the Rocky Mountains, and the Blue Mountains. Within the watershed are diverse landforms including mountains, arid plateaus, river valleys, rolling uplands, and deep gorges. Grand Teton National Park lies in the watershed, as well as parts of Yellowstone National Park, <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and North Cascades National Park. Canadian National Parks in the watershed include Kootenay National Park, Yoho National Park, <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park, and Mount Revelstoke National Park. Hells Canyon, the deepest gorge in North America, and the Columbia Gorge are in the watershed. Vegetation varies widely, ranging from western hemlock and western redcedar in the moist regions to sagebrush in the arid regions. The watershed provides habitat for 609known fish and wildlife species, including the bull trout, bald eagle, gray wolf, grizzly bear, and Canada lynx.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition {{to the study of}} the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E

50|$|Ethnically, the {{residents}} of Norway are predominantly ethnic Norwegians who are of North Germanic / Nordic descent, although there are communities of the Scandinavian native people Sami who settled the area around 8,000 years ago, probably from continental Europe through the Norwegian coast and through Finland along the inland <b>glaciers.</b> The <b>national</b> minorities of Norway include Scandinavian Romani, Roma, Jews, and Kvener, {{as well as a}} small Finnish community.|$|R
5|$|<b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last ice age. These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} U-shaped valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers {{from the base of the}} highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various warming and cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the Little Ice Age, which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the Little Ice Age, the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to nowhere near as great an extent as they had during the Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|In late Precambrian time, {{extension}} {{from a large}} {{tectonic plate}} or smaller plates moving away from Laurentia thinned its continental crust, forming large rift basins that would ultimately fail to split the continent. Eventually, this sunken region of Laurentia was flooded with a shallow seaway that extended from at least present-day Lake Superior to <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park in Montana to the Grand Canyon and the Uinta Mountains. The resulting Grand Canyon Supergroup of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied geologic formations that were laid down from 1.2billion and 740million years ago in this sea. Good exposures of the supergroup {{can be seen in}} eastern Grand Canyon in the Inner Gorge and from Desert View, Lipan Point and Moran point.|$|E
5|$|The {{region that}} became <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park was first {{inhabited}} by Native Americans. Upon {{the arrival of}} European explorers, it was dominated by the Blackfeet {{in the east and}} the Flathead in the western regions. Under pressure, the Blackfeet ceded the mountainous parts of their treaty lands in 1895 to the federal government; it later became part of the park. Soon after the establishment of the park on May 11, 1910, a number of hotels and chalets were constructed by the Great Northern Railway. These historic hotels and chalets are listed as National Historic Landmarks and a total of 350 locations are on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1932 work was completed on the Going-to-the-Sun Road, later designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, which provided greater accessibility for automobiles {{into the heart of the}} park.|$|E
50|$|Lyell Glacier {{is in the}} Sierra Nevada of California. The glacier was {{discovered}} by John Muir in 1871, and was the largest <b>glacier</b> in Yosemite <b>National</b> Park. It lies on the northern slopes of Mount Lyell.|$|R
50|$|Surprise Glacier is a <b>glacier</b> in Denali <b>National</b> Park and Preserve in the U.S. {{state of}} Alaska. The glacier {{begins in the}} Alaska Range near Mount Dall, moving west. Its {{terminus}} {{is the source of}} the Tonzona River.|$|R
50|$|Buckskin Glacier is a <b>glacier</b> in Denali <b>National</b> Park and Preserve in the U.S. {{state of}} Alaska. The glacier {{originates}} {{on the east}} side of The Moose's Tooth, flowing east, then southeast, for 14 mi beforegiving rise to the Hidden River.|$|R
5|$|The {{rocks in}} <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The species' modern {{range in}} North America is mostly {{confined}} to Alaska and Canada, with populations also occurring in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and small portions of Washington, Idaho, northern Oregon, and Montana. A functional wolf population should exist in California by 2024 {{according to estimates}} by state wildlife officials. Canadian wolves began to naturally re-colonize northern Montana around <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park in 1979, and the first wolf den in the western U.S. in over half a century was documented there in 1986. The wolf population in northwest Montana initially grew {{as a result of}} natural reproduction and dispersal to about 48 wolves by the end of 1994. From 1995–1996, wolves from Alberta and British Columbia were relocated to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho. In addition, the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) was reintroduced to Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. The gray wolf is found in approximately 80% of its historical range in Canada, thus making it an important stronghold for the species.|$|E
5|$|When US-89 {{was created}} in 1926, it only went {{as far north as}} Spanish Fork, where {{travelers}} could continue to Salt Lake City via US-91. The highway was extended north to the Canada–US border near <b>Glacier</b> <b>National</b> Park in the mid-1930s, though a dispute between Utah and Idaho on the one side and Wyoming on the other was not settled until 1938. The American Association of State Highway Officials decided in favor of Utah and Idaho, placing US-89 on or near US-91 between Spanish Fork and Logan, where it split northeasterly to Yellowstone National Park. (US-89 only left US-91 twice: between Farmington and Ogden, where it still travels today, and via an all-weather route from Brigham City into the Cache Valley, now SR-38 and SR-30.) Wyoming's preferred routing, which left US-91 at Provo, instead became US-189. Beginning in the 1950s, Interstate 15 was constructed, replacing US-91 for through traffic south of Brigham City, and leading to that route's truncation there in 1974. On the other hand, US-89 follows independent corridors south of Spanish Fork and north of Logan. It has not been truncated, and mostly follows US-91's final alignment, except between Farmington and Ogden (where old US-91 is now I-15, SR-126, and SR-26).|$|E
