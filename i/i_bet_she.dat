In supposing that only she was observant Carol was ignorant, misled by the {{indifference}} of cities. She fancied that she was slipping through the streets invisible; but when she had passed, Mr. Ludelmeyer puffed into the store and coughed at his clerk, [...] "I seen a young woman, she come along the side street. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>she</b> iss Doc Kennicott's new bride, good-looker, nice legs, but she wore a hell of a plain suit, no style, I wonder will she pay cash, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>she</b> goes to Howland & Gould's more as she does here, what you done with the poster for Fluffed Oats?") ...|$|E

6000|$|Kurt had a {{detailed}} {{knowledge of the}} Miles Standish. [...] "She {{used to be a}} crack ship for gunnery--held the record. I wonder if we beat her shooting, or how? I wish I was in it. I wonder which of our ships beat her. Maybe she got a shell in her engines. It's a running fight! I wonder what the Barbarossa is doing," [...] he went on, [...] "She's my old ship. Not a first-rater, but good stuff. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>she's</b> got a shot or two home by now if old Schneider's up to form. Just think of it! There they are whacking away at each other, great guns going, shells exploding, magazines bursting, ironwork flying about like straw in a gale, all we've been dreaming of for years! I suppose we shall fly right away to New York--just as though it wasn't anything at all. I suppose we shall reckon we aren't wanted down there. It's no more than a covering fight on our side. All those tenders and store-ships of ours are going on southwest by west to New York to make a floating depot for us. See?" [...] He dabbed his forefinger on the map. [...] "Here we are. Our train of stores goes there, our battleships elbow the Americans out of our way there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mebbe she didn't want {{to speak}} to him ag'in," [...] said Olly, fiercely, with a toss of her curls. [...] "I'd like to know what he'd bin' sayin' to her--like his impudence. Enny how he ought to hev found her out, and she his sweetheart! Why didn't he go right off to the Presidio? What did he come back for? Not find her, indeed! Why, Gabe, do you suppose as July won't find you out soon--why, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> anythin' <b>she</b> knows jest whar you are" [...] (Gabriel trembled and felt an inward sinking), [...] "and is on'y waitin' to come forward to the trial. And yer you are taken in ag'in and fooled by these yer lawyers!--you old Gabe, you. Let me git at thet Philip--Ashley Poinsett--thet's all!" ...|$|R

The Rheinholdt woman has got her jewels back, or will have at noon to-day. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>she</b> won't worry about the thief. Then the Professor's mouldy old {{skeleton}} was returned to him, even if it was burnt up afterwards. I should take on something fresh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I could see," [...] said Mela, {{as she and}} Christine {{drove home}} together, [...] "that she was as jealous as she could be, {{all the time you}} was talkun' to Mr. Beaton. She pretended to be talkun' to Conrad, but she kep' her eye on you pretty close, I can tell you. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>she</b> just got us there to see how him and you would act together. And I reckon she was satisfied. He's dead gone on you, Chris." ...|$|E
60|$|Pray for me! I {{reckoned}} if she knowed me she'd take a {{job that}} was more nearer her size. But <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>she</b> done it, just the same--she was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there warn't no back-down to her, I judge. You may {{say what you want}} to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it ain't no flattery. And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she lays over them all. I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon I've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for HER, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.|$|E
60|$|DOOLITTLE. It ain't the lecturing I mind. I'll lecture them {{blue in the}} face, I will, and {{not turn}} a hair. It's making a gentleman of me that I object to. Who asked {{him to make a}} gentleman of me? I was happy. I was free. I touched pretty nigh {{everybody}} for money when I wanted it, same as I touched you, Henry Higgins. Now I am worrited; tied neck and heels; and everybody touches me for money. It's a fine thing for you, says my solicitor. Is it? says I. You mean it's a good thing for you, I says. When I was a poor man and had a solicitor once when they found a pram in the dust cart, he got me off, and got shut of me and got me shut of him as quick as he could. Same with the doctors: used to shove me out of the hospital before I could hardly stand on my legs, and nothing to pay. Now they finds out that I'm not a healthy man and can't live unless they looks after me twice a day. In the house I'm not let do a hand's turn for myself: somebody else must do it and touch me for it. A year ago I hadn't a relative in the world except two or three that wouldn't speak to me. Now I've fifty, and not a decent week's wages among the lot of them. I have to live for others and not for myself: that's middle class morality. You talk of losing Eliza. Don't you be anxious: <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>she's</b> on my doorstep by this: she that could support herself easy by selling flowers if I wasn't respectable. And the next one to touch me will be you, Henry Higgins. I'll have to learn to speak middle class language from you, instead of speaking proper English. That's where you'll come in; and I daresay that's what you done it for.|$|R
40|$|Achievements are not {{accomplished}} alone, and {{completion of}} this study is no exception. There are many who helped prepare me, directly and indirectly, to do this work. I can only mention a few in these pages. First, I want to acknowledge Dr. Gail Furman who most closely mentored me through this study. Dr. Furman has been an encourager, mentor, and extraordinary teacher. I recall some years ago when I bumped into Dr. Furman at a coffee shop in Pullman Washington. She pulled me aside and told me to give her a call. She encouraged me to plan a course toward this study and earning a doctoral degree. Ultimately, Dr. Furman graciously agreed to chair my dissertation committee. <b>I</b> would <b>bet</b> <b>she</b> had no idea how much work I would be for her. However, Dr. Furman stuck with me and repeatedly told me “this will work. ” Thanks to the confidence she helped me find, her persistence to keep me moving forward, and her ability to get me back on track when I would derail, we prevailed. Next, I am grateful for the kind and generous encouragement and guidance given by my other committee members, Drs. Lenore Foster, Joan Kingrey, and Forrest Parkay. They each in their own way and time provided the support and encouragement, and yes, prodding that...|$|R
5000|$|Greenwald is a vegan and has {{appeared}} {{in at least two}} ads for PETA. He told PETA his reasons for going vegan: [...] "In college I stopped eating red meat on a bet with my girlfriend at the time. <b>She</b> <b>bet</b> <b>she</b> could stop smoking, and <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> that <b>I</b> could stop eating red meat. She started smoking again, so I won, which I'm always proud of.…I had been a vegetarian as a child for whatever reason. I guess kids sometimes follow their instincts…My friend dared me to go vegan as I was reading this book Fast Food Nation, which opened my eyes to a lot of cruelties.…Ever since then, I've been vegan and enjoyed it daily." ...|$|R
5000|$|Maggie and Wade {{never got}} along. When they first met, Wade said, [...] "There's {{something}} about that woman I don't like. Make that everything about that woman I don't like." [...] Maggie was critical of the way Wade was handling the death of Maximillian Arturo and used it as evidence that she was weak. However she started to understand as she also broke down due to her husband's death and reevaluated her opinion of Wade somewhat when Wade saved her life from a zombie commenting that Wade [...] "showed her something" [...] by doing that and seemed somewhat humbled by the experience. In the episode [...] "Dinoslide", the conflict between Wade and Maggie was further examined. At {{the beginning of the}} episode, Wade was upset about Maggie's desire to kill Rickman out of revenge. Later, when the sliders encountered dinosaurs, Maggie wanted to kill the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Wade remarked, [...] "Isn't there anything she doesn't think about killing?" [...] By the end of the episode, there were indicators that the two were starting to get along; Wade and Maggie said, [...] "Nice shooting!" [...] to each other as they were shooting a gun at an oxygen tank in the dinosaur's mouth in an attempt to kill the dinosaur. The last time they saw each other was in the episode [...] "This Slide of Paradise". At the end of the episode, Maggie said, [...] "I'm going to miss you getting on my nerves Wade!" [...] and then Wade responded by saying, [...] "Same here." [...] When Maggie met Marda in the episode [...] "Genesis", Marda said, [...] "Wade said you were a tough bitch," [...] and Maggie responded, [...] "Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>she</b> did!" [...] After the Sliders lost Wade (and apparently Rembrandt for good), Maggie broke down and said she couldn't take the loss anymore until as part of Wade's last act, she returned Rembrandt to the Sliders.|$|E
