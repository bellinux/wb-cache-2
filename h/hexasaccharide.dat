5000|$|The Phillips Mechanism {{proposed}} that the enzyme's catalytic power came from both steric strain on the bound substrate and electrostatic stabilization of an oxo-carbenium intermediate. From X-ray crystallographic data, Phillips proposed the active site of the enzyme, where a <b>hexasaccharide</b> binds. The lysozyme distorts the fourth sugar (in the D or -1 subsite) in the <b>hexasaccharide</b> into a half-chair conformation. In this stressed state, the glycosidic bond is more easily broken. [...] An ionic intermediate containing an oxo-carbenium is created {{as a result of}} the glycosidic bond breaking. Thus distortion causing the substrate molecule to adopt a strained conformation similar to that of the transition state will lower the energy barrier of the reaction.|$|E

Assembly within the pericellular matrix compartment requires specific cell-matrix interactions to occur, that are mediated via membrane receptors. The focus {{of this study is}} to elucidate the mechanisms of assembly and retention of the cartilage pericellular matrix proteoglycan aggregates important for matrix organization. Assembly of newly synthesized chondrocyte pericellular matrices was inhibited by the addition to hyaluronan <b>hexasaccharides,</b> competitive inhibitors of the binding of hyaluronan to its cell surface receptor. Fully assembled chondrocyte pericellular matrices were displaced using hyaluronan <b>hexasaccharides</b> as well. When exogenous hyaluronan was added to matrix-free chondrocytes in combination with aggrecan, a pericellular matrix equivalent in size to an endogenous matrix formed within 30 min of incubation. Addition of hyaluronan and aggrecan to glutaraldehyde-fixed chondrocytes resulted in matrix assembly comparable to live chondrocytes. These matrices could be inhibited from assembling by the addition of excess hyaluronan <b>hexasaccharides</b> or displaced once assembled by subsequent incubation with hyaluronan <b>hexasaccharides.</b> The results indicate that the aggrecanrich chondrocyte pericellular matrix is not only on a scaffolding of hyaluronan, but actually anchored to the cell surface via the interaction between hyaluronan and hyaluronan receptors...|$|R

Two methods were used to release the carbohydrate receptor from the gram-positive streptococcus, autoclaving and mutanolysin treatment. The polysaccharide released from the streptococcal cell wall by either treatment was purified by ion-exchange chromatography; this polysaccharide inhibited coaggregation when preincubated with the gram-negative capnocytophaga partner. After hydrolysis of the polysaccharide by hydrofluoric acid (HF), the major oligosaccharide of the polysaccharide was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. By analysis of the HF hydrolysis of the polysaccharide and the purified oligosaccharide, this major oligosaccharide {{appeared to be the}} repeating unit of the polysaccharide, with minor components resulting from internal hydrolysis of the major oligosaccharide. Gas chromatography results showed that the oligomer was a <b>hexasaccharide,</b> consisting of rhamnose, galactose, and glucose, in the ratio of 2 : 3 : 1, respectively. By weight, the purified <b>hexasaccharide</b> was a fourfold-more-potent inhibitor of coaggregation than the native polysaccharide. Resistance to hydrolysis by sulfuric acid alone and susceptibility to hydrolysis by HF suggested that oligosaccharide chains of the polysaccharide are linked by phosphodiester bonds.

The purification of both a polysaccharide and its constituent <b>hexasaccharide</b> repeating unit, which both inhibited coaggregation, and the absence of this polysaccharide or <b>hexasaccharide</b> on a coaggregation-defective mutant strongly suggest that the <b>hexasaccharide</b> derived from the polysaccharide functions as the receptor for the adhesin from C. ochracea ATCC 33596...|$|E

40|$|Heparan sulfate (HS) {{catabolism}} {{begins with}} endo-degradation of the polysaccharide to smaller HS oligosaccharides, {{followed by the}} sequential action of exo-enzymes to reduce these oligosaccharides to monosaccharides and inorganic sulfate. In mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA) the exo-enzyme, N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, is deficient resulting in an inability to hydrolyze non-reducing end glucosamine N-sulfate esters. Consequently, partially degraded HS oligosaccharides with non-reducing end glucosamine sulfate esters accumulate. We investigated the distribution of these HS oligosaccharides in tissues of a mouse model of MPS IIIA using high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Oligosaccharide levels were compared to total uronic acid (UA), which {{was used as a}} measure of total glycosaminoglycan.

Direct measurements of the kinetic behavior of the <b>hexasaccharides,</b> octasaccharides, and decasaccharides showed that these fractions greatly enhanced the rate of Factor Xa inactivation by antithrombin. Indeed, these species exhibited specific molar activities that ranged from 6. 9 % (hexaccharide) to 60. 9 % (decasaccharide) of that of the heparin fragment of approximately 16 residues. However, these oligosaccharides exhibited essentially no ability to accelerate thrombin-antithrombin interactions.

Bovine articular cartilage aggrecan was isolated in a composite agarose PAGE gel or diluted in ammonium acetate buffer and was digested overnight with chondroitinase ABC. Including a chemical release/reduction protocol after digestion, we could separate and detect three differentially sulfated chondroitin sulfate disaccharides of the repeat region (ΔUA 1 - 3 GalNAc 0 / 4 / 6 S-ol) from the three differentially sulfated linkage region <b>hexasaccharides</b> (ΔUA 1 - 3 GalNAc 0 / 4 / 6 Sβ 1 - 4 GlcAβ 1 - 3 Galβ 1 - 3 Galβ 1 - 4 Xylitol). Graphitized carbon LC−MS in the negative ion mode was able to resolve isomeric disaccharides and linkage region <b>hexasaccharides.</b> Specific MS² and MS³ enabled us to confirm the sulfate location on all oligosaccharides by comparing their fragmentation with sulfated disaccharide standards. The presence of unsulfated, 6 -sulfated, and 4 -sulfated linkage regions was correlated with positive Western blot staining with the respective CS linkage region neoepitope antibodies (1 B 5, 3 B 3, 2 B 6) on digested aggrecan. Our strategy of examining linkage region and repeat region profiles is applicable to screening GAGs from various biological samples in order to detect differences between normal and disease states. 10 page(s...|$|R

In this study, we report the binding affinities between five synthetic <b>hexasaccharides</b> with human FGF- 1 obtained by surface plasmon resonance experiments, and compare with the induced mitogenic activity previously obtained. These five oligosaccharides differ in the sulfation pattern and in the sequence. We have previously demonstrated that all the five <b>hexasaccharides</b> have similar 3 D structure of the backbone. Consequently, the differences in binding affinity should have their origin in the substitution pattern. Subsequently, the different capacity for induction of mitogenic activity can be, at least partially, explained from these binding affinities. Interestingly, one of the oligosaccharides lacking of axially symmetry (3 :) was biologically inactive, whereas the other (2 :) was the most active. The difference between both compounds is the order of the FGF-binding motifs along the chain relative to the carbohydrate polarity. We can conclude that the directionality of the GAG chain is essential for the binding and subsequent activation. The relative biological activity of the compounds with regular substitution pattern can be inferred from their values of IC 50. Remarkably, the sulfate in position 6 of d-glucosamine was essential for the mitogenic activity but not for the interaction with FGF- 1...|$|R
