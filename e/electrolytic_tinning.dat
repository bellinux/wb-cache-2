50|$|Again, {{demolition}} and clearance {{of these}} plants allowed the start of construction of phase2 of the tinplate works. This included new constructions of: an effluent plant; single stack annealing line; two <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tinning</b> lines (ETL); a cleaning line; and a Hallden Shears plant. Having cost £57 million, the plant was officially opened in June 1978 by Derek Hornby, the President of the Food Manufacturing Federation. It was envisaged in the original plan that phase3 would then be constructed to double production yet again, {{but it was never}} authorised for planning by the government.|$|E

The tandem mill {{is equipped with}} automatic gauge control, x-ray gauge, data logging and thyristorisation.Electrolytic Tinning LineThe continuous <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tinning</b> line produces a shining tin-coated surface {{in a variety of}} coating thicknesses. The tinplate shearing lines are equipped with sensitive pinhole detectors and an automatic sorting system.Galvanising LinesTwo continuous hot-dip galvanising lines are equipped with jet-coating facilities. There are 2 multi-roller-corrugating machines as well which produce corrugated sheets.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTension {{control is}} a crucial measure to ensure stable and {{reliable}} operation of the plate production line. The paper begins with {{the example of the}} tension control of the <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>Tinning</b> Line(ETL), and introduces the method of tension control that realized by the Siemens T 400 technology board and discusses the strategy of 1 # tension roller load-balanced control that carried out by Siemens 6 SE 70 Simovert Masterdrives. The practice shows that these methods have a simple and reliable programming, make debugging convenience, achieve satisfactory control effect and significantly improve product quality...|$|E
40|$|Surface oxides {{formed at}} ferrite grain {{boundaries}} of low carbon steels annealed at 700 °C in 5 % hydrogen 95 % nitrogen atmosphere were characterized using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Two different oxides (Fe,Mn) O and MnCr 2 O 4 are observed at the grain boundaries and the former is five-fold coarser than the latter. It was found at the annealing temperature of 700 °C that the mean particle size of the (Fe,Mn) O depends on the manganese content, and the mean particle size and distribution of the MnCr 2 O 4 dependent on chromium, but independent of manganese. It is unlikely the coarse (Fe,Mn) O precipitates pose any potential risks to the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tin</b> coating quality as they will be removed by the pickling operation prior to tinning. The potential risks posed by the MnCr 2 O 4 {{to the quality of}} the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tin</b> coating of tinplate products can be minimized by restricting the chromium content of the steel...|$|R
5000|$|Yorkville Works at Yorkville, Ohio, which {{consisted}} of the first cold reduced black plate for tinning. The first tandem mill of its kind was installed in 1928. The facility produced electrolytic and hot-dipped tinplate, black plate, and terneplate. It also had a metal decorating plant for coating and lithographing tin, terne, and black plate, and two <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tin</b> plate lines that produced tin plate at up to 1,000 feet per minute.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, the Steel Company of Wales was nationalised {{with others}} to form British Steel Corporation. Choosing to close the {{tinplate}} works at Port Talbot Steelworks, they invested in all three remaining tinplate works within the newly formed South Wales group: Trostre, Felindre and Ebbw Vale. With four <b>electrolytic</b> continuous <b>tinning</b> lines installed at each plant, they were capable of combining to produce 2 million tons of tinplate per annum.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{presentation}} of the application of surveying principles used in a process of building the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tinning</b> line at the U. S. Steel s. r. o. Kosice. The work involved is setting up a new network of measuring points, as well as the effective implementation of suitable methodologies, instruments and measuring tools. All of these were focal points for the survey, required during the installation of machinery units for the new tinning line. The coil producing technology utilised on the line entails a high speed movement. In this context all methods and final measurements were adapted to a very high standard of precision in order to ensure a safe working environment and exclude the risk of malfunctions in the final production stage. The smallest variations in the positioning of machinery units, compared with technical drawings, could rise a danger of coil breakdown, line malfunction or personal injury...|$|E
40|$|Plant trial {{evaluations}} {{have been}} completed for two zirconium-based, non-chromium passivation systems previously identified as possible alternatives to cathodic dichromate (CDC) passivation for electrolytic tinplate (ETP). These trials were done on a commercial <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tin</b> plating line at Weirton Steel and extensive evaluations of the materials resulting from these trials {{have been completed}}. All this was accomplished as a collaborative effort under the AISI Technology Roadmap Program and was executed by seven North American Tin Mill Products producers [Bethlehem Steel (now acquired by International Steel Group (ISG)), Dofasco Inc., National Steel (now acquired by U. S. Steel), U. S. Steel, USS-Posco, Weirton Steel, and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel] with funding partially from the Department of Energy (DOE) and partially on an equal cost sharing basis among project participants. The initial phases of this project involved optimization of application procedures for the non-chromium systems in the laboratories at Bethlehem Steel and Betz Dearborn followed by extensive testing with various lacquer formulations and food simulants in the laboratories at Valspar and PPG. Work was also completed at Dofasco and Weirton Steel to develop methods to prevent precipitation of insoluble solids {{as a function of}} time from the zirconate system. The results of this testing indicated that sulfide staining characteristics for the non-chromium passivation systems could be minimized but not totally eliminated and neither system was found to perform quite as good, in this respect, as the standard CDC system. As for the stability of zirconate treatment, a method was developed to stabilize this system for a sufficient period of time to conduct plant trial evaluations but, working with a major supplier of zirconium orthosulfate, a method for long term stabilization is still under development...|$|R
40|$|Samples of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tin</b> {{and nickel}} {{have been exposed}} for 1 to 12 m in indoor environment, inside a box (rain {{sheltered}} cabinet), placed in tropical humid marine-urban climate, {{as a part of}} Gulf of Mexico. The corrosion aggressiveness of box has been classified as a very high corrosive, based on the monitored chlorides and SO 2 deposition rates, and the Temperature/Relative Humidity air daily complex. The annual mass increasing of nickel is approximately twice higher than its values of mass loss (C). The relation between nickel mass loss or increasing and time of wetness (t) of metal surface is linear and does not obey the power equation C = A tn, which has be found for tin. The SEM images reveal a localized corrosion on nickel and tin surfaces. XRD detects the formation of SnCl 2 . H 2 O as a corrosion product. Within the time on the tin surface appear black spots, considered as organic material.

La agresividad de la caseta ha sido clasificada como muy altamente corrosiva, basada al registro de la velocidad de deposici&oacute;n de cloruros y SO 2 , y en el complejo diario de temperatura/humedad relativa del aire. El incremento de masa anual de n&iacute;quel es, aproximadamente, dos veces mayor que del valor de su p&eacute;rdida de masa (C).

40|$|In {{this highly}} {{competitive}} market where {{the demand for}} the products is increasing gradually, {{it is essential for}} a manufacturing company to reduce the production cycle time and cost accordingly. One of the methods for this is to increase the availability of process. This paper attempts to identify and quantify the causes of machine downtime in a manufacturing company. For this a four-prong approach is taken: Firstly, the major causes for the low availability of process are determined, where bearing failure is found to be the major causes of low availability. Second, combining desirability function approach and data envelopment analysis are performed to identify the sensitive input variables that affect the bearing failure. Thirdly, ordinary linear regression is used to validate the results of DEA. Lastly, some managerial implications to reduce the downtime were suggested. We have considered an electrolytic tinplating line process in a tin sheet manufacturing company as a case study. data envelopment analysis; DEA; linear regression; machine availability; machine downtime; desirability function; bottleneck identification; bottlenecks; manufacturing equipment; bearing failure; <b>electrolytic</b> tinplating; <b>tin</b> sheet manufacturing. ...|$|R
