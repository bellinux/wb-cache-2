5|$|Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the {{description}} of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only wants to talk to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take a look at his brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells out into the hall and the police arrest Martin because they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.|$|E
25|$|Like Owen Roberts in Sorrells, he {{expressed}} concern that a predisposition test would needlessly deter defendants who might otherwise <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> based {{on the behavior of}} the government agents involved from doing so, since it would allow the prosecution to bring up prior bad acts that would be prejudicial to the jury and otherwise inadmissible.|$|E
25|$|Around 95% {{of people}} are better after seven to ten days of treatment. Potential {{complications}} include abscess formation. Cellulitis occurred in about 21.2 million people in 2015. In the United States about two of every 1000 people per year <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> affected the lower leg. Cellulitis in 2015 resulted in about 16,900 deaths worldwide. In the United Kingdom, cellulitis {{was the reason for}} 1.6% of admissions to a hospital.|$|E

50|$|A nominal phrase can be {{regarded}} a single unit. It <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>case,</b> <b>a</b> number, and <b>a</b> gender. <b>Case</b> and number depend on the context, whereas the main noun determines the gender.|$|R

25|$|On January 10, 2006, in an en banc decision, Judge Bybee {{wrote the}} opinion for the {{majority}} in the case of Smith v. Salish Kootenai College. In that case, James Smith sought to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> heard in federal court which he had previously brought in a tribal court. When he disagreed with the tribal court's decision, he claimed that it had had no jurisdiction in the first place. In an 8-3 decision, the Court upheld the tribal court's jurisdiction over the subject matter, thereby strengthening tribal courts' rights to claim jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|At one point, Garrett and his {{followers}} rounded up 30 head of cattle bearing Bogan's brand, stating they were stolen, whereas Bogan claimed they were mavericks. Bogan approached lawyer H. H. Wallace, who demanded that Oldham County, Texas officials pay $25,000 in damages, and fearing Bogan might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case,</b> the county settled for $800. By the fall of that year, indictments had been handed down against 159 cowboys, Bogan being one, and Garrett and his men set out to round them up. Garrett, however, did not disguise his movements, as he did want to avoid trouble if possible and would be satisfied if the cowboys merely left.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, {{the episode}} {{received}} some negative reviews. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt was more negative towards the episode writing that [...] "Here, we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> where an episode could have signaled {{at least some}} sense of what else the show might be interested in other than Andy as the well-meaning but hapless boss and Pam and Angela's dueling pregnancies, and all we got were variations on those storylines with no new angle either narratively". He gave the episode a C. IGN writer Cindy White considered the episode superior to previous [...] "external" [...] episodes [...] "Christening" [...] and [...] "Phyllis' Wedding", but considered it inferior to the [...] "Niagara" [...] and the [...] "classic" [...] "Booze Cruise". She criticized the main plot for rehashing previous plot lines and ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10.|$|E

50|$|This {{hierarchy}} is to {{be interpreted}} as follows: If <b>a</b> language <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> that is listed on the hierarchy, it will usually {{have at least one}} case from each position to the left. So for example, if <b>a</b> language <b>has</b> <b>a</b> dative <b>case,</b> it will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> genitive (position to the left), an accusative or ergative case or both, and a nominative.|$|R
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this means is that public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and it is something that their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might be what the Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to have become so closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however my impression is that the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by lawyers at Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{during a}} debate with his {{opponent}} Mark Begich {{days after his}} conviction, Stevens continued to claim innocence. [...] "I have not been convicted. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> pending against me, and probably the worst case of prosecutorial misconduct by the prosecutors that is known." [...] Stevens also cited plans to appeal. Begich went on to defeat Stevens by 3,724 votes.|$|E

2500|$|In another episode, {{the sons}} of Redhorn decide {{to go on the}} warpath. The older brother asks [...] "Storms as He Walks" [...] for the Thunderbird War bundle. After some effort, it is produced, but the Thunderbirds demand that it <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case.</b> A friend of {{the sons of}} Redhorn offers his own body as its case.

2500|$|Chief {{among them}} has been an iron {{determination}} to keep the world's attention focused on the genocide, {{rather than on the}} role of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), the force that took power in 1994, bringing President Paul Kagame to power. In recent years uncomfortable questions have been raised about the war crimes the RPF are alleged to have committed during and after 1994. While stressing there can be no equation between genocide and war crimes, Alison Des Forges of Human Rights Watch says RPF leaders do <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> to answer. [...] "Their victims also deserve justice," [...] she says.|$|E
2500|$|Former Afghanistan Foreign Minister Dr. Abdullah {{said during}} a press conference with US Under Secretary for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns, [...] "I {{know that it is}} a very {{sensitive}} issue and we know the concerns of the American people. In fact, in our embassy we received hundreds of messages of such kind. As far as I understand the nature of the case has been that the wife of the gentleman has registered a lawsuit against her husband. And then the Government of Afghanistan has nothing to do in it. It's a legal and judicial case. But I hope that through our constitutional process there will be a satisfactory result out of that process." [...] He also stated: [...] "Every time we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> it is like an alarm. These contradictions [...] will not go away with one or two cases." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was early}} {{provided}} that, {{in seeking to}} remove one who wrongfully entered another's land with force and arms, a person could allege disseisin (dispossession) and demand (and pay for) a writ of entry. That writ gave him the written right to re-enter his own land and established this right {{under the protection of}} the Crown if need be, whence its value. In 1253, to prevent judges from inventing new writs, Parliament provided that the power to issue writs would thereafter be transferred to judges only one writ at a time, in a [...] "writ for right" [...] package known as a form of action. However, because it was limited to enumerated writs for enumerated rights and wrongs, the writ system sometimes produced unjust results. Thus, even though the King's Bench might have jurisdiction over a case and might have the power to issue the perfect writ, the plaintiff might still not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> if {{there was not a single}} form of action combining them. Therefore, lacking a legal remedy, the plaintiff's only option would be petitioning the King.|$|E
2500|$|A {{motion for}} Mosby to recuse {{herself from the}} case was filed {{on behalf of the}} charged officers, on the alleged basis of {{personal}} gain by Mosby and her husband, personal relationships with potential witnesses, and the financial interest of Gray's attorney, whom the motion claims is a close friend of Mosby. CNN's legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin pointed out that he does not see any serious conflict of interest to disqualify Mosby from the case, and that the officers may not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> with that motion. The lawyers representing the officers filed a motion insisting that the city must pay thousands of dollars in damages for arresting and detaining them—or else they could sue Mosby and the Mayor of Baltimore, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. In a 11-page rebuttal, Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow wrote that Gray was detained [...] "well before the arresting officers knew he possessed a knife" [...] and that the motion was absurdly [...] "bounc from one ridiculous allegation to another, like a pinball on a machine far past 'TILT. Mosby was ordered to respond to the motion filed by the defense attorneys by June 26, 2015.|$|E
