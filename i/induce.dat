5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to <b>induce</b> LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to <b>induce</b> LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E

As a tool, methods of demographic analysis of <b>induced</b> abortion and some statistical methods are applied. <b>Induced</b> abortions from other than health reasons are currently legally permitted in 25 of 28 analysed countries. Significant differences among developed countries not only in quantum of <b>induced</b> abortion but also in the structure of <b>induced</b> abortion by the age of woman were found by the analysis.
