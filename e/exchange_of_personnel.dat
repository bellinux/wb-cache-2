5|$|Following the Polish campaign, Hitler {{approved}} {{the expansion of}} the SS combat troops to three divisions as well as bringing the LSSAH up to the strength of a reinforced motorised regiment. To achieve this goal before the commencement of the planned invasion of France and the Low Countries, Berger needed at least partially-trained personnel. To do this, he circumvented the recruiting primacy of the Wehrmacht by transferring men from forces already under Himmler's control, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV) that ran the concentration camps, and combat-trained police reinforcements of the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police or Orpo). By adding these men to the LSSAH and the existing three regiments of the SS-VT, he expanded the force to the approved ceiling, including 50,000 trained replacements. The three new divisions were: the SS-Verfügungs-Division (later given the name Reich and then Das Reich) commanded by the Inspector of the SS-VT, SS-Gruppenführer Paul Hausser; the SS-Division-Totenkopf commanded by the Inspector of Concentration Camps, SS-Gruppenführer Theodor Eicke; and the Polizei-Division, commanded by SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch.

50|$|From the 6th to the 4th century BC, Boeotia {{produced}} black-figure vases. In {{the early}} 6th century, many Boeotian painters still used the orientalising silhouette technique. Thereafter, the followed Attic production particularly closely. At times, distinction between or ascription {{to the two}} areas is difficult, some material can also be confused with Corinthian vases. Often, Attic vases of low quality are mistaken as Boeotian. There was probably some level of <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> with Attica; {{in at least one}} case, Bird-Horse Painter, an Attic artist emigrated to Boeotia, the same also probably applies to the Tokra Painter and certainly to the potter Teisias the Athenian. Important motifs included animal friezes, symposia and komasts. Mythological imagery is quite rare; when it occurs, it usually shows Herakles or Theseus. In the late 6th and early 5th centuries, a silhouette style prevailed. Painted shapes were predominantly kantharoi, lekanai, kylikes, plates and jugs. Between 420 and 350 BC, the Kabiria Group were the dominant black-figure style in Boeotia. As in Athens, kalos inscriptions occurred. Boeotian potters had a predilection to produce plastic vessels, also kantharoi with plastic applications and tripod-pyxides. Lekanis, kylix and neck amphora were adopted from Athens. The paintings style often appears comical; komasts and satyrs were preferred motifs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of R&D worker {{mobility}} on innovation performance. As one main novelty, we employ churning as a measure for worker mobility. Churning depicts {{the number of workers}} which are replaced by new ones. It is a very informative indicator since a firm may be exposed to simultaneous leave and inflow of R&D workers even if the size of R&D employment remains unchanged. Hence, we can separate the effect of replacement from net change in R&D workforce. Our results from estimating various knowledge production functions suggest an inverse u-shaped relationship. The <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> R&D <b>personnel</b> fosters innovation through inter-firm knowledge spillovers and improved job-match quality up to certain threshold. The point when costs of churning exceed the benefits is reached faster if the R&D knowledge is non-duplicative. [...] innovation,churning,mobility...|$|R
