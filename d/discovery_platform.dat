40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{antimicrobials}} {{are increasingly}} ineffective {{due to the}} emergence of multidrug-resistance among pathogenic microorganisms. The need to overcome these deficiencies has triggered exploration for novel and unconven-tional approaches to controlling microbial infections. Multidrug efflux systems (MES) have been a profound obstacle in the successful deployment of antimicrobials. The discovery of small molecule efflux system blockers has been an active and rapidly expanding research discipline. A major theme in this platform involves efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) from natural sources. The discovery methodologies and the available number of natural EPI-chemotypes are increasing. Ad-vances in our understanding of microbial physiology have shed light on a series of pathways and phenotypes where the role of efflux systems is pivotal. Complementing existing antimicrobial <b>discovery</b> <b>platforms</b> such as photodynamic ther...|$|R
40|$|Service {{discovery}} {{has become}} more complicated than {{it was just a}} few years ago, because lots of service <b>discovery</b> <b>platforms</b> are introduced for their own purpose. As a result, the devices concurrently existed in such platforms must be equipped with corresponding modules which enable the devices to communicate with other devices. A great deal of papers dealing with service discovery has recently been published, and many efficient and fast searching schemes are proposed, they, however, do not consider the problem of interoperability between discovery protocols, and scalability as well as user's accommodation needs. Therefore, we propose a Web-based multi-purpose discovery middleware to support discovering in heterogeneous ubiquitous environments, and show that proposed system outperforms in terms of path length and hitting probability...|$|R
40|$|While {{long-range}} propagating plasmons {{have been}} extensively investigated for implementing on-chip optical sensing platforms, waveguide-excited localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) based sensing systems {{have not yet}} received much attention. Waveguide excitation and readout {{as an alternative to}} free-space light based single-particle spectroscopy are particularly attractive for high-throughput sensing and on-chip drug <b>discovery</b> <b>platforms.</b> Here we present a numerical investigation of the optical response of a waveguide-excited plasmonic dolmen-shaped compound nanoantenna that exhibits a Fano signature in its spectral response. Although only evanescently coupled to the waveguide, the compound nanoantenna is seen to induce a high-contrast extinction in the transmission spectrum of the waveguide. The compound plasmonic nanoantenna configuration presented here is of interest in hybrid photonic-plasmonic sensing approaches with high-throughput capabilities...|$|R
