50|$|In some senses, {{the process}} of {{diagnosis}} is always a matter of assessing {{the likelihood that a}} given condition is present in the patient. In a patient who presents with <b>haemoptysis</b> (coughing up blood), the <b>haemoptysis</b> is very {{much more likely to be}} caused by respiratory disease than by the patient having broken their toe. Each question in the history taking allows the medical practitioner to narrow down their view of the cause of the symptom, testing and building up their hypotheses as they go along.|$|E
50|$|Some {{symptoms}} {{and signs of}} Bagassosis include breathlessness, cough, <b>haemoptysis,</b> slight fever. Acute diffuse bronchiolitis may also occur. An xray may show mottling of lungs or a shadow.|$|E

50|$|He gave no {{evidence}} in support of a plea for mitigation, so a specialist physician was called to testify on his behalf about his health. The physician stated that he had examined Zinn {{for the first time in}} 1966. His past history showed that he had been treated for about six years from 1930 for pulmonary tuberculosis. The 1966 examination showed that he had a condition called bronchiectasis, due to the prior lung disease. His lung tissue was lacking in aeration, while the bronchi had dilated and become pockets of infection, causing him to suffer recurring attacks of <b>haemoptysis.</b> He also suffered pulmonary disability in that he wheezed and became short of breath on the slightest effort. His condition was chronic and would not improve unless surgical treatment was given. In the opinion of the physician, Zinn might stay as he was, suffering small but repeated <b>haemoptysis,</b> and yet live quite a long life; alternatively, the condition might erupt in a severe <b>haemoptysis,</b> which could be fatal. There might also be a deterioration by secondary infection. It would therefore be advisable, the physician suggested, for Zinn to remain under medical attention. The physician conceded that, if freed from business worries, his condition might improve.|$|E
50|$|The {{presenting}} features may be {{a palpable}} testicular mass or asymmetric testicular enlargement in some cases. The tumour may present as signs and symptoms relating {{to the presence of}} widespread metastases, without any palpable lump in the testis. The clinical features associated with metastasising embryonal carcinoma may include low back pain, dyspnoea, cough, <b>haemoptysis,</b> haematemesis and neurologic abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|In 1798, {{he gave in}} {{addition}} a separate course of physiology. A dangerous attack of <b>haemoptysis</b> interrupted his labors for a time; but the danger was no sooner past than he plunged into new engagements with the same ardour as before. He had now scope in his physiological lectures for a fuller exposition of his original views on the animal economy, which excited much attention in the medical schools at Paris.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, Sir William Gull {{suffered}} {{the first of}} several strokes at his Scottish home at Urrard House, Killiecrankie. The attack of hemiplegia and aphasia was caused by a cerebral haemorrhage, of which the only warning had been unexplained <b>haemoptysis</b> a few days earlier. He recovered after a few weeks and returned to London; but was under no illusions about the danger to his health, remarking “One arrow had missed its mark, but there are more in the quiver”.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{with single}} aspergillomas {{generally}} do well with {{surgery to remove}} the aspergilloma, and are best given pre-and post-operative antifungal drugs. Often, no treatment is necessary. However, if a patient coughs up blood (<b>haemoptysis),</b> treatment may be required (usually angiography and embolisation, surgery or taking tranexamic acid). Angiography (injection of dye into the blood vessels) {{may be used to}} find the site of bleeding which may be stopped by shooting tiny pellets into the bleeding vessel.|$|E
50|$|Clinically, IPH manifests as a triad of <b>haemoptysis,</b> diffuse parenchymal infiltrates on chest radiographs, {{and iron}} {{deficiency}} anaemia. It is diagnosed {{at an average}} age of 4.5 plus or minus 3.5 years, and it is twice as common in females. The clinical course of IPH is exceedingly variable, and most of the patients continue to have episodes of pulmonary haemorrhage despite therapy. Death may occur suddenly from acute pulmonary haemorrhage or after progressive pulmonary insufficiency resulting in chronic respiratory failure.|$|E
50|$|Clear {{diagnosis}} {{is useful to}} avoid unnecessary treatment and exclude more sinister diagnoses (for example, <b>haemoptysis</b> or pleural effusion could also indicate cancer). Overall treatment for pulmonary endometriosis is surgical, with subsegmentectomy. It is obviously important to preserve as much lung parenchyma as possible, while removing macroscopic signs of pathological tissue. Medical treatment includes gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, which can cause cessation of menstruation and decreased libido, {{as well as a}} 50% recurrence rate. Even in the asymptomatic, treatment is recommended to prevent possible complications listed above.|$|E
50|$|Gallio's brother Seneca {{reports in}} Moral Epistles 104.1 that Gallio {{began to develop}} a fever in Achaia and took ship at once, insisting that the disease was not of the body but of the place. Furthermore, Pliny the Elder states in his Natural History 31.33 that There are besides many other uses, the chief being a sea voyage for those {{attacked}} by consumption, as I have said, and for <b>haemoptysis,</b> such as quite recently within our memory was taken by Annæus Gallio after his consulship.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{symptoms}} and signs are often non-specific or absent in early CTEPH, with signs of right heart failure only in advanced disease. The main symptom of CTEPH is exertional breathlessness (shortness of breath during exertion such as exercise), which is unspecific and may often {{be attributed to}} other, more common, diseases by physicians. When present, the clinical symptoms of CTEPH may resemble those of acute PE, or of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH). Leg oedema (swelling) and <b>haemoptysis</b> (blood in mucus) occur more often in CTEPH, while syncope (fainting) {{is more common in}} iPAH.|$|E
50|$|An aspergilloma is a fungal mass {{caused by}} a fungal {{infection}} with Aspergillus species that grows in either scarred lungs or in a pre-existing lung cavity, {{which may have been}} {{caused by a}} previous infection. Patients with a previous history of tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis or other lung disease are most susceptible to an aspergilloma. Aspergillomas may have no specific symptoms but in many patients there is some coughing up of blood called <b>haemoptysis</b> - this may be infrequent and in small quantity, but can be severe and then it requires urgent medical help.|$|E
50|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} mainly by {{the content of}} strongly acidic hydrochloric acid, but also due to thermal effects of reaction of zinc chloride with water. These effects cause lesions of the mucous membranes of the upper airways. Damage of the lower airways can manifest itself later as well, due to fine particles of zinc chloride and traces of phosgene. In high concentrations the smoke can be very dangerous when inhaled. Symptoms include dyspnea, retrosternal pain, hoarseness, stridor, lachrymation, cough, expectoration, {{and in some cases}} <b>haemoptysis.</b> Delayed pulmonary edema, cyanosis or bronchopneumonia may develop. The smoke and the spent canisters contain suspected carcinogens.|$|E

In 1914, Girl won a prize at the Eighth Bunten Exhibition. Later that year he visited Izu Ōshima. In 1915 his petition for the hand of Toshiko in marriage was opposed by her parents (she went on to marry Rash Behari Bose). In 1916 he built a studio in Shimo-Ochiai (下落合) in Shinjuku and exhibited Dr. Tanakadate and Nude at the Eleventh Bunten Exhibition. His Portrait of Eroshenko was exhibited at the Second Teiten Exhibition in 1920.|$|E
50|$|Pitcairn had {{frequent}} {{attacks of}} quinsy, and failing health, accompanied by <b>hæmoptysis,</b> in 1798, {{forced him to}} give up work and spend eighteen months in Portugal. He returned to England and continued to practise, but on 13 April 1809 had an attack of sore throat, followed by acute inflammation of the larynx, with consequent œdema of the glottis, of which he died on 17 April 1809, at Craig's Court, Charing Cross. Matthew Baillie, a close friend for 30 years, attended him, and described his case, with the similar one of John Macnamara Hayes, who died of the same disease three months later. Pitcairn's body was examined by Benjamin Collins Brodie the elder, {{in the presence of}} Baillie, Everard Home, and William Charles Wells.|$|E
50|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} lung cancer that is {{identical}} to lung cancer from other causes. Exposure to asbestos is associated with all major histological types of lung carcinoma (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma). The latency period between exposure and development of lung cancer is 20 to 30 years. It is estimated that 3%-8% of all lung cancers are related to asbestos. The risk of developing lung cancer depends on the level, duration, and frequency of asbestos exposure (cumulative exposure). Smoking and individual susceptibility are other contributing factors towards lung cancer. Smokers who {{have been exposed to}} asbestos are at far greater risk of lung cancer. Smoking and asbestos exposure have a multiplicative (synergistic) effect on the risk of lung cancer. Symptoms include chronic cough, chest pain, breathlessness, <b>haemoptysis</b> (coughing up blood), wheezing or hoarseness of the voice, weight loss and fatigue. Treatment involves surgical removal of the cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of these (multimodality treatment). Prognosis is generally poor unless the cancer is detected in its early stages. Out of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer, only 15% survive for five years after diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Quain, born in November 1796, was {{eldest son}} of Richard Quain of Ratheahy, co. Cork, {{by his first}} wife, a Miss Jones. His {{grandfather}} was David Quain of Carrigoon, co. Cork. He received the name of Jones from his mother's family. Richard Quain (1800-1887) was his full brother, and Sir John Richard Quain his half-brother. Sir Richard Quain was his first cousin. He began his education in Adair's school at Fermoy. He then entered Trinity College, Dublin, where, in 1814, he obtained a scholarship, then the highest classical distinction. He graduated in arts, and in 1820 he took the degree of bachelor of medicine, {{though he did not}} proceed M.D. until 1833. At the close of his college career he visited the continental schools and spent some time in Paris, translating and editing Martinet's Manual of Pathology. Quain came to London in 1825 and joined, as one of its anatomical teachers, the Aldersgate Street school of medicine founded by Frederick Tyrrell. The other teacher of anatomy was William Lawrence. While engaged there he published Elements of Anatomy which became a standard text-book in English-speaking countries. An attack of <b>hæmoptysis</b> occurring while he suffered from a dissection wound compelled him to take a rest for two years.|$|E
40|$|<b>Haemoptysis</b> {{is defined}} as the {{expectoration}} of blood or bloody streaking of the sputum. The list of possible underlying differential diagnoses is broad, and the cause of <b>haemoptysis</b> depends on the origin of the individual patient. Patients with minor <b>haemoptysis</b> can often be managed in the outpatient setting. In contrast, patients with major <b>haemoptysis</b> require immediate in-hospital diagnostic workup and therapy. Patients with major <b>haemoptysis</b> should be managed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of Pulmonologists, Critical Care Physicians/Anaesthesiologists, Interventional Radiologists, and Thoracic Surgeons. In major <b>haemoptysis,</b> airway maintenance, adequate gas exchange, and haemodynamic stabilization are mandatory. In this article, the recommended diagnostic and therapeutic steps in patients with major <b>haemoptysis</b> (particularly computed tomography, laboratory analyses, bronchoscopy, and bronchial artery embolization) are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{pulmonary}} tuberculosis may present as massive <b>haemoptysis.</b> <b>Haemoptysis</b> usually originates from the bronchial artery but the pulmonary artery {{might be the}} culprit vessel in recurrent <b>haemoptysis.</b> We present a case where bronchial artery embolisation had to be augmented by pulmonary artery coil embolisation for a Rasmussen's aneurysm after recurrent <b>haemoptysis.</b> In cases where recurrent haemorrhage occurs, sources other than the bronchial artery should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-seven {{patients}} admitted {{with the}} provisional diagnosis of "Haemoptysis for investigation " were reviewed {{to ascertain the}} aetiology and incidence of surgically curable causes of <b>haemoptysis.</b> In a predominantly male sample (51 of 67), <b>haemoptysis</b> occurred at {{the mean age of}} 40. 5 years. Thirty-eight (56. 7 %) of sixty-seven patients had bronchial or lung parenchymal inflammation as the cause of <b>haemoptysis.</b> Thirty-nine patients had bronchography to find the cause of <b>haemoptysis.</b> Twenty-one (53. 8 %) of thirty-nine patients were found to have bronchiectasis as a cause of <b>haemoptysis.</b> No case of lung cancer was detected in this series on sputum cytology, computerized tomography (CT) of chest and bronchoscopy. The yield of interventional investigations to find out a surgically curable cause of <b>haemoptysis</b> is low (2 of 67, 2. 9 %), when chest radiograph is within normal limits. We conclude that in Saudi Arabia the aetiology of <b>haemoptysis</b> in patients with normal chest X-ray is different from that seen in Western countries. Lower respiratory tract infections remain the predominant cause of <b>haemoptysis.</b> We recommend bronchography or high resolutio...|$|E
40|$|Bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) {{has been}} {{established}} as an effective technique in the emergency treatment of life-threatening <b>haemoptysis.</b> However, few data concerning outcome are available.

30|$|Massive <b>haemoptysis</b> {{is defined}} as {{expectoration}} of 100  ml of blood in a single episode or more than 600  ml of blood over a 24 -h period. Massive <b>haemoptysis</b> is a life-threatening medical emergency, which is fatal in about one-third of cases. Bronchogenic carcinoma {{is the most common}} cause of massive <b>haemoptysis</b> in patients over 40  years old with an overall rate of <b>haemoptysis</b> of 10 - 20 %, although only fatal in 3 % [23].

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To audit {{the use of}} {{bronchial}} arteriography and embolisation {{for controlling}} <b>haemoptysis.</b> DESIGN [...] Retrospective review of radiological and clinical data. SETTING [...] Brompton and National Heart Hospitals. PATIENTS [...] 35 patients with severe pulmonary disease in whom 58 bronchial arteriograms were obtained between 1 January 1984 and 31 December 1989 {{with the intention of}} bronchial artery embolisation for controlling <b>haemoptysis.</b> MAIN MEASURES [...] Rate of technical success and cessation of haemoptysis; detailed evaluation of patients, particularly those with major <b>haemoptysis</b> (> 100 ml expectorated blood); and retrospective assessment of the appropriateness of the procedure in each. RESULTS [...] 58 procedures were performed, nine of which were unsuitable for detailed analysis. Nine procedures were for minor <b>haemoptysis,</b> which subsequently recurred, and 40 for recent major <b>haemoptysis</b> in 26 patients with cystic fibrosis (16) aspergilloma (six), bronchiectasis (three), and an unknown diagnosis (one). The median total volume of <b>haemoptysis</b> in the episode before the procedure was 680 ml (range 270 - 2200 ml). Embolisation was technically successful in 33 / 40 procedures, in 17 of which, however, major <b>haemoptysis</b> recurred within 10 days of the procedure, leaving 16 clinically and technically successful procedures in 15 patients. Five patients (three with aspergilloma, two with cystic fibrosis) died of <b>haemoptysis</b> despite attempted embolisation. CONCLUSION [...] Success rate of bronchial artery embolisation was 40 %(16 / 40). IMPLICATIONS [...] Bronchial artery embolisation is probably not justified for minor <b>haemoptysis</b> or when performed more than one week after a major <b>haemoptysis.</b> Repeat arteriograms during a single period of <b>haemoptysis</b> are seldom useful. With these criteria 43 % fewer procedures would have been performed with no loss of clinical benefit...|$|E
