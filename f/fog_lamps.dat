25|$|Proponents of twin rear <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> say {{two lamps}} provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available {{from a single}} lamp. Proponents of the single rear fog lamp say dual rear <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear fog lamp.|$|E

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2008 General Motors {{currently}} utilizes {{halogen bulb}} technology {{as the light}} source for front <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> applications.

If a single rear fog is fitted, most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side {{in the country in}} which the vehicle is registered. This is to maximize the sight line of following drivers to the rear fog lamp. In many cases, a single reversing lamp is mounted on the passenger side of the vehicle, positionally symmetrical with the rear fog.
