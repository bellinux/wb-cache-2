5|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the game is}} its short length. Episode One takes roughly 4–6 hours to complete, which raises the issue of whether the game justifies its price. Computer Games Magazine argued the futility of reviewing the game due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> judge it when divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E

5|$|All {{surviving}} sources, except Pliny the Elder, characterize Caligula as insane. However, it is {{not known}} whether they are speaking figuratively or literally. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> separate fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided in attempting to ascribe a medical reason for his behavior, citing as possibilities encephalitis, epilepsy or meningitis. The {{question of whether or not}} Caligula was insane (especially after his illness early in his reign) remains unanswered.|$|E

5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect {{because it is}} colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E

Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{includes a}} dynamical spacetime, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see {{how to identify}} the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E
