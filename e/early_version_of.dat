5|$|Djawadi {{said that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the main title music by an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the series's computer-animated title sequence.

5|$|Early {{drafts of}} the novel {{entitled}} Trimalchio: An <b>Early</b> <b>Version</b> <b>of</b> The Great Gatsby have been published. A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream in Trimalchio. Another {{difference is that the}} argument between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby is more even, although Daisy still returns to Tom.|$|E

5|$|Ibn Bajjah (Avempace, c. 1085–1138) {{proposed}} {{that for every}} force there is a reaction force. While he did not specify that these forces be equal, it was still an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Newton's third law of motion.|$|E
5|$|The T194 {{training}} round was discontinued in 2002. It {{could be}} considered an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the SS192 or SS195. It used the same 1.8-g (28grain) copper-jacketed aluminum core bullet, propelled at the same muzzle velocity. It had a green tip.|$|E

5|$|A trio {{of small}} Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon a common {{platform}} {{at the east}} end of the terrace, facing west. It is likely that the platform was purposely built to support the three temples that were built more-or-less simultaneously. Neither the platform nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the central temple (Temple 30) was built first, then decommissioned with the platform being built to cover the early version, followed by {{the construction of a new}} version plus the two additional flanking temples.|$|E
5|$|An <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> {{the modern}} {{self-help}} book, the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There {{was an explosion}} in the number of conduct books published {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took advantage of this burgeoning market when she published Thoughts. However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> it {{that was not}} released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead {{turned it into a}} pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing {{a number of}} pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E
5|$|In 1641, Harvard University sent three preachers to England {{to raise}} money for missionary {{activities}} among the Indians. To support the fund-raising, the University produced one of the earliest fund-raising brochures, New England's First Fruits. An <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the press release was used when King's College (now Columbia University), sent out an announcement of its 1758 graduation ceremonies and several newspapers printed the information. Princeton was the first university to make it a routine practice of supplying newspapers with information about activities at the college.|$|E

5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E
5|$|The Paperboys were {{originally}} formed in 1991 by bassist Christopher Jonat and Tom Landa on acoustic guitar and vocals, with Jeremy Hughes on accordion and vocals, Kevin Ball on fiddle, and Dave Plenkovich on drums.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of {{considerable}} debate {{for more than a}} century. In 1920, British palaeoanthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark proposed that the toothcomb found in treeshrews (which he believed were primates) was an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the dental structure found in lemuriforms. Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the Miocene as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb, he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently. This view was later overturned, and the monophyletic relationship between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted.|$|E
5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known {{today as the}} Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would have {{incorporated}} a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.|$|E
5|$|Basing {{the plot}} {{partially}} {{on a story}} told to her by a stranger, Kim began an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> 12 Days as a sophomore in college to help herself cope {{with the end of}} a relationship. After moving on emotionally with her break-up, she stopped developing the comic and later left South Korea to attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York, United States, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning. Following her successful pitch of 12 Days to manga publisher Tokyopop, she resumed work on it in early 2005 and finished in the middle of August 2006. 12 Days focuses on Jackie Yuen, who decides to drink the ashes of her former lover for twelve days in beverages as a way to cope with her grief over her death.|$|E
