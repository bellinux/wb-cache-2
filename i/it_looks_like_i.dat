2500|$|While {{initially}} touted {{to return}} to Augusta State University for the 2011/12 season as late as 11 July 2011, Purser announced just three days later that he was unlikely to play another NCAA season. While Purser said he enjoyed his time with the Jaguars, he said it may be better for {{him to stay in}} Perth, citing [...] "At this stage <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> might be staying, just because academically my units that I've started back here [...] don't match up. I think, just looking at a number of factors, that I may be staying." [...] Soon after, Purser informed coach Dip Metress of his departure, after joining a shortlist of players fighting for the final spot on the Perth Wildcats roster – the most successful team in the National Basketball League (NBL). Joining Purser on the shortlist included three members of the Wildcats' 2010/11 extended squad – Greg Hire, Tom Jervis and Everard Bartlett. No matter the outcome, Wildcats coach Rob Beveridge guaranteed Purser involvement with the team in 2011/12, with the worst-case scenario being a development player role. Not to Purser's displeasure, on 11 August, Hire was awarded with the final roster spot. Purser was undeterred by the Wildcats' decision not to award the final spot to him, instead relishing the prospect of becoming an NBL development player. Purser appeared in 10 games for the Wildcats during the 2011/12 season, scoring a total of 20 points. Highlights for Purser included scoring 6 points in 5½ minutes against the New Zealand Breakers at home on 23 December 2011 in just his third NBL game; being nominated for the NBL's Round 23 Play of the Week for his athletic three-point play in the final period against the Cairns Taipans on 11 March 2012; and being nominated for the NBL Rookie of the Year Award. The Wildcats finished the regular season in second place with a 19–9 record and took down the third-seeded Gold Coast Blaze 2–1 in the semi-finals, with Purser seeing game time in Game 3 on 7 April 2012. The Wildcats went on face the New Zealand Breakers in the NBL Grand Final series, where they were defeated 2–1.|$|E
