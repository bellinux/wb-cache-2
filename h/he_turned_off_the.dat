500|$|On 20 May, two {{flights of}} F-86 Sabres {{encountered}} multiple MiG-15s in MiG Alley, and through radio communications, two additional flights of F-86 Sabres joined the battle, including Jabara. In {{preparation for the}} oncoming battle, Jabara and the other F-86 Sabre pilots were ordered to jettison their auxiliary fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability. Jabara's fuel tank failed to separate from his wing, and protocol required he return to base as the aircraft would be impeded by the extra weight and imbalance, and limit his potential to match off with a MiG. However, Jabara decided to continue to the air battle, where {{he was able to}} still handle his aircraft well enough to be credited with shooting down two MiG-15s with [...]50 caliber machine gun fire. The first was in a group of three MiGs and the other was the last in a six-plane group. Jabara was able to see the first aircraft explode from his gunfire, but he only saw his second victory go into a tailspin as he was avoiding being targeted by another MiG. His fifth and sixth victories made Jabara the first American in history to use jet aircraft to become an ace. The Americans said the 20-minute air battle had included 36 F-86 Sabres against nearly 50 MiG-15s (Russian data shows 30 MiGs), and the American pilots recorded Jabara's two victories and another pilot's [...] "probable". While returning to base, Jabara's F-86 Sabre was so low on fuel, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> engine and glided towards the base before turning it on prior to landing. Data-matching with Soviet records made available {{since the end of the}} Cold War has since shown that only one MiG was lost in the combat, and that Jabara's jet-versus-jet tally was four at best. Nevertheless, American military forces claimed that Jabara was the first jet-versus-jet ace. Jabara later stated in an interview, [...] "That was my bag for the day, and it made me feel pretty good to know that I was the first jet ace in the history of aerial warfare." [...] The mission was his 63rd Korean mission of an eventual 163; he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest decoration.|$|E
2500|$|When Whitehead {{neared the}} end of a field, the article said <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> motor and the {{aircraft}} landed [...] "so lightly that Whitehead was not jarred in the least." ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain Schettino stated that, before {{approaching}} the island, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> alarm {{system for the}} ship's computer navigation system. [...] "I was navigating by sight, because I knew those seabeds well. I had done the move three, four times." [...] He told investigators that he saw waves breaking on the reef and turned abruptly, swinging {{the side of the}} hull into the reef. [...] "I have {{to take responsibility for the}} fact that I made a judgment error." [...] "This time I ordered the turn too late." [...] The captain initially stated that the ship was about [...] from the shore (about the length of the vessel) and hit an uncharted rock. However, the ship's first officer, Ciro Ambrosio, told investigators that Schettino had left his reading glasses in his cabin and repeatedly asked Ambrosio to check the radar for him.|$|E
5000|$|Back on the farm, a dog {{tries to}} ask his lover, Marie-Alana, something. The dog wishes there was a blackout. He sees a lightswitch, and yells [...] "BLACKOUT!". After a short blackout, the dog has {{lipstick}} stains on his face, and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lights again, yelling [...] "BLACKOUT!".|$|R
50|$|Jack {{then takes}} {{some time to}} say goodbye to his former lover, as alarms go off around him announcing that Angelo's just died. In {{annoyance}} <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> machines, until <b>he</b> realizes that unlike everyone else on the planet, the rules for the miracle do not apply to Angelo either; he has actually died.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> light proper, {{consequently}} {{the way to}} the companionway was rather dark.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> gas, and {{the springs}} shrieked under his body.|$|E
60|$|As {{the room}} was scantily heated, Crabtree lost no time in disrobing. Having donned a long night robe, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> gas, flung the sheets back, and leaped into bed.|$|E
60|$|In one of {{his pockets}} he carried a piece of cake, and this he ate with {{satisfaction}} while undressing. Then, when clad only in his pajamas, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> light and moved in the semi-darkness toward the bed.|$|E
50|$|The film {{opens with}} Manchester Black {{watching}} news stories about villains and how they're given second chances. All {{of the news}} stories come down to one subject: the world wants solutions {{to all of the}} evil in the world - by killing it. When Manchester sees this, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> TV and begins his plot to keep the world safe by any means necessary.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{also had}} {{elements}} of horror. As did another Outer Limits story, [...] "The Borderland", it addressed {{the idea of}} an electronic limbo that exists when television signals cease transmission or are broadcast out into space, raising questions such as where the Galaxy Being goes when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> transmitter. This horror of oblivion was to occur in several other Outer Limits episodes.|$|R
500|$|Back in {{the present}} day, Homer takes Maggie to bed, commenting on how the sooner kids learn to talk, the sooner they learn to talk back, and tells Maggie that he hopes she never says a word. But as soon as <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> light and closes the door, Maggie takes her {{pacifier}} {{out of her mouth}} and utters the word [...] "daddy", before going to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the front}} lamps {{of the machine}} shone down on {{something}} in the roadway that sent back a strange sparkle of light. Dick bent forward and uttered an exclamation of dismay. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> power and jammed on both brakes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> light; {{there was}} the end of the stick, and {{there was the}} little patch of sandy gravel, which he stepped upon, {{stamping}} heavily as he did so. He then retired outside the screen. Professor Tippengray turned to the audience.|$|E
6000|$|Lancelot went {{thoughtful}} home, and sat down--not {{to answer}} Luke's letter--for he knew no answer but Tregarva's, and that, alas! {{he could not}} give, for {{he did not believe}} it, but only longed to believe it. So <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> subject by a question-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-morning, sur," [...] {{said the}} stout-limbed and stout-hearted man, {{with a smile}} and a nod, as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> towards <b>the</b> moor-house to put on his mining garments.|$|R
50|$|Despondent, Cunningham {{insists that}} Giles open the vault and free his asphyx. Giles agrees, on the {{condition}} that Cunningham first grant him immortality. Unbeknownst to Cunningham, Giles rigs the procedure, removing the phosphorus stones from the spotlight. As Cunningham attempts to gas Giles to death to summon his asphyx, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> gas and <b>turns</b> on the oxygen to save Giles. Giles strikes a match. The resulting explosion kills Giles and destroys all of the equipment required to capture asphyxes.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the film Doctor Dave (Nick Frost) and Carl conspire to have Carl lose his virginity. Dave has his girlfriend get naked and lie in bed for him while <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lights and goes into the bathroom, where Carl has hidden. Carl then gets naked and walks into the dark room in an attempt to deceive Dave's girlfriend. However she turns the lights on and sees who was really about to have sex with her, and Carl gets embarrassed and leaves.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lights, and as {{he crossed}} the house, pressed off the hall lights as he went, while the many {{unimportant}} little nothings, almost of themselves, ranged themselves into an ordered text of doubt and conjecture that he could not refrain from reading.|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{he began}} to splash, {{throwing}} up water in handfuls, singing. The water poured {{over the side of}} the tub. Mr. Wrenn tried to hold him still, but the wet sleek shoulders slipped through his hand like a wet platter. Wholesomely vexed, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> water and slammed the bathroom door.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she went}} {{past him and}} out through the door, {{and he had to}} go back to the mantel-piece where one of the {{electric}} light switches was. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> light; the room remained in darkness save where the dying embers of the fire threw a red glow on the sofa where she had sat with him, and the footstool on which her evening shoe had rested.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night, John," [...] {{answered}} <b>the</b> signalman, as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> in <b>the</b> {{direction of}} his own dwelling, while the engine-driver and his little daughter pursued the footpath that led to their cottage.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> from <b>the</b> {{track and}} wandered among the bushes. One might lie down {{anywhere}} here. But not yet; {{it was as}} yet barely twilight. He consulted his watch. HALF-PAST SEVEN.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> from <b>the</b> lawn, and {{approached}} by a small circuit {{the gate of the}} ground. Suddenly he perceived a carriage on the point of going <b>off.</b> It was <b>the</b> Duchess of Shropshire's.|$|R
6000|$|Fortunately, Dave's {{knowledge}} of gasoline engines now stood him in good stead, {{and without the}} loss of a second <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> supply of gasoline and the electric spark, and thus allowed the engine to [...] "die." [...] As the propeller slowed up and stopped, the water behind the craft calmed down, and then the pounding on the rocks was reduced to a gentle rub that did little but scratch the paint.|$|E
60|$|He left Ord, ostensibly toward Bradford, but, once out of sight, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road, circled {{through the}} brush, and several {{miles south of}} town he struck a narrow grass-grown trail that Fletcher had told him led to Cheseldine's camp. The horse tracks along this trail were not {{less than a week}} old, and very likely much more. It wound between low, brush-covered foothills, through arroyos and gullies lined with mesquite, cottonwood, and scrub-oak.|$|E
60|$|Later, he {{paid his}} bill, lighted a cigar and strolled homewards. Already his brain was at work. The scenes {{of his story}} lay {{stretched}} invitingly before him--it seemed that he would only have to take up his pen and write until exhaustion came. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Strand, humming softly to himself, so wrapt in his world of teeming fancies {{that he did not}} notice the little figure in sober black, who looked eagerly into his face as she approached. He would have passed on but for her timid word of remonstrance.|$|E
50|$|The film {{opens with}} a boy waking from sleep {{in the middle of}} the night. He walks to a closed door across the hall from his bedroom and overhears the sound of a woman having sex, which {{suddenly}} stops. He walks to the living room, where the television is playing static. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> television and notices a red light emanating from his bedroom. He becomes afraid and runs to the closed door, yelling for his mother. A robed arm reaches towards him from his bedroom. The door slams.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for the song, {{directed}} by Tamar Simon Hoffs, features the band inside a car being driven around by a chauffeur, {{who appears to}} be unimpressed by the group (at one point <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> car radio, stopping the song). The car stops inside a tunnel and the girls walk towards the end of it, which cuts to the band playing and dancing over a red background. Leonard Nimoy played the part of the chauffeur; this came about due to Nimoy being a friend of Tamar and Susanna Hoffs' family.|$|R
60|$|Macdermot by {{no means}} desired to admit Father Cullen into the conference about his sister; the strong {{expression}} of his dislike had fallen from him as it were involuntarily: <b>he</b> therefore <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> question.|$|R
60|$|Lawrence {{told him}} to do so. The lift had stopped between the floors on their ascent, and the {{electric}} light inside it had gone out, while the boy said something about his {{not being able to}} run it much longer. The photographs, however, were not on the bureau and Lawrence searched the room before he found them on the bed. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> light and went into the passage, which was rather dark. The lamp at the shaft was not burning, but he could see Walters beckoning at the gate.|$|E
60|$|She {{wondered}} what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city, and finally decided {{that he had been}} appointed to some great honor, somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the subject, especially when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> gas, and kissed the picture in the dark.|$|E
60|$|It {{was long}} past midnight, when, weary in body, but still hopeful and happy in mind, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> dusty road into a vast rolling expanse of wild oats, {{with the same}} sense of {{security}} of rest as a traveler to his inn. Here, completely screened from view by the tall stalks of grain that rose thickly around him to the height of a man's shoulder, he beat down a few of them for a bed, on which he deposited his blanket. Placing his pack for a pillow, he curled himself up in his blanket, and speedily fell asleep.|$|E
50|$|Mimi, Edith and Yvette {{play the}} Andrews Sisters' Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy on a {{gramophone}} in the café, practicing miming to it, {{while waiting for}} the allies. While they are doing this, René comes into the café, a cauliflower in his hand and onions hanging around his neck. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> record and informs them, that the blowing up of the ammunition dump failed, but that they hit a vegetable van instead. While René gives the vegetables to Mimi to put in the kitchen and let Yvette tend to the bar, he and Edith go upstairs to radio London.|$|R
60|$|As {{rapidly as}} <b>he</b> could Matt <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> faucet. Then leaving the water {{still in the}} sink to the brim, he dashed downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's fair,' I says, and I {{shook hands}} with Jackson Bird. 'I'll get it for you if I can, and glad to oblige.' And <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> down <b>the</b> big pear flat on the Piedra, in the {{direction}} of Mired Mule; and I steered northwest for old Bill Toomey's ranch.|$|R
