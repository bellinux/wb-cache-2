Jeffersonians supported France and strongly attacked the treaty. Washington listened to both sides, then announced his strong support, which mobilized public opinion and was pivotal in securing ratification in the Senate on June 24, 1795 by the requisite two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, while Metternich {{was still}} at Laibach with Tsar Alexander, the revolt of Alexander Ypsilantis {{threatened}} to bring the Ottoman Empire {{to the brink of}} collapse. Wanting a strong Ottoman Empire to counterbalance Russia, Metternich opposed all forms of Greek nationalism. Before Alexander returned to Russia, Metternich secured his agreement not to act unilaterally and would write to the Tsar again and again asking him not to intervene. For extra support he met with Viscount Castlereagh (now also Marquis of Londonderry) and King George IV of the United Kingdom in Hanover in October. The warmness of Metternich's welcome was sweetened by his promise to settle in part Austria's <b>financial</b> <b>debts</b> to Britain. The earlier Anglo-Austrian entente was thus restored, and the pair agreed that they would support the Austrian position concerning the Balkans. Metternich went away happy, not least because he had met Dorothea Lieven once more.|$|E

Eberhardt asked him for every detail he could give her {{about life in the}} Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged the two of them to relocate to Bône, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series of circumstances that remain unclear though involved <b>financial</b> <b>debts</b> and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined the French Foreign Legion and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa.|$|E
40|$|Financing {{choices are}} one of the most {{critical}} decision for management by influencing the firm’s behaviour as well as its economic performance and value. Based on the researches of Abor (2005) and Gill, Biger and Mathur (2011) the paper is a moderate attempt to understand the relationship between capital structure and economic performance of Italian large, medium and small firms in manufacturing and service industry listed in Italian Stock Exchange in a period of 5 years (from 2007 to 2011). The analysis found a significant relationship between economic performance of the firm and its <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> but with non-unique direction. A positive correlation was found in the medium manufacturing firms (between i) ROE and total, long-term and short-term <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> to total assets; ii) ROA and total and short-term <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> to total assets; iii) ROI and short-term <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> to total assets), in the large service firms (between i) ROA and total <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> to total assets; ii) ROI and long-term <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> to total assets) and in the small service firms (between ROE and total and short-term financial deb t to total assets). Differently a negative correlation was found in the large manufacturing firms (between i) ROE, ROA and short-term <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> to total assets; ii) ROI and total and long-term <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> to total assets), in the small manufacturing firms (between ROE and total and short-term <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> to total assets) and in the large and small service firms (between ROI and short-term <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> to total assets).

40|$|Using {{survey data}} on Italian {{manufacturing}} firms, this paper examines firms' capital structure and {{their access to}} <b>financial</b> <b>debt,</b> notably bank loans. We find that the share of <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> in total liabilities is, on average, smaller for small firms than for large ones. However, this is not because the typical small firm borrows less than a large firm, but because small firms are more likely not to borrow at all. For firms that do borrow, the share of <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> varies little with firm size. The absence of <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> on the balance sheet of many firms is mainly {{because they do not}} want to borrow, not because lenders do not want to lend. Thus, credit rationing does not appear to be a widespread phenomenon, but when it happens, lack of size and equity seems to play a key role.

40|$|The main {{objective}} with the thesis was to analyze institutional {{change in the}} European Union pre-and-post <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> crisis, with particular focus on {{the roles of the}} Parliament, the Commission, the Council as well as the Court of Justice. To attain the objective, the thesis intended to answer the subsequent queries; (i) what notable institutional changes were brought in the European Union pre-and-post <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> crisis; (ii) what role did the Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the Court of Justice play pre-and-post <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> crisis; were their roles enhanced by the <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> crisis? In order to attain the objective, the thesis utilized an institutional analysis and development framework. This theoretical framework relied on a qualitative content analysis.  The results of the thesis exhibit that the European Union’s progression route was not free from crises. With the Union’s expansion, more decisions ought to be taken by the four institutional bodies. The role of the European institutional bodies resulted in various institutional changes with the establishment of the Treaty of Lisbon; from having a normative power to encompass an executive one. The Treaty of Lisbon also changed the decisionmaking procedure to an ordinary legislative procedure. Apropos decision-making, the Treaty of Lisbon also enhanced the Council and the Parliament’s role pre-financial debt crisis by making the Parliament and Council equal in the new co-decision procedure. The role of the Council has been dynamic since its formation, while the role of the three other institutions could somewhat vary throughout the pre-financial debt crisis. With regards to institutional change after the <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> crisis, the results reveal that institutional changes occurred mainly in economic and fiscal policies, for instance strengthening the EMU with the intergovernmental Treaty on Stability and Coordination and Governance. Whilst the Treaty of Lisbon brought more supranationalism in the European Union, the period after the <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> crisis rather celebrated intergovernmentalism in the Union. The role of the Council was dynamic even post-financial debt crisis, decreasing the role of the Commission in the agenda setting. However, with the introduction of the Six-Pack and the Banking Union, the Commission and the Parliament’s role became evidently enhanced, whilst the Court of Justice, did not {{play a key role in}} the <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> crisis...|$|R

2500|$|Adrian Busietta, {{the later}} {{owner of the}} residence, was born on 14 January, 1935 to William Busietta and Evelyn (née Casolani), a working class family, and lived his early life in Sliema. He was {{introduced}} to his eventual wife, Eileen [...] "dei Conti" [...] Sant Fournier, by his uncle John Fleri {{who worked for the}} Sant Fournier family. The encounter is said to have led to an arranged marriage; Busietta had always estranged his wife whom he married on October 10, 1958, and who bore him three children: Hadrian Jr., Rowena and Fiona. His marriage to Eileen was a turning point from a simple clerk to a prosperous life and opened before him a number of career opportunities such as a banker, businessman, and the President of the Malta Chamber of Commerce. After Busietta gained access to his wife and family business, he spent money on luxurious goods, creating several <b>financial</b> <b>debts,</b> and was partially to blame for the liquidation of the many companies and assets owned by the family. Busietta had an extra matrimonial relationship with his mistress, Maria [...] "Marie Angelique" [...] Caruana, during which period they had a child. In 1975 Busietta and Eileen separated and went to live apart, with Eileen gaining custody of the children. Busietta and his wife eventually entered a divorce process, which eventually succeeded in 1978. After some years, Eileen entered into a relationship with a man named Vince, whom also fathered his step-children.|$|E
