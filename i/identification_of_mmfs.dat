40|$|Using data {{recorded}} by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we have traced 123 pairs of opposite magnetic polarity moving magnetic features (MMFs) in three active regions NOAA ARs 8375, 0330 and 9575. At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330 mature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> pairs with polarity opposite {{to that of the}} sunspot support a downflow of around 50 - 100 m s$^{- 1 }$. The average Doppler shift difference between negative and positive elements <b>of</b> an <b>MMF</b> pair is about 150 m s$^{- 1 }$ in AR 8375, 100 m s$^{- 1 }$ in AR 0330, and 20 m s$^{- 1 }$ in AR 9575. These observational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part of a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this model the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar surface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity <b>of</b> <b>MMFs</b> ranges from 0. 1 km s$^{- 1 }$ to 0. 7 km s$^{- 1 }$, and on average, the velocity <b>of</b> an <b>MMF</b> pair decreases significantly (from 0. 6 km s$^{- 1 }$ to 0. 35 km s$^{- 1 }$) with increasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the change in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat flow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>MMF</b> pairs. This result is also in agreement with the U-loop model <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> pairs. We also find that properties <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution stages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> pairs in ARs 9575 and 0330 are 0. 7 hours and 1. 6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorter than the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375.

40|$|Abstract Background Mycophenolate mofetil (<b>MMF),</b> the prodrug <b>of</b> {{mycophenolic acid}} (MPA), is a rationally {{designed}} immunosuppressive drug. The current study investigates the effect <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> on key pattern of restenosis {{in a cascade}} of in vitro and ex vivo models. Methods Part I of the study investigated in northern blot and cytoflow studies the effect <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 μg/mL) on TNF-α induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) in human coronary endothelial cells (HCAEC) and human coronary medial smooth muscle cells (HCMSMC). Part II of the study applied a human coronary 3 D model of leukocyte attack, the 3 DLA-model. HCAEC and HCMSMC were cultured {{on both sides of}} a polycarbonate filters, mimicking the internal elastic membrane. Leukocyte attack (LA) was carried out by adding human monocytes (MC) on the endothelial side. The effect <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> (50 μg/mL) on adhesion and chemotaxis (0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 h after LA) and the effect on proliferation of co-cultured HCMSMC (24 h after LA) was studied. In part III of the study a porcine coronary organ culture model of restenosis (POC-model) was used. After ex vivo ballooning MMF (50 μg/mL) was added to the cultures for a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days. The effect on reactive cell proliferation and neointimal thickening was studied at day 7 and day 28 after ballooning. Results Expression of ICAM- 1 in northern blot and cytoflow studies was neither clearly inhibited nor stimulated after administration <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> in the clinical relevant concentration of 50 μg/mL. In the 3 DLA-model 50 μg/mL <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> caused a significant antiproliferative effect (p Conclusion Thus, the data demonstrate a significant antiproliferative effect of clinical relevant levels <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> (50 μg/mL) in the 3 DLA-model. The antiproliferative effect was a direct antiproliferative effect that was not triggered via reduced expression of ICAM- 1 or via an inhibition of MC-adhesion and chemotaxis. Probably due to technical limitations (as e. g. the missing of perfusion) the antiproliferative effect <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> (50 μg/mL) could not be reproduced in the coronary organ culture model. A cascade of focused in vitro and ex vivo models may help to gather informations on drug effects before large experimental studies are initiated. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background/AimsThe dose <b>of</b> mycophenolate mofetil (<b>MMF)</b> {{has been}} reduced in Asia due to side effects {{associated}} with the conventional fixed dose of 2 - 3 g/day. We aimed to determine the pharmacokinetics of a reduced dose <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> and to validate its feasibility in combination with tacrolimus in living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT). MethodsTwo sequential studies were performed in adult LDLT between October 2009 and 2011. First, we performed a prospective pharmacokinetic study in 15 recipients. We measured the area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC 0 - 12) for mycophenolic acid at postoperative days 7 and 14, and we performed a protocol biopsy before discharge. Second, among 215 recipients, we reviewed 74 patients who were initially administered a reduced dose <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> (1. 0 g/day) with tacrolimus (trough, 8 - 12 ng/mL during the first month, and 5 - 8 ng/mL thereafter), with a 1 -year follow-up. We performed protocol biopsies at 2 weeks and 1 year post-LDLT. ResultsIn {{the first part of}} study, AUC 0 - 12 was less than 30 mgh/L in 93. 3 % of cases. In the second, validating study, 41. 9 % of the recipients needed dose reduction or cessation due to side effects within the first year after LDLT. At 12 months post-LDLT, 17. 6 % of the recipients were administered a lower dose <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> (0. 5 g/day), and 16. 2 % needed permanent cessation due to side effects. The 1 - and 12 -month rejection-free survival rates were 98. 6 % and 97. 3 %, respectively. ConclusionsA reduced dose <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> was associated with low blood levels compared to the existing recommended therapeutic range. However, reducing the dose <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> combined with a low level of tacrolimus was feasible clinically, with an excellent short-term outcome in LDLT...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy and tolerance <b>of</b> mycophenolate mofetil (<b>MMF)</b> {{for the treatment}} of noninfectious uveitis using the methods advocated by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group and to compare this with other studies of immunosuppression in ocular inflammation. Methods: Retrospective case series. Patients with noninfectious uveitis, followed at a tertiary Uveitis Service in São Paulo, Brazil, from 2007 to 2014 and receiving oral MMF for a minimum of 6 months, were retrospectively reviewed. After reaching an optimal dose <b>of</b> <b>MMF,</b> patients were evaluated after 6 (T 6), 12 (T 12), and 24 months (T 24). The optimal dose varied for each patient (medium 2. 2 g/day, range 1. 0 - 3. 0 g/day). The main outcome measures were: 1) success on achieving complete control of inflammation in both eyes and/or oral prednisone dosage reduction to ≤ 10 mg per day, and 2) the length of time required to reduce oral prednisone to ≤ 10 mg/day, partial control of ocular inflammation, and side effects. Results: In a cohort of 16 patients with refractory noninfectious uveitis, 67 % reached the ideal prednisone dose after 1 year <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> treatment and 83 % after 2 years <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> treatment. Complete or partial inflammation control was achieved in 43. 7 % at T 12. Two patients (14 %) had disease remission after 4. 7 years <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> treatment.

40|$|Immunosuppression {{correlates}} {{with the development}} and recurrence of cancer. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) {{has been shown to}} reduce adhesion molecule expression and leucocyte recruitment into the donor organ. We have hypothesized that MMF might also prevent receptor-dependent tumour dissemination. Therefore, we have investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> on tumour cell adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and compared them with the effects on T cell–endothelial cell interactions. Influence <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> on cellular adhesion to HUVEC was analysed using isolated CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, or WiDr colon adenocarcinoma cells as the model tumour. HUVEC receptors ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, E-selectin and P-selectin were detected by flow cytometry, Western blot or Northern blot analysis. Binding activity of T cells or WiDr cells in the presence <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> were measured using immobilized receptor globulin chimeras. MMF potently blocked both T cell and WiDr cell binding to endothelium by 80 %. Surface expression of the endothelial cell receptors was reduced by MMF in a dose-dependent manner. E-selectin mRNA was concurrently reduced with a maximum effect at 1 µm. Interestingly, MMF acted differently on T cells and WiDr cells. Maximum efficacy <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> was reached at 10 and 1 µm, respectively. Furthermore, MMF specifically suppressed T cell attachment to ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1 and P-selectin. In contrast, MMF prevented WiDr cell attachment to E-selectin. In conclusion, our data reveal distinct effects <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> on both T cell adhesion and tumour cell adhesion to endothelial cells.

Methods: Purified human CGCs were treated {{with a series of}} graded concentrations <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> after being confirmed by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Proliferation and MUC 5 AC mRNA expression of CGCs were measured by Cell Count Kit- 8 (CCK- 8) and quantitative nested real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QNRT-PCR at 24 h after treatment. The cell proliferation and MUC 5 AC mRNA expressiion were compared among different doses <b>of</b> <b>MMF.</b> Results: MMF induced a dose-dependent upregulation of MUC 5 AC mRNA expression (F= 238. 851, p< 0. 01) but a biphase effect on proliferation of the CGCs over 24 h of co-incubation. This biphase effect manifested as a dose-dependent increase in cell numbers with MMF from 0. 25 to 2. 5 ng/ml, an unchanged population of the cells from 2. 5 to 10 ng/ml and a reduced population of the cells from 25 to 100 ng/ml.

The dosing regimen <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> 600 mg/m 2 b. i. d. achieved the targeted early post-transplantation MPA 12 -h area under concentration-time curve (AUC 0 – 12) of 27. 2 µg h per ml. Adverse events had similar frequencies among the age groups (with the exception of diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, and anemia, which were more frequent in the < 6 years age group) and led to withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> in about 10 % of patients. Administration <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> 600 mg/m 2 b. i. d. is effective in prevention of acute rejection, provides predictable pharmacokinetics, and is associated with an acceptable safety profile in pediatric renal transplant recipients...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{data and}} few {{clinical}} non-randomized {{studies have shown}} that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) associated or not with the use <b>of</b> mycophenolate mofetil (<b>MMF)</b> could delay or even halt the progression of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). In this retrospective historical study, we investigated whether ACE inhibition (ACEI) associated or not with the use <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> has the same effect in humans as in experimental studies and what factors are associated with a clinical response. A total of 160 transplant patients with biopsy-proven CAN were enrolled. Eighty-one of them were on ACE therapy (G 1) and 80 on ACEI_free therapy (G 2). Patients were further stratified for the use <b>of</b> <b>MMF.</b> G 1 patients showed a marked decrease in proteinuria and stabilized serum creatinine with time. Five-year graft survival after CAN diagnosis was more frequent in G 1 (86. 9 vs 67. 7 %; P < 0. 05). In patients on ACEI-free therapy, the use <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> was associated with better graft survival. The use of ACEI therapy protected 79 % of the patients against graft loss (OR = 0. 079, 95 %CI = 0. 015 - 0. 426; P = 0. 003). ACEI and MMF or the use <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> alone after CAN diagnosis conferred protection against graft loss. This finding is well correlated with experimental studies in which ACEI and MMF interrupt the progression of chronic allograft dysfunction and injury. The use of ACEI alone or in combination with MMF significantly reduced proteinuria and stabilized serum creatinine, consequently improving renal allograft survival.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use <b>of</b> mycophenolate mofetil (<b>MMF)</b> is {{associated}} with less acute rejection than azathioprine (AZA) early after kidney transplantation. However, the long-term impact <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> versus AZA is less well studied. METHODS: The Tricontinental Mycophenolate Mofetil Renal Transplantation Study was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> versus AZA, together with cyclosporine and steroids, first reported in 1996. We analyzed the long-term outcomes of the Australian cohort of patients enrolled in this study using follow-up data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. Patient and graft survival, cancer incidence, and estimated kidney function were compared on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: A total of 133 Australian patients participated in the study: 45 were randomized to AZA, 44 were randomized to MMF 2 g/d, and 44 were randomized to MMF 3 g/d. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Median follow-up was 13. 8 years, during which there were 97 graft failures, 75 deaths, and 1 lost to follow-up. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between the groups in long-term patient or graft survival, cancer incidence, or kidney function. Death-censored graft survival was best in the group with 3 g/d MMF and worst in the group with 2 g/d MMF. By 5 years, 42 % <b>of</b> the <b>MMF</b> group had switched permanently to AZA, whereas crossover from AZA to MMF was rare. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term examination, although limited by small numbers, found little evidence for the superiority <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> over AZA. Philip A. Clayton, Stephen P.

40|$|Cyclosporine {{withdrawal}} and mycophenolate mofetil treatment {{effects on the}} progression of chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. BackgroundRecent clinical trials <b>of</b> mycophenolate mofetil (<b>MMF)</b> in chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) demonstrated that the dose of cyclosporine A (CsA) {{is one of the}} critical factors in determining graft function in CAN, but the effect <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> on chronic CsA nephropathy is undetermined. We undertook this study to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> on CsA-induced nephrotoxicity in an animal model of chronic CsA nephropathy. MethodsIn the first experiment, Sprague-Dawley rats on a low-salt diet were treated with CsA (7. 5 mg/kg per day) for 10 weeks, or were treated with CsA for five weeks and then MMF (20 mg/kg per day) was administered five weeks later. In the second experiment, rats were treated with CsA for five weeks, and CsA was then withdrawn for five weeks with or without MMF treatment. Renal function, histologic parameters (tubulointerstitial fibrosis, arteriolopathy, ED- 1 –positive cells, renin-positive glomeruli, TUNEL-positive cells) and the expression of osteopontin and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 mRNA expressions were compared for different treatment groups. ResultsCsA-treated rats showed decreased renal function and increased histologic parameters compared with the vehicle (VH) -treated rats. The addition <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> did not improve these parameters compared with the CsA-treated rats. With CsA withdrawal, renal function and histologic parameters were significantly improved compared with the CsA-treated rats, and MMF treatment after CsA withdrawal further improved the histologic parameters. At the molecular level, the addition <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> did not decrease the expression of osteopontin and transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) mRNAs, which were increased in the CsA-treated rat kidney. With CsA withdrawal, the expression of both mRNAs was significantly decreased compared with the CsA group, and a further decrease was observed with MMF treatment after CsA was withdrawn. ConclusionThe combined treatment <b>of</b> CsA and <b>MMF</b> does not prevent the development of chronic CsA nephrotoxicity, but MMF treatment after CsA withdrawal does improve chronic CsA nephrotoxicity. This finding provides a rationale for MMF treatment in chronic CsA nephrotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is used {{extensively}} for the induction therapy of lupus nephritis (LN) and has even outpaced intravenous (i. v.) cyclophosphamide (CyP) as the initial choice of therapy. There are no studies comparing the response <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> with standard dose i. v. CyP in Indian patients with LN. We conducted a 24 -week prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing oral MMF with monthly i. v. CyP as induction therapy for active biopsy proven Class III and IV LN. The primary end-point was response to treatment at 24 weeks, and the secondary end-points were complete remission, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores (SLEDAI) and adverse reactions. Of the 40 patients, 17 were randomized to the MMF group and 23 to the i. v. CyP group. Complete remission {{was seen in}} nine (52. 94 %) patients in the MMF group and 11 (47. 82 %) in the i. v.

At six months, the cumulative probability of response {{was not statistically significant}} between the two groups (P = 1. 000). MMF is comparable to i. v. CyP in the management of LN in Indian patients having an equal safety profile. The dose <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> required was lower than the conventional doses used in other studies suggesting genetic or environmental factors in the Indian population influencing the metabolism <b>of</b> <b>MMF,</b> which requires further evaluation. The cost <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> is a limiting factor in its use. The use of i. v. CyP is favorable as the monthly doses ensure compliance and is also cost-effective...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} agent mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) {{is being used}} since 1996 also in pediatric renal transplant recipients. There {{is no doubt that}} <b>MMF</b> is <b>of</b> clinical benefit in the initial posttransplant period in pediatric renal transplant recipients. Two multicenter trials have provided evidence that MMF at the daily dose of 1200 mg/m² body surface area given in two divided doses in conjunction with cyclosporin A (CsA) and prednisolone is superior to azathioprine in the pediatric renal transplant population. The tolerability <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> in children is in general acceptable; the most frequent side effects necessitating dosage reduction are diarrhea and/or nausea and leukopenia. Some arguments for giving MMF as a long-term maintenance {{immunosuppressive agent}} are based on what it does not do: it does not cause lipid or carbohydrate metabolism abnormalities or organ toxicity (e. g., hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, or neurotoxicity), it is not mutagenic, and it does not inhibit longitudinal growth. MMF is sufficiently powerful to allow a decrease of potentially nephrotoxic CsA in the stable phase posttransplant in children with chronic transplant nephropathy without the burden of acute rejection, and there is growing evidence for a steroid sparing potential <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> in this patient population. The therapeutic potential <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> may be optimized in the future by therapeutic drug monitoring. The estimation of mycophenolic acid (MPA) exposure in children is probably best achieved by use of an abbreviated area under the concentration curve. A large multicenter prospective randomized FDCC-study involving both adult and pediatric renal transplant recipients is currently investigating whether a concentration-controlled (CC) dosing <b>of</b> <b>MMF</b> is superior to a fixed dose (FD) regimen regarding efficacy and tolerability...|$|R
