50|$|An {{ampere hour}} or amp hour (symbol Ah; also denoted A·h or A h) is {{a unit of}} {{electric}} charge, having dimensions of <b>electric</b> current <b>multiplied</b> by time, equal to the charge transferred by a steady current of one ampere flowing for one hour, or 3600 coulombs. The commonly seen milliampere hour (mAh or mA·h) is one-thousandth of an ampere hour (3.6 coulombs).|$|R

5000|$|For a {{non-uniform}} electric field, {{the electric}} flux [...] {{through a small}} surface area [...] is given by(the <b>electric</b> field, , <b>multiplied</b> by the component of area perpendicular to the field). The electric flux over a surface [...] is therefore given by the surface integral:where [...] is the electric field and [...] is a differential area on the closed surface [...] with an outward facing surface normal defining its direction.|$|R
5000|$|Komar mass {{can also}} be defined by a flux integral. This {{is similar to the}} way that Gauss's law defines the charge {{enclosed}} by a surface as the normal <b>electric</b> force <b>multiplied</b> by the area. The flux integral used to define Komar mass is slightly different from that used to define the electric field, however - the normal force is not the actual force, but the [...] "force at infinity". See the main article for more detail.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{voltage on}} a single-turn loop inside an {{enclosure}} characterizes the enclosure shielding effectiveness against a lightning insult. In this paper, the maximum induced voltage on a single-turn loop inside an enclosure from lightning coupling to a metal enclosure wall {{is expressed in}} terms of two multiplicative factors: (A) the normalized enclosure wall peak penetration ratio (i. e., ratio of the peak interior <b>electric</b> field <b>multiplied</b> by the sheet conductance to the exterior magnetic field) and (B) the DC voltage on an ideal optimum coupling loop assuming the ideal penetration ratio of one. As a result of the decomposition, the variation of the peak penetration ratio (A) for different coupling mechanisms is found to be small; the difference in the maximum voltage hence arises from the DC voltage on the optimum coupling loop (B). Maximum voltages on an optimum coupling loop inside a finite cylinder enclosure for direct attachment and a lightning line source at different distances from the enclosure are given in Table 3. 1...|$|R
50|$|Bipolar {{electrochemistry}} is {{a phenomenon}} in electrochemistry based on the polarization of conducting objects in electric fields. Indeed, this polarization generates a potential {{difference between the two}} extremities of the substrate that is equal to the <b>electric</b> field value <b>multiplied</b> {{by the size of the}} object. If this potential difference is important enough, then redox reactions can be generated at the extremities of the object, oxidations will occur at one extremity coupled simultaneously to reductions at the other extremity. In a simple experimental setup consisting of a platinum wire in a weighing boat containing a pH indicator solution, a 30 V voltage across two electrodes will cause water reduction at one end of the wire (the cathode) and a pH increase (OH− formation) and water oxidation at the anodic end and a pH decrease. The poles of the bipolar electrode also align themselves with the applied electric field.|$|R
2500|$|Gas flow {{proportional}} counters {{are used}} mainly for detection of longer wavelengths. Gas flows through it continuously. Where {{there are multiple}} detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane ("P10"), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionised by incoming X-ray photons, and the <b>electric</b> field <b>multiplies</b> this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or nichrome of 20–60 μm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to {{the ratio of the}} detector chamber diameter to the wire diameter, a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector. The window needs to be conductive, thin enough to transmit the X-rays effectively, but thick and strong enough to minimize diffusion of the detector gas into the high vacuum of the monochromator chamber. Materials often used are beryllium metal, aluminised PET film and aluminised polypropylene. Ultra-thin windows (down to 1 μm) for use with low-penetration long wavelengths are very expensive. The pulses are sorted electronically by [...] "pulse height selection" [...] in order to isolate those pulses deriving from the secondary X-ray photons being counted.|$|R
40|$|We study extremal {{black hole}} {{solutions}} in D dimensions with near horizon geometry AdS 2 × S D− 2 in higher derivative gravity coupled to other scalar, vector and antisymmetric tensor fields. We define an entropy function by integrating the Lagrangian density over S D− 2 {{for a general}} AdS 2 ×S D− 2 background, taking the Legendre transform of the resulting function {{with respect to the}} parameters labelling the <b>electric</b> fields, and <b>multiplying</b> the result by a factor of 2 π. We show that the values of the scalar fields at the horizon as well as the sizes of AdS 2 and S D− 2 are determined by extremizing this entropy function with respect to the corresponding parameters, and the entropy of the black hole is given by the value of the entropy function at this extremum. Our analysis relies on the analysis of the equations of motion and does not directly make use of supersymmetry o...|$|R

Laidlaw, a teetotaler, {{made a point of}} buying the pub directly next door, The Grosvenor, and turning it into offices. As well as its roof top playground and tearooms Farmer was also noted for its high-rise parking building connected to the shop by an elevated sky way. Like many buildings from the 1920s onwards it had <b>electric</b> lifts which <b>multiplied</b> in number as the building grew in size. The store also boasted the first escalators in Auckland which were opened in 1955 by the Mayor of Auckland, Mr J H Luxford and Mrs Luxford. The Mayor cut the ribbon and the official party travelled up the escalators followed by a crowd of curious Aucklanders, along with the store's mascot Hector the parrot. The eight banks of escalators were the largest installation in the Southern Hemisphere. (New Zealand Film Archive ref F49681) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical {{study of the}} electro-rheological effects observed in the nematic phase of 4 -n-heptyl- 4 '-cyanobiphenyl has been conducted. This liquid crystal {{appears to be a}} model system, in which the observed rheological behaviour can be interpreted by the Leslie-Ericksen continuum theory for low molecular weight liquid crystals. Flow curves are illustrated at different temperatures and under the influence of an external electric field ranging from 0 to 3 kV mm- 1, applied perpendicular to the direction of flow. Also presented is the apparent viscosity as a function of temperature, over similar values of electric field, obtained at different shear rates. A master flow curve has been constructed for each temperature by dividing the shear rate by the square of the <b>electric</b> field and <b>multiplying</b> by the square of a reference value of electric field. In a log-log plot, two Newtonian plateaux are found to appear at low and high shear rates, connected by a shear-thinning region. We have applied the Leslie-Ericksen continuum theory, in which the director alignment angle {{is a function of the}} electric field and the flow field boundary conditions are neglected, to determine viscoelastic parameters and the dielectric anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to reveal the relations of physical factors to deposition of contaminants on insulator. In this paper, the simulation model of high voltage end of insulator was established to study the force and motion characteristics of particles affected by electric force and airflow drag force near the ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) insulator. By finite element method, the electric field was set specially {{to be similar to}} the one near practical insulator, the steady fluid field was simulated. The electric force and air drag force were loaded on the uniformly charged particles. The characteristics of the two forces on particles, the relationship between quantity of electric charge on particles and probability of particles contacting the insulator were analyzed. It was found that, near the sheds, airflow drag force on particles is significantly greater than electric force with less electric charge. As the charge <b>multiplies,</b> <b>electric</b> force increases linearly, airflow drag force grows more slowly. There is a trend that the magnitude of electric force and drag force is going to similar. Meanwhile, the probability of particles contacting the insulator is increased too. However, at a certain level of charge which has different value with different airflow velocity, the contact probability has extremum here. After exceeding the value, as the charge increasing, the contact probability decreases gradually...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} and theoretical {{study of the}} electrorheological (ER) effect observed in the nematic phase of the 4 -n-hepthyl- 4 '-cyanobiphenyl (K 21) is {{the aim of this}} work. The K 21 liquid crystal (LC) appears to be a model system where all the observed rheologial behaviours can be interpreted by the Leslie-Ericksen (L-E) continuum theory for low molecular weight liquid crystals. We present the flow curves of our sample for different temperatures and under the influence of an external electric field, ranging from 0 to 3 kV/mm, applied perpendicular to the flow direction. We also present the viscosity {{as a function of the}} temperature, for the same values of electric field, obtained for different shear rates. A master flow curve was built, dividing the shear rate by the square of the <b>electric</b> field and <b>multiplying</b> by the square of a reference electric field value, for each temperature, where two Newtonian plateaus appear at low and high shear rate values, connected by a shear-thinning region at intermediate shear rate values. Theoretical interpretation of the observed behaviours is proposed in the framework of the continuum theory. In this description the director alignment angle is a function of the electric field and the flow field - boundary conditions are neglected. In this way it was possible to extract some viscoelastic parameters, as well as the dielectric anisotropy. Comment: 19 pages, including 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{explains}} {{the design and}} production of two autonomous ultrawideband (UWB) radiation sources. These sources consist of a high-gain broadband antenna that is driven by one of two subnanosecond pulsed power sources. Each source {{is made up of}} a Marx generator and a pulse-forming device based on the use of a gaseous spark gap. The first source combines a four-stage 200 -kV/ 34 -J Marx generator with a coaxial pulse-forming line. Its main characteristics are an output voltage of 100 kV, a 250 -ps rise time, a subnanosecond pulse duration, and a repetition rate of about 40 Hz. The second pulsed source is a ten-stage subnanosecond Marx generator that delivers pulses in the 250 -kV/ 1. 5 -J range, with a 300 -ps rise time and a subnanosecond pulse duration at a pulse repetition rate of 350 Hz. Probes were produced based on capacitive line dividers to measure both the temporal characteristics and the high-voltage (HV) amplitude of the pulses delivered by the pulsed power sources. The antenna, combined with these two pulsed sources, is a traveling-wave antenna called the Valentine antenna. Some mechanical modifications were made to the antenna to improve its dielectric strength. First, a 3 -D model of the antenna was created on time-domain electromagnetic software to study the influence of these modifications on its main radiating characteristics. Its high gain and its capability to radiate short pulses without dispersion allow us to achieve a high measured figure of merit (the maximum value of far-field peak-to-peak <b>electric</b> field strength <b>multiplied</b> by the distance). A new method called the Instantaneous Electromagnetic Field Measurement by Signature of a Neutral Object (MICHELSON) method is used to measure the very intense electromagnetic fields that are radiated. The incident field is diffracted by a special small-dimension target. The diffracted field is measured by a conventional low-power UWB antenna. The target that is used has small dimensions, and no cables are used - - in the field region; thus, the electromagnetic interference that is generated and undergone by the measurement device is considerably limited. The figure of merit that is measured is 436 kV...|$|R
