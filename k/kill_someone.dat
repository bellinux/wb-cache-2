5|$|Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) {{talks to}} the others {{to try to get}} a sense of Shane's actions. He later speaks to Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) about Shane's erratic behavior, his {{suspicion}} that Shane had killed Otis to escape a walker horde, and his fear Shane may <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> else soon. As Beth's condition worsen, Lori asks Daryl (Norman Reedus) to drive into town to check on Rick, but Daryl refuses, saying his days of searching for someone are over. Lori opts to go alone, but en route, her car hits a walker and is overturned.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally <b>kill</b> <b>someone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Weevil (Francis Capra) organizes {{a meeting}} between Veronica and the PCHers, and the new leader says {{that they would not}} <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> over a bad car like the Coach's vehicle. Mason (Robert Ri'chard), one of the team's former star {{basketball}} players, testifies to Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) that Josh is responsible for his father’s death. The Sheriff arrests Josh, and Veronica learns that the Coach's car was found in the water. Logan and Heather begin to actually enjoy each other's company. Keith speaks to Mindy O'Dell (Jaime Ray Newman), stating that he will continue to search for Dean Cyrus O'Dell's killer. Veronica questions Mason, but he ends up angrily walking away. Veronica and Keith recuperate, and Keith says that Cyrus's car was taken out within the timeframe of the murder. Heather sends a radio request to play a special song from Logan to Veronica, while Veronica interrogates the hotel staff. One of them says that he heard two men yelling in the room. Veronica and Logan have a chance meeting in the elevator.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error went into {{banishment}}. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and <b>killed</b> <b>someone.</b> One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and <b>killed</b> <b>someone.</b> One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and <b>killed</b> <b>someone.</b> But one would not go into banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and <b>killed</b> <b>someone,</b> or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket <b>killed</b> <b>someone,</b> or while going up a ladder one fell down and <b>killed</b> <b>someone.</b> The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the person did not go into banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from the ax handle and <b>killed</b> <b>someone,</b> Rabbi taught that the person did not go into banishment, but the sages said that the person did go into banishment. If from the split log rebounding <b>killed</b> <b>someone,</b> Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the person did not go into banishment.|$|R

5|$|Later that evening, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss killing Jeff, with Joe (as {{a police}} officer), {{against the idea}} saying that Quagmire could be arrested for murder and it doesn't matter, while Quagmire says that it does and {{explains}} that people like Jeff never change. Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends.|$|E

25|$|On July 14, 2006, Augustine's husband, Chaz Higgs, {{attempted}} suicide by slitting his wrists in the couple's Las Vegas home. Higgs {{was arrested in}} Hampton, Virginia, on September 29, 2006, and charged with first degree murder in her death after an FBI toxicology test found a paralyzing drug, succinylcholine, in Augustine's system. Higgs, a critical care nurse, allegedly made suspicious remarks to a co-worker about how to <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> undetectably using succinylcholine. He was extradited back to Nevada. The warrant and test results were kept secret until Higgs's arrest.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{breakdown}} of relations between the NUM and the ISTC (Iron and Steel Trades Confederation), NUM pickets threw bricks, concrete and eggs full of paint at lorries transporting coal and iron ore to South Wales. In September 1984, Viv Brook, assistant chief constable of South Wales Police, warned that throwing concrete from motorway bridges was likely to <b>kill</b> <b>someone.</b> Taxi driver, David Wilkie, was killed on 30 November 1984 while driving a non-striking miner to Merthyr Vale Colliery, in South Wales. Two striking miners dropped a concrete post onto his car from a road bridge and he died at the scene. The miners served a prison sentence for manslaughter. Police reported that the incident had a sobering effect {{on many of the}} pickets and led to a decrease in aggression.|$|E

25|$|An {{engineer}} who {{is often seen}} hanging out with Wally. He is referenced by name more often in older comics, {{but he is still}} seen occasionally now. He has been accepted into Dilbert's clique. He has been fired and killed numerous times (for example, being pushed {{down a flight of stairs}} and becoming possessed), so it is likely that he is rehired and brought back to life in a similar way to the other main characters who die and come back. In addition to this, he is often promoted and given benefits over the other employees. Ted has a wife and kids who are referenced multiple times and seen on at least one occasion. Adams refers to him as Ted the Generic Guy because whenever he needs to fire or <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> he uses Ted, but slowly over time Ted has become his own character.|$|E
25|$|Although suicide {{was officially}} {{accepted}} {{as the cause}} of death, some medical experts have raised doubts, suggesting that the evidence does not support this. The most detailed objection was provided in a letter from three medical doctors published in The Guardian, reinforced by support from two other senior doctors in a later letter to the newspaper. These doctors argued that the post-mortem finding of a transected ulnar artery could not have caused a degree of blood loss that would <b>kill</b> <b>someone,</b> particularly when outside in the cold (where vasoconstriction would cause slow blood loss). Further, this conflicted with the minimal amount of blood found at the scene. They also contended that the amount of co-proxamol found was only about a third of what would normally be fatal. Dr Rouse, a British epidemiologist wrote to the British Medical Journal offering his opinion that the act of committing suicide by severing the wrist arteries is an extremely rare occurrence in a 59-year-old man with no previous psychiatric history. Nobody else died from that cause during the year.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Madhusudana Saraswati of Bengal {{organised}} {{a section}} of the Naga tradition of armed sannyasi in order to protect Hindus from the intolerant Mughal rulers. Although generally said to abide by the principle of non-violence (ahimsā), these Dashanami monks had long been forming akhara for the practice of both yoga and martial arts. Such warrior-ascetics have been recorded from 1500 to as late as the 18th century, although tradition attributes their creation to the 8th-century philosopher Sankaracharya. They began as a stratum of Rajput warriors who would gather after harvest and arm peasants into militarised units, effectively acting as a self-defense squad. Prevalent in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Bengal, they would give up their occupations and leave their families to live as mercenaries. Naga sadhu today rarely practice any form of fighting other than wrestling, but still carry trishula, swords, canes and spears. To this day their retreats are called chhauni or armed camps, and they have been known to hold mock jousts among themselves. As recently as the 1950s, it was not unusual for Naga sadhu to strike to <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> over issues of honour.|$|E

[...] "God Send Death" [...] and [...] "Deviance" [...] take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> if they really [...] "pissed him off", and decided he was unable to <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> he did not know just for power. He later admitted {{he was trying to get}} into that person's mind; [...] "why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it.

500|$|There has been, at times, {{speculation}} {{by historians}} {{and her brother}} Hugh as to whether her death was truly a suicide, as there were some suspicious circumstances.

500|$|The {{violence}} in the game drew the attention of U.S. Representative Joe Baca, who was the sponsor of a legislation to fine those who sell adult-themed games to players younger than 17. Baca said of Manhunt, [...] "it's telling kids how to <b>kill</b> <b>someone,</b> and it uses vicious, sadistic and cruel methods to kill". The media was also drawn into the debate. For example, The Globe and Mail wrote [...] "Manhunt is a venal disconnect for the genre. There's no challenge, just assembly-line, ritualistic slaughter. It's less a video game and more a weapon of personal destruction. This is about stacking bodies. Perhaps the scariest fact of all: Manhunt is so user-friendly that any sharp 12-year-old could navigate through the entire game in one sitting." ...|$|E

500|$|Libby {{is one of}} the few main {{characters}} not to have a centric episode detailing her life before the crash. The writers said a reason for killing the character was so they could explore her backstory in a mysterious and posthumous way. The producers intended to explore Libby's backstory through flashbacks in the show's third season, and later in the fourth season, although her character did not appear. Although she appeared in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", her backstory was not explored. In September 2008, the writers stated her backstory would probably be explored in the fifth season; however, Lindelof revealed in May 2009 her story would not be explored any further, saying, [...] "I have learned that if you <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> off the show, they are less likely to cooperate with you". The producers said Watros was busy with other commitments, and they could not reveal Libby's story without her.|$|E
500|$|... "Momentum Deferred" [...] {{was written}} by screenwriters Zack Stentz and Ashley Edward Miller. In the first several drafts of the episode, it was {{initially}} called [...] "This is the Night Mail," [...] {{which was based on}} a poem by W.H. Auden. The episode completed the [...] "gun arc" [...] storyline, which began with Olivia hurtling out of her SUV in the season premiere and being too weak to control her gun during her physical recovery, and ended with the killing of the shapeshifter posing as Charlie Francis. Miller and Stentz elaborated, [...] "I think it's Jeff Pinkner who described the first several episodes as the gun arc. Because really the gun played out until Olivia was whole again. Her actions with the gun in all of those episodes symbolized where she was on the journey. And it culminates in her being able to use it to <b>kill</b> <b>someone</b> who looks exactly like her best friend." ...|$|E

Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as [...] "wonderful as sots:...
