Although the Germans offered Spain surplus Leopard 1 tanks and Soviet equipment incorporated into the German army after the reunification of Germany, the Spanish government declined these offers and pressed for the Leopard 2.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, Perfect Dark Zero {{sold more}} than one million copies {{worldwide}} and received generally positive reviews from critics, garnering a score of 81 out of 100 at review aggregate website Metacritic. The game's numerous multiplayer modes singled out as strong features.

In 2015, the game was included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|By {{established}} practice, Byzantine emperors did {{not personally}} lead troops into battle. Heraclius ignored this convention and joined with his general Priscus' siege of the Persians at Caesarea. Priscus {{pretended to be}} ill, however, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> emperor. This was a veiled insult to Heraclius, who hid his dislike of Priscus and returned to Constantinople in 612. Meanwhile, Shahin's troops escaped Priscus' blockade and burned Caesarea, much to Heraclius' displeasure. Priscus was soon removed from command, along with others who served under Phocas. Philippicus, an old general of Maurice's, was appointed as commander-in-chief, but he proved himself incompetent against the Persians, avoiding engagements in battle. Heraclius then appointed himself commander along with his brother Theodore to finally solidify command of the army.|$|E

5|$|Federal {{agencies}} filed {{charges against}} the KD IIs owner, operator and captain. They further sought forfeiture of the fins under in rem jurisdiction, resulting in the unusual case title. Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz granted the order in 2005. The boat's owners appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed Moskowitz three years later. It held that the seizure was illegal for three reasons: the KD IIs activities <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> definition of a fishing vessel under the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Since it did not, under the SFPA, the fins {{could not have been}} lawfully seized on the high seas.

5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through that initiative, 3,800 inactive nurses received refresher courses and 4,800 graduated nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of 1942, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools but that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> country's need. At this point, {{it was clear that}} nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep abreast of both civilian and military needs. The need for additional federal aid for the recruitment of nurses became apparent when the U.S. Army and Navy called for 2,500 new nurses each month during the fiscal year 1943.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not invited}} to {{participate}} in the presidential debates because he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> criteria of 15% support in five polls set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2015, Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein filed a lawsuit against the commission, arguing that the commission and its rules violated antitrust law and the First Amendment. In August 2016, the lawsuit was dismissed. Johnson's poll numbers have been averaging between 7 and 9 percent. Johnson's campaign manager Ron Nielson argued for Johnson's inclusion, citing Ross Perot's admission to the debates in the 1992 debates, when Perot was polling at 8 percent.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1668, Don Juan de Urtarte (governor of the {{province}} from 9 June 1668 to 26 July 1669) wrote a memorandum to the King of Spain stating that Fort Santiago was unfit for defense because of its round shape and its mud and stone construction. Several years later, Governor Don Sancho Fernando de Angulo y Sandoval began—without authorization from the war council—construction of a new fortress with the rationale that the San Antonio de la Eminencia castle <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> city's defensive requirements, as it is located on a hilltop far {{from the city and}} the coast.

Twenty-five departments and agencies were approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works.

For much of that period, he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. This was a time of rapid naval reform, and he insisted that the ships of the United States Navy should be as capable as those of Great Britain and France, the foremost navies in the world at that time. He also wrote a bill, and guided it through Congress, that provided for compulsory retirement of officers who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> standards of the profession.|$|E
