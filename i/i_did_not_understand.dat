500|$|When it {{was time}} to sup, the dance ceased, and six and thirty persons sat down to two tables in the same room. [...] After supper the ladies sung Erse songs, to which I listened as an English {{audience}} to an Italian opera, delighted with the sound of words which <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|E
500|$|A new freshman, David Banks, wrote {{a letter}} to his mother about his {{experience}} in trying out for the football team in the fall of 1901:"I am not sure whether I ought to play football or not. ... I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. They made me run around the track a couple times to try my wind. Then they rolled me around the ground and sat on me a while. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the necessity of all they did to me, but the boys say every great player must begin that way." ...|$|E
500|$|As schools {{began to}} integrate, {{students}} and teachers noticed differences in the way Black students and White students signed. Carolyn McCaskill, now professor of ASL and Deaf Studies at Gallaudet University, recalls the challenge of understanding the dialect of ASL used by her White principal and teachers after her segregated school of her youth integrated: [...] "When I began attending the school, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the teacher {{and she did not}} understand me because we used different signs." [...] Carl Croneberg was the first to discuss differences between BASL and White ASL in his appendices of the 1965 version of the Dictionary of American Sign Language. Work has continued on BASL since then.|$|E

6000|$|... "There is no reason," [...] Rochester admitted. [...] "It {{is simply}} a matter of policy. Frankly, I mistrust you. There are points about your behaviour, ever since in a foolish moment I asked you to stay at Beauleys, which <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> Lord Guerdon's sudden {{recognition}} of you, and even suddener death. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> why it has amused you to fill the head of my young ward, Lois Champneyes, with foolish thoughts. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> why you should stand between my wife and the writers of a blackmailing letter. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> ask you for any explanation. I simply tell you that these things present themselves as enigmas to me. You have declared your position. I declare mine. What you will not tell me I shall make it my business to discover." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the video}} Voris {{admitted}} {{it may have}} been a mistake on his part not to have brought this information to the public earlier, but that he did not feel it necessary to provide all the details in order to proclaim the Gospel. [...] "I did not do it to deceive, but because <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the necessity. Now, I do," [...] he said. At the end of the video, he says, [...] "We will never cease to declare these truths, the glories of the Catholic faith, regardless of what happens. If this is all threatened because of revelations of my past sins, then please pray that the will of God be done. Thank you for your prayers, your support and your understanding, as well as the measure of forgiveness you are ready to extend." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Dunn, a {{spokesman}} for Dion, accused the Tories of making fun of the Liberal leader's hearing issues. Dion responded to Harper's comments, saying Harper had [...] "no class", saying [...] "I {{did not understand the}} question", and [...] "Maybe it's because I have a hearing problem, maybe because [...] my second language, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the question". Both the Conservatives and the CTV have come under criticism for their handling of the footage, but they have stated they stand by their actions. Duceppe has called Harper's comments a [...] "double standard", saying that many English-speaking politicians have little or no ability to speak French, yet francophones are somehow always expected to be perfect, and that the attack was an attempted [...] "low blow". [...] But Duceppe also took the opportunity to criticise Dion, suggesting he understood the question. [...] "The real question is that I think Dion understood the question. [...] The real problem wasn't the language, it was the substance," [...] Duceppe said, [...] "He had nothing to say". Layton also defended Dion, saying he has [...] "struggled with questions, too".|$|E
