40|$|Fighting is a {{fundamental}} determinant of male fitness in species where females prefer socially dominant males as mates or where dominants can prevent subordinates from mating. This in turn {{can lead to the}} evolution of honest inter- and intra-sexual cues of male dominance. Fighting as a behaviour comprises both <b>fighting</b> <b>rate</b> (number of fights per unit of time) and fighting performance (success in winning fights), but it is not always clear which of these components are important for female choice and how they link to signals of male quality. To quantify the relative importance of fighting as a cue for females, we recorded detailed behavioural data from male black grouse Tetrao tetrix at leks. We explored the relationship between phenotypic traits (body mass, eye comb size, tail (lyre) length and blue chroma colouration) and fighting performance and rates and how these were related to male mating success. In older males' pairwise fights, winners had lower blue chroma than losers, but there were no differences in other morphological traits. In yearlings, no morphological trait predicted success in pairwise contests. Both <b>fighting</b> <b>rate</b> and performance were positively related to the number of copulations acquired by a male; however, when controlled for lek centrality, fighting performance and not <b>fighting</b> <b>rate</b> was significantly related to mating success. Our results indicate that females may be using components of fighting behaviour as cues for mate choice...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that achromatic plumage {{can act as}} honest indicators of male quality. In some species with areas of white plumage, black melanin spots {{can be found on}} parts of the feathers. The functional significance of these spots and the relationship with male quality is yet poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between black melanin spots in an otherwise totally white ornament, the undertail covert, in relation to age, fitness and covariance with past and present expression of sexual traits, in the lekking black grouse Lyrurus tetrix. We found that spots at tips of feathers (tip spots) were negatively related to survival and reproductive success, and covaried negatively with current <b>fighting</b> <b>rate.</b> They also covaried positively with past <b>fighting</b> <b>rate,</b> suggesting high investment in fighting leads to carryover effects on male condition. In contrast, spots found further down the feather (vane spots) were unrelated to fitness and morphological and behavioural trait expression. Our results show that melanin spots can indicate some relationship with male quality and that the location of the spots has some importance in this relationship. However, the exact drivers of melanin spot expression and how these link to male quality, are currently unknown...|$|E
40|$|Females may use condition-dependent sexual traits as {{reliable}} cues of male "quality" if {{the costs of}} the expression of such traits vary with male "quality", and if there is positive genetic correlation between male traits and condition. However, there are multiple ways of measuring the changes in body condition which reflect physiological costs meaning that the multifaceted nature of the physiological costs associated with the expression of sexual traits has rarely been thoroughly examined. In the lekking black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), mating success is highly skewed towards males defending central territories and having high survival rates to the following year, but the mechanisms underpinning such superior performance remain unclear. In this study, we quantified the changes in five measures of body condition before and after the mating season and related these changes to male lek performance (<b>fighting</b> <b>rate,</b> territory centrality and mating success) to understand the physiological costs of male reproductive effort. Between the two capture sessions, male body mass decreased significantly, blood parasite counts and plasma carotenoid concentration increased substantially while the total immunoglobulin concentration tended to increase. There was no overall impairment of individual body condition as the changes in the five measures of body condition were unrelated. Male <b>fighting</b> <b>rate</b> was unrelated to changes in the condition measures but males losing more body mass defended central territories and had high mating success. Therefore, females preferring central, dominant males may select males better able to afford the energetic costs of lek performance thereby effectively enforcing the honesty of male display...|$|E

40|$|Theory on the {{sequential}} assessment model (SAM) {{has frequently}} been tested by using swimming crabs {{of the family}} Portunidae. Predictions {{on the effect of}} resource value and resource holding power were not met for all species and not even within a single species. They also were not tested simultaneously in a single study. Moreover, alternatives for SAM have been proposed and existing experimental tests fail to discriminate between them. Taken together, this calls for a reassessment of the assessment game in portunids. We staged fights between shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) because this portunid gave rise to the sharpest contrast with the sequential assessment theory. Pairs of shore crabs of different sizes were allowed to feed on mussels (Mytilus edulis) offered in different densities. We tested effects of mussel density, competitor size and absolute body size on contest duration, intensity of fighting, <b>fighting</b> <b>rate</b> (no. of displayed contests per min) and winning frequency. <b>Fighting</b> <b>rate</b> increased with increasing competitor size, and was not affected by mussel density and absolute body size. Winning frequency decreased with increasing competitor size and was not affected by mussel density. Contest duration increased when competitors were size- matched, independent of their absolute body size. Contest duration also increased with decreasing mussel density, suggesting that the value of a mussel item (resource value) increases with decreasing mussel density. Results were tested against predictions from different assessment games and were partly supportive of selfassessment and partly supportive of the mutual assessment game SAM. However, contrary to SAM, crabs engaged in pushing contests where they assessed resource holding power along a continuum, rather than in discrete sequential phases. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

Pairs of high-fighting animals then received saline or different chlorpromazine dosages during successive sessions. Finally, single high-fighting members of each pair also received the different drug dosages. The chief findings were that: (a) rats showing high fighting rates when matched against each other revealed low fighting rates when matched against one, but not the other member of a low-fighting pair; and (b) high-fighting rats decreased their fighting rates as their own or their opponent's chlorpromazine dosage increased.

The top three males accounted for between 60 and 90 % of copulations each year. Lek attendance time was the major determinant of male copulatory success, but territory location also affected the number of copulations achieved. Copulatory success was correlated {{with the number of}} females in a male's territory and possibly with dominance status, but not with fighting success or <b>fighting</b> <b>rate.</b> All males that defended lek territories were 5 years of age or older. Copulatory success may improve with age. Body condition appears to be an important determinant of male copulatory success, because only males in superior condition could defend a lek territory for up to 2 weeks.

40|$|The {{importance}} of a central territory position as a determinant of male mating success in lekking species has been debated The process by which a male can obtain a central territory has been especially lacking a quantitative analysis. We present a stochastic queuing model describing territory succession toward the lek center {{and apply it to}} a 8 -year sequence of territory centrality measures on a black grouse Tetrao tetrix lek. The lek shows a value of intermediate queue discipline, which deviates significantly both from strict orderly queuing and from random ranking of males. Thus, high-ranking males are partly able to maintain their superior position over years, but queue-jumping is not excluded, especially because highly successful males do not attempt to change their territory position toward the lek center. As a result of stochastic queuing, a central territory indicates an older than average male, as well as a male with a history of high <b>fighting</b> <b>rates.</b> These results are consistent with the hypotheses that territory position is an honest signal of male quality and that the long-term fighting effort and survival required to acquire a central territory may increase the reliability of die signal over that of short-term display effort The impartial queue discipline, however, also leaves room for other male characteristics {{to play a role in}} determining individual mating success.

40|$|The {{classical}} Holling type II functional response, {{describing the}} per capita predation as function of prey density, was modified by Beddington and DeAngelis to include interference of predators that increases with predator density and decreases the number of killed prey. In the present paper we further generalize the Beddington–DeAngelis functional response, considering that all predator activities (searching and handling prey, fight and recovery) have time duration, the probabilities of predator activities depend on the encounter probabilities, and hence on the prey and predator abundance, too. Under these conditions, {{the aim of the}} study is to introduce a functional response for fighting predator and analyse the corresponding dynamics, when predator-predator-prey encounters also occur. From this general approach, the Holling type functional responses can be also obtained as particular cases. In terms of the activity distribution, we give biologically interpretable sufficient conditions for stable coexistence. We consider two-individual (predator-prey) and three-individual (predator-predator-prey) encounters. In the three-individual encounter model there is a relatively higher <b>fighting</b> <b>rate</b> and a lower killing rate. Using numerical simulation, we surprisingly found that when the intrinsic prey growth rate and the conversion rate are small enough, the equilibrium predator abundance is higher in the three-individual encounter case. The above means that, when the equilibrium abundance of the predator is small, coexistence appears first in the three-individual encounter model. ...|$|E
40|$|Age {{at first}} {{reproduction}} {{is a crucial}} component of individual fitness as it often determines the length of reproductive lifespan. The reproductive success of males generally varies more than that of females, but {{it is challenging to}} study because the genetic data or proper surrogate measure needed to investigate reproductive success are usually not available. In black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), a lekking species with strong male mating skew and female preference for older males, there is a strong relationship between observed matings and genetic paternity. Using this relationship, we studied the effects of morphological, and behavioral traits on probability of being territorial, mating success, and survival of yearling males. Heavier yearling males {{were more likely to be}} territorial, and higher population density increased the frequency of yearling male territoriality. Mating success was positively related to population density, lek attendance, and <b>fighting</b> <b>rate,</b> but not to morphological traits. Overwinter survival did not differ between territorial and nonterritorial yearling males. Our results show that yearling male black grouse in good condition can establish territories and have some limited mating success, especially during increasing population density. In black grouse, the direct fitness benefits gained as yearlings undoubtedly contribute substantially to individual fitness, as the high reproductive skew means few males successfully copulate during their lifetime. For other species, early reproduction may relate to individual lifetime mating success but depends both on the direction and magnitude of the relationship between age-specific mating success and survival, and, as our results also demonstrate, on extrinsic factors such as population density. Key words: age at first reproduction, fitness, male–male competition, sexual selection, survival...|$|E

40|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the field}} cricket, Gryllus integer, was systematically observed in indoor arenas {{to determine the extent}} of female Choice and male-male competition at different sex ratios representing two male densities (12 : 6 and 6 : 6). The costs and benefits to males and females in those two densities were analyzed according to the theory of the evolution o£ leks. Observations were conducted during the dark hours when most calling occurred since hourly rates of courtship song and mating did not fluctuate significantly over a 24 h period. Female mating rates were not significantly different between densities, therefore males at high densities were not advantaged because of increased female tendencies to mate when social stimulation was increased. Mean rates of acoustical signalling (calling and courtin"g) did not differ significantly between densities. Mean <b>rates</b> of <b>fighting</b> by males at the high density were significantly greater than those of males at the low density. Mating benefits associated with callin~courting and fighting were measured. Mating rates did not vary with rates of calling at either density. Calling was not a prerequisite to mating. Courtship song preceded all matings. There was a significant power fit between male mating and courting rates, and male mating and <b>fighting</b> <b>rates</b> at the low, but not at the high, density. Density differences in the benefits associated with increased courting and fighting may relate, in part, to greater economic defensibility and monopoly of females due to reduced male competition at the low density. Dominant males may be preferentially chosen by females or better able to monopolize mating opportunities than subordinate males. Three criteria were used to determine whether dominant males were preferentially chosen by females. The number of matings by males who won fights (within 30 min of mating) was significantly greater than the number of matings by males who were defeated in such fights. Mating rates did not vary significantly with rates of winning at either density. There was a significant power fit between male mating rates and the percentage of fights a male won (irrespective of his fighting-frequency) at the low density. The mean duration a male guarded the female after mating did not vary significantly between densities. There was a significant linear relationship between the duration a spermatophore was retained and the duration a male guarded the female after mating. Courtship song apparently stimulated spermatophore removal. Male guarding involved inter-male aggression and reduced courtship attempts by other males. Males at the high density received no apparent reproductive benefits associated with increased social stimulation. Conclusive evidence for preferential choice of males by females, using the criteria examined here, is lacking. Males at the lower density had fewer competitors and could monopolize females more effectively...|$|R

40|$|Consumers are {{increasingly}} concerned and confused about utility rate regulation. Increases in electric power rates, {{the breakup of}} AT&T, and so on, {{have given rise to}} a new wave of political activity by consumers and, subsequently, their political leaders. Indeed, this previously mundane matter of utility rate regulation has moved into the political limelight, for better or worse. Although there is currently much discussion about <b>fighting</b> utility <b>rate</b> increases, the key consumer issue revolves around the ability of utilities to provide efficient (low-cost) service over the long-run. This paper shall briefly review some of the issues regarding electric power rates and the AT&T divestiture in light of the long-run interest of con sumers; particular attention will be given to Illinois. THE CONSUMER'S INTEREST In a competitive market, prices tend to reflect the marginal cost of production. This implies that consumer well-being is maximized since the last dollar that consumers are willing to spend on a product equals the last dollar producers expend in producing the product. Thus, the demands of consumers are met by producers at the most economical cost (and price). In a monopolistic market, prices may exceed marginal cost. Thus, producers may earn above-normal profits and consumers pay a price above production costs. For this reason, monopolies such as the OPEC oil cartel are adverse to the well-being of consumers. In the case of utilities, prices are regulated by the government. It is in the consumer's interest that the regulated utility price reflects the marginal cost of production as in a competitive market. If utility rates are above the incremental cost of production, they will not reflect con sumer demands. Thus, {{as in the case of}} a monopoly, the utility will earn excess profits and consumer well-being will be reduced. The well-being of consumers will also not be served by rates that are below costs. In this case, shortages will eventually occur because an adequate incentive is not provided to meet consumer demands. Although efficient prices (based on marginal production costs...|$|R

Interspecies comparisons with 7 other fossorial and semi-fossorial rodent species, and with beavers, which expose their incisors to enormous mechanical pressure, revealed that this palatal perforation is unique to the male mole-rat. We suggest that while the fast eruption rate of incisors in the mole-rat compensates for the rapid wear resulting from digging, evolutionary adaptation to continuous tooth-digging is still ongoing, since the physical pressure of digging at the apical sites of the upper incisors leads to tissue destruction, breakage of the palatal bone and possibly to death, as a result of maxillary inflammation...|$|R
