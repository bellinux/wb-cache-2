500|$|The {{treatment}} of the upper floors provides a striking contrast. 134,000 green, orange, lime and yellow glazed terracotta tiles cover the façades in 13 irregularly oriented vertical panels on the external perimeter. The façades facing the inner courtyard are lined with another eight panels covered with grey tiles, a design which project architect Maurits van der Staay says was intended to [...] "ensure that the upper storeys did not detract from the transparency of the ground floor and to maximise the amount of light reflected back into the offices." [...] The façades are hung on an internal chassis carrier system (a similar system is in use in another Piano development on Berlin's Potsdamer Platz). Pierced by rows of identical windows repeated across the entire development, the façades {{are expected to be}} effectively self-cleaning and immune to fading. The colours of the façades are evoked in the design of many of the development's interior fittings, such as lift-door reveals, handrails and lift displays.

40|$|With {{mandatory}} {{implementation of}} the ISO 9000 quality system by the Housing Authority in Hong Kong, most construction firms there now claim to have initiated quality systems in their processes as defined in their quality manuals. In addition, an objective quality measuring yardstick, the Performance Assessment Scoring Scheme (PASS), has been administered by the Housing Authority of Hong Kong to monitor the performance quality of contractors. These two measures, coupled with the two other contractual requirements stipulating the use of mechanized formwork and precast <b>facade</b> <b>units,</b> are directed towards achievement of a desired quality standard. However, the PASS analysis has revealed that the general level of quality has not improved significantly and the expected continuous improvement in construction quality {{has not been realized}} over a specific time period. Quality appears far better on paper than does the actual work on site. This suggests that quality management in the construction setting is far more difficult to achieve than it is in other industries. This paper explores possible reasons for failure in the quest for quality in public housing construction, and proposes changes needed before the vision of continuous quality improvement can be realized.

Building façade is the first layer exposed to external loading, thus it acts as the first line of defence against external loads. Precast concrete panels are mostly used in external building 2 ̆ 7 s façade for modern construction, and therefore their resistance to other dynamic loads such as impact load needs further evaluation. This paper presents the results of an experimental research on two-way reinforced concrete panels as well as thin ferrocement concrete panels under impact loading. The impact test apparatus used is versatile enough to test large variety of specimens modeling <b>façade</b> <b>units.</b> The performance of the panels under impact load is evaluated in terms of: the failure mode; the maximum impact loads sustained by the panels; the number of impact loads up to failure; the maximum load transmitted to the supporting frame; and the strain induced in the panels. The effect of the different design parameters including the reinforcement amount, spacing and location across the panel thickness on the dynamic response of the panel to impact load are considered. Results clearly showed the significant effect of reinforcement on the overall resistance to impact loading. This research outcomes provide {{a better understanding of the}} performance of concrete panels under impact loading that can help enhancing structural design under such loads...|$|R

The cooling energy demand of low-energy buildings with a high-quality building envelope is rather affected by solar and internal heat gains and the ventilation than by the heat transmission through the building envelope.

However, the higher air temperature in the boundary layer at the facade may increase the cooling load in buildings with window opening or <b>facade</b> integrated air-handling <b>units.</b> Neither monthly energy calculation programs nor building simulation programs use different temperatures for the ambient air to calculate the heat transfer through the facade and for the boundary layer to calculate the heat flux by ventilation.

40|$|High-rise {{residential}} {{tower is}} an inevitable and prevalent building type in high-density {{areas such as}} China. Because of the large population such buildings accommodate, {{improving the quality of}} people's lives in these towers has significant meaning. One of the important problems in such environments is the loss of identity of individual homes. This occurs because living spaces cannot fit individual families' unique and changing physical and spiritual needs. People can identify their lives and express their individual values in their homes in only the most meager ways. Consequently, people and their communities suffer deeply for the loss of identity of individual homes. The first focus of this thesis is to bring the question of individual control into light with the issue of identity of individual homes. Identity of any built environment results from the interplay of both shared values and individual values. In an identifiable and accommodating environment, both value sets should be in balance, over time. In high-rise residential towers, individual values are hardly presented {{because of the lack of}} individual control. So the radical way to establish identity of individual homes is to enable individual control in the building process. The second focus of this thesis is a study in architectural design of the distribution of control in such high-rise environments. Two kinds of individual controls are assumed and distributed: the control of the dwelling layouts and the control of dwelling <b>unit</b> <b>facades.</b> To enable these tow configurations of parts to be subject to individual control, propositions for setting up a new balance between centrally controlled parts and individually controlled parts in high-rise residential towers are put forward. To demonstrate these propositions, a specific high-rise residential tower in Beijing is redesigned to the solution of technical problems, regulatory issues and conventions when control is distributed. Individual control of both the dwelling layouts and the facades are simulated in a methodical way. Finally, notes about supportive products and management techniques, broader developments in other types of high-rise buildings, and the cultivation of shared values out of individual values are offered.

40|$|Two {{thirds of}} all office {{real estate in}} Europe is older than 30 years. While the load bearing {{structure}} of a building can last for a century, the interior design is renovated at relatively short intervals. Practice has shown, however, that {{at the age of}} twenty to thirty years the facades and climate installations of a building do no longer fulfil today’s demands. They are out-of-date on technical, optical and comfort matters. Particularly these building components hold the potential to improve the energy performance of a building significantly. The façade of a building is also responsible for its exterior appearance and thus the public perception of it owner, {{as well as for the}} interior climate and the well-being of the occupant. Consequently, more and more office buildings come into consideration for refurbishment. However, currently the building economy is lacking innovative refurbishment strategies for office facades. On the one hand, most of the current renovation projects tend to substantially refurbish a building, which causes major interference with the building’s interior and the load bearing structure, and consequently a major investment. On the other hand, only little is known about the various façade types, which have been built in different eras. This leads to certain reluctance in initiating a refurbishment project. The market is obviously lacking an overview of practical refurbishment strategies and their applicability to different existing façade typologies. The present thesis intends to fill this gap of knowledge. After an introduction (chapter 1) and overview of the ‘state of the art’ of façade refurbishment (chapter 2), this research project is set up in four steps. In the first place, chapter 3 evaluates the existing stock of office facades in Western Europe. It defines the typical office facades and sorts them into 22 categories, which are characterised by structural features and similar refurbishment challenges. With this typology at hand, the distribution of these office facades is evaluated in different locations in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and in Germany. The local market analysis shows that the three countries, although being in the same climate zone, have developed very different office façades. Thus, an overview is created, which estimates the amount of facades of one typology for certain locations and eras. The common refurbishment tasks become evident. The following step (chapter 4) elaborates the demands and restrictions of façade refurbishment planning. In order to compare different concepts for one given building with each other, this chapter also evaluates existing assessment methods and generates appropriate tools for the special task of refurbishment. These tools compare the quantifiable features energy consumption and life-cycle-cost, as well as quality aspects such as the construction process and the interference with the function of an office, and possible improvement of indoor comfort. For these ‘soft skills’ an evaluation tool is developed, which facilitates the comparative rating and graphical visualisation. Chapter 5 takes in the central part of the research and intensively assessing five case studies that can stand representative for the most common façade types. Among these cases there are office buildings in the Netherlands and Germany, as well as the campus of Bielefeld University. In these studies, the typical problems of each façade typology come to light. For each case, different refurbishment concepts are developed and evaluated in order to define the most promising solution. These concepts look at the building in general and at the façade construction in detail. Furthermore, two product developments are part of this research, which propose solutions for the most common façade types. For the typical post-and-beam façade, an adapter profile has been developed, which permits upgrading existing façades of different manufacturers with new standardised products. It brings the façade to an up-to-date insulation level without alteration of connections to dividing walls and interior finishings. The second product development looks at the typical load bearing <b>facades</b> with window <b>units.</b> The concept proposes to replace the windows and renew the building services within the façade. By combining these features in new façade components it is possible to renew the building envelope and installations entirely from the outside with minimal disturbance of the interior. The system is highly modular, which allows future adaptations. In the fourth step (chapter 6) the results of the case studies and further assessed best-practice examples are combined. This thesis thus gives an overview of the common existing façade types and their typical challenges. The possible refurbishment strategies are evaluated in terms of architecture, function, comfort, investment, material consumption, and energy saving potential. It is possible to choose those refurbishment strategies that are most promising for the various refurbishment tasks. This analysis results in a matrix, which presents the features of each refurbishment concept and relates the concepts to the different existing types of façades. Thus, it will be of use for architects and specialist consultants in the early planning stage to clarify the building task and to identify the first refurbishment concepts. This work is also intended to provide decision makers, such as owners and investors with the necessary background knowledge of the topic. The façade industry can gain insight into the market for office refurbishment and can find inspiration for future product developments. With these goals in mind, this thesis aims to structure the complex task of façade refurbishment and visualise its possibilities. Thus, it wants to motivate real estate stake holders to step into the planning and initiate more buildings to be refurbished. The presented refurbishment strategies permit reducing the energy consumption of an existing building, while the life-cycle costs are reduced. At the same time, they give the chance to improve the comfort of the inhabitants and the quality of the urban environment. In this sense, the refurbishment of office façades takes its share in improving the sustainability of the building stock. Building TechnologyArchitectur...|$|R
