The decision was taken by majority vote, with the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia voting against and Finland abstaining.

Each participating government can select from the referrals and refugees themselves cannot choose their country of resettlement. Even though receiving countries should not select refugees according to their own criteria, it may be that societal and political desires influence which groups of refugees are received. Countries make their decisions based on either just a dossier or following an interview with the refugee.|$|E

From 1997 - 2006, the State of New of Hampshire received 4063 refugees from more than 30 countries and they represent a diverse group of ethnic minorities. It is estimated that 1512 (37 %) refugees were received from African nations and out which, the city of Concord received 366 refugees as the estimated target group for this project. Under the RSA 112, refugees are resettled to New Hampshire by the United States Department through Immigration and Naturalization Services and the voluntary agencies. The preliminary process of resettlement begins at the United Nations High Commission for refugees, located in the <b>first</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum.</b> The African refugees in the city of Concord continue to experience socio-economic hardships while struggling to adjust into their new home. Lack of immediate intervention, has lead to high incidence of unemployment among these refugees. The project has used variety of studies and applications to collect both primary and secondary data. The project conducted survey/ questionnaire, one- on meeting, group discussion, interview and the review of documents. The project provided essential inputs and partnership had enabled the target community accessed affordable childcare and Driver's license and other basic life skills. The project had further improved participants' Employable skills and the knowledge of English language/proficiency. The project has bridged the cultural gap and improved participants' of American life style. The prospect of attaining stable income and employment will depend largely on competency enhancement and total skills improvement of the African refugees. (Author abstract) Mbata-Aboro, P. R. (2008).

40|$|Peter Browne {{describes}} {{the genesis of}} his book The Longest Journey: Resettling Refugees from Africa, published by UNSW Press, which looks at the evolution of Australia’s refugee resettlement program and the obstacles faced by refugees in Africa IN THE EARLY 1990 s, while {{people in the west}} were debating whether the fall of the Berlin Wall represented, in Francis Fukuyama’s notorious phrase, “the end of history,” many of the countries in the north-east of sub-Saharan Africa were at war or on the verge of conflict. During those years violence continued, intensified or broke out in Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. In the midst of these countries Kenya, with its long, unpatrolled borders and relatively stable government, was a sanctuary. Between 1990 and 1992 the country’s refugee population grew from fewer than 15, 000 to over 400, 000, stabilising at around {{a quarter of a million}} - the number estimated to be living there still in late 2005. Among the people who fled to Kenya during those years were a Rwandan woman and her two sons. The woman (her name was never revealed in the coverage of the case) was a close relative of the former Rwandan president, Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu politician whose death was the pretext for the genocidal violence in 1994. Two (or three, according to some reports) of her children had been killed in Rwanda, and she had escaped to Uganda with the two younger boys in 2000. When it was clear they were not safe there, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, transferred the family to Nairobi. By early 2002 they were living in a refugee accommodation centre and waiting for a final decision on their application to resettle in Australia. Early one morning in April 2002 the three were attacked as they slept. The boys were killed and their mother badly injured. According to a short report in the Melbourne Age, the family had been scheduled for a medical check the following day as a final step in preparing to leave Kenya. Despite the urgency of their case - Human Rights Watch reported that the family had been attacked before - they had waited over a year for the resettlement process to reach this point. Although the first report in the Kenyan Daily Nation described the attack as a “fight,” the evidence that emerged over the next few days suggests that the sleeping children were sedated and then stabbed. Their mother said that she was woken by two attackers who held her down while they stabbed her repeatedly. Police from the nearby Kilimani station reported no evidence of a break-in; a kitchen knife from the centre, believed to have been used in the attack, was found two days later. Acting on the assumption that the attackers were among the other 180 or more people housed at the centre, the police eventually arrested two men who claimed to be deserters from the Rwandan army. In Canberra, an unnamed official denied that Australia had dragged its feet in dealing with the woman’s request for resettlement. Australia, he added, was one of “only a handful of countries” resettling refugees from that region. According to Human Rights Watch, the case highlighted “the current failure of the UNHCR in Nairobi to provide speedy resettlement for refugees whose lives are at risk. ” Over the previous two years the federal government’s policies towards refugees and asylum seekers had developed into the most contentious issue in Australian politics. The immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, had repeatedly argued that asylum seekers arriving by boat were queue jumpers, taking places from the needier refugees waiting patiently in camps or lined up outside local offices of the UNHCR. Yet here, just a few kilometres from the UNHCR’s Nairobi office and not far from the Australian High Commission, was a compelling example of how the official route by which refugees can settle in Australia is far from orderly, or even safe. So it was surprising that the Age was the only Australian newspaper to report the incident in any detail. The coverage of the attack also highlighted another important fact. For many years Australia has been one of only ten countries accepting refugees through the UNHCR’s resettlement program. (Those ten - the United States, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Ireland and New Zealand - have recently been joined by another group of countries offering smaller quotas.) Judged by the size of its population, Australia now takes more refugees through the program than any other country. The origins of the attack lay in the history and circumstances of an influential and high-profile Rwandan family. But it seemed to me that the details of the case might help to illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of the resettlement process itself. So, with an advance from the magazine Eureka Street to help cover costs, I flew to Kenya in mid 2002 to find out more about the attack and get an idea of what life was like for refugees waiting in Philip Ruddock’s “queue. ” A year later, again writing for Eureka Street, I visited the Kakuma refugee camp in north-western Kenya, near the border with Sudan and talked to UNHCR staff there and at the organisation’s headquarters in Geneva, and another year later I made a third trip to Nairobi. When I first arrived in the Kenyan capital the UNHCR office was still recovering from a UN investigation that had uncovered extensive corruption. Thousands of resettlement case files had been tainted and needed to be reassessed, adding to the backlog of applications. Meanwhile, thousands of refugees were living in Nairobi in dire circumstances, treated as criminals by the Kenyan government and harassed by police. And another 200, 000 or more refugees - mainly Somalis and Sudanese - were living in two large camps in remote, arid areas. Although it wasn’t clear at the time, Kenya itself was living through the dying days of the increasingly corrupt and inept government of Daniel arap Moi. The head of refugee protection at the UNHCR’s Nairobi office, Sergio Calle-Noreña, was treating the murder of the two children very seriously. He had visited their mother in hospital early on the morning after the attack to try to find out what had happened, and described in great detail the speculation about how and why the attack had taken place. He told me that although the family was classified as an urgent case, the UNHCR hadn’t realised they faced any immediate danger. “You must remember,” he said, “that the wife and daughter of President Habyarimana are moving around in the streets of Belgium with no problems. ” But he conceded that the family had been attacked more than once when they lived in Uganda. In Nairobi the family had been living in a centre run by Goal, an Irish aid agency. Under an agreement with the UNHCR, no one at Goal would talk to me about the case, but later I was told that staff there felt that the UNHCR had not made it clear the family was potentially in danger. This failure on the part of the UNHCR could well have been a symptom of the pressure the office had been under following the corruption inquiry. No one I spoke to questioned Calle-Noreña’s competence or his dedication to the job; one aid worker described him as among “the best” of the UNHCR people she’d met during a long career working in the field. Nor did anyone I spoke to in Nairobi blame the Australian authorities for the delays in processing the family. A few days after the attack the woman was shifted to a convent, where she was looked after while the police investigation proceeded. She was now classified as an emergency case, and her approval for travel came through quickly from the Australian High Commission. She left Kenya for Australia at around the same time that the police, lacking evidence, released the two Rwandan suspects from custody. Apart from Calle-Noreña, the local Agence France Presse correspondent and, off the record, an aid agency employee, no one was willing to talk about the case, so it was difficult to sort out exactly what went wrong. But it became clear to me that significant barriers stood in the way of many of the refugees for whom resettlement was the best option. Some were the result of the policies of the UNHCR and resettlement countries, others were created by host countries - in this case, Kenya - and others reflected the circumstances facing refugees almost anywhere. Taken together, these obstacles meant that some of the most vulnerable refugees faced almost impossible odds in seeking to settle in countries like Australia, Canada and the United States. Off the record, UNHCR staff described to me how the largest resettlement countries, including Australia, accepted refugees selectively, favouring certain nationalities over others - the mainly Christian Sudanese over the mainly Muslim Somalis, for example - on the basis of their assumed capacity to integrate into their new home country. Women were generally experiencing greater difficulty than men in gaining access to resettlement countries, and refugees with medical conditions could face enormous odds. At the time, the humanitarian intake of each of these countries was still skewed heavily against Africa, despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of refugees were living in long-term refugee camps dotted across the continent, with little prospect of a return home. As much as anything, the character of Australia’s resettlement program reflected the fact that Australia’s immigration policies - like those of the United States, Canada and New Zealand but unlike most European countries - have mainly served economic goals, filling gaps in the labour market and generating domestic demand. Although the humanitarian program drew from a different pool of potential immigrants, it tended to reflect the same pragmatic imperatives as the wider immigration program. Yet Philip Ruddock was arguing that his government’s hostile response to unauthorised arrivals was justified because Australia was helping the neediest refugees through the resettlement program. In its failure to translate rhetoric into reality, Australia was not alone. Writing in 2002 the academic researchers Matthew Gibney and Randall Hansen described the US, Canadian and Australian resettlement programs as “a kind of adjunct to skilled migration schemes,” granting admission to “pre-screened refugees from first countries of asylum. ” When I began gathering material for this book the evidence tended to support that view, or at least the view that these three countries selected the most employable, assimilable refugees regardless of how vulnerable they were in their <b>first</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum.</b> But the declining number of refugees seeking resettlement from south-eastern Europe (particularly the former Yugoslavia) was helping to stimulate a reappraisal. Over a relatively short period the focus of the Australian program shifted significantly, better reflecting the international distribution of vulnerable refugees who had little prospect of repatriation or making a life in a neighbouring country. The program still has its limitations, and it has been used, illogically, by immigration ministers Philip Ruddock and Amanda Vanstone to help justify Australia’s inhumane and legally dubious policies of naval interdiction, mandatory detention and deportation of asylum seekers. But it deserves to be recognised as a contribution to dealing with the large, entrenched concentrations of refugees in countries like Kenya that are poorly equipped to offer security, shelter and food. *** TWO and a half years after I first travelled to East Africa, the Sudanese government signed a peace agreement with the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, ending over twenty years of renewed war between north and south. At war for much of the period since the late 1950 s, Sudan had contributed enormously to the refugee crisis in north-eastern Africa. In January 2005, thousands of Sudanese refugees and exiles cheered and sang in Nairobi as twelve African heads of state, two European ministers and the US secretary of state watched the vice-president of Sudan and the chair of the southern movement sign the accord. Celebrations took place in Melbourne as well, involving about 200 of what ABC News called “the estimated two to three thousand Australian-based Sudanese. ” The ABC’s figure was wrong: by the beginning of 2005 over 14, 000 Sudanese had arrived in Australia, almost all of them as refugees or humanitarian applicants who had fled to Kenya. Nearly three-quarters of them had arrived since mid 2002. The geographic focus of Australia’s resettlement program had changed dramatically in less than three years. • Peter Browne is editor of APO.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} persons recognised {{as refugees}} {{based on the}} criteria set by Article 1 A(2) of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (CSR 1951) and residing in a Contracting State. It appraises the exclusion of CSR 1951 refugees from participation in elections <b>of</b> their <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> pursuant to a citizenship voting qualification, which most countries set. It is emphasised that, since neither the CSR 1951 refugees nor their <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> know when or indeed whether cessation of CSR 1951 refugee status may occur, their exclusion may last for an indeterminate period of time. CSR 1951 confers on recognised refugees a host of civil, social and economic rights in their <b>country</b> <b>of</b> asylum; voting rights are absent. Concomitantly, while the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (and regional human rights treaties) pronounce that all persons are entitled to have their rights respected, protected and promoted, Contracting States are permitted to reserve two rights for their (full) members: the right to enter and remain in their country, {{and the right to}} vote in its elections. The central claim of this thesis is that recognised CSR 1951 refugees are a special category of non-citizen residents, due to their unique political predicament. They are unable to participate in elections <b>of</b> their <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin, do not enjoy its diplomatic protection and consular assistance abroad, and – most fundamentally – are unable or unwilling, owing to a well-founded fear of persecution, to return to it for an indeterminate (and potentially protracted) period. It is submitted that recognised CSR 1951 refugees should be entitled to vote in elections <b>of</b> their <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum,</b> notwithstanding general citizenship qualifications imposed by these countries. At present, treaty law does not require <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> to enfranchise their recognised CSR 1951 refugees. Hence, this thesis explores a gap in international refugee law and international human rights law between de lege lata and de lege ferenda; it is an exercise in ‘progressive development of the law’. Its inquiry is located in the international domain, and concerns, in principle, any Contracting State which admits and recognises CSR 1951 refugees.
