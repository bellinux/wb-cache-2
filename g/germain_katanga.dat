5000|$|The Bogoro {{massacre}} {{resulted in}} approximately 200 villagers being killed, and many women being raped and forced into sexual slavery.Katanga was originally charged as an [...] "indirect co-perpetrator" [...] for the crimes {{related to the}} Bogoro massacre but was only convicted of being an accessory to these crimes. This change in the charge {{was made by the}} Court during the trial. Judge Christine van den Wyngaert, in her dissenting opinion, said that it [...] "has rendered this trial unfair by infringing a series of <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga's</b> rights".The court acquitted Katanga of directing rapes and the use of child soldiers during the massacre, citing insufficient evidence to connect Katanga to these crimes, {{while at the same time}} emphasizing that these crimes did occur. The court cited evidence that Katanga supplied guns to the militia that carried out the Bogoro massacre, thus [...] "reinforcing the strike capability of the militia" [...] in justifying the convictions of Katanga as an accessory, but indicated that the evidence presented during the trial was insufficient to sustain the original charge that he directed the massacre.|$|R
50|$|The {{prosecution}} of the five suspects are separated into four cases; <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui are being tried together {{and the other three}} suspects are being tried individually. The trial of Bosco Ntaganda started in September 2015. At this moment, Sylvestre Mudacumura was still not arrested.|$|E
50|$|In March 2009, judges chose Kuenyehia {{as well as}} Anita Ušacka of Latvia for appeals positions. Three months later, both of {{them had}} to step down from an appeal in the case of <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity, because they had {{previously}} issued his arrest warrant.|$|E
50|$|Initially led by <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga,</b> FRPI {{leadership}} switched in 2005 to Baudouin Adirodo. Katanga {{was arrested}} and flown to the International Criminal Court at The Hague in October 2007 to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, {{including the use of}} child soldiers and promotion of sexual slavery. He was found guilty in March 2014.|$|E
50|$|On March 7, 2014, by a 2-to-1 decision, the ICC convicted <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> on five {{counts of}} war crimes and crimes against humanity, as an {{accessory}} in the February 2003 massacre {{in the village of}} Bogoro in the DRC. The verdict was {{only the second time in}} the 12-year history of the International Criminal Court that an ICC trial resulted in a conviction.|$|E
50|$|The ICC has {{jurisdiction}} to prosecute {{individuals who are}} accused of committing crimes defined under the Rome Statute (the treaty that established the Court) as either war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide. The Prosecutor has charged six people with committing crimes within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Court in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, Bosco Ntaganda, Callixte Mbarushimana, and Sylvestre Mudacumura.|$|E
50|$|<b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga,</b> {{the former}} {{leader of the}} FRPI, was {{surrendered}} on 17 October 2007 by the Congolese authorities to the International Criminal Court. On 7 March 2014 Katanga was convicted by the ICC on five counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as an accessory to the February 2003 massacre {{in the village of}} Bogoro. The verdict was the second-ever conviction for the International Criminal Court, following the conviction of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> {{former leader}} of the Front for Patriotic Resistance of Ituri (FRPI), and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui were indicted on seven counts of war crimes, and three counts of crimes against {{humanity}} in 2008, which included the use of children under 15 years of age being used in combat, by the pre trial chamber of the ICC. Katanga was convicted of having taken part in the Bogoro massacre on 24 February 2003. He was cleared of sexual offenses {{and the use of}} child soldiers.|$|E
50|$|On 17 March 2006, Lubanga {{became the}} first person ever arrested under an ICC arrest warrant, when the Congolese {{authorities}} arrested him and transferred him into ICC custody. He was flown to the Hague, {{where he has been}} held in the ICC detention centre since 17 March 2006. Before embarking the plane, Lubanga wept openly. As of January 2009, he is one of four people being detained by the ICC, including two rebels who fought against Lubanga in the Ituri conflict: <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui. His trial opened on 26 January 2009.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> ( [...] ; born 28 April 1978), {{also known}} as Simba (...) , is a former leader of the Patriotic Resistance Force in Ituri (FRPI), an armed group in the Ituri Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). [...] On 17 October 2007, the Congolese {{authorities}} surrendered him to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to stand trial on six counts of war crimes and three counts of crimes against humanity. [...] The charges include murder, sexual slavery, rape, destruction of property, pillaging, willfull killing, and directing crimes against civilians, to name a few.|$|E
50|$|Two more {{participants}} in the Ituri conflict, <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, were also surrendered to the Court by the Congolese authorities. Both men are charged with six counts of war crimes and three counts of crimes against humanity, relating to {{an attack on the}} village of Bogoro on 24 February 2003 in which at least 200 civilians were killed, survivors were imprisoned in a room filled with corpses, and women and girls were sexually enslaved. The charges against both men include murder, sexual slavery and using children under 15 years to participate actively in hostilities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{assault on}} Bogoro, which {{occurred}} on February 24, 2003, {{was an attack}} on the village of Bogoro in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) and the Front for Patriotic Resistance of Ituri (FRPI). The attackers allegedly went on an [...] "indiscriminate killing spree", killing at least 200 civilians, imprisoning survivors in a room filled with corpses, and sexually enslaving women and girls. [...] Two rebel leaders, <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, have been charged by the International Criminal Court with war crimes and crimes against humanity over their alleged role in planning the attack.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, FPJC combatants stole {{national}} election materials from voter registration centers in Ituri, though did not otherwise block voter registration. The UN {{reported that the}} group has engaged in abductions and forced recruitment of adults and children. A resolution of the European Parliament in 2010 accused the FPJC, along with other armed groups active in eastern Congo, of [...] "causing, either directly or indirectly, thousands of deaths, unbearable suffering, poverty and internally displaced people (IDPs) every month." [...] In 2011, custody of Sharif Manda {{was transferred to the}} International Criminal Court to have Manda testify as a witness in the case against <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga,</b> the former FPRI leader accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5000|$|Matata {{has been}} accused of leading the {{massacre}} at Nyakunde Hospital in 2002, which resulted in the deaths of at least 1,200 civilians, and the subsequent Bogoro massacre. Matata succeeded <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> as leader of the FRPI after Katanga integrated into the FARDC in 2004. Matata surrendered to the Congolese government on November 21, 2014, and was arrested on January 2, 2015, in Bunia, a city in Ituri, for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the use of child soldiers. Matata was also accused of forming a rebel group, desertion, and attempting to escape detention. [...] Prior to his surrender, Matata commanded an estimated 1,000 combatants in Ituri. The FARDC falsely claimed in 2011 that it had killed Matata.|$|E
50|$|When Congolese warlord <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> {{was convicted}} in March 2014 of being an {{accessory}} to one count of crime against humanity and war crimes including murder and pillage - only the second conviction in the 12-year history of the ICC -, Van den Wyngaert partially disagreed with her two fellow judges Fatoumata Dembele Diarra and Bruno Cotte. In her dissenting opinion, she argued Katanga's trial had lasted too long {{and that he should}} have been acquitted in 2013 along with his co-accused Mathieu Ngudjolo. She also held that Katanga was not intentionally responsible for the crimes and said it was unfair to convict him as an accessory when he had originally been charged with being central to the crimes' commission.|$|E
5000|$|On 6 February 2008, the Congolese {{authorities}} {{arrested him}} and surrendered {{him to the}} ICC. The following day, he was flown to the ICC's detention centre in The Hague. Ngudjolo was the third suspect surrendered to the ICC since its establishment in 2002. [...] He was tried jointly with <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga,</b> who is also charged with directing the Bogoro attack; the hearing to confirm the charges against the two men began on 27 June 2008. Ngudjolo's lawyer {{has argued that the}} case should have been inadmissible since Ngudjolo has already been tried for the crimes in question. [...] The trial began on 24 November 2009, and concluded on 23 May 2012. [...] On 21 November, the charges against Katanga were separated.|$|E
50|$|Upon their inauguration to the ICC in 2003, the ICC {{judges were}} {{assigned}} to judicial divisions. During her first term, Ušacka {{was assigned to the}} Trial Division. However, from 2007-2009, she was temporarily attached to Pre-Trial Chamber I, which presided over the second ever confirmation of charges hearing at the ICC {{in the case of the}} Prosecutor v. <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui. During the period of her temporary attachment to Pre-Trial Chamber I, this Chamber was also the first of the ICC to issue a warrant of arrest for a sitting head of state, in the case of the Prosecutor v. Omar Al Bashir. In March 2009, Ušacka was reassigned by the plenary of judges to the Appeals Division. From April 2011 to March 2012, she has been the Appeals Division’s President.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2004, the DRC {{government}} referred {{the situation}} in the country to the International Criminal Court (ICC). [...] In July 2007, the Court found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two rebel leaders, <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, bore individual criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Bogoro attack, and issued sealed warrants for their arrest. [...] Both men were charged with six counts of war crimes (willful killing; inhuman treatment or cruel treatment; using {{children under the age of}} fifteen years to participate actively in hostilities; sexual slavery; intentionally directing attacks against civilians; and pillaging) and three counts of crimes against humanity (murder, inhumane acts and sexual slavery). [...] They are alleged to have ordered their fighters to [...] "wipe out" [...] the village of Bogoro.|$|E
50|$|The International Criminal Court is {{conducting}} an ongoing investigation into crimes {{committed in the}} DRC during the Second Congo War and afterwards. Several military leaders {{have been charged with}} crimes of sexual violence. <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga,</b> the leader of the Front for Patriotic Resistance in Ituri (FPRI), and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, the leader of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI), were charged and indicted with nine crimes against humanity including sexual slavery, a crime against humanity under article 7(1)(g) of the Rome Statute and a war crime under article 8(2)(b)(xxii) or (e)(vi) of the Rome Statute. Bosco Ntaganda of the Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo (FPLC) was charged with rape and sexual slavery. Callixte Mbarushimana of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), and Sylvestre Mudacumura have also been charged with rape.|$|E
5000|$|Moreno Ocampo led an {{investigation}} against {{leaders of the}} Lord's Resistance Army, who in 2005 faced ICC arrest warrants for crimes against humanity. Moreno Ocampo directed {{an investigation}} against <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Matthieu Ngudjolo Chui, who received arrest warrants in 2007 and 2008 respectively for crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In March 2008, according to an Argentine online news report, Moreno Ocampo claimed that the FARC, the largest guerrilla group in Colombia, was appropriate for {{an investigation by the}} International Criminal Court. Moreno Ocampo began implementing preliminary tests in Colombia, which involved evaluating prosecutions of paramilitary commanders in Colombia, interviews with victims of the FARC, among others. Moreno-Ocampo claimed that the FARC could be investigated for crimes against humanity. He visited Colombia in August, after which the ICC launched an investigation on the [...] "support network for FARC rebels outside Colombia".|$|E
50|$|In November, 2012, McCallum began {{creating}} {{a body of}} portraits depicting defendants standing trial before international courts titled Weights and Measures, a project he began {{in partnership with the}} Coalition for the International Criminal Court in his unique capacity as the organization’s year-long artist-in-residence. The project consists of oil paintings portraying individuals standing trial before the International Criminal Court as well as the ad hoc international tribunals that preceded it, such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. According to an interview with MSNBC, the paintings are monumental formal portraits, referencing a classical, 19th-century approach to portraiture that challenges viewers to reconsider the harmful influence these powerful men had on their communities.Currently, McCallum has completed painted portraits of Thomas Lubanga, Slobodan Milošević, Radovan Karadžić, <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga,</b> Kang Kek Iew, Nuon Chea, William Ruto, Charles Taylor, Jean-Pierre Bemba, and Fidèle Wandu.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga,</b> {{also known}} simply as [...] "Simba" [...] (the Swahili word for [...] "lion"), was {{allegedly}} {{the commander of the}} Front for Patriotic Resistance in Ituri (FRPI). Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui was allegedly the leader of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI). Katanga and Chui are charged with nine counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed between January and March 2003 in the Ituri region of the DRC against members of the Hema people. Katanga and Chui were indicted in July 2007. Specifically, Katanga and Chui are also accused of launching a coordinated attack against the civilian population of the village of Bogoro on 24 February 2003. According to the warrants of arrest issued for Katanga and Chui, the attack included such acts as [...] "the murder of about 200 civilians", the [...] "imprisoning of civilians in a room filled with corpses", and [...] "the sexual enslavement of several women and girls". The counts are as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The International Criminal Court {{investigation}} in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or {{the situation in the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo is an ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) into crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during the Second Congo War and its aftermath, including the Ituri and Kivu conflicts. The war started in 1998 and even although a peace agreement was made between combatants in 2003, conflict continued in the eastern parts of the country for several years. In April 2004 the government of the DRC formally referred the situation in the Congo to the International Criminal Court, and in June 2004, the Prosecutor of the ICC, Luis Moreno Ocampo, formally opened an investigation. To date, warrants of arrest have been issued for Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, Bosco Ntaganda, Callixte Mbarushimana, and Sylvestre Mudacumura. Lubanga is imprisoned; Katanga is convicted; Chui is acquitted; the pre-trial chamber declined to confirm the charges against Mbarushimana; Mudacumura is currently a fugitive; and Ntaganda turned himself in to the US Embassy in Kigali on 18 March 2013, requesting to be extradited to the ICC.|$|E
40|$|The International Criminal Court (ICC) was {{established}} in 2002 and its Statute (Rome Statute 1) was heralded as an advanced enumeration of gender based crimes. However, in the three cases before the Court in which charges have been confirmed: The Prosecutor v Thomas Lubanga Dyilo 2 (Lubanga), The Prosecutor v <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chii 3 (Katanga and Ngudjolo) and The Prosecutor v Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo 4 (Bemba) there are either no charges for gender based crimes as in Lubanga 5 or the charges are not comprehensive. This article examines why despite the extensive provision in the Rome Statute the ICC is failing to advance the prosecution of gender based crimes. It also considers the wider impact of this failure in particular on the ICC‟s role in assisting national courts to prosecute war crimes and in deterring the commission of such crimes...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to its retributive and restorative functions, by its mere existence the International Criminal Court is slated to play a deterrence role never before seen in international criminal law. However, unabated sexualized violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo evidences limits of the permanent ICC’s deterrent capacity. Despite the ICC’s investigation, and indictments and proceedings against <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Mathieu Ngudjolo for sexually violent war crimes and crimes against humanity, the nascent court is yet unable to elicit preventive effects. While deterrence theory is logically compelling, mechanisms and assumptions underlying it prove impractical when deterrence is assessed in reality. First, the ICC cannot execute certain, severe or swift enough punishment to generally deter. Second, deterrence theory’s assumption that perpetrators are rational actors engaged in utilitarian calculations of legal risk is dispelled by an analysis of Congolese perpetrators’ accounts. Evidently, prosecutions alone will not end sexualized violence in the DRC...|$|E
30|$|In addition, ‘pillaging a town or place, {{even when}} taken by assault’ is {{prohibited}} through the provisions RS Art 8 War crimes 2. (b) (xvi) applicable in IAC, and under RS Art 8.2 (e) (v) applicable in NIAC. A number of authors bring to light that {{the reference to}} a ‘town or a place’ is not in line with IHL, and further, the prohibition of pillage is universal (Stewart 2011; Keenan 2014). Furthermore, AP II (1977) Art 4 g) underlines that ‘pillage is prohibited {{at any time and}} in any place whatsoever’. In relation to CIHL, the ICC in Prosecutor v. <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> [2014] found ‘In the opinion of the Chamber, the pillaging of a town or place comprises all forms of appropriation, public or private, including not only organized and systematic appropriation, but also acts of appropriation committed by combatants in their own interest’ [ICC- 01 / 04 - 01 / 07 - 3436 para 905].|$|E
40|$|According to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), The Pre-Trial Chamber {{must hold}} a hearing {{to confirm the}} charges against an accused person within a {{reasonable}} time after that person has been taken into {{the custody of the}} Court. At the close of the hearing, the Pre-Trial Chamber must determine whether there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that the accused committed the crimes charged by the Prosecutor. The Chamber may then confirm the charges and commit the accused to trial; decline to confirm the charges; or adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider providing further evidence or amending a charge. At the time this report was written, the ICC confirmed the charges in two cases—namely, in the case against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and in the joint case against <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> and Matheiu Ndgudjolo Chui. Focusing on these two cases, the aim of this report is to analyze the confirmation process as carried out by the Court thus far—both in terms of {{the manner in which the}} drafters of the Rome Statute seemed to have envisioned the process, as well as with respect to issues not necessarily anticipated by the drafters—and to make recommendations as to how the process might be improved for future accused.

40|$|On 7 March 2014, Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted <b>Germain</b> <b>Katanga</b> for {{war crimes}} and crimes against humanity. Katanga's {{conviction}} {{is based on the}} concept of common purpose liability as regulated in Article 25 (3) (d) of the Rome Statute. This liability theory establishes criminal responsibility for wilfully or knowingly contributing to the crimes of a group of persons who act together pursuant to a common purpose. The ICC regards commonpurpose liability as a residual liability theory, which provides for a lower level of blameworthiness than principal forms of criminal responsibility, such as joint perpetration. This article appraises the residual and inferior status of common purpose liability by comparing the ICC's application of common purpose liability and joint perpetration. The comparison makes clear that common purpose liability in theory stipulates lower actus reus and mens rea standards than joint perpetration. However, in practice the ICC applies the requirements of both these liability theories in a context-dependent way in interplay with the particular facts of individual cases. It can therefore not be concluded in general terms that common purpose liability by definition constitutes a less serious type of criminal responsibility than joint perpetration. Instead, it is preferable to adopt a flexible approach, which recognizes that common purpose liability covers a variety of conduct entailing different levels of blameworthiness...|$|E
