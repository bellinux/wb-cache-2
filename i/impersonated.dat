40|$|Consider Alice and Bob, {{who have}} some shared secret which helps Alice to {{identify}} Bob-impersonators, and Eve, who does not know their secret. Eve wants to <b>impersonate</b> Bob and “fool ” Alice. If Eve is computationally unbounded, how long does she need to observe Bob before she can <b>impersonate</b> him? What is a good strategy for Eve? If (cryptographic) one-way functions exist, an efficient Eve cannot <b>impersonate</b> even very simple Bobs, {{but if they do}} not exist, can Eve learn to <b>impersonate</b> any efficient Bob? We formalize these questions in a new computational learning model, which we believe captures a wide variety of natural learning tasks, and tightly bound the number of observations Eve makes in terms of the secret’s entropy. We then show that if one-way functions do not exist, then an efficient Eve can learn to <b>impersonate</b> any efficient Bob nearly as well as an unbounded Eve.

5|$|Verified status {{does not}} imply that Twitter {{continuously}} checks whether such accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was <b>impersonated</b> briefly in 2015.
