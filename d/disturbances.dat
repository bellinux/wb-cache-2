A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. <b>Disturbances</b> occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These <b>disturbances</b> create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity.

40|$|A primary {{impediment}} to understanding how species diversity and anthropogenic <b>disturbance</b> are related {{is that both}} diversity and <b>disturbance</b> can depend on the scales at which they are sampled. While the scale dependence of diversity estimation has received substantial attention, the scale dependence of <b>disturbance</b> estimation has been essentially overlooked. Here, we break from conventional examination of the diversity-disturbance relationship by holding the area over which species richness is estimated constant and instead manipulating the area over which human <b>disturbance</b> is measured. In the boreal forest ecoregion of Alberta, Canada, we test the dependence of species richness on <b>disturbance</b> scale, the scale-dependence of the intermediate <b>disturbance</b> hypothesis, and the consistency of these patterns in native versus exotic species and among human <b>disturbance</b> types. We related field observed species richness in 1 ha surveys of 372 boreal vascular plant communities to remotely sensed measures of human <b>disturbance</b> extent at two survey scales: local (1 ha) and landscape (18 km 2). Supporting the intermediate <b>disturbance</b> hypothesis, species richness-disturbance relationships were quadratic at both local and landscape scales of <b>disturbance</b> measurement. This suggests the shape of richness-disturbance relationships is independent of the scale at which <b>disturbance</b> is assessed, despite that local diversity is influenced by <b>disturbance</b> at different scales by different mechanisms, such as direct removal of individuals (local) or indirect alteration of propagule supply (landscape). By contrast, predictions of species richness did depend on scale of <b>disturbance</b> measurement: with high local <b>disturbance</b> richness was double that under high landscape <b>disturbance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Lawton et al. (1998) found, in {{a highly}} cited study, that the species {{richness}} of 8 taxa each responds differently to anthropogenic <b>disturbance</b> in Cameroon forests. Recent developments in conservation science suggest that net number of species is an insensitive measure of change and that understanding which species are affected by <b>disturbance</b> is more important. It is also recognized that all <b>disturbance</b> types are not equal in their effect on species and that grouping species according to function rather than taxonomy is more informative of responses of biodiversity to change. In a reanalysis {{of most of the}} original Cameroon data set (canopy and ground ants, termites, canopy beetles, nematodes, and butterflies), we focused on changes in species and functional composition rather than richness and used a more inclusive measure of forest <b>disturbance</b> based on 4 component drivers of change: years since <b>disturbance,</b> tree cover, soil compaction, and degree of tree removal. Effects of <b>disturbance</b> on compositional change were largely concordant between taxa. Contrary to Lawton et al. âs findings, species richness for most groups did not decline with <b>disturbance</b> level, providing support for the view that trends in species richness at local scales do not reflect the resilience of ecosystems to <b>disturbance.</b> <b>Disturbance</b> affected species composition more strongly than species richness for butterflies, canopy beetles, and litter ants. For these groups, <b>disturbance</b> caused species replacements rather than just species loss. Only termites showed effects of <b>disturbance</b> on species richness but not composition, indicating species loss without replacement. Although <b>disturbance</b> generally caused changes in composition, the strength of this relationship depended on the <b>disturbance</b> driver. Butterflies, litter ants, and nematodes were correlated with amount of tree cover, canopy beetles were most strongly correlated with time since <b>disturbance,</b> and termites were most strongly correlated with degree of soil <b>disturbance.</b> There were moderately divergent responses to <b>disturbance</b> between functional feeding groups. <b>Disturbance</b> was most strongly correlated with compositional differences of herbivores within beetles and nematodes and humus feeders within termites. Our results suggest that consideration of the impact of different forms of <b>disturbance</b> on species and functional composition, rather than on net numbers of species, is important when assessing the impacts of <b>disturbance</b> on biodiversity.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the bee fauna of the Carolinian Zone in Ontario, Canada. In 2003, 15687 individuals from 152 species of bees were collected. Tliere were many rare species but few abundant species. There were three distinct bee seasons. The Niagara bee assemblage was less diverse compared to other Carolinian Zone assemblages and types of landscapes. This study also examined how anthropogenic <b>disturbance</b> affects the diversity of bee assemblages. The intermediate <b>disturbance</b> hypothesis (IDH) was tested by selecting field sites subject to low, intermediate, and high <b>disturbance.</b> Intermediate <b>disturbance</b> had the highest species richness (SR= 1 15) and most bees (N= 556 I), followed by low <b>disturbance</b> (SR= 100, N= 2975), then high <b>disturbance</b> (SR= 72, N= 1364), supporting the IDH. Increased species richness in areas of intermediate <b>disturbance</b> was due to higher abundance, possibly because more blooming flowers were found there.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new nonlinear robust <b>disturbance</b> observer {{by using only}} the input-output information for minimum phase dynamical systems with arbitrarily relative degrees. The model uncertainties, the nonlinear parts of the system are merged into the <b>disturbance</b> term, and are regarded {{as a part of}} the <b>disturbance.</b> The <b>disturbance</b> is assumed bounded. However, the upper and lower bounds are assumed unknown. The new <b>disturbance</b> observer is inspired by the VSS control theory, whereas the upper and lower bounds of the <b>disturbance</b> are adaptively updated. The estimation error of the <b>disturbance</b> can be made as small as necessary by choosing the design parameters. The attraction of the proposed method lies in its robustness to <b>disturbance</b> and easiness to be implemented. Example and simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

40|$|DOI: 10. 1890 / 07 - 1263. 1 Â© Ecological Society of AmericaEcologists know {{relatively}} {{little about the}} manner in which <b>disturbance</b> affects the likelihood of alternative community stable states and how the history of community assembly affects the relationship between <b>disturbance</b> and species diversity. Using microbial communities comprising bacterivorous ciliated protists assembled in laboratory microcosms, we experimentally investigated these questions by independently manipulating the intensity of <b>disturbance</b> (in the form of density-independent mortality) and community assembly history (including a control treatment with simultaneous species introduction and five sequential assembly treatments). Species diversity patterns consistent with the intermediate <b>disturbance</b> hypothesis emerged in the controls, as several species showed responses indicative of a trade-off between competitive ability and ability to recover from <b>disturbance.</b> Species diversity in communities with sequential assembly, however, generally declined with <b>disturbance,</b> owing to the increased extinction risk of later colonizers at the intermediate level of <b>disturbance.</b> Similarities among communities subjected to different assembly histories increased with <b>disturbance,</b> a result due possibly to increasing <b>disturbance</b> reducing the importance of competition and hence priority effects. This finding is most consistent with the idea that increasing <b>disturbance</b> tends to reduce the likelihood of alternative stable states.
