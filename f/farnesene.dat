40|$|Sesquiterpenes {{belong to}} the large and diverse group of isoprenoids, which are {{ubiquitous}} in the plant kingdom and have various applications in the chemical industry as fragrances, pharmaceuticals and as substitutes for petroleum-based gasoline, diesel and jet fuels. In this project, production of sesquiterpenes was studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using <b>farnesene</b> as an example with the objective to gain {{new insights into the}} synthesis of these compounds and to evaluate different metabolic engineering strategies. Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) represents the universal precursor for all sesquiterpenes and different strategies were addressed to increase production of this intermediate and to allow for its efficient conversion to <b>farnesene.</b> As FPP is provided by the mevalonate pathway, we aimed at increasing the flux through the pathway by incorporation of malonyl-CoA using a recently identified acetoacetyl-CoA synthase from Streptomyces sp. strain CL 190. While the enzyme had detrimental effects on growth as well as on product formation, it was able to compensate for the loss of the essential, endogenous acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. Additionally, a homologous enzyme with superior efficiency could be identified. Secondly, as FPP is required as substrate for different pathways and represents a metabolic branch point, a novel tool for enzyme co-localization was developed to divert more flux towards <b>farnesene.</b> The system utilizes scaffolds based on affibodies and could improve product yields by more than twofold. Furthermore, the role of terpene synthases on the production of <b>farnesene</b> was elucidated by comparing <b>farnesene</b> synthases with different plant origins, i. e. Malus domestica, Citrus junos and Artemisia annua. While the selected candidates produced similar amounts of <b>farnesene</b> (up to 170 mg/L), these enzymes appeared to be superior in comparison to other sesquiterpene synthases, i. e. santalene synthase. Lastly, the response to increased product formation was investigated using transcriptome and metabolome analysis, which highlighted changes across various metabolic pathways and identified pantothenic acid as a potential target for future engineering strategies. In conclusion, the study evaluates different metabolic engineering strategies for production of sesquiterpenes in S. cerevisiae and provides new insights into the cellular response during their production.

As well, microtubules immunolabeling, phytohormone measurements and ROS staining helped us to elucidate the single or multi-modes of action of this sesquiterpene on plant metabolism. Farnesene-treated roots showed a strong growth inhibition and marked modifications on morphology, important tissue alterations, cellular damages and anisotropic growth. Left-handed growth of farnesene-treated roots, reverted by taxol (a known microtubule stabilizer), was related to microtubule condensation and disorganization. As well, the inhibition of primary root growth, lateral root number, lateral root length, and both root hairs length and density {{could be explained by}} the strong increment in ethylene production and auxin content detected in farnesene-treated seedlings.

One {{of the most}} prominent examples is the sesquiterpene <b>farnesene,</b> which can be used as diesel substitute in its hydrogenated form farnesane. Recent metabolic engineering efforts have enabled efficient production of several terpenes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. Plant terpene synthases take on an essential function for sesquiterpene production as they catalyze the specific conversion of the universal precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to the sesquiterpene of interest and thereby impose limitations on the overall productivity. Using <b>farnesene</b> as a case study, we chose three terpene synthases with distinct plant origins and compared their applicability for <b>farnesene</b> production in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Differences regarding the efficiency of these enzymes were observed in shake flask cultivation with maximal final titers of 4 mg/L using -farnesene synthase from Malus domestica. By employing two existing platform strains optimized for sesquiterpene production, final titers could be raised up 170 mg/L in fed-batch fermentations with RQ-controlled exponential feeding. Based on these experiments, the difference between the selected synthases was not significant. Lastly, the same fermentation setup was used to compare these results to production of the fragrance sesquiterpene santalene, and almost equivalent titers were obtained with 163 mg/L, using the highest producing strain expressing a santalene synthase from Clausena lansium.

40|$|Efficient {{production}} of sesquiterpenes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a high flux through the mevalonate pathway. To achieve this, {{the supply of}} acetyl-CoA plays a crucial role, partially because nine moles of acetyl-CoA are necessary to produce one mole of farnesyl diphosphate, but also to overcome the thermodynamic constraint imposed on the first reaction, in which acetoacetyl-CoA is produced from two moles of acetyl-CoA by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. Recently, a novel acetoacetyl-CoA synthase (nphT 7) has been identified from Streptomyces sp. strain CL 190, which catalyzes the irreversible condensation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA and, therefore, represents a potential target to increase the flux through the mevalonate pathway. This study investigates the effect of acetoacetyl-CoA synthase on growth {{as well as the}} {{production of}} <b>farnesene</b> and compares different homologs regarding their efficiency. While plasmid-based expression of nphT 7 did not improve final <b>farnesene</b> titers, the construction of an alternative pathway, which exclusively relies on the malonyl-CoA bypass, was detrimental for growth and <b>farnesene</b> production. The presented results indicate that the overall functionality of the bypass was limited by the efficiency of acetoacetyl-CoA synthase (nphT 7). Besides modulation of the expression level, which {{could be used as a}} means to partially restore the phenotype, nphT 7 from Streptomyces glaucescens showed clearly higher efficiency compared to Streptomyces sp. strain CL 190. © 2017, The Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Enzyme fusions {{have been}} widely used as a tool in {{metabolic}} engineering to increase pathway efficiency by reducing substrate loss and accumulation of toxic intermediates. Alternatively, enzymes can be colocalized through attachment to a synthetic scaffold via noncovalent interactions. Here we describe the use of affibodies for enzyme tagging and scaffolding. The scaffolding is based on the recognition of affibodies to their anti-idiotypic partners in vivo, and was first employed for colocalization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase and <b>farnesene</b> synthase in S.  cerevisiae. Different parameters were modulated to improve the system, and the enzyme:scaffold ratio was most critical for its functionality. Ultimately, the yield of <b>farnesene</b> on glucose YSFar could be improved by 135 % in fed-batch cultivations using a 2 -site affibody scaffold. The scaffolding strategy was then extended to a three-enzyme polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) pathway, heterologously expressed in E.  coli.

Volatile compounds of five aromatic cultivars (Styrie, Saaz, Lublin, Mount Hood, and Hallertau) and six bitter cultivars (Northern Brewer, Nugget, Pride of Ringwood, Northdown, Target, and Challenger), stored at different temperatures, were extracted with a Likens-Nickerson simultaneous solvent extractor. Only compounds remaining stable through aging were kept to build an identification flowchart.

PCC 6803 was genetically engineered to produce the biofuel n­-butanol. Several metabolic engineering strategies were explored with the aim to increase butanol titers and tolerance. In papers I-II, different driving forces for n-butanol production were evaluated. Expression of a phosphoketolase increased acetyl-CoA levels and subsequently butanol titers. Attempts to increase the NADH pool further improved titers to 100 mg/L in four days. In paper III, enzymes were co-localized onto a scaffold to aid intermediate channeling. The scaffold was tested on a <b>farnesene</b> and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) pathway in yeast and in E. coli, respectively, and could be extended to cyanobacteria. Enzyme co-localization increased <b>farnesene</b> titers by 120 %. Additionally, fusion of scaffold-recognizing proteins to the enzymes improved <b>farnesene</b> and PHB production by 20 % and 300 %, respectively, {{even in the absence}} of scaffold. In paper IV, the gene repression technology CRISPRi was implemented in Synechocystis to enable parallel repression of multiple genes. CRISPRi allowed 50 - 95 % repression of four genes simultaneously. The method will be valuable for repression of competing pathways to butanol synthesis. Butanol becomes toxic at high concentrations, impeding growth and thus limiting titers. In papers V-VI, butanol tolerance was increased by overexpressing a heat shock protein or a stress-related sigma factor.

One such advance is the use of synthetic biology to re-engineer photosynthetic micro-organisms such that they are able to produce novel hydrocarbons directly from CO 2. Terpenes are a class of hydrocarbons that can be produced biologically and have potential as liquid transport fuels. This paper presents experimental studies on a compression ignition engine and spark ignition engine in which the combustion and emissions of 12 different terpenes that could potentially be produced by cyanobacteria were assessed as single components and blends with fossil diesel and fossil gasoline. The 12 terpenes were chosen to explore how small changes to the molecular structure of geraniol (a terpene most easily produced by cyanobacteria) impact on combustion and emissions. Furthermore, the toxicity of some of the best performing terpenes were assessed using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter, Synechocystis) as a prelude to a metabolic engineering programme. The compression ignition engine tests were carried out at constant injection timing and constant ignition timing, and the spark ignition engine tests were conducted at a constant spark timing and a constant lambda value of 1. Of the terpenes tested in the compression ignition engine, geranial and <b>farnesene</b> were found to be the best performing single component fuels in terms of combustion and emissions.

The solvents dioctyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, and <b>farnesene</b> showed greater than 100 -fold increase in the MIC compared to the monoterpenes in a solvent-free system. In particular, the MIC for limonene in dibutyl phthalate showed a 702 -fold (308 ?mM, 42. 1 ?g?L- 1 of limonene) improvement while cell viability was maintained above 90 %, demonstrating that extractive fermentation is a suitable tool for the reduction of monoterpene toxicity. Finally, we estimated that a limonane to farnesane ratio of 1 : 9 has physicochemical properties similar to traditional Jet-A aviation fuel. Since <b>farnesene</b> is currently produced in S. cerevisiae, its use as a co-product and extractant for microbial terpene-based jet fuel production in a two-phase system offers an attractive bioprocessing option.

40|$|Early in spring, {{just after}} the snow melts, the leaf beetle Oreina cacaliae feeds on flowers of Petasites paradoxus. Later in spring they switch to their {{principle}} host plant Adenostyles alliariae. The attractiveness of short- and long-term damaged host plants was studied in a wind tunnel. The spring host P. paradoxus was more attractive to the beetles after it had been damaged overnight by conspecifics or artificially, but not when the plants were damaged {{half an hour before}} the wind-tunnel experiments. Contrary to P. paradoxus, the principle host plant, A. alliariae was more attractive shortly after an attack by conspecifics (half an hour before the experiment) compared to a undamaged plant, but lost its increased attractiveness when damaged overnight. The enhanced attraction of damaged plants was longer lasting in the spring host P. paradoxus than in the main host A. alliariae. Volatiles emitted by host plants were collected and gas chromatographic analyses of the odors collected showed qualitative and quantitative differences between damaged and undamaged plants. Among the volatiles recorded, green leaf volatiles and mono- and sesquiterpenes dominated. In overnight damaged P. paradoxus plants with an enhanced attractiveness, limonene was emitted in higher amounts. In freshly damaged A. alliariae leaves, more -humulene and germacrene D were emitted compared to (E,E) [...] <b>farnesene,</b> whereas in the less attractive A. alliariae plants, more (E,E) [...] <b>farnesene</b> was emitted compared to -humulene and germacrene D. In the field, the long lasting attraction of flowering P. paradoxus early in the season may facilitate mating in O. cacaliae after a successful overwintering...|$|E

(Fam Apiaceae) were {{collected}} in July - Auguest 1993 from kandavan area in north of Tehran. The oil was extracted by hydrodistillation (0. 13 %) from leaves and was analyzed by GC, GC/CS and 1 H-NMR. The major component was trans - anethole (82. 8 %) Other components were &beta; - pinene, p-cymene and terpinolene (monoterpenes), &alpha;- caryophylene, &alpha;- bergamotene, &alpha;- <b>farnesene,</b> zingiberene, spathulenol (sesqiterpenes).

40|$|Bachelor theses is themed "Variability in {{the content}} of {{essential}} oils in selected plants used in herbal medicine, aromatic plants and spice plants" and deals with the variability of the content of essential oils in caraway (Carum carvi L.), where carvone and limonene are present, in chamomile (Matricaria recutita L.), which contains <b>farnesene,</b> chamazulene, bisabolol oxide A and apigenin- 7 -glucoside, and in lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), which contains camphor, borneol, alpha-terpineol and linalylacetate. The thesis consists of two parts [...] the first one is a literature review of selected plants and the second one is a practical part held in the laboratory at Department of Crop Science, Breeding and Plant Medicine at Faculty of Agriculture. In the practical part, drugs were individually analyzed using the methods taken from Czech pharmacopoeia. Samples from caraway were acquired from Agritec, s. r. o. company's breeding, lavender and chamomile came from the company Leros, s. r. o. and also from domestic production. Variation analysis of caraway proves that content of both examined substances [...] carvone and limolene [...] was highly affected by its genotype. Total content of essential oils, on the other hand, was not statistically affected by genotype. Four different variants were studied in chamomile. The content of essential oils in chamomile was statistically highly affected by monitored variants; the content of chamazulene was affected in the same way. Bisabolol oxide A was significantly affected by the variant of chamomile and so was apigenin- 7 -glucoside. <b>Farnesene</b> was not significantly affected by variant. All compounds found in lavender's essential oils, namely camphor, borneol, alpha-terpineol and linalyl-acetate, were statistically greatly affected by variant...|$|E
