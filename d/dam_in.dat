5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> Turkey and the Tabqa <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> Syria. This increase can, among other things, {{be related to the}} lower discharge of the Euphrates {{as a result of the}} construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> Syria. High-salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes.|$|E
5|$|The dam was {{completed}} in September 1940. When built it was the longest concrete gravity <b>dam</b> <b>in</b> Australia, and also the second highest after the Burrinjuck <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> New South Wales. As of 1997 of the 90 large concrete and masonry gravity dams in Australia the Canning Dam is still the fifth highest and the sixth longest. It is the largest concrete <b>dam</b> <b>in</b> Western Australia in terms of length of crest and volume of concrete.|$|E
5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, {{along with one}} further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The <b>dam</b> <b>in</b> Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the <b>dam</b> <b>in</b> Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E

Swagger later cost Cesaro his match against Rob Van <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> the semi-finals of the Intercontinental Championship #1 contender tournament, while Van Dam later lost in the tournament final due to Cesaro's interference.

5|$|Hydropower is {{produced}} in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> Venezuela. The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity.

5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> Tennessee and Pian Telessio <b>dam</b> <b>in</b> Italy among others.|$|E
5|$|A further {{improvement}} {{was made in}} 1951 when a concrete-lined channel was constructed to divert stream flow from the nearby Kangaroo Gully catchment. The Canning Dam and reservoir was Perth's primary source of water until the boom growth {{of the city in}} the 1960s and the completion of Serpentine <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> 1961.|$|E
5|$|Aluminum {{production}}, shipbuilding, {{and nuclear}} {{production at the}} Hanford site contributed to a rapid increase in regional demand for electricity.

5|$|Hetch Hetchy {{represented}} {{the first great}} environmental controversy in the US, and debate over the dam and reservoir continues today.

5|$|In 1903, a <b>dam</b> <b>in</b> the {{northern}} {{portion of the}} park was proposed. Located in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, its purpose was to provide water and hydroelectric power to San Francisco.

5|$|In 1927, when Syria was a French mandate, it was {{proposed}} {{to build a}} <b>dam</b> <b>in</b> the Euphrates near the Syro–Turkish border. After Syria became independent in 1946, the feasibility of this proposal was re-investigated, but the plan was not carried out. In 1957, the Syrian government reached {{an agreement with the}} Soviet Union for technical and financial aid {{for the construction of a}} <b>dam</b> <b>in</b> the Euphrates. Syria, as part of the United Arab Republic (UAR), signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 for a loan to finance the construction of the dam. After Syria left the UAR in 1961, a new agreement about the financing of the dam was reached with the Soviet Union in 1965. A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction of the <b>dam.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1960s Swedish geomorphologist Åke Sundborg worked as advisor in the dam project with the task of estimating the amount and fate of sediments that would enter into the dam. Sundborg developed for this purpose a mathematical model on the prognosed growth of a river delta in the dam.|$|E

5|$|In a {{preliminary}} match from the Raw brand, Kane faced Rob Van <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> a No Disqualification match. Both wrestlers used a ladder {{to their advantage}} early in the match.

Van Dam performed a variation of a rolling thunder on Kane using a folding chair. Following this, Van Dam attempted to hit Kane with a Van Daminator with a chair, but Kane rolled out of the ring to avoid the attack. Van Dam then attempted an aerial technique from inside the ring towards Kane, but Kane caught Van <b>Dam</b> <b>in</b> mid-air and executed a Tombstone Piledriver, after which he covered Van Dam for the pinfall.|$|E

The construction of Hoover was a major step towards stabilizing the lower channel of the Colorado River, storing water for irrigation in times of drought, and providing much-needed flood control as part of a program known as the Boulder Canyon Project. Hoover was the tallest <b>dam</b> <b>in</b> the world at the time of construction and also had the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. Flow regulation from Hoover Dam opened the doors for rapid development on the lower Colorado River; Imperial and Parker dams followed in 1938, and Davis Dam was completed in 1950.|$|E
