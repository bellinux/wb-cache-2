5|$|DeHavilland's career spanned 53 years, from 1935 to 1988. During that time, she {{appeared}} in 49 feature films, {{and was one of}} the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood. She began her career playing demure ingénues opposite popular male stars, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made her breakout film Captain Blood in 1935. They would go on to make eight more feature films together, and became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. Her range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Following her film debut in the Shakespeare adaptation A Midsummer Night's Dream, deHavilland achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedies, such as The Great Garrick and Hard to <b>Get,</b> <b>and</b> Western adventure films, such as Dodge City and Santa Fe Trail. In her later career, she was most successful in drama films, such as In This Our Life and Light in the Piazza, and psychological dramas playing non-glamorous characters in films such as The Dark Mirror, The Snake Pit, and Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|Sure, it's not a Sepultura reunion, {{but having}} Max and Igor {{performing}} on {{record for the}} first time in a dozen years is as close as we'll ever <b>get,</b> <b>and</b> not only does Cavalera Conspiracy's Inflikted revisit the post-thrash sounds of 1993's Chaos A.D., but it manages to outshine anything Sepultura has put out in the last dozen years. Rounded out by Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo and, most impressively, Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier on bass and rhythm guitar, the band is as solid a metal supergroup as you'll ever come across, and the album's eleven tracks benefit hugely from the chemistry between the four musicians.|$|E
40|$|Get 3, <b>Get</b> 4, <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> 5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{participate}} in the insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We elucidated the interaction between <b>Get</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> 5 <b>and</b> investigated their interaction with <b>Get</b> 3 <b>and</b> a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, Sgt 2. Based on co-immunoprecipitation <b>and</b> crystallographic studies, <b>Get</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> 5 formed a tight complex, suggesting that they constitute subunits of a larger complex. In contrast, although Get 3 interacted physically with the Get 4 -Get 5 complex, low amounts of Get 3 co-precipitated with Get 5, implying a transient interaction between <b>Get</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> 4 -Get 5. Sgt 2 also interacted with Get 5, although the amount of Sgt 2 that co-precipitated with Get 5 varied. Moreover, GET 3, <b>GET</b> 4, <b>and</b> <b>GET</b> 5 interacted genetically with molecular chaperone YDJ 1, suggesting that chaperones might also {{be involved in the}} insertion of tail-anchored proteins...|$|R

25|$|Reconstructions of {{tectonic plate}} {{movement}} in the past 250million years (the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras) can be made reliably using fitting of continental margins, ocean floor magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic poles. No ocean crust dates back further than that, so earlier reconstructions are more difficult. Paleomagnetic poles are supplemented by geologic evidence such as orogenic belts, which mark the edges of ancient plates, and past distributions of flora and fauna. The further back in time, the scarcer and harder to interpret the data <b>get</b> <b>and</b> the more uncertain the reconstructions.|$|E
25|$|In the Conservative {{movement}} {{a traditional}} get is required. However, {{in cases where}} the husband refuses to grant the <b>get</b> <b>and</b> the Bet Din (Rabbinic Court) has ruled that the husband's refusal is not justified, the marital condition may be terminated by hafqa'at kiddushin, or annulment of the marriage. This requires a majority vote of the Joint Bet Din of the movement, which is made up of nine rabbinic scholars. Upon their authorization of the process, the Bet Din may issue a certificate of annulment. This protocol is viewed as extreme and is invoked only in cases of dire necessity.|$|E

25|$|Some {{of these}} efforts include the {{construction}} of the Green Roof in 2006. The roof helps to keep the building temperature regulated while using less energy which aids in keeping pollution low. The plant life, which is a sedum species, helps to purify the air. The green roof also reduces stormwater runoff - which can cause sewage backup during periods of deluge. NOW implements a 100% recycled paper policy and uses only vegetable-based dyes for print. This effort, each year, saves over 28,000 living trees, reduces greenhouse gases - the equivalent given off by 534 cars, eliminates 7 swimming pools of waste water and saves 79 garbage trucks worth of solid waste. Now also partners with Green Enterprise Toronto (<b>GET)</b> <b>and</b> Canopy (formerly Markets Initiative). Both companies are dedicated to responsible business and green initiatives.|$|E
25|$|Mumps {{is highly}} {{contagious}} and spreads rapidly among {{people living in}} close quarters. The virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets or direct contact with an infected person. Only humans <b>get</b> <b>and</b> spread the disease. People are infectious to each other from about seven days {{before the start of}} symptoms to about eight days after. Once an infection has run its course, a person is typically immune for life. Reinfection is possible but the ensuing infection tends to be mild. Diagnosis is usually suspected due to parotid swelling and can be confirmed by isolating the virus on a swab of the parotid duct. Testing for IgM antibodies in the blood is simple and may be useful; however, it can be falsely negative in those who have been immunized.|$|E
25|$|The salmon {{fisheries}} of the Columbia River are now but {{a fraction}} of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could <b>get,</b> <b>and</b> the two legislatures {{have never been able to}} agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, {{there were}} 50 GMs (USSR: 19, Yugoslavia: 7, USA: 5, Argentina: 4, West Germany: 2, France: 2, Sweden: 1, Czechoslovakia: 1, Hungary: 1, Austria: 1, Belgium: 1, Denmark: 1, Netherlands: 1, Poland: 1). In 1972, there were 88 GMs with 33 {{representing}} the USSR. The current FIDE ratings list includes over 1000 Grandmasters. Nigel Short was rated the third {{best player in}} the world in 1989 with a rating of 2650; in the 21st century such a rating would only be good enough for a player to reach the top 100 or so, with the third {{best player in the}} world usually rated around 2800. Other minor factors come into play: there are more tournaments worldwide and cheaper air travel makes them more accessible to globe-trotting chess professionals, who include many players from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe whose movements are no longer restricted as they were before the 1990s. Additionally, players can make norms in tournaments that would have been previously considered too short for norms, making norms easier to <b>get</b> <b>and</b> allowing for more norm tournaments to be held.|$|E
25|$|As the Dubois Brothers {{continued}} to make money and become wealthier they realized that the highest profits were {{in the drug trade}} realizing that a drug, especially methamphetamine, were cheap enough to <b>get</b> <b>and</b> highly addictive and once a customer was hooked they could not resist coming back for more creating a customer base. One of their previous drug pushers stated that the Dubois Brothers could get a pound of marijuana for $30 imported from Mexico and were able to sell it on the streets for up to $750 making a major profit. The Dubois Brothers, more specifically Adrien, Claude and Roland, had branched off logically into drug trafficking in the mid 70s and were controlling, in the west end and city center of Montreal, the sales of marijuana, hashish, LSD, amphetamines, and cocaine. They had a web of dealers set up to distribute the drugs all of which were working in licensed establishments under the control of {{at least one of the}} Brothers. Montreal police were able to seize a drug distribution for the Dubois Brothers that consisted of nearly two million tenure pills in late 1973 to early 1974. The Brothers took it one step further by going continental when they began having roots in Pakistan because Adrien Dubois decided to introduce a Sixth Family associate to his impressive source of hashish through a corrupt government official in Pakistan who had a ministerial position and thrived for foreign currency. The Dubois Brothers were always thirsty for more territory and money and that is what lead them to the McSween Turf War.|$|E
