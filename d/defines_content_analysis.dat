40|$|Abstract: One of {{the means}} to reach a Semantic Web is to add some machine {{readable}} meta-data to documents (semantic annotations) and/or to improve the performance of information retrieval applications thanks {{to the use of}} semantic resources such as terminologies and ontologies. This position paper promotes the idea that these semantic resources cannot be universal but should rather be domain and even task specific in most cases. Moreover, we assert that their content is all the more relevant that it has been <b>defined</b> from document <b>content</b> <b>analysis.</b> And finally, we advocate in favor of a supervised learning process for their design from well selected texts. We shortly present two contributions, a method to build ontologies from texts and a tool for semantic relation identification, that illustrate these positions.

40|$|In {{this article}} we <b>define</b> a {{multimedia}} <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> problem, which we call multimodal location estimation: Given a video/image/audio file, the task is to determine where it was recorded. A single indication, such as a unique landmark, might already pinpoint a location precisely. In most cases, however, a combination of evidence from the visual and the acoustic domain will only narrow down the set of possible answers. Therefore, approaches to tackle this task should be inherently multimedia. While the task is hard, in fact sometimes unsolvable, training data can be leveraged from the Internet in large amounts. Moreover, even partially successful automatic estimation of location opens up new possibilities in video content matching, archiving, and organization. It could revolutionize law enforcement and computer-aided intelligence agency work, especially since both semi-automatic and fully automatic approaches would be possible. In this article, we describe our idea of growing multimodal location estimation as a research field in the multimedia community. Based on examples and scenarios, we propose a multimedia approach to leverage cues from the visual and th...|$|R

30|$|Once {{these three}} cases were <b>defined,</b> we used <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> (Miles & Huberman, 1994) to {{understand}} what factors this group of teachers felt were important {{to the success of}} STEM in their classrooms. This limited the scope of the analysis to only examine interview content that was uniquely related to STEM integration. For example, comments surrounding district-mandated time constraints were not considered. Each transcript was read and openly coded individually by the first and second authors (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). After reading and coding each interview for the given case, individual codes were discussed to check for places of agreement and disagreement between coders before moving on to reading the next transcript. Codes repeated across individual interviews allowed us to determine initial themes within each case before all transcripts were coded. Once all transcripts in all three cases were coded, we used a constant-comparative method to examine and re-examine codes to collapse them into themes across all nine interviews (Corbin & Strauss, 2008; Miles & Huberman, 1994). Once these themes were identified and refined, we further consulted the teaching logs and field notes to contextualize teachers’ comments surrounding their classroom implementation.|$|R

An experiment (N= 48) on 18 to 30 year-old women was run to see how the visual cognitive complexity of digital women's magazines' home pages affects the cognitive processing of individuals and their evaluations of the sites. A <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> of 13 online magazines was conducted and six magazine sites were chosen for the experiment and put in the complexity levels of low, medium, and high. There were two sites per level. Visual cognitive complexity did not affect the time it took participants to select a story or recognition. Additionally, perceived complexity did not match up to the levels operationally <b>defined</b> in the <b>content</b> <b>analysis.</b> The original measures were based off of Lang's concept of information introduced (I²). Although the hypotheses were not significant, a lot of insight can be gained about how to operationally define visual cognitive complexity. Although, the measure presented here did not yield significant results, there are ideas presented on how to build off this measure and create new measures for the future. This research is a starting point on studying visual complexity from a cognitive standpoint. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the article: The present {{manuscript}} summarizes {{benefits of}} the use of computer-based <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> in a generation phase of foresight initiatives. Possible advantages, disadvantages and limitations of the <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> for the foresight projects are discussed as well. Methodology/methods: In order to specify the benefits and identify the limitations of the <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> within the foresight, results of the generation phase of a particular foresight project performed without and subsequently with the use of computer based <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool were compared by two proposed measurements. Scientific aim: The generation phase of the foresight is the most demanding part in terms of analysis duration, costs and resources due to a significant amount of reviewed text. In addition, the conclusions of the foresight evaluation are dependent on personal views and perceptions of the foresight analysts as the evaluation is based merely on reading. The <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> may partially or even fully replace the reading and provide an important benchmark. Findings: The use of computer based <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool significantly reduced time to conduct the foresight generation phase. The <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool showed very similar results as compared to the evaluation performed by the standard reading. Only ten % of results were not revealed by the use of <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool. On the other hand, several new topics were identified by means of <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool that were missed by the reading. Conclusions: The results of two measurements should be subjected to further testing within more foresight projects to validate them. The computer based <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool provides valuable benchmark to the foresight analysts and partially substitute the reading. However, a complete replacement of the reading is not recommended, as deep understanding to weak signals interpretation is essential for the foresight...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{additional}} data regarding the reliability and validity of a previously developed Thinking/Feeling <b>Content</b> <b>Analysis</b> Scale (Seegmiller 2 ̆ 6 Epperson, 1987). The stability of Thinking/Feeling <b>Content</b> <b>Analysis</b> scores was investigated by obtaining two 5 -minute tape-recorded verbal samples from undergraduate student volunteers on separate occasions, approximately five weeks apart. Verbal samples were transcribed and analyzed to yield Thinking/Feeling <b>Content</b> <b>Analysis</b> scores.

First, subjects 2 ̆ 7 verbal <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> scores were correlated with the scores they obtained on the Thinking/Feeling Scale of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and a significant correlation was obtained. Second, subjects 2 ̆ 7 <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> scores were correlated with the scores they obtained on the Thinking and Feeling Scales of the Singer-Loomis Inventory of Personality. The relationship between <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> scores and SLIP thinking/feeling preference scores was not statistically significant.
