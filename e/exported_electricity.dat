40|$|Nowadays, the {{achievement}} of sustainable development constitutes an important constraint {{in the design of}} energy policies, being necessary the development of reliable indicators to obtain helpful information about the use of energy resources. The ecological footprint (EF) provides a referential framework for the analysis of human demand for bioproductivity, including energy issues. In this article, the theoretical bases of the footprint analysis are described by applying input-output tables of energy to estimate the Galician energy ecological footprint (EEF). It is concluded that the location of highly polluting industries in Galicia makes the Galician EEF quite higher than more developed regions of Spain. The relevance of the outer component of the Galician EEF is also studied. First, available information seems to indicate that the energy incorporated to the trading of manufactured goods would notably increase the Galician consumption of energy. On the other hand, the inclusion of electricity trade in the EEF analysis, including an adjustment, following the same philosophy as with manufactured goods is proposed. This adjustment would substantially reduce the Galician EEF, as the <b>exported</b> <b>electricity</b> widely exceeds the imported one. ...|$|E

In particular, the article deals with the economic benefit resulting on varied photovoltaic system and battery sizes, through a parametric analysis. Such an analysis is strongly dependent on the costs of photovoltaic systems and battery packs, which are prone to decrease in the coming years, according to many authors. In this context, the article investigates current and forecast economic scenarios, in order to show the expectable improvement in the financial performance in systems installed in the next few years. For this purpose, the article includes a review of photovoltaic system and battery prices forecasts for the coming years. The financial analysis takes into account two different (and conservative) feed-in tariffs: in the first case, the hourly national price of electricity is used as a feed in tariff, in the second case no reimbursement is considered for <b>exported</b> <b>electricity,</b> thus considering the case of wide photovoltaic system penetration and a consequent photovoltaic electricity overproductio...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{offsetting}} – {{the investment}} in carbon reduction activities {{to compensate for the}} carbon emitted by other activities – is a way for people to use carbon fuels without adding to global environmental damage. In 2010, the UK government introduced a feed-in-tariff scheme, which guaranteed small scale generators of electricity from renewable sources at a fixed price for the power they produced that is considerably above the wholesale market price. This was done specifically to encourage consumers to generate their own electricity. Under the scheme, it is unlikely that all the power will be generated by renewable means when it is needed, but it is possible to export surplus electricity to the grid, which can offset the <b>exported</b> <b>electricity</b> when the equipment is not generating. By exporting more electricity than is needed, it is possible to offset the carbon emissions from heating. This paper looks at the potential for using photovoltaic cells (PV) to provide a carbon offsetting scheme. It investigates the impact {{of the structure of the}} tariff to see if it encourages installations that are capable of offsetting the carbon used by a range of households...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{generation of}} electricity from renewable energy sources may imply issues {{in the management of}} national electric systems, due to the low predictability of electricity generation from renewable energy sources. In this regard, interesting opportunities come from the use of advanced control strategies for the management of electric devices such as heat pumps, able to exploit dynamic electricity prices aimed to induce users to absorb/generate electricity according with the electricity grid imbalance. In this paper, the results of building energy simulations applying tailored heat pump control strategies suitable for the integration within smart grids are presented. In particular, three heat pump control strategies are applied, whose action is based on the cost of electricity (absolute and relative to the following 12 h) and on the level of the local electricity generation from photovoltaics. The analyzed control strategies ensure relevant money savings (up to 30 %) and increase the degree of energy self-consumption (up to 12 % for <b>exported</b> <b>electricity</b> and 22 % for imported electricity). The analysis considers also comfort issues and shows that the best results may be achieved commanding the heat pump basing on the generation of the photovoltaic system {{as well as on the}} simultaneous heating/cooling loads and electricity prices...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the GHG emissions associated with producing bio-hydrocarbons via fast pyrolysis of Miscanthus. The feedstock is then upgraded to bio-oil products via hydroprocessing and zeolite cracking. Inventory {{data for this}} study were obtained from current commercial cultivation practices of Miscanthus in the UK and state-of-the-art process models developed in Aspen Plus®. The system boundary considered spans from the cultivation of Miscanthus to conversion of the pyrolysis-derived bio-oil into bio-hydrocarbons up to the refinery gate. The Miscanthus cultivation subsystem considers three scenarios for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates. These were assumed as follows: (i) excluding (SOC), (ii) low SOC and (iii) high (SOC) for best and worst cases. Overall, Miscanthus cultivation contributed moderate to negative values to GHG emissions, from analysis of excluding SOC to high SOC scenarios. Furthermore, the rate of SOC in the Miscanthus cultivation subsystem has significant effects on total GHG emissions. Where SOC is excluded, the fast pyrolysis subsystem shows the highest positive contribution to GHG emissions, while the credit for <b>exported</b> <b>electricity</b> was the main ‘negative’ GHG emission contributor for both upgrading pathways. Comparison between the bio-hydrocarbons produced from the two upgrading routes and fossil fuels indicates GHG emission savings between 68 % and 87 %.

The smart metering is experiencing a growth in Europe and the United States but the possibilities of its use are still uncertain, in our system we propose their use to manage the storage and to allow the user to know their electrical power and energy balances.

40|$|In Sweden, EU: s Water Framework Directive {{led to an}} {{investigation}} that started in April 2012 by the Swedish government, called Vattenverksamhetsutredningen freely translated to "Water Activities Survey", with the purpose to investigate the Environmental Code’s rules concerning water activities and water plants. The survey is divided into 3 reports, two sub-reports and a final report. One of the sub-report is focused on Swedish hydropower and the investigators found that many hydropower plants have old permits. One suggestion in the survey was to reconsider old permits so they would become consistence with today’s Environmental Code. There have been discussions regarding whether Sweden will lose much of its electricity production from hydropower as an outcome if the survey’s suggestions becomes reality. The aim with this literature study is to investigate how the EU: s Water Framework Directive and the Water Activities Survey will affect Swedish hydropower and if {{there will be a}} decrease in electricity production as an outcome if the suggestions made in the survey becomes reality. The results in this literature study shows that there will probably be a decrease in production for Swedish hydropower, but with how much is hard to say because the Swedish government has not yet decided what they will do with the suggested actions in the Water Activities Survey. A comparison is done with Sweden’s import and export statistics between the years 2001 - 2014 with a predicted loss of 13 TWh per year, which is a number taken from a survey made by Vattenfall. A comparison with a loss of half of 13 TWh per year is also done. Between the years 2001 and 2014 Sweden imported electricity 6 out of 14 years and <b>exported</b> <b>electricity</b> 8 out of 14 years.

The conclusions is that Sweden will have to import a lot more electricity if only looking at import and export statistic if the loss of electricity is between 6. 5 - 13 TWh per year...|$|E

40|$|With {{the current}} {{movement}} towards Net Zero Energy Buildings (Net ZEBs) decisions regarding energy carrier weighting factors will have implications on which technologies could be favoured or disfavoured, and therefore adopted or not adopted, {{in the building}} sector of the near future. These implications {{should be taken into}} consideration by policy makers when developing legislation and regulations addressing the building sector. A parametric analysis was conducted on six buildings in Europe of different typologies and climates in order to assess how different weighting factors would impact the choice of technical systems to be installed. For each combination the amount of PV capacity necessary to achieve a net zero balance has been calculated and used as the main indicator for comparison; where less PV area means more favourable condition. The effect of including a solar thermal system is also discussed. With the current European national weighting factors, biomass boiler is largely the preferred solution, frequently achieving the balance with PV installed on the roof, while gas boiler is the most penalized. The situation changes when strategic weighting factors are applied. Lower weighting factors for electricity and district heating, e. g. reflecting national targets of increased penetration of renewables in such grids, would promote the use of heat pump and district heating, respectively. Asymmetric factors aimed at rewarding electricity export to the grid would facilitate the achievement of the zero balance for all technologies, promoting cogeneration in some cases. On the contrary, low weighting factors for electricity, e. g. reflecting a scenario of high decarbonisation of the power system, prove quite demanding; only few technical solutions would be able to reach the balance within the available roof area for PV, because of the low value credited to <b>exported</b> <b>electricity.</b> In this situation, the preferred solution would be heat pumps combined with solar thermal. In addition, the choice of weighting factors and the resulting favoured technologies will determine the temporal matching of load and generation. While all-electric solutions tend to use the grid as seasonal storage, other solutions will have a yearly net export of electricity to the grid to compensate for the supply of other (thermal) energy carriers. Therefore, {{it is important to consider}} the implications for the electricity grid resulting from the choice of weighting factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} Swedish cogeneration {{importance for}} the domestic energy system and for the North European power exchange. Carbon dioxide emissions and generation cost of Swedish cogeneration is compared to imported or that by export replaced average electricity to and from Sweden. The comparison is for a historic period (2005 - 2010) where known annual electricity exchange data and cogeneration generation by fuel is used to compare actual emissions and cost. And a future period (2011 - 2020) based on the NREAP report, where projected electricity and cogeneration investments are used to estimate future CO 2 - emissions and generation cost. Also the new Rya NGCC CHP plant is compared to the North European marginal electricity generation for the historic period (2005 - 2010). The comparison is based on emissions of CO 2, NOx and SOx. The method uses fixed values for emissions factors, generation prices and fuel to energy efficiencies based on qualified sources for average values. The comparison is visualised in both diagram and tables. The result implies that the imported electricity has lower CO 2 -emissions compared to Swedish cogeneration. However when removing Norway from the comparison the result is different, now the imported electricity has higher CO 2 -emissions. The comparison for Swedish cogeneration and the by export replaced abroad average electricity is different annually {{depending on how much}} electricity Sweden exports to Norway. Removing Norway from the comparison makes Swedish cogeneration better from an emission point of view. The estimated generation cost of both imported and <b>exported</b> <b>electricity</b> is lower than Swedish cogeneration, even when the heat income from sold heat is accounted for. If Norway is once again removed from the comparison, the results shows that the generation cost of both the imported and by export replaced average electricity is similar to Swedish cogeneration. As cogeneration also generates useful heat it can be assumed to be a better alternative compared to the average electricity generation in these countries. Swedish cogeneration can however not compete with the cheap and emission free Norwegian hydro power. Future CO 2 -emissions will decrease faster for the North European average electricity compared to Swedish cogeneration, but will still be higher. The cost of generating this electricity will still be higher than Swedish cogeneration but the gap will decrease. Sweden will based on the results join Norway and generate enough CO 2 -free electricity by 2015 to meet its annual domestic needs. The efficient Rya NGCC CHP has lower emissions compared to marginal electricity in Northern Europe. The use of natural gas which is the cleanest fossil fuel alternative and the lower average efficiency in the abroad power generation makes Rya a relatively clean facility. Especially when keeping in mind the high heat demand that exists in Gothenburg’s urban area during winter season when Rya is operated...|$|E
