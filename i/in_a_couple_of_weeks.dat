5|$|Mac {{returns to}} work after a month's leave. When Caroline meets him she implies that she is engaged to Guy. Mac and Guy are then drunk in a bar, where Mac tells Guy {{he is going to}} die <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> and makes Guy promise he will not tell Caroline. However, Guy tells Martin, who then {{complains}} to him about his selfishness. However, Caroline walks in and overhears the argument. Meanwhile, Mac suggests to Sue that she finds someone else to love. Caroline confronts Mac about marrying her. Mac defends himself by saying {{it would be better for}} her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do the right thing, and tells Mac to propose to Caroline because they love each other. Caroline and Mac therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend. The special ends with Caroline floating away into the sky holding a mass of helium balloons.|$|E

25|$|On April 2, 2016, the Lightning {{announced}} that Stamkos {{was diagnosed with}} thoracic outlet syndrome, {{which is the same}} injury that sidelined teammate Andrei Vasilevskiy {{at the start of the}} season. It is a condition that is rare among hockey players. Stamkos said that he first felt some discomfort in his arm after the game against the Montreal Canadiens. He is scheduled for surgery on Monday with Dr. Karl Illig, who performed Vasilevskiy's surgery. Lightning General Manager, Steve Yzerman, stated that there will be no long-term impact on Stamkos' health or his career. In addition, Yzerman indicated that Stamkos recovery time would be between one and three months, but they would have a better idea <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> where he falls within that time frame. Yzerman also stated that the team's desire is for Stamkos to remain with the organization, which came after a question of whether Stamkos had played his last game in a Lightning uniform. On April 4, 2016, Stamkos had successful surgery at Tampa General Hospital. Stamkos' surgeon stated that they plan on evaluating him in approximately two weeks and that should clear up his prognosis. On May 26, 2016, Stamkos dressed for game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins despite still being on blood thinners following surgery. He registered five shot attempts during the game, but the Lightning ultimately lost 2-1 and were eliminated from the playoffs.|$|E

500|$|With the Cardinals down by 25 {{points in}} the fourth quarter, quarterback Neil Lomax threw for three touchdowns in a come-from-behind win. One of the touchdowns was to tight end Robert Awalt, the other two to league {{reception}} leader J.T. Smith. Donald Igwebuike's potential game-tying 53-yard field goal attempt bounced off the crossbar as time ran out. The Cardinals came in on a three-game losing streak, while the Buccaneers entered the game leading the league in takeaways. The attendance of 22,449 was the Cardinals' lowest in four years, the team having announced the previous week their plans {{to move to another}} city. Detectives were assigned to guard Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill due to death threats. Irritation over DeBerg's celebrations after his three touchdown passes provided inspiration to some of the Cardinals, who commented, [...] "he's going to lose his job to Vinny Testaverde <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> anyway". Awalt caught nine passes for 124yards, while Smith caught eight passes for 96yards. Said coach Perkins of his team's performance, [...] "...they whipped us in every phase of the game. Even down 28â€“3, they were playing better football than we were". After the Buccaneers turned three consecutive potential blowout wins into nail-biters, safety Rick Woods said that the team seemed to be playing not to lose instead of playing to win. As an example, he noted that many players turned to see how much time was left on the clock after Cardinals linebacker Niko Noga returned a James Wilder fumble for a touchdown. The next week, Woods was demoted to the taxi squad. Offensive tackle Rob Taylor suffered a strained medial collateral ligament, and center Randy Grimes was also out for the fourth quarter with a hyperextended knee. [...] "We should have gotten a lot more hurt", Perkins said, and accused his players of allowing positive press coverage to inflate their egos and cloud their judgments. The 25-point lead, if it had held, would have represented the largest margin of victory in a Buccaneers road win. Instead, it became the largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1939 Nazi-Germany and the Soviet Union {{signed the}} Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, where Finland and the Baltic states {{were given to}} the Soviet [...] "sphere of influence". After the Invasion of Poland, the Soviet Union sent ultimatums to the Baltic countries, where it demanded {{military}} bases on their soil. The Baltic states accepted Soviet demands, and lost their independence in the summer of 1940. In October 1939, the Soviet Union sent the same kind of request to Finland, but the Finns refused to give any land areas or military bases for the usage of the Red Army. This caused the Soviet Union to start a military invasion against Finland on 30 November 1939. Soviet leaders predicted that Finland would be conquered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> However, even though the Red Army had huge superiority in men, tanks, guns and airplanes, the Finns were able to defend their country about 3.5 months and still avoid invasion successfully. The Winter War ended on 13 March 1940 with the Moscow peace treaty. Finland lost the Karelian Isthmus to the Soviet Union after the war. The Winter War was a big loss of prestige for Soviet Union, and it was expelled from the League of Nations because of the illegal attack. Finland received lots of international goodwill and material help from many countries during the war.|$|E

2500|$|The MCC {{stayed for}} another game with {{reinforcements}} from the east; the Australian openers Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry and the strokemaker Norm O'Neill. Perth {{would not see}} a Test match until 1970-71 and this game helped to compensate by showing off some Test players and trying them out against the opposition. Barry Shepherd won the toss, but there was confusion over his decision to field. Ted Dexter led the MCC out, certain that Shepherd would bat and the Western Australian captain had to run out and call them back in. the big fast bowler Des Hoare (3/42) sent Colin Cowdrey and Ted Dexter back to the pavilion, the young Garth McKenzie (4/38) accounted for Tom Graveney and Ken Barrington and the MCC had lost four top batsmen for 14 runs in six overs. [...] "The Rev" [...] David Sheppard (43) and the Essex all rounder Barry Knight (65) held off the venomous attack until lunch, when Sheppard was caught by Simpson off Tony Lock (3/36), the tail failed to support Knight, and the MCC were out for 157. Lawry (52) and Simpson (109) were 96/0 at stumps and took their opening stand to 116 {{in the morning before}} Fred Trueman (3/65) separated them. The off-spinner David Allen (5/76) took the next five wickets, Vernon, O'Neill and Shepherd all failing and the Combined XI lost 7 wickets for 101 runs. The fielding was sluggish and catches were dropped as John parker (55) and McKenzie (48 not out) added 64 for the eighth-wicket and hoisted the score to 317. There was enough time for Hoare (5/60) to hand Cowdrey his pair before stumps, but Sheppard (92) and Dexter (60) added 99 and Sheppard and Barrington (44) 103 for the fourth wicket. These two stands made up two-thirds of the MCC's runs as they were out for 270, O'Neill's (2/30) part-time leg-breaks removed Dexter and Graveney and McKenzie (3/66) dismissed Sheppard and then took the last two wickets. Lawry and Simpson knocked off 50 runs on the same day, but Lawry retired hurt on 15 after his big toe was hit and Vernon helped Simpson (66 not out) gather in the runs, 111/0 in the MCC's first defeat at the WACA. Jack Fingleton thought they lost because of too much golf, which led to a press furore and some papers wondered if the MCC were cricketers who played golf or golfers who played cricket. After one poor round on the links the Duke joked that all this cricket was affecting his golf, and one journalist wrote that he had better give up his golf to improve his writing. Three of the keenest golfers were Ted Dexter, Colin Cowdrey and Ken Barrington, who made 102, 88 and 219 not out at the Melbourne Cricket Ground <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
