50|$|Size {{is one of}} {{the factors}} {{distinguishing}} a lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> from a greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover,</b> with the lesser being slightly smaller. However, {{it is not easy to}} rely on size alone especially when seen individually. The length of the bill is another distinguishing feature, with the lesser generally having a shorter bill compared to a greater. The colour of the legs in a lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> is generally darker, ranging from black to grey, while in a greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> it is much paler, ranging from grey to yellowish.|$|R
50|$|The lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover's</b> {{feeds on}} insects, {{crustaceans}} and annelid worms, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, {{rather than the}} steady probing of some other wader groups. This species takes fewer steps and shorter pauses than the greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> when feeding.|$|R
50|$|The bay {{regularly}} supports {{more than}} 1% {{of the population}} of at least 22 wader species: Greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover,</b> Lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover,</b> Oriental plover, Red-capped plover, Grey plover, Bar-tailed godwit, Black-tailed godwit, Red knot, Great knot, Red-necked stint, Curlew sandpiper, Sanderling, Eastern curlew, Little curlew, Whimbrel, Common greenshank, Common redshank, Grey-tailed tattler, Terek sandpiper, Ruddy turnstone, Asian dowitcher, and Pied oystercatcher.|$|R

50|$|The greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> {{is one of}} {{the species}} to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.|$|R
50|$|In all plumages, it is {{very similar}} to lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover,</b> Charadrius mongolus. Separating the species may be {{straightforward}} in mixed wintering flocks on an Indian beach, where the difference in size and structure is obvious; it is another thing altogether to identify a lone vagrant to western Europe, where both species are very rare. The problem is compounded in that the Middle Eastern race of the greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> is the most similar to the lesser species.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} rare vagrant birds have {{occurred}} at the marshes including a stilt sandpiper in 2002, and a lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> in 2003.|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} birds were named after Leschenault, {{including}} greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius leschenaultii [...] ), white-crowned forktail (Enicurus leschenaulti [...] ) and sirkeer malkoha (Phaenicophaeus leschenaultii [...] ).|$|R

Separating the species may be {{straightforward}} in mixed wintering flocks on an Indian beach, where the difference in size and structure is obvious; it is more difficult to identify a lone vagrant to western Europe, where both species are very rare. The problem is compounded in that the Middle Eastern race of greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> is the most similar to the lesser. The lesser usually has darker legs, a white forehead, and a more even white wing bar than the greater.|$|R

50|$|There {{are five}} races, {{and the large}} east Asian forms, C. m. mongolus and C. m. stegmanni, are {{sometimes}} given specific status as Mongolian plovers, Charadrius mongolus. If the taxonomic split is accepted, lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> as then defined becomes Charadrius atrifrons, including the three races atrifrons, pamirensis and schaeferi.|$|R
50|$|Many other waterbirds {{breed in}} colonies on the floodplain, {{especially}} egrets, herons and spoonbills, while the mudflats {{are used by}} flocks of migratory waders in summer.

5000|$|Some 96 km2 {{of the bay}} {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports, with its low-tide feeding habitat and high-tide roosting sites, over 1% of the world population of great knots.

50|$|As {{well as for}} bar-headed geese, with up to 125 {{breeding}} pairs {{using the}} site, the reserve was classified as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of several other bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants. These include Tibetan snowcocks, Himalayan snowcocks, ruddy shelducks, saker falcons, Himalayan vultures, lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> brown-headed gulls, yellow-billed choughs, Hume's larks, white-winged redstarts, white-winged snowfinches, rufous-streaked accentors, brown accentors, black-headed mountain-finches, Caucasian great rosefinches and red-fronted rosefinches.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a partial}} migrant. Birds leave the United States, except Florida, to winter south in Brazil. Some Mexican birds leave in winter for Peru. Furthermore, a small {{resident}} population is known from Brazil, it being named {{as a new}} subspecies, brasiliensis, in 2008. In 2012 it was established {{that this is a}} junior synonym, and the correct name for the subspecies is crassirostris. This also means that one of the subspecies of the greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> had to be renamed.|$|R

From April to July tens of thousands of birds migrate to the Kumana swamp area. Rare species such as black-necked stork, lesser adjutant, Eurasian spoonbill, and great thick-knee are breeding inhabitants. Waders belonging to families Scolopacidae and Charadriidae are among the visitors to the area along with waterfowl. Pintail snipes migrate here flying 9000 km to 11000 km from Siberia. Asian openbill, glossy ibis, purple heron, great egret, Indian pond heron, black-crowned night heron, intermediate egret, little egret, spot-billed pelican, Indian cormorant, little cormorant, common moorhen, watercock, purple swamphen, white-breasted waterhen, pheasant-tailed jacana, black-winged stilt, lesser whistling duck and little grebe are the bird species migrate here in large flocks.

One of the most numerous wintering shorebird is the lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius mongolus), which occurs in flocks of many thousands along the outer coast {{of the delta}}. The wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola) and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) are also abundant.|$|R
50|$|The Dawlish Warren {{nature reserve}} {{provides}} a major roosting site for wading birds and migratory waterfowl, {{and serves as}} a habitat for the endangered petalwort plant.

A large number of rare vagrant birds have been recorded at Dawlish Warren, including elegant tern, lesser crested tern, long-billed murrelet, greater <b>sand</b> <b>plover,</b> semipalmated plover, cream-coloured courser and great spotted cuckoo. Some sand lizards have also been spotted at the reserve, as a result of re-introductions.|$|R
50|$|The Bakers Creek Conservation Park {{occupies}} the south-east headland created by Bakers Creek entering into the Coral Sea. It is a protected area {{due to the}} need to preserve the shorebird habitat consisting of intertidal zones and mangroves; it has been declared a nationally important area for shorebirds. It has a population of the vulnerable species Eracus neglectus (beach stone-curlew). It is considered of internationally significant for migrating shorebirds such as the Charadrius mongolus (lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover),</b> Numenius madagascariensis (eastern curlew), Calidris tenuirostris (great knot) and Haematopus fuliginosus (sooty oystercatcher).|$|R
50|$|The {{lower part}} of Great Sandy Strait was listed under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of {{international}} significance in 1999. The area {{is also an important}} roosting site for CAMBA and JAMBA listed species. Some 806 km2 of the strait has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports about 120,000 non-breeding waders, including over 1% of the global populations of bar-tailed godwits, eastern curlews, great knots, grey-tailed tattlers, lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> pied oystercatchers, red-necked stints and red-capped plovers, as well as small numbers of the range-restricted mangrove honeyeater.|$|R
50|$|The mud {{from which}} the islands get their name is {{excellent}} feeding habitat for migratory waders. More than 1% of the known Australian populations of four wader species, Pacific golden plover, grey <b>plover,</b> lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> and ruddy turnstone, spend the summer around Mud Islands. More than 5% of the Victorian populations of red knot, great knot, eastern curlew and bar-tailed godwit feed in Swan Bay to the west but roost on the islands at high tide. Two resident waders, the pied oystercatcher and the red-capped plover, regularly breed on undisturbed parts of the islands.|$|R
