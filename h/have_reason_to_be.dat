6000|$|Ormsgill {{seemed to}} smile. [...] "In that case," [...] he said, [...] "he may <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sorry he ever entertained {{a notion of}} that kind." ...|$|E
60|$|She was as frightened as I at the prospect, and we <b>had</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{gazing at}} close range at the gleaming teeth and dog-like mouths.|$|R

6000|$|... "You don't say so?" [...] {{observed}} Flaggan. [...] "Well, now, I'd scarce {{have thought}} we <b>had</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so fearful {{of a small}} thing, with a stupid brown face like that." ...|$|R
