5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> itself. As the metabolism of <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> progresses there will be less <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and this will decrease the blood <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> concentration. <b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. <b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all cases attributable to <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> are reported to poison control centers. Most deaths from <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} drinking <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> Early symptoms include intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain.

40|$|Polyetheresteramides (PEEAs) {{have been}} {{synthesised}} in the melt from 1, 4 -butylene terephthalamide and <b>ethylene</b> or propylene <b>glycols.</b> The <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> were ethylenediol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol. The propylene glycols were 1, 3 -propanediol and the mixtures of 1, 2 - and 1, 3 -propylenediols, 1, 2 / 1, 3 -propanediol, dipropylene glycol and tripropylene glycol. The melting temperatures of the PEEAs decreased with increasing {{length of the}} <b>glycols.</b> The <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> have higher melting temperatures than the 1, 2 / 1, 3 -propylene glycols. The undercooling for these polymers determined at 20 °C min− 1 was low (20 – 35 °C), suggesting a very high rate of crystallisation of the copolymers. Injection moulded samples were analysed with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The glass transition temperature for the ethylenediol polymer was 122 °C and the Tg decreased with increasing glycol length to 42 °C for the tetraethylene glycol. The Tg/Tm ratio for these polymers was high (0. 69 – 0. 70). The dimensional stability of these copolymers above the Tg was high. The diethylene glycol PEEA had a melting temperature of 262 °C, a glass transition temperature of 103 °C, a shear modulus at 150 °C of 180 MF'a, an undercooling of 28 °C, a stress at break of 65 MPa and a modulus of 2. 9 GPa...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in the removal of <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and its metabolites from the blood. Hemodialysis also has the added benefit of correcting other metabolic derangements or supporting deteriorating kidney function. Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If hemodialysis is not available, then peritoneal dialysis also removes <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> although less efficiently.|$|E

Good biological degradability of tested substrates was found, a "primary" degradability of 75 % - 98 % in a 10 -day interval. Obtained results, in accord with our previous work, proved the dominant proportion of degradative scission in the hydrophile part of surfactant molecule. During biological degradation, no significant cumulation of mono- up to polyethylene glycols appeared neither that of mono- or dicarboxylic acids, and degradation of these components was not the rate-determining degradation factor...|$|R

5|$|<b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic to {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs. A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of pure substance. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child.

The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to propose a simple cubic {{equation}} of state for the prediction of phase equilibria in highly non ideal systems. The NRTL-PR equation of state is based on the association of the Peng−Robinson EoS and the generalized NRTL model developed in the first part of this work. This model, which derives from the lattice two-fluid theory, was specially developed to take account for the differences in size and shape between mixture components. The main advantage of the resulting NRTL-PR equation of state is to yield a simple and predictive model, depending on very few interaction parameters.

5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E
