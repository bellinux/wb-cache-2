5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, the third section is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece <b>departs</b> <b>from</b> the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin <b>departs</b> <b>from</b> the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues form and the next two measures extend the subdominant as a transition into the last ten bars.|$|E

60|$|Fourth, To <b>depart</b> <b>from</b> iniquity is to <b>depart</b> <b>from</b> the ENTICINGS of iniquity. There {{is that in}} iniquity that is of an {{enticing}} nature. Its pleasures, profits, honours, delights, and sweetnesses are enticing, and he that hankers {{after these}} is not <b>departed</b> nor <b>departing</b> <b>from</b> iniquity. A man must be weaned from these things, and must find some things somewhere else that are better than these, else he cannot <b>depart</b> <b>from</b> iniquity.|$|R
60|$|Third, To <b>depart</b> <b>from</b> iniquity, is to <b>depart</b> <b>from</b> it {{in those}} EXAMPLES that are set before us thereto: {{occasions}} and examples are sometimes the same, {{but there may}} be occasions to sin where there are no examples thereto, and therefore in that they differ. And to <b>depart</b> <b>from</b> iniquity is to shun and <b>depart</b> <b>from</b> those examples, those beastly examples, that in every corner of the country present themselves to men.|$|R

5|$|The concerto is {{innovative}} in many respects. In {{the first}} movement alone, Mendelssohn <b>departs</b> <b>from</b> the typical {{form of a}} Classical concerto in many ways, the most immediate being the entry of the soloist almost from the outset, which also occurs in his First Piano Concerto. Although the first movement is mostly in the conventional sonata form, Mendelssohn has the first theme played by the solo violin {{and then by the}} orchestra. Classical concertos typically opened with an orchestral introduction followed by a version of essentially the same material that incorporates the soloist.|$|E

According to Cornish legend King Arthur did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated {{into the body of}} a red-billed chough, the red colour of its bill and legs being derived from the blood of the last battle and hence killing this bird was unlucky. Legend also holds that after the last Cornish chough <b>departs</b> <b>from</b> Cornwall, then the return of the chough, as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 {{conspiracy}} fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, {{there was a new}} level of public interest in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but <b>departs</b> <b>from</b> the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a Merovingian sacred king descended from the historical Jesus, the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore the feminist theology necessary for a complete understanding of early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, as well as in his public appearances and interviews.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor <b>departs</b> <b>from</b> this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} of , the antennae of the Submillimeter Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are arranged on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the antennae on a curve of constant width causes the observatory {{to have the same}} spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform of the signal from the array. The antennae may be moved from one Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired angular resolution of each observation. The precise placement of the antennae on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory <b>departs</b> <b>from</b> the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.|$|E
