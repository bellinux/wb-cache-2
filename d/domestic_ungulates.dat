Since 2002, the application of several sanitary regulations has limited the availability of feeding resources provided by domestic carcasses, but theoretical studies assessing whether the availability of food resources provided by wild ungulates are enough to cover energetic requirements are lacking. Methodology/Findings: We assessed food provided by a wild ungulate population in two areas of NE Spain inhabited by three vulture species and developed a P System computational model to assess the effects of the carrion resources provided on their population dynamics. We compared the real population trend with to a hypothetical scenario in which only food provided by wild ungulates was available. Simulation testing of the model suggests that wild ungulates constitute an important food resource in the Pyrenees and the vulture population inhabiting this area could grow if only the food provided by wild ungulates would be available. On the contrary, in the Pre-Pyrenees there is insufficient food to cover the energy requirements of avian scavenger guilds, declining sharply if biomass from domestic animals would not be available.

While ungulate herbivores generally reduce standing biomass, their effects on aboveground net primary production (ANPP) can vary by spatial and temporal context, intensity of herbivory, and herbivore identity and species richness. Some evidence indicates that moderate levels of herbivory can stimulate aboveground productivity, but few studies have explicitly tested the relationships among herbivore identity, grazing intensity, and ANPP. We used a long- term exclosure experiment {{to examine the effects}} of three groups of wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>ungulate</b> herbivores (megaherbivores, mesoherbivore wildlife, and cattle) on herbaceous productivity in an African savanna. Using both ﬁeld measurements (productivity cages) and satellite imagery, we measured the effects of different herbivore guilds, separately and in different combinations, on herbaceous productivity across both space and time. Results from both productivity cage measurements and satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) demonstrated a positive relationship between mean productivity and total ungulate herbivore pressure, driven in particular by the presence of cattle. In contrast, we found that variation in herbaceous productivity across space and time was driven by the presence of wild herbivores (primarily mesoherbivore wildlife), which significantly reduced heterogeneity in ANPP and NDVI across both space and time.

This ibis may also be in potential competition with humans during amphibian and swamp eel harvesting during the dry season. Alongside direct habitat loss through land development, the white-shouldered ibis’s habitat could also be threatened indirectly through modern agricultural mechanisation to replace traditional keeping of <b>domestic</b> <b>ungulates</b> that graze and trample on underlying vegetation and wallow in mud to maintain forest clearings and seasonal pools as important foraging ground for ibis. [...] The potentially adverse agricultural changes may be driven by the increasing profitability of mechanised farming. The hypothesis concerning the importance of ungulates to ibises in creating suitable habitats has been supported in exclosure experiments which show increased vegetation height and cover in exclosures fenced to bar ungulates compared to unfenced controls. Therefore, the marked decline of traditional farming livelihood practices potentially beneficial to white-shouldered ibis could lead to increased vegetation growth beside pools in clearings, and thereby render these sites unsuitable foraging ground for this ibis. This may be especially likely considering the local extinction or dramatic decline of many wild ungulate species whose role in ibis habitat creation and maintenance has been largely taken over by human-reared ungulates with equivalent functions.|$|E

Polymerase chain reaction followed by reverse line blotting and sequencing allowed detecting 16 tick-borne pathogen species {{belonging to the}} genera Babesia, Theileria, Anaplasma, and Ehrlichia. Ten pathogen species were involved in 29 new host-pathogen combinations. Most infections (77. 9 %) involved more than one pathogen species. Principal component analysis (PCA) assigned the 163 infections, identified to species level, to 4 groups. Three groups were associated with sheep, cattle, and horse and their respective wild counterparts. Each group was characterised by high homogeneity in pathogen assemblage and host phylogenetic status. These groups characterised the most privileged transmission routes between and among wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>ungulates.</b> The 4 th group showed high heterogeneity in pathogen assemblage and host phylogenetic status. This group seems to indicate frequent spill over events in impala of pathogens that usually circulate among cattle- or sheep-related species. Within 6 localities, we sampled {{an equal number of}} wild and domestic animals (n = 128). On this dataset once having controlled for the significant variation among localities, the infection prevalence and intensity of infection did not differ significantly between wild and domestic hosts.

Mutagenicity tests represent a good method for genotoxic effect evaluation of environmental pollutants. The micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood and bone marrow erythrocytes has been evaluated in four <b>domestic</b> <b>Ungulate</b> species (ox, sheep, swine and horse). For each species two or three groups of animals coming from Italy and other European countries were analysed and the results indicate a relatively low mean frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes (ME), both in peripheral blood and bone marrow. The comparison between these two frequencies in the four species studied shows that the ME frequency in sheep and horse is significantly higher in peripheral blood than in bone marrow, whereas in bovines it is higher in the bone marrow, and in swine the difference is not significant. These results could indicate that in ox and swine the spleen is involved in ME removal from the peripheral circulation, as is known for other species including man. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the same occurs {{in the other two}} species, since they exhibit a relatively low peripheral blood ME frequency as well. Further studies on domestic mammals are needed to clarify the spleen function and verify the use of the peripheral blood micronucleus test for genotoxic biomonitoring. At present, the application of the micronucleus test to the bone marrow seems a more suitable method, but, being invasive, it can be used only as a control system of animal hygiene and health, in addition to the routine tests, rather than for biomonitoring.

40|$|Aims: Aspen forests {{around the}} {{northern}} hemisphere provide rich biodiversity compared to surrounding vegetation types. In both North America and Europe, however, aspen are threatened {{by a variety of}} human impacts: clear-felling, land development, water diversions, fire suppression, and both wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>ungulate</b> herbivory. We conducted a landscape assessment of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) for the purpose of identifying key components of resilience. Specifically, we strove to test novel measures linking plant-animal interactions, compare crucial functional differences in aspen types, and make appropriate restorative recommendations based on the outcome of these assessments. Location: The Book Cliffs region of eastern Utah and western Colorado, USA. Methods: Seventy-seven one hectare plots were sampled for forest structure, composition, regeneration and recruitment, landscape elements, browse level, and herbivore use. Use was determined by counting the number of pellet groups by ungulate species at each sample location. We tested the efficacy of a visual stand condition rating system when compared to objective metrics. A series of non-parametric analyses were used to compare functional aspen types and stand condition groups by key variables. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) allowed us to explore all our data to find the most critical measures of aspen stand conditions for the purpose of better informing future aspen monitoring. Results: Results indicate that plots differed significantly by seral or stable aspen functional types, stand condition rating, and browse species use. Ordination analysis revealed that regeneration level and herbivore use were the strongest objective indicators of aspen stand conditions, while the stand condition rating proved a valuable subjective index of forest status. While ungulate herbivory of aspen is problematic internationally, our results show acute impacts where moderate slopes, relatively low water availability, and intense browsing predominate. Conclusions: Appropriate measures of aspen communities, informed by crucial functional divisions, have allowed us to gain a clear understanding of conditions across this large landscape. Overall, aspen in our study landscape is highly vulnerable to collapse due to narrow physiographic and climate limitations and browse levels. Without herbivory reduction, future conservation in such areas will be strained and widespread system failure may occur...|$|R

When comparing different early human-foal interactions, we found that early exposure to a motionless human enhanced slightly foals reactions to humans whereas forced stroking or handling in early life did not improve later human-foal relation. Foals that were assisted during their first suckling (e. g., brought to the dam's teat) even tended to avoid human approach at 2 weeks, and physical contact at I month of age. We argue that interspecies differences may exist in how tactile stimulation is perceived.

In addition, the introduction of non-native wild ungulate species in areas occupied by the ibex (e.g. fallow deer and mouflon in the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park) increased the grazing pressure, as well as the risk of transmission of both native and exotic diseases.|$|R
