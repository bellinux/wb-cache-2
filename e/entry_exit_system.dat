40|$|Glucose {{transport}} in Cladosporium resinae was {{studies with}} the aid of the non-metabolizable glucose analogue 3 -O-methyl-D-glucose (3 -O-MG). 3 -O-MG, transported as a free sugar without phosphorylation, was found to inhibit glucose uptake competitively. Conversely, glucose was a competitive inhibitor of 3 -O-MG uptake. Moreover, both glucose and 3 -O-MG were able to bring about rapid counterflow intracellular 3 -O-MG. Thus, glucose and 3 -O-MG share the same <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> <b>systems.</b> The transport of 3 -O-MG is carrier mediated and energy dependent as shown by saturation kinetics, strong temperature dependence, accumulation of unaltered 3 -O-MG against a concentration gradient, and inhibition of uptake by NaN 3, NaCN, and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol. The glucose transport system appeared to be constitutive for glucose transport in cells grown on fructose, galactose, mannose, xylose, or glucose. There was no derepressible low-Km glucose transport system in C. resinae. n-Hexane and n-heptane were found to inhibit 3 -O-MG uptake rapidly at temperatures above 20 C. Over 50 % inhibition of the uptake rate occurred after only 10 min of incubation with n-hexane at 30 C. The percentage of inhibition in the presence of n-hexane, compared to controls in the absence of n-hexane, was found to increase with increasing temperature. Longer-chain n-alkanes (C 8 to C 18) had no significant effect on uptake.

Not only vehicles parked in public places are likely to be lost, but the vehicles in an area with security guards are also likely to be lost. For example, in government departments such as the office parking area, housing areas with guard posts and even in Universiti Malaysia Pahang itself. Student and staff of UMP need a safer place to park their vehicles. In UMP, the supervision at guard post is done manually where a few security guards will be stationed at each guard post to monitor the <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> of vehicles. The possibility of stolen vehicle is high because there is no identity inspection done to every vehicle’s owner that enter and exit UMP area.

While the importance of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> has been recognised, attention has focused almost exclusively on quantifying barriers to them, rather than on investigating the determinants of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> and measuring the magnitude of these processes.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{provision}} of eye {{care in the}} developing world has been constrained by the limited number of trained personnel and by professional cultures. The use of personnel with specific but limited training as members of multidisciplinary teams has become increasingly important as health systems seek to extract better value from their investments in personnel. Greater positive action is required to secure more efficient allocation of roles and resources. The supply of professional health workers is a factor of the training system, so {{it stands to reason that}} more cost-effective, flexible and available education methods are needed. This paper presents a highly flexible competencies-based multiple <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> training <b>system</b> that matches and adapts training to the prevailing population and service needs and demands, while lifting overall standards over time and highlighting the areas of potential benefit. Methods Literature surveys and interviews in five continents were carried out. Based on this and the author's own experience, a encies-based multiple <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> scheme for eye care in a developing country was derived, modeled and critically reviewed by interested parties in one country. Results The scheme was shown to be highly cost-effective and readily adaptable to the anticipated eye care needs of the population. Eye care players in one selected country have commented favourably on the scheme. Conclusion The underlying principles used to derive this model can be applied to many eye care systems in many developing countries. The model can be used in other disciplines with similar constructs to eye care. </p...|$|R

When both <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> equations are estimated separately the results support the existence of strong symmetry in their determinants. When, however, <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> are estimated within a simultaneous equation framework, the empirical evidence does not offer sufficient grounds to support the notion that <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> are simultaneously linked. Instead it seems that they are two contemporaneously related processes which respond in like fashion to the structural characteristics found in particular industries. Their linked response is also extended to factors unaccounted for by the individual <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> formulations, and this expresses itself in significant contemporaneous correlation between the <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> equation residuals. The change in the identities of firms operating, implied by the positive correlation between <b>entry</b> and <b>exit,</b> may then be attributed to industry turbulent conditions, which in turn appear perhaps to be conditioned in the shorter run by time-invariant inter-industry differences in technological factors and sunk costs. ...|$|R

The estimation exploited the negative binomial model to investigate the role of trigger points (thresholds) on the observed number of <b>entry</b> or <b>exit</b> firms in Dutch glasshouse horticulture over 25 years. Firms should overcome different thresholds depending on types of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit.</b> Marshallian trigger points function {{as good as the}} ones based on Real Option theory.

We show that a heterogeneous-firm model with uncertainty and sunk entry costs can explain these results.

The paper discusses how <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> rates in industrial sectors {{are affected by}} previous <b>exit</b> and <b>entry</b> rates. Economic theory presents two different approaches to how <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> of firms are interrelated, the multiplier effect and the competition effect.

The empirical analysis is based on data for 25 Swedish manufacturing industries at the 2 -digit SIC level, during the period 1991 – 2000. In the estimation work the study applies a dynamic panel data approach as suggested by Anderson and Hsiao [Journal of the American Statistical Association, 76 : 598 – 606, 1981] and Arellano and Bond [Review of Economic Studies, 58 (2) : 277 – 297, 1991].
