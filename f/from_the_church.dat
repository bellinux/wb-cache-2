5|$|The {{most urgent}} problem facing the new Emperor was the {{scarcity}} of resources left in the imperial treasury.

5|$|According to the church, its {{membership}} as of 2016 was 63,392, which represented approximately 60 percent of Tonga's population. The church also reported 166 congregations, one mission, and one temple. However, {{according to the}} 2011 Tongan census, 18,554 people self-identify as Mormon, making it the second-largest religion in the country, ahead of Catholicism and behind Methodism. LDS Church membership statistics are different from self-reported statistics, mainly because the LDS Church does not remove an individual's name from {{its membership}} rolls based on disengagement <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} five years at Wells, Wheelwright {{received}} an invitation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> and town of Hampton, then under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as a pastor of the church there. Without apparent hesitation he went there in the spring of 1647 and entered into a written agreement with a committee of the church and town. He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts, or 24 June 1647 by another. The job afforded the 55-year-old Wheelwright with a larger salary than the parish at Wells did, an important consideration given the large size of his family. No longer in a frontier setting, he was now within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement, more aligned with his educational background.|$|E

5|$|After their Hampstead {{home was}} hit by bomb {{shrapnel}} in September 1940, Moore and Irina moved out of London {{to live in a}} farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of Perry Green near Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. This was to become Moore's home and workshop {{for the rest of his}} life. Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore never felt the need to move to larger premises and, apart from the addition of a number of outbuildings and studios, the house changed little over the years. In 1943 he received a commission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of St. Matthew, Northampton, to carve a Madonna and Child; this sculpture was the first in an important series of family-group sculptures.|$|E
5|$|Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard is a posthumous {{biography}} of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard by British journalist Russell Miller.

It quotes extensively from official documents acquired using the Freedom of Information Act and from Hubbard's personal papers, which were obtained via a defector <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church.</b> It was also published in Australia, Canada and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, George Ripley {{was pushed}} to attend Harvard College {{by his father}} and {{completed}} his studies in 1823. He went on graduate from the Harvard Divinity School {{and the next year}} married Sophia Dana. Shortly after, he became ordained as the minister of the Purchase Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts, where he began to question traditional Unitarian beliefs. He became one of the founding members of the Transcendental Club and hosted its first official meeting in his home. Shortly after, he resigned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> to put Transcendental beliefs in practice by founding an experimental commune called Brook Farm. The community later converted to a model {{based on the work of}} Charles Fourier, although the community was never financially stable in either format.|$|E

5|$|During {{and after}} the battle, Waller {{captured}} at least 500 men, around 100 of these re-enlisting with him. Additionally, more than 100 Royalist soldiers were killed. Together, the men lost represented nearly half of Hopton's infantry forces in the south. Waller, on the other hand, lost around ten men and gained much reputation for his success. Waller put his prisoners to work dragging the horse carcasses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> dismantling the scaffoldings inside, and burying their fallen comrades near the northern wall of the building. All of the captured men were then marched to Farnham tied together in pairs.|$|E
5|$|Further {{additions}} to the interior were made over the next quarter-century. A new Gothic altar, produced in Düsseldorf, Germany, was installed in 1880. Two years later a communion bench was installed. The tower was also given a clock and bells during this period; the clock was removed in 1978 since the machinery was broken. Lijden died in 1882, and the Jesuit Joannes de Vries became the parish priest, the first in an unbroken line of Jesuit pastors which continues until the present day. De Vries was soon after elected provincial superior for the province, and thus {{he spent much of}} his time away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> By 1885 there were 1,620 Catholics in Semarang, up from approximately a thousand four years earlier. Many of these were in the colonial military.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{was educated}} at a Christian Gymnasium, where he {{completed}} his Abitur (university entrance examination) in 1917.

His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and Goebbels seriously considered it. He studied literature and history at the universities of Bonn, Würzburg, Freiburg, and Munich, aided by a scholarship from the Albertus Magnus Society. By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E

5|$|Heazlewood {{speculated that}} the later 1865 church was {{probably}} used for classes due {{the small size of}} the wooden school building. The school grew to around 100 pupils on the register in 1900. The church building, also used for Wesleyen Sunday school, was used as a school until 1929. For this period the Education Department rented it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> trustees. A new school was built, on donated land, opposite the church and next to the recreation ground. This state school was opened in a ceremony on 23 August 1929. The school remained open as late as the end of 1954.|$|E
