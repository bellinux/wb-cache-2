Ereshkigal is in mourning at {{the death of her}} consort, Gugalanna (The Wild Bull of Heaven Sumerian Gu = Bull, Gal = Great, An = Heaven). [...] She passed through seven gates and at each one was required to leave a garment or an ornament so that when she had passed through the seventh gate she was a simple woman, entirely naked. Despite warnings about her presumption, she did not turn back but dared to sit herself down on Ereshkigal's throne. Immediately the Anunnaki of the underworld judged her, <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with the eyes of death, and she became a corpse, hung up on a meathook.|$|E
