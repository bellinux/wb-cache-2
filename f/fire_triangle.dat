25|$|A fire burns {{due to the}} {{presence}} of three elements, often referred to as being the <b>fire</b> <b>triangle.</b> These are: fuel, oxygen and heat. The aim of firefighting is to deprive the fire of {{at least one of these}} elements. Sometimes this is referred to as a fire tetrahedron if a fourth element is added: a chemical chain reaction that can sustain or re-kindle a fire. Firefighters are equipped with a wide variety of equipment to accomplish this task. Some of their tools include ladder trucks, pumper trucks, tanker trucks, fire hose, and fire extinguishers. Very frequent training and refresher training is required.|$|E

50|$|Some chemicals, such as {{fluorine}} gas, perchlorate salts such as ammonium perchlorate, or chlorine trifluoride, act as oxidisers, {{sometimes more}} powerful ones than oxygen itself. A fire {{based on a}} reaction with these oxidisers can {{be very difficult to}} put out until the oxidiser is exhausted; that leg of the <b>fire</b> <b>triangle</b> cannot be broken by normal means (i.e., depriving it of air will not smother it).|$|E
50|$|Sparks are an {{ignition}} source in combustible environments {{that may lead}} to catastrophic explosions in concentrated fuel environments. Most explosions {{can be traced back to}} a tiny electrostatic discharge, whether it was an unexpected combustible fuel leak invading a known open air sparking device, or an unexpected spark in a known fuel rich environment. The end result is the same if oxygen is present and the three criteria of the <b>fire</b> <b>triangle</b> have been combined.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is proven}} that CAFS attacks all three {{sides of the}} <b>fire</b> <b>triangle</b> simultaneously. The foam {{blankets}} the fuel, thereby reducing the fuel’s capacity to seek out a source of oxygen. The CAFS solution adheres to ceilings and walls, more readily aiding in rapid reduction in heat. Also, the opaque surfaces of the foam, as it adheres to walls and ceilings, shield the fuel source from radiant energy. (Brooks, 2005; Brooks, 2006) ...|$|E

50|$|The fire {{tetrahedron}} {{represents the}} addition of a component in the chemical chain reaction, to the three already present in the <b>fire</b> <b>triangle.</b> Once a fire has started, the resulting exothermic chain reaction sustains the fire and allows it to continue until or unless {{at least one of the}} elements of the fire is blocked. Foam can be used to deny the fire the oxygen it needs. Water can be used to lower the temperature of the fuel below the ignition point or to remove or disperse the fuel. Halon can be used to remove free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas in a direct attack on the chemical reaction responsible for the fire.|$|E
50|$|The {{triangle}} {{illustrates the}} three elements a fire needs to ignite: heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent (usually oxygen). A fire naturally {{occurs when the}} elements are present and combined in the right mixture, meaning that fire is actually an event rather than a thing. A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing {{any one of the}} elements in the <b>fire</b> <b>triangle.</b> For example, covering a fire with a fire blanket removes the oxygen part of the triangle and can extinguish a fire. In large fires where firefighters are called in, decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a volume}} {{protected}} by hypoxic air, a normobaric hypoxic atmosphere is continuously retained: hypoxic {{means that the}} partial pressure of the oxygen is lower than at the sea level, normobaric means that the barometric pressure {{is equal to the}} barometric pressure at the sea level. Usually 5%/10% of oxygen contained in the air is replaced by the same amount of nitrogen: as a consequence a hypoxic atmosphere containing around 15 Vol% of oxygen and 85 Vol% of nitrogen is created. In a normobaric hypoxic environment, common materials cannot ignite or burn. Thus, considering the <b>fire</b> <b>triangle,</b> a fire cannot occur {{because of the lack of}} sufficient oxygen. [...] "However, at 15% oxygen level, risk for fire still exists, and the system cannot be seen as an alternative to extinguishing systems.".|$|E

50|$|The <b>Triangle</b> of <b>Fire</b> (French: Le <b>triangle</b> de feu) is a 1932 French-German crime film {{directed}} by Edmond T. Gréville and Johannes Guter and starring Jean Angelo, André Roanne and Elisabeth Pinajeff.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the basic}} {{rules of the}} <b>fire</b> <b>triangle,</b> for a {{reaction}} to take place three ingredients are required: oxygen, fuel, and heat. In the case of wax melted down, only the top surface has access to oxygen, so the fire progresses slowly. When water {{is added to the}} wax, two things happen. Firstly, the water — being denser than wax — sinks {{to the bottom of the}} container. Secondly, as burning wax quickly reaches a temperature of well over 200 degrees C, the water instantly vapourises. When water changes from a liquid to a gas, there is more than a thousand-fold increase in volume. The water expands violently, and throws the hot wax layer above it into the air as small droplets. The wax now has a much bigger surface area exposed to oxygen so combustion takes place very quickly.|$|E
50|$|The ECO Funnel {{resolves}} a {{long standing}} incongruity between federally mandated safety protocol and standard laboratory practice. The traditional method for handling fluid waste {{is to set}} a standard funnel onto the mouth of an open bottle, which is sometimes stored under a fume hood. This is out of compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1450 and EPA 40 CFR 264.173. Testing confirms that these methods allow chemicals to evaporate, contaminating the surrounding atmosphere and posing a health risk not only to laboratory workers, but to neighboring areas. Additionally, chemical contaminants in the atmosphere, in combination with normal oxygen levels in the lab, fulfill {{two of the three}} components necessary to complete the <b>fire</b> <b>triangle.</b> Further, chemical spills in the laboratory preclude procedures of safe disposal, leading these toxins to end up in landfills, and consequently, soil, rivers and oceans. As plant and animal life are effected, the consequences escalate exponentially.|$|E
50|$|Specialized {{equipment}} {{is required to}} meet OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1450 and EPA 40 CFR 264.173. standards of safety. Minimal recommended equipment include a fume hood and primary and secondary waste containers to capture potential overflow. Even beneath the fume hood, containers containing chemical contaminants should remain closed when not in use. An open funnel placed {{in the mouth of}} a waste container has been shown to allow significant evaporation of chemicals into the surrounding atmosphere, which is then inhaled by laboratory personnel, and contributes a primary component to the threat of completing the <b>fire</b> <b>triangle.</b> To protect {{the health and safety of}} laboratory staff as well as neighboring civilians and the environment, proper waste management equipment, such as the Burkle funnel in Europe and the ECO Funnel in the U.S., should be utilized in any department which deals with chemical waste. It is to be dumped after treatment.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Physical properties== Wildfires {{occur when}} all of the {{necessary}} elements of a <b>fire</b> <b>triangle</b> come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to sufficient heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are required to evaporate any water within the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.|$|E
5000|$|Gani Kryeziu {{was born}} in Gjakova, Vilayet of Kosovo, Ottoman Albania, {{as a member of}} {{powerful}} Kryeziu family, a ruling family derived from the Ottoman cast. He was the brother of Ceno Bey Kryeziu, Albanian politician and diplomat known as a Serbian agent, as well as Said Bey and Hasan Bey, both resistance and anti-communists fighters, and son of Riza Bey Kryeziu, an influential local bey who had contributed in the League of Junik and was one of activists of Albanian national movements of early 20th century.Gani grew up in Serbia, attended a military academy in Sarajevo, and served in the Serbian army in early '20s, as well as aide-de-camp for Alexander I of Yugoslavia, and for a short time in Albania during 1925 after the June Revolution and Zogu coming into power. He would become an enemy of Ahmet Zogu after the assassination of his brother Ceno in Prague in 1927 by Alkiviadh Bebi, and agent of Ahmet Zogu.In 1932, he and his brother were sentenced to death in absence for trying to disturb the internal order. With the Italian Invasion of Albania he joined the resistance, while keeping tight contacts with the British Intelligence. The British tried to send him in Kukës region to proclaim himself as the ruler of an autonomous Albania, in contrast with the Fascist Albanian state, but the project never came to life. The Germans caught him, imprisoned in Zemun, and later handed over to the Italians, who imprisoned him. After the invasion of Italy in 1943, he returned to Albania helped by Mehmet Bey Konica. He gathered up a group of fighters with the support of his kin, and proclaim to combat the Germans. Enver Hoxha would mention him as a Serbian agent,... he and his crew never really shot a gun against the Germans. Hoxha would consider him as an important adversary to liquidate. Gani continued to fight, as a key member of the liberation anti-communist resistance {{with the support of the}} British side (Sir Jocelyn Percy and Dayrell Oakley-Hil), but was caught in a <b>fire</b> <b>triangle</b> between the Germans, Albanian partisans, and Kosovo partisans of Fadil Hoxha. The Albanian partisans caught him in 1945, handed him over to the Yugoslavian communists who surprisingly sentenced him to only five years of hard labor.In 1949, he founded the [...] "League of Albanian Political Refugees" [...] in Prizren, which headquarters will reside in Shkup, and a military base in Peć, together with Cen Elezi (1884 - 1949), and helped sending insurgents to Albania with the support of American, British (who had intervened to the Yugoslavian side for his release) and Yugoslavian intelligence, somehow lacking coordination with the [...] "National Committee for a Free Albania" [...] of Mit'hat Frashëri where his brother Said was a co-founder. Gani's and Elezi's men would cross the border in the area of Prizren, into the Albanian territory, declaring war on the communists in power and agitating for an Albanian-Yugoslavian friendship. Cen Elezi would over-trust the Yugoslavs, he got arrested by the Yugoslavian authorities, and considering the nationalist background of his family and lack of the credibility that Kryeziu had, would spend months in interrogation rooms, until his body gave up and died in 1949.On February 28, 1950, the New York Times reported that two teams of Albanian anti-communist units, trained in Malta, had landed in Albania with instructions to contact Gani's men in the north. They were ambushed and the operation failed.Gani Kryeziu died in 1952.|$|E
