40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} {{by which to}} observe the consequences of enlargement of the European Union. We outline the sincere positions {{of the old and}} new EU members, using a one-dimensional spatial model to predict a range of stable policy outcomes under two proposed sets of voting rules: qualified majority voting (QMV), and a <b>dual</b> <b>majority</b> requiring a majority of the members states encompassing 60 % of the EU's population. We show that the positions of the ten joining countries tend to fall outside of the range of stable outcomes under QMV, and even more so under the <b>dual</b> <b>majority</b> rule. ...|$|E
40|$|The December 2003 Brussels summit {{failed to}} agree on the draft Constitution for the EU which had been {{proposed}} by the European Convention. Spain and Poland rejected the proposal to move from the new voting arrangements agreed at Nice, which were still based mainly on weighted votes, to a system in which decisions could be adopted by a simple majority of states representing 60 % of total population. The Nice arrangements are unnecessarily complex, whereas the <b>dual</b> <b>majority</b> is simpler and more efficient. Moreover, Spain and Poland have a special interest. They are very favourably treated under Nice, but are relative losers, compared to Germany and small states, in any move to a <b>dual</b> <b>majority.</b> Yet these countries’ weighting under Nice is not quite so disproportionate or inappropriate as is alleged, taking into account the characteristics of the EU system. Moreover, there are broader issues at stake. Does the EU still need weighted votes in order to maintain a balance between states? Are EU citizens ready for a system based largely on relative population? The best outcome on balance is to move to a <b>dual</b> <b>majority,</b> but only in November 2009 as proposed in the draft Constitution. This is not optimal from the perspective of efficiency. However, the EU can make use of this time to digest enlargement, establish its limits more clearly and conduct a more serious public debate, before introducing what would indeed be a major shift in the underlying premises of its institutional arrangements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how neutral the current EU decision-making procedures are to membership {{and how well}} they obey certain transparent general constitutional principles. The paper evaluates {{the performance of the}} procedures by strategic and classical power indices. The main emphasis in the assessment is in stability, efficiency and fairness. The paper concludes that co-decision either with shared right to initiate between the Commission and the the Parliament or a double-hat Presidency works the best. In the Council the current weighting should be replaced by the <b>dual</b> <b>majority</b> of square-rooted populations and Member States. ...|$|E

In this paper we present new analysis of Understanding Society that expands the limited evidence on minority identification. Drawing on Berrys acculturation framework, we explore patterns of <b>dual</b> minority and <b>majority</b> identification among the UKs minority ethnic groups. We find that minorities tend to hold strong British identities; but that that there are variations in identity acculturation across minority groups and by generation.

50|$|In Europe, {{super singles}} became popular when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with dual wheels, with three 8 t axles on wide-base single wheels. The significantly lower axle weight on super singles {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from single versus <b>dual</b> wheels. The <b>majority</b> of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on super singles, as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both dual wheels and on single wheels, instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on single wheels.|$|R
40|$|Background: Surgical {{management}} of intractable epilepsies is currently an established mode of therapy in various clinical settings. Aims: To retrospectively evaluate the neuropathological findings in both temporal and extratemporal lobe resections in such patients. Materials and Methods: The study included resected specimens from patients with intractable epilepsy managed at a tertiary care hospital of India, during a 10 -year period (1995 - 2004). Results: A total of 153 patients, {{with mean age}} of 19. 4 years and male predominance (73. 2 &#x 0025;) {{were included in the}} study. Overall, there was a predilection for the temporal lobe (73. 2 &#x 0025;), while 41 cases were extratemporal in location. On histopathology, mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) (24. 8 &#x 0025;) was the commonest lesion, followed by tumors (19. 6 &#x 0025;) and isolated focal cortical dysplasia (FCD - 15. 11 &#x 0025;). Other less common findings included Rasmussen encephalitis, non-specific gliosis and vascular malformations. In addition, 20. 9 &#x 0025; (32 cases) had <b>dual</b> lesions, <b>majority</b> of which included FCD with ganglioglioma (15 cases) or with dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (12 cases). In the temporal lobe, neoplasms and dual lesions formed the majority (apart from MTS), unlike dual lesions followed by neoplasms and FCD, in the extratemporal location. Conclusion: This series demonstrates that most patients with chronic intractable epilepsy have significant histopathological findings and highlights the neuropathological spectrum of such lesions, in the Indian context. This was similar to that reported from the West, but different from the single Indian series available in the literature. Further, the overall profile of temporal lobe lesions was not different from the extratemporal ones...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{description of}} pacemaker systems which are commercially available or in clinical validation is given as a background for their application {{in a series}} of 62 consecutive patients presenting over a period of 1 year for permanent cardiac pacing. The patients (23 (37 %) sick sinus syndrome, 38 (61 %) atrioventricular block, and 1 ventricular tachycardia) were studied electrophysiologically and haemodynamically to allow the appropriate application of a pacemaker system. In sick sinus syndrome, 8 patients had permanent atrial pacing, 14 ventricular pacing, and 1 atrioventricular sequential pacing; in atrioventricular block, 8 patients had atrial synchronous ventricular inhibited pacing and the remaining 30 had ventricular pacing. A high incidence of atrial fibrillation, 9 patients, and abnormal sinus node function, 15 patients, precluded wider use of atrial synchrony. The results show benefit in acute haemodynamic studies of using systems including atrial sensing and/or pacing, and with greater availability of atrioventricular sequential and still more advanced pacemakers with dual sensing as well as <b>dual</b> pacing the <b>majority</b> of patients may be offered this benefit...|$|R
40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP 1) is a {{heat shock}} protein 90 (HSP 90) molecular chaperone upregulated in several human malignancies and involved in protection from apoptosis and drug resistance, cell cycle progression, cell metabolism and quality control of specific client proteins. TRAP 1 role in thyroid carcinoma (TC), still unaddressed at present, was investigated by analyzing its expression in a cohort of 86 human TCs and evaluating its involvement in cancer cell survival and proliferation in vitro Indeed, TRAP 1 levels progressively increased from normal peritumoral thyroid gland, to papillary TCs (PTCs), follicular variants of PTCs (FV-PTCs) and poorly differentiated TCs (PDTCs). By contrast, anaplastic thyroid tumors exhibited a <b>dual</b> pattern, the <b>majority</b> being characterized by high TRAP 1 levels, while a small subgroup completely negative. Consistently with a potential involvement of TRAP 1 in thyroid carcinogenesis, TRAP 1 silencing resulted in increased sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, inhibition of cell cycle progression and attenuation of ERK signaling. Noteworthy, the inhibition of TRAP 1 ATPase activity by pharmacological agents resulted in attenuation of cell proliferation, inhibition of ERK signaling and reversion of drug resistance. These data suggest that TRAP 1 inhibition may be regarded as potential strategy to target specific features of human TCs, i. e., cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis...|$|R

Materials and methods: This is a cross-sectional study using a semi-structured ­self-administered questionnaire to assess the knowledge and practice of dual contraception among female undergraduates in the University of Ibadan and The Polytechnic, Ibadan. A total of 1, 200 undergraduate students were interviewed, and data obtained were analyzed with SPSS Version 18. 0. Results: The {{mean age of the}} respondents was 22. 57 ± 3. 43  years. Among the respondents, 900 (84. 6 %) were unmarried, 871 (77. 9 %) have been sexually exposed, 793 (70. 9 %) had heard of dual contraception, and 659 (58. 9 %) had knowledge of <b>dual</b> contraception. <b>Majority</b> (66. 8 %) of the participants used effective contraception, of whom 423 (56. 3 %) used condom, while others used other short- or long-term reversible contraception. More than two-thirds (79. 2 %) of the sexually exposed respondents were aware of dual contraception, but only 465 (41. 6 %) had practiced it. The main sources of information about dual contraception were from friends and radio (45. 3 % and 36. 1 %, respectively). Those who had multiple sexual partners and early coitarche were more likely to use dual contraception (P< 0. 05). History of previous sexually transmitted infection (odds ratio = 3. 06, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 03 – 4. 62) and unwanted pregnancy (odds ratio = 3. 53, 95 % CI = 2. 62 – 4. 74) were strongly {{associated with the use of}} dual contraception. Conclusion: Uptake of dual contraception among the students was low. Efforts need to be concentrated on determining and addressing the challenges that are responsible for the lower uptake of dual contraception among female undergraduates who are at higher risk of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Promotion of consistent use of dual contraception is pertinent in maximizing the benefits of dual contraception in our environment.

30|$|As noted above, the Norwegian {{committee}} {{split into}} a majority and a minority over {{the question of}} <b>dual</b> citizenship. The <b>majority</b> claimed that the factors that traditionally have been assessed as disadvantages of dual citizenship {{from the perspective of}} the state – military draft in two countries, problems related to diplomatic protection and concerns for national security – currently should be perceived as being of minor importance. Even the special advantages for individuals of having two formal citizenships, such as having two passports and being eligible for parliament in two countries, was seen by the committee as having few practical implications, as long as there already are persons with two passports in the population and that the right to vote and eligibility in local elections are granted to persons who have been resident in the country for at least three years. As regards the concerns for sufficient affiliation to the country and the potential for divided loyalties, the committee stated that immigrants invariably would preserve an attachment to the home country and often will wish to maintain contact: ‘These kinds of ties and interests will not disappear when the person becomes a Norwegian citizen’ (NOU 2000 : 32, p. 89). This line of argument is strikingly similar to what can be found in the Swedish report, and like their Swedish colleagues, the majority of the Norwegian committee endorsed acceptance of dual citizenship.|$|R
40|$|Context: Successful tobacco quit by {{the tobacco}} users can avoid {{millions}} of premature death. However, the physical dependence on tobacco use results in frequent relapse most commonly due to withdrawal symptoms. Aims: The {{aim of this}} study was to study the level of tobacco dependence among tobacco users in an urban slum of Puducherry. Materials and Methods: This facility-based descriptive pilot study was conducted among patients aged 15 years or above attending an urban health and training center in an urban slum of Puducherry. A total of 90 consecutive current tobacco users were included after obtaining verbal informed consent and interviewed using a pretested questionnaire. The information on tobacco dependence was collected using Fagerstrom Addiction Scale for smokers and smokeless tobacco users separately. Results: Of the 90 current tobacco users, 95 % were daily tobacco users. Of the current tobacco users, 48. 8 %, 45. 6 %, and 5. 6 % were smokers, smokeless tobacco users, and <b>dual</b> users, respectively. <b>Majority</b> of the smokers (61 %) and most of the smokeless tobacco users (41 %) had medium dependence for tobacco use. However, physical dependence was much higher among smokeless tobacco users (41. 3 %) than smokers (20. 4 %). Conclusion: Proportionately high physical dependence on tobacco is a concern in the study population. Community-based interventions are required to curb the problem; however, study with representative sample should be carried out before that...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chikungunya fever (CHIK) is an arboviral disease. Dengue fever (DENG) and CHIK are indistinguishable {{clinically}} {{and need}} to be differentiated by laboratory investigations. Purpose: This study aimed at estimating the seroprevalence of CHIK mono-infection and CHIK and DENG dual infection in suspected patients. We also analyzed the age, sex distribution, joint involvement, and relation of joint movement restriction with visual analog scale (VAS). Materials and Methods: Two hundred patients clinically suspected with DENG and CHIK were enrolled from a Tertiary Care Hospital in Mumbai from April 2012 to October 2013. The detailed history and examination findings were recorded. Serum samples were subjected to DENG and CHIK immunoglobulin G (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The seroprevalence of CHIK was 12. 5 %. Mono-infection of CHIK was 3 %, and CHIK and DENG dual infection was 9. 5 %. Most affected age group in CHIK cases was 46 - 60 years wherein female preponderance was seen. All 6 patients with CHIK mono-infection had fever and joint involvement; knee and elbow were the most commonly affected joints. All CHIK patients had VAS score of 6 - 10 with restricted joint movement. Of the patients with <b>dual</b> infection, the <b>majorities</b> were from 31 to 45 years with male preponderance; all had fever and joint pain mainly affecting knee and elbow. Of patients who had VAS score 6 - 10 in patients with dual infection, only 5. 26 % had restricted joint movement. Conclusion: IgM ELISA for Chikungunya infection {{should be included in the}} routine laboratory tests for acute febrile illness...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a thesis}} on the {{political}} economy of decentralisation. Part one analyses the effects of fiscal and electoral decentralisation on the accountability of public officials. Chapter 2 introduces a model of repeated elections to public office. The interaction between voters and officials is seen as a principal-agent relationship. Within this framework, two potential justifications for political decentralisation are provided. It is shown that voters may strictly prefer to limit the funds they allocate to a public office by setting up more than one office (fiscal decentralisation). A smaller budget implies a stronger incentive for the officeholder to try to be re-elected. The second argument for political decentralisation is that splitting up the electorate into homogeneous jurisdictions (electoral decentralisation) implies that the voters will tend to have more control over the use of public funds by the officials. Chapter 3 introduces asymmetric information into the model. Officeholders are assumed to have better knowledge of the technological conditions under which public funds are provided. Asymmetric information gives rise to an information rent for the officials. Total information rents can be limited by having more than one bureau and the voters using relative performance evaluation for their re-election decisions (=electoral yardstick competition). It is also shown that fiscal decentralisadon can be beneficial to the voters, if they are better informed about the local rather than the federal conditions of public goods provision. Part two studies {{the political economy of}} the transition from a collectivist economy to a market economy. Chapter 4 develops a general equilibrium model of income distribution and risk-taking. The formation of entrepreneurial and working classes as well as the allocation of talent are derived endogenously. In a market economy, no insurance can be provided due to the non-observability of output (and employment) in private firms. The more able and the less risk averse individuals tend to become entrepreneurs. Inefficiencies arise due to insufficient risk-taking. A different (second-best) balance is reached in a collectivist economy where output is shared equally. In this case, non-observability implies that workers will not reveal their talent and managers will not reveal the productivity of their plant. It is shown that either of the two systems may overall dominate the other in terms of the majority criterion or even the Pareto criterion. Different forms of transition from collectivist to market-based production are considered. A total (or "big bang") reform is viewed as the collectivist sector being closed down completely and all individuals having to move to the competitive sector. Gradual reform is viewed as the free migration of individuals between the collectivist sector and the competitive sector. This leads, in general, to a <b>dual</b> economy. A <b>majority</b> of individuals may want to leave the traditional sector to try their luck in the modem sector and, therefore, vote for reform. Despite this, under both gradual and total reforms, a majority of individuals may ex post regret the changes and vote for a return to the collectivist system. It is also shown that the majority choice between total reform, gradual reform and no reform is always transitive. Moreover, gradual reform is never the most preferred option for the majority. These results may be useful for interpreting some of the developments in the economies in transition...|$|R
