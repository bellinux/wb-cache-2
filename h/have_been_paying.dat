5|$|Wilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local {{stockbroker}} {{helped him}} raise the initial capital needed through a public stock offering. By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation {{at the behest}} of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned to selling college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state sales tax on his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and none of the three were required to pay any back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms. In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing the ads, and agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers.|$|E

Mathilda {{lives with her}} {{dysfunctional}} family in an apartment down the hall, and has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda's abusive father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> him to stash cocaine in his apartment. After they discover he has been cutting the cocaine to keep for himself, DEAagents storm the building, led by sharply dressed drug addict Norman Stansfield (Oldman).

2500|$|The chief {{continued}} {{to pay the}} annual tribute to Virginia's governor. This consists of game, usually a deer, and pottery or a [...] "peace pipe". The Pamunkey <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> such tribute since the treaty of 1646. Making this annual payment {{has not always been}} easy. Chief Miles remembers one year that was particularly hard, [...] "We couldn't find anything, no deer, no turkeys--nothing. My dad was chief then, and we knew we had to have something to present to the governor; so we went to a turkey farm, bought a live turkey, brought it back to the reservation and killed it. That way we were able to fulfill the terms of the treaty--after all it was killed on the reservation." [...] As far as anyone knows, they have not missed a payment in 331 years.|$|E
2500|$|Outside of patch notes, Hello Games had {{effectively}} gone {{silent on}} social media right after the game's release up until {{the announcement of the}} Foundation update in late November 2016. Murray, who used the Hello Games' Twitter account with some frequency before release, had not been visible online for the first two months following the game's release. In the announcement of this update, Hello Games admitted to being [...] "quiet" [...] but <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> attention to the various criticisms levelled at the game. [...] Schreier from Kotaku and Ben Kuchera of Polygon commented that some of the negative player reaction was {{due to a lack of}} clarification on these apparently missing features from either Hello Games or Sony in the weeks just after release, with Kuchera further stating that with the silence from either company, [...] "the loudest, most negative voices are shouting unopposed" [...] and leading to a strong negative perception of the game. Kuchera later wrote that many of the issues in the lead-up and follow-up to No Man's Skys release, whether by choice or happenstance, provide many lessons on the importance of proper public relations. Kuchera specifically pointed to the decision to withhold review copies and an apparent lack of public relations (PR) to manage statements relating to what features would be in the game. Kuchera also noted that many people had taken the hype generated by the press only to be disappointed by the final game, and that consumers did have ways to evaluate the game following its release before they purchased the title. Sony president Shuhei Yoshida admitted that Hello Games did not have [...] "a great PR strategy" [...] for No Man's Sky, in part for lacking a dedicated PR staff to manage expectations, but still support the developers as they continue to patch and update the game. Jesse Signal, writing for the Boston Globe noted that some of the hype for No Man's Sky may be attributed to game journalists themselves for getting too excited about the game, positing [...] "Had journalists asked certain questions at certain times, perhaps it would have been more difficult for Hello Games to make promises it couldn’t deliver on." ...|$|E
