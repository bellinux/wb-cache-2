5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E

5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson, <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. <b>Flying</b> <b>in</b> tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the Swedish {{government}} began development studies for an aircraft capable of fighter, attack and reconnaissance missions {{to replace the}} Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen. A new design from Saab was selected and developed as the JAS 39, first <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> 1988. Following two crashes during flight development and subsequent alterations to the aircraft's flight control software, the Gripen entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1997. Upgraded variants, featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times, began entering service in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two months of 1944, Hartmann claimed over 50 Soviet aircraft. This {{included}} 25 in January. On 26 February 1944 he claimed 10 fighters shot down, all of them Soviet-flown P-39s. Hartmann continued scoring at an even greater pace. His spectacular rate of success raised a few eyebrows even in the Luftwaffe High Command; his claims were double and triple-checked, and his performance closely monitored by an observer <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> his formation. On 2 March, he reached 202.|$|E
5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent to the {{presentation}} of the Swords to his Knight's Cross, he was officially banned from operational flying. Occasionally he still flew combat missions and on 23 March 1944, <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> defense of the Reich, he claimed his 162nd and last aerial victory and was killed in action by United States Army Air Forces long-range P-51 Mustang fighters near Schöppenstedt, in Lower Saxony.|$|E
5|$|The December 1970 OAG shows 86 weekday arrivals (77 jet) on 13 {{fixed-wing}} airlines from 31 airports, but the August 1974 shows 14 arrivals (all jet) on four airlines, and in 1976–79 Midway {{had only}} {{the two or three}} Delta DC-9s from St Louis. Midway Airlines arrived on October 31, 1979 with DC-9 nonstops to Kansas City, Detroit and Cleveland Lakefront; they expanded greatly in the 1980s. Their September 1989 timetable shows 117 weekday departures to 29 cities, plus 108 departures on their commuter affiliates to 22 more cities. Midway quit <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> 1991.|$|E
5|$|The USAF {{eventually}} gave up {{fighting for}} its {{production and the}} B-70 program was canceled in 1961. Development was then turned over to a research program to {{study the effects of}} long-duration high-speed flight. As such, two prototype aircraft, designated XB-70A, were built; these aircraft were used for supersonic test-flights during 1964–69. In 1966, one prototype crashed after colliding with a smaller aircraft while <b>flying</b> <b>in</b> close formation; the remaining Valkyrie bomber is in the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.|$|E
