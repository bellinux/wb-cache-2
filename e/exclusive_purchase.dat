40|$|Matching theory predicts {{choices on}} {{concurrent}} variable ratio schedules on which consumers' brand selection occurs will show maximization via exclusive {{choice of the}} richest schedule. However, aggregate studies of consumer choice indicate two modes of consumer brand purchase within a product category: either <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchase</b> of one brand or multibrand purchasing. This article uses brand-selection data from individual consumers to determine whether, at this level of analysis, (a) consumers' purchasing patterns show matching, (b) consumers maximize returns, and, if so, (c) what they maximize. Consumer behavior for fast-moving goods exhibits matching, but {{in the form of}} multibrand purchasing rather than exclusive choice. Moreover, for substitutes, brand selection is price sensitive, suggesting both melioration and maximization; for nonsubstitutes, choice is not price sensitive but still appears consistent with maximization of price- and nonprice-related sources of value...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{thematic}} {{content analysis}} of textbooks, curricula, and an overview of educational legislation after the 1989 change of political regime in Romania, this paper presents empirical evidence to argue that that postsocialist citizenship education displays surprising similarities with converging post-war changes {{in the concept of}} the ‘good citizen’. The findings suggest a complex picture of change combining liberal, communitarian and cosmopolitan renditions of the new citizen, all having a common thread: the shift towards a post-national ethos delinking the citizen from the <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchase</b> of national belonging and decoupling citizen action from the absolute duty to the patria. Such significant changes are often overlooked due to the dominant focus on the failures to comply with an idealized Western liberal model. However, they invite us to reconsider current understandings of both the pitfalls and the opportunities of post-socialist citizenship education by considering them from a different angle: that of wider socio-cultural change that is gradually being institutionalised at the world level...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{whether the}} market share threshold enshrined in Regulation 2790 / 1999 allows to draw correct inferences on the foreclosure risks arising from single branding and <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchasing</b> obligations {{in the context}} of vertical relationships. As far as the customer foreclosure risks arising from single branding are concerned, it comes to the conclusion that Regulation 2790 / 1999 wrongly focuses on the market share of the seller and should concentrate on the market share of the acquirer. Symetrically, in so far as the input foreclosure risks arising from <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchasing</b> are concerned, Regulation 2790 / 1999 should focus on the market share of the seller. In the context of the upcoming review of the rules applicable to vertical agreements, the European Commission should seek to address this problem...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 20 th century, {{optimism}} existed that non-timber {{forest products}} (NTFPs) can form an integral part in conservation and development strategies. However, there is limited knowledge on how the different stakeholders could relate to the state or to each other in promoting commercialization of NTFPs. Applying the policy network as an analytical framework, we investigated the structural patterns of actor relations in the governance structure of indigenous natural products (INPs) in Namibia, to understand the implications of such relations on INP policy process. The findings indicate that the INP policy network in Namibia is multi-dimensional, consisting of the Indigenous Plant Task Team (IPTT) —the key governance structure for resource mobilization and information sharing;and functional relations which serve specific roles in theINP value chain. The existing relations have facilitated policy development particularly for heavily regulated species, such as devil’s claw; but for other species, onlyincremental changes are observed in terms of small-scale processing facilities for value addition and <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchase</b> agreements for sustainable sourcing of INPs. Participation of primary producers, private actors and quality standardization bodies is limited in INPs governance structures, which narrow the scope of information sharing. Consequently, despite that the IPTT has fostered publicly funded explorative pilot projects, ranging from production to marketing of INPs, there are no clear guidelines how these projects results can be transferred to private entities for possible commercialization. Further collaboration and information sharing is needed to guide public sector relations with the private entities and cooperatives...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: An {{appreciation}} of the drinking patterns of population subgroups may usefully inform tailored interventions. For this purpose research has highlighted a need to better describe the drinking behaviour of UK women. This study aims to characterise the purchasing and consumption behaviour of female heavy, harmed, drinkers in contact with Scottish health services in two cities and explore {{the factors that influence}} the link to harm. Methods: Mixed method study involving cross sectional survey questionnaires and one-to-one interviews (5). The questionnaires documented (i) demographic data (including derived deprivation score), last week’s (or ‘typical’ weekly) consumption (type, brand, volume, price, place of purchase), self-reported illnesses and (ii) Alcohol Related Problem Questionnaire score. Results: Median consumption was 157. 6 UK units for the recorded week, with almost <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchase</b> from ‘off sale’ retail outlets. Preferred drinks were white cider, vodka and white wine. Increasing problems was positively associated with drinking more in the week, being younger, and belonging to Glasgow. Participants: 181 patients with serious health problems linked to alcohol, recruited within NHS hospital clinics (in- and out- patient settings), in two Scottish cities during 2012. Conclusion: For Scottish women the current definition of ‘harmful’ consumption likely captures a fourfold variation in alcohol intake, with gender differences less apparent. While current alcohol-related harm is positively associated with dose and being younger, there is clear evidence of an influence of the less tangible ‘Glasgow effect’. Future harm concerns are warranted by data relating to pattern, alcohol dose and cigarette use...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} proposed by Mussa and Rosen (1978) for modelling quality differentiation, we allow consumers to buy simultaneously different variants {{of the same}} indivisible good. We call this the "joint purchase option". We show that this option dramatically affects price competition: while a unique equilibrium always prevails when consumers are assumed to make mutually <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchases,</b> either uniqueness, or multiplicity, or absence of price equilibrium arise when the joint purchase option is opened depending on the utility attached to joint purchase relative to separate purchases. ...|$|R

50|$|With {{a system}} of {{interconnected}} canals and rivers, {{a new form of}} transportation connected the colonies and encouraged westward development. The early 19th century's steam-powered boats did for the transportation infrastructure what the railroads would do {{in the second half of}} the century. Railroads were expensive, and obtaining funding for {{a system of}} interconnected track crossing municipalities and states was challenging. Much investment had developed a canal system in the U.S., which was threatened by more cost-effective transport. As a result, canal companies resisted railroad agreements allowing the construction of rail lines along existing canals. Receiving earlier charters, canals used this as an argument for exclusivity. From the 1820s through the 1830s, canal attacks on the legitimacy of railroad charters were successful. In 1832, Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company v. Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company involved a dispute over the Potomac River valley and proprietary rights to land selection. Although both parties had rights to purchase the land, the court upheld the exclusive privilege of the canal company. This threatened new railroad ventures, since the court’s decision protected the canal company’s right to purchase land (excluding potentially-viable rail companies from doing so). However, in 1837 the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the premise of <b>exclusive</b> privilege in <b>purchasing</b> rights in Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge. Citing jeopardy to the development of modern transportation that allowing a proprietary right to purchase land through the conferred exclusivity of a charter would create, the court struck down any assumed <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchasing</b> rights by canal companies. This decision benefited the railroads, allowing rail companies equal opportunity to purchase land for development and stimulating growth in railroad infrastructure.|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of suppliers {{who do not}} deliver materials in the quality, quantity and delivery time requested is a common phenomenon {{that has been the}} heart of many problems in purchasing management. If the supply problem continues, the company will find difficulties in carrying out its supply chain management and simultaneously, fail in serving its market. This paper emphasizes the global purchasing where the complexities of global purchasing have leveraged supply risks and accordingly, require special attention from the company. Basically, the continuous success in procuring globally lays on the company?s ability in select the right suppliers, continued with managing its relationship with its suppliers and unforgettably, leveraging its bargaining power. To select the right global suppliers, the purchasing company initially has to decide from what country it wants to source according to the assessment in the country environment that afterwards followed by analysis on the company?s internal environment in comparison to the purchasing company?s condition. Meanwhile, Supplier Relationship Management becomes the backbone in managing global suppliers, in which the SRM system characterized by the employment of <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchasing</b> professionals, constant communication, and coordination with the suppliers and meticulous evaluation system that aims to develop closer relationship with suppliers.
