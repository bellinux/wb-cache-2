The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes {{and said that the}} rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, [...] "Nobody has ever called me a liar," [...] and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush, and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, [...] "It goes to his ability to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done,</b> <b>to</b> get along with people. He's all peaches and cream on television." [...] Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a ban on assault weapons in the 1990s. The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the debate was [...] "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".|$|E

40|$|Background Leadership is {{the process}} of {{directing}} the behaviour of others toward the accomplishment of some common objectives. Leadership is influencing people to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> a standard and quality above their norm - and doing it willingly. Leading others is {{not simply a matter of}} style, or following some how-to guides or recipes. Ineffectiveness of leaders seldom results from a lack of know-how or how-to, nor is it typically due to inadequate managerial skills. Leadership is even not about creating a great vision. It is about creating conditions under which all your followers can perform independently and effectively toward a common objective. Leadership is also a never ending process of self-studies with the purpose to know yourself and your behaviour as individual and in a group better. Understanding group dynamics is essential in order to inspire employees into higher levels of teamwork. It could be argued that for any improvement, leadership forms the main resource basis on which success of change relies. Gotland University has during several years carried out well frequented distance courses in leadership. The typical student is a person with a degree working in some organisation, often in a managerial position. Course assessments have indicated appreciation and a high level of student satisfaction. Purpose The question is if leadership theories and methodologies learnt really are put into use when the course is finished. The main purpose of this research is to explore how current leadership teaching is transferred into practical use in organisations. Another purpose is to see how current management attitudes correspond with the main theories. The results will help to improve the understanding of the practical relevance of different parts of leadership theory. Additionally the role of pedagogy and contextual factors when putting leadership theory into practise are highlighted. Methodology/Approach An alumni database for former students is used for sending a questionnaire asking for the relevance of different topics. Focus is on seeing what parts of theory have been used and to what extent. Based on the first results from the questionnaire a number of interviews are carried out to find out more detailed areas of improvement relating both to what theory to focus on and how to learn. Additionally randomly chosen written reports from courses are used to identify current managerial behaviour. Findings Preliminary findings indicate that theories are being used, but that there is improvement potential (study is still in progress). Limitations The study is limited to the theories used in the current courses. Students are practically all mature students already working. Value Leadership is a practical issue and it is important to know that what is taught is relevant and that it is being used.

40|$|Introduction The PhD {{thesis is}} {{inspired}} by the rapid rise in political attention on climate change from 2005 onwards, followed by the media hype known as ‘climategate’ and the subsequent fall in attention afterwards. The polarisation in the public debate between so-called activists and deniers shows that climate change is a classroom example of what scholars in policy and planning define as a wicked or unstructured problem. This type of problem is characterised by {{a wide variety of}} societal understandings or frames through which new knowledge is interpreted. Governing wicked problems is a tricky process and has a history of policy conflict and controversy. In this thesis, I aim to elucidate the process and outcomes of governing adaptation to climate change. I do so by focusing on the social interactions of public and private players in governance and how they develop meanings and related policy outcomes through their frame interactions. The thesis starts with the notion that adapting to the long-term and uncertain character of climate change results in a special type of governing, especially {{in the context of the}} little institutionalised policy domain and the wide variety of societal frames involved. Governing adaptation to climate change involves careful monitoring of policy direction, speed, and societal current in relation to scientific projections and societal sensemaking of what climate impacts might be ahead. Navigating climate change therefore metaphorically boils down to a form of dead reckoning, a systemised method of monitoring course, speed, and current through which sailors in the 15 th century used to navigate their ships into the unknown. Navigating hierarchically organised ships, however, is different from steering plural democratically organised societies. In policy sciences, this process of governing long-term policy issues in plural societies is traditionally defined as a dynamic process of both puzzling over what the issue means to society and powering to get things done. Puzzling and powering are broadly defined as interrelated; new meanings might alter actors’ positions and corresponding policy outcomes, and changing power positions might alter societal understandings of what is at stake. Processes of puzzling and powering are considered to vary across traditions of state organisation and related institutional arrangements. In the climate adaptation governance literature however, the governance process is differently defined. Scholars define governance of adaptation to climate change as a matter of getting the knowledge system right to design the right policies, and getting the institutional system right to enforce the policies. This static approach does not show an interrelated or dynamic understanding of actor-centred processes based on sensemaking and positioning. Other scholars define climate adaptation as a matter of developing the right knowledge, creating legitimacy, or enhancing justness through deliberative or participatory approaches to governing, but seem to neglect the need for power organisation to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done.</b> <b>To</b> be able to contribute to both the policy sciences and the climate adaptation governance literature, the thesis opens up the black box of climate adaptation governance by zooming in on the actual policy deliberations in four concrete governance cases in different institutional arrangements and traditions of state organisation. To do so, I propose frame interactions as a means for better understanding the traditionally defined interplay between processes of puzzling over meaning and powering over positions in different institutional contexts. This results in the following central research question: In what way do frame interactions construct interplaying processes of puzzling over meaning and powering over positions in different institutional arrangements occupied with governing societal adaptation to climate change? Research design To investigate and compare the frame interaction processes in different institutional arrangements and state traditions, I started with a distant view towards frame developments in official water policy proposals over time. Using longitudinal frame analysis, I discussed these developments against the backdrop of a rise and fall in societal attention to climate change. Subsequently, I systematically assessed the scholarly approaches in making sense of climate adaptation governance. Inspired by both the developments in official policy framing over time and the different theoretical approaches to governance of adaptation to climate change, I opened the black box of frame developments and frame interactions in concrete governance practices. I adopted explorative case study research to get an in-depth understanding of the governance processes. By participatory observation, semi-structured interviews, and longitudinal frame analysis of policy deliberations in four different case studies, I was able to get in-depth understanding of governance processes in different institutional contexts. Because my research was embedded in the Dutch research programme Knowledge for Climate, which centres on climate adaptation governance challenges in the Dutch context, I took this Dutch context as my point of departure. The lowland delta nature of most of the Dutch territory makes the country potentially vulnerable to climate- related issues. Climate change poses governance challenges to delta regions in general, for which the Dutch delta might be an interesting illustration and an interesting case for academic inspiration and cross-national comparison. In terms of institutional arrangements, Dutch adaptation to climate change empirically shows continuities as well as discontinuities with the traditional Dutch cornerstone of dealing with collective action problems through poldering. In two selected case studies, climate adaptation is mainstreamed in existing poldering approaches and follows what is traditionally defined as a neo-corporatist state tradition. In neo-corporatism, a limited number of traditionally defined organised interests negotiate with the state in an institutionalised fashion. One selected case study shows signs of discontinuity with this traditional approach, allowing for more ad hoc deliberation with a much wider and less organised array of stakeholders and societal actors, known as deliberative governance. This approach follows the pleas in the contemporary climate adaptation governance literature for more participation. To understand the implications of state traditions for framing processes, I compare the selected case studies with a fourth selected case study of a similar deliberative governance initiative in the pluralist state tradition of the UK. Pluralism entails less state involvement in policymaking, but more central coordination of societally initiated policy actions through national legislation. Findings From a distant view, I show how policy frames evolve over time as an ongoing long-term conversation between policy proposals. Zooming in on four case studies reveals a wide array of frames in governance processes, which can be classified according to the scales addressed in the frames, and the nature of the issues framed. In relation to framing the nature of the issue, two archetypical frames can be defined: technical frames and political frames. Frame interactions shape learning processes, but due to the inclusion and exclusion effect of frames they can never be viewed without more conflict-based notions on policymaking. Counterintuitively, technical frames appear to change power positions, but, in the same counterintuitive way, political frames allow for puzzling over roles and responsibilities as well. Therefore, the thesis shows how meaning alters power positions and frame interactions affect substantial and relational outcomes. I show how these insights complicate what I define as the system assessment approach, which is dominant in the climate adaptation governance literature. Frames appear to do things in climate adaptation governance processes, from which I conclude that frames navigate climate adaptation. In addition to frame interactions as a puzzling and powering interplay, I show how a second interplay might be defined between institutions and frame interactions. Different institutional arrangements yield different frame interactions and outcomes. Institutional arrangements determine the rules of what can be defined as a framing game over wicked problems. Institutions also determine who is playing what framing game and therefore determine player dependencies. Institutions interplay with frame interactions, and may create the preconditions for effectively navigating the wide array of frames in climate adaptation governance. Without institutional demarcation of roles and responsibilities, the framing game might allow for new players and knowledge, but risks becoming gratuitous. In little institutionalised deliberative governance contexts without central coordination, frame interactions are likely to yield a dominant self-referential technical framing which empowers experts and promises technical efficiency solutions to a wicked problem. These contexts might yield the preconditions for what I define as a political bystander effect in deliberative governance. In addition, I show how state traditions play a role in what institutional arrangements yield what type of frame interactions. Therefore, I conclude that institutional arrangements in combination with state traditions play a role in how the variety of climate adaptation frames can be navigated. These findings point towards my most important recommendations. For future research, I would suggest further investigation of: (1) the possible emergence of a dominant technical framing in deliberative governance; (2) the extent to which this framing might point towards what other scholars have labelled self-reinforcing frames; (3) related political bystander effects in specific combinations of governance arrangements, policy issues, and state traditions. In relation to that, my most important recommendations to policymakers are: (1) be aware of the variety of frames in governance, (2) be aware of state traditions, (3) choose the right institutional arrangement, and (4) be modest in depoliticising wicked problems. In general, my recommendation would be to frame climate adaptation as an ongoing process of dead reckoning, which allows for explaining uncertain events, anticipating changing societal currents, and learning-by-doing.  ...|$|E

When the deadline of a task is categorized in a like-the-present category, it triggers the default implemental mind-set and hence results in a greater likelihood of task initiation.

"When {{the first}} annual conference took place at Bradford in January 1893 and was seen to thrive, Champion could write in The Labour Elector: 'We have created the ILP {{and set it on}} its legs.'"The boast has truth in it. For if any one man could say 'I created the ILP,' that man was Henry Hyde Champion. Others, and notably James Keir Hardie, are extolled as founders of the ILP..... Keir Hardie, Joseph Burgess, Robert Blatchford — were but midwives. The real father was H.H. Champion. And if Champion has been pushed out of the scene, it is partly because he left England for Australia; and partly because, {{indifferent}} to fame, he was ambitious rather <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done</b> than <b>to</b> have the credit for the accomplished fact. [...] "But Champion is the man whom the student of history, writing without bias and without axe to grind on behalf of reputation for the living or the dead, without fear of foe or favour for friend, unswayed by personal predilection for the character of this man or the policy of that, will name as the real creator of the ILP. It was Champion who discerned that the Socialist League with its non-parliamentary policy and Anarchist sympathies would never command the support of the British people, always strongly attached to parliamentary institutions; that the SDF in its devotion to the pure gospel of Marx made no appeal to Trade Unionists anxious for small but pressing changes that would better their condition; that Labour Electoral Associations in the control of Liberal Trade Unionists would accomplish nothing that would diminish the power of the Capitalist." ...|$|R

Are there universal behaviours which are consistent around the world? Are there subtle differences of emphasis which vary across different nationalities or corporate environments? Senior executives were polled in two major divisions of a global petroleum company and from its major subsidiaries around the world. They were asked to describe examples of exceptional organizational performance and to identify the key leadership behaviours which they saw as explaining or accounting for the extraordinary outcomes. Content analysis led to a few key leadership behaviours being identified. The major finding was that the main dimensions of leadership for extraordinary performance are universal. Only a few variations in emphasis existed among six different regions of the world. Also there were some clear leadership differences, long established in the folklore of the company, associated with different corporate cultures in the two major divisions.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{communities}} of practice (CoPs) has rapidly gained ground in {{fields such as}} knowledge management and organisational learning since it was first identified by Lave and Wenger (1991) and Brown and Duguid (1991). In this article, we consider a related concept that we have entitled “communities of implementation. ” Communities of implementation (CoIs) are similar to communities of practice in that they offer {{an opportunity for a}} collection of individuals to support each other and share knowledge in a dynamic environment and on a topic in which they share interest. In addition, and to differentiate them from CoPs, a community of implementation extends the responsibilities of a CoP by having as its focus the implementation of a programme of change. This may well extend to designing the change programme. Thus, whereas a main purpose of a CoP is to satisfy “a real need to know what each other knows” (Skyrme, 1999) in an informal way, we argue that a main purpose of a community of implementation is to “pool individual knowledge (including contacts and ways of <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> <b>done)</b> <b>to</b> stimulate collective enthusiasm in order to take more informed purposeful action for which the members are responsible. ” Individual and collective responsibility and accountability for successfully implementing the actions/change programme is a key feature of a community of implementation. Without these pressures the members might lower the priority of implementation, allowing competing priorities to dominate their attention and resources. Without responsibility and accountability, the result is likely to be (at best) an organisation which has not begun a change programme, or (at worst) an organisation which is stuck halfway through another failing initiative. To achieve these additional objectives beyond those of a CoP, the CoI needs to provide heightened support to its members. In fact often the members will collectively strategise {{the development and implementation of}} the change programme they are leading in the organisation. Other concepts similar to CoPs have appeared in the literature, for example “communities of knowing” (Boland & Tenkasi, 1995), but none have a specific focus on implementation. Perhaps the closest example of a CoI, as suggested by our definition, is reported by Karsten, Lyytinen, Hurskainen, and Koskelainen (2001) who describe a CoP in a paper machinery manufacturer which seems to have the necessary focus on implementation. The theoretical aspects of this article will explore the relationship between CoPs and CoIs, and the needs for different arrangements for a CoI. The practical aspect of this article will consist of a report on a case study of a CoI that was successful in its implementation of a programme of change that aimed to improve its organisation’s knowledge management activities. Over two years the CoI implemented a suite of complementary actions across the organisation. These actions transformed the organisation and moved it towards achieving its ‘core values’ and overall objectives. The article will explore: the activities that formed and gelled the community, the role of the community in the implementation of actions, and experiences from key members of this community on its success and potential improvements...|$|R
40|$|Structured {{abstract}} Purpose: At {{the core}} of how societies operate, lies social interaction. Organizations as significant social bodies rely on social interaction both <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done</b> in order <b>to</b> remain sustainable and to also impart {{a contribution to the}} wider society. Understanding the dynamics of social interactions in the way social agents and social action take place through the lens of social practice theory could yield powerful insights both about practices of socialization as well as, the socialization of practices. They fundamentally reveal the tensions that such interactions expose and the dynamics in negotiating individual and collective priorities. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a conceptual approach on the links to be established between practice and socialization. Findings: In this paper we focus on how a practice perspective provides us valuable insights about how social agents <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done</b> in organizations. Research limitations/implications for research, practice and/or society: This paper is linked with other papers in this issue where the dynamics in negotiating individual and collective priorities reveal the tensions that such interactions expose (‘transaction’). This paper provides a useful foundation for examining why organization practices tend to have an institutional character.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} how women of color who are at the senior level of academe continue to advance while navigating and maneuvering through power and politics encountered in the organizational system. Although we know that there are few women of color at the senior level of administration, this qualitative study provided information about the challenges and obstacles women of color senior level leaders face at micro- and macro-levels in a doctoral granting or baccalaureate granting university. The major research question guiding this study was: How do women of color navigate power and politics to arrive at the senior level in academe? The research design was nine individual case studies of women of color at nine institutions: three African Americans, two Asian American Pacific Islanders, two Latinas, and two American Indian women at doctoral granting and baccalaureate granting universities. Five women were senior leaders at minority serving institutions; seven were presidents, one was a provost, and one was a vice-provost. Three participants came from historically Black colleges and universities, one woman held a position at a Tribal college, and one worked at a Hispanic serving institution. 	 Drawing upon five theoretical frameworks, four themes emerged that were grounded in the data: 1) Advancing Women Through Opportunity and Experience; 2) Challenges of Race and Gender: Inviting Partnership with Community; 3) Inclusive and Persuasive Leaders: Creating Positive Change; 4) Using Power and Politics to Achieve Goals. Participants saw power as the ability to bring people together and to use a strategy to achieve one's objectives. They defined power as the privilege one has because of social identity or as something that was borrowed or loaned. Women of color leaders described using politics for the community, to reap benefits, not for oneself but to achieve a broader goal. Participants maneuvered through the system by finding allies, and enlisting people to intervene on their behalf. Women of color senior leaders saw politics as a means <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done</b> and <b>to</b> emerge with a win-win situation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001 Is Management or Leadership ability a {{prerequisite}} for a successful project Supervisor/facilitator? Management and Leadership: In traditional thinking managers requires certain competencies {{to be able to}} plan, organize, direct and control the allocation of human, material, financial and information resources in the pursuit of organisational goals. Management is therefore a technical discipline of applying and administering authority over others, which is given through a formalised structural arrangement of the organisation. Leadership is about vision and influence, ie. the ability to obtain followers. Leaders are also seen as people who communicate effectively, which leads to recognition, which in turn leads to influence. Leadership is therefore a quality of obtaining results from others through personal influence. The distinction between leadership and management is perhaps {{in the fact that the}} former focuses more on setting the vision and relying on softer skills such as interpersonal skills to communicate the vision and generate commitment and enthusiasm to make it happen, while the other concentrate on the harder more functional issues of planning and controlling. Project management: Project management is a structured but flexible process for producing a new end result. Its success depends on the application of a two-step sequence: First plan - then produce. Success from a project management perspective requires being on time, within budget and meeting requirements. However, from a project perspective, a successful project is clearly one in which the 'customer' ends up satisfied. Optimum project management success is therefore obtained when both success dimensions are achieved simultaneously. Project Success is dependent on the nature of the organization (sector, activities, structure), the nature of the project, nature of the project work (complexity, scale, stature), but most importantly the personality of the project manager. Hence, must the project manager be a manager or leader? The various authors generally agree that leadership is important to the success of a project because leadership is essentially about motivating people. Also, what may be characterized, as "managership" is equally important because this is about <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> <b>done.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> a project started off right, the project manager must become a leader. However, the style of leadership <b>does</b> need <b>to</b> change as the project progresses through its life cycle. Indeed, there comes a point in time when "managership" may be more important than "leadership. Failure to match an appropriate style to project circumstances can lead to unsatisfactory project results. Project management style classification: Having stated that the style of leadership needs to change as the project progresses we base our classification on the work done mostly by R. M. Wideman, whose research focused on four project leader profiles, namely: The Explorer: entrepreneur type project leaders have a vision of the future being bold, courageous and imaginative, constantly searching for opportunities and improvements. The Driver: distinctly action-oriented, hard working, hard driving, pragmatic, realistic, resourceful and resolute. The Coordinator: have a more independent and detached view of their surroundings and responsive to the views of project team members. The Administrator: recognizes the need for stability and optimize productivity through maximizing repetition, information assembly and analyzing, scheduling, trade-ofts to resolve conflicts and problems, in advance. Although experienced and skilled project managers often find themselves 'shifting gears' to suit current circumstances during the course of a project, the literature suggest that it is unusual to find all four traits in a single person. The study also discusses research done into the availability of people suited to various roles in project work. The research concluded that the Explorer (entrepreneur) type makes up only about 1 - 2 % of the population, some 5 - 10 %, are of the Driver (marshal) type, some 5 - 10 %, are of the Coordinator (catalyst) type and 25 - 30 % are of the Administrator (stabilizer) "professional" types. Another 20 - 25 % of the population is probably more suited as "followers". That still leaves about a third of the population who are most likely uncomfortable and unsuited to working on projects at all. If these statistics holds true, then the rate of unsatisfactory projects should come as no surprise considering the scarcity of people naturally suited for project management...|$|R
40|$|The {{entrepreneurial}} construct {{has many}} definitions, {{is still to}} be fully understood and lacks an updated and unifying framework. Relatively {{little research has been}} done on entrepreneurial strategy, despite it being distinct and important. Often, the focus has been on whom the entrepreneur is and not what he does, which is critical. While one of the objectives of an entrepreneurial firm is growth, the enigma of growth and its relationship to entrepreneurship is relatively new. The researcher answers the question as to whether there is something in the make-up of today’s entrepreneurial organisation that can promote or limit its growth, depending on how well it is managed. Entrepreneurial Confluence impacts positively on the creation and growth of enduring value within entrepreneurial firms. In today’s hyper-competitive, globalised business landscape, entrepreneurial strategy is defined at the confluence of the continuous identification of new, risk-adjusted opportunities and formulation of concomitant plans (ENTERPRISE), the adaptation and transformation of the firm’s environments, ideas and business models to viable products or services (EVOLUTION), and the discipline <b>to</b> <b>get</b> new <b>things</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> deliver results against the strategy (EXECUTION). ‘Entrepreneurs at the confluence’ grow value through innovation. An exploratory, mixed research methodology was used to create a generalisable paradigm of the creation and growth of firms. A new, self-tailored, pilot-tested, valid and reliable multi-dimensional 80 item questionnaire Entrepreneurial Confluence Measuring Instrument (ECMI) was administered to a purposive sample of 41 founders/CEOs of entrepreneurial, high-growth firms listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, including four from other African countries. The outcome is a dynamic and innovative 3 x 3 entrepreneurial growth strategy matrix which re-defines entrepreneurial strategy and has practical applications for both entrepreneurs and corporate managers in delivering enduring growth. Limitations were that the sample was purposively selected, and that the respondents are leaders of large public-listed South African firms who fit a demographic group. A random, more diverse sample, including younger and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), across other geographies might deliver different results. However, given that these large businesses were once SMEs, this research gives insight into what can reduce start-up mortality and enable firms to grow sustainably over time. Future research might look at the impact of entrepreneurial leadership talent on an enterprise’s growth, the connection between entrepreneurial strategy and economic value creation and enhancing the rigour of the ECMI.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{increase}} knowledge {{of the quality of}} performance of everyday activities, autonomy and participation in children with spina bifida (SB) and to explore how they relate to each other. Methods: In Study I, the quality of performance of everyday activities in 50 children with SB (of the 65 in a population-based cohort) aged 6 to 14 years was assessed with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). Their ability measures were compared with international age norms and with the ability measures from a control group of typically developed Nordic children. In study II, the cross-cultural differences in the ADL motor and process ability measured with the AMPS between children from the Nordic countries, (n= 2374), and from North America (n= 2239), aged 3 - 15 years, without known disabilities were analysed using a two-way ANOVA. In Study III the autonomy levels of the 50 children with SB were rated both by the children themselves and by their parents. The agreement between the children’s and the parents’ ratings was analysed, and the relationship between the autonomy levels and the child’s age, motor and process ability measures from the AMPS assessment in study I was analysed with binary logistic regression. Study IV: The frequency of participation in school-related activities in the 50 children with SB was rated both by the children themselves and by their teachers (in 48 / 50 cases). The teachers also rated the children’s level of active participation using the School Function Assessment (SFA). The relationship between the children’s level of active participation and their motor and process ability measures was analysed with binary logistic regression. Results: The majority of the children had difficulties performing well-known everyday activities in an effortless, efficient, safe and independent way, demonstrated by low ADL motor- and process ability measures. This deficient quality of task performance, in particular the process skills, was strongly related to both their level of autonomy in daily life and their level of active participation in school. The children with SB had low autonomy levels in goal-directed situations that needed personal initiation. The agreement between parents’ and children’s ratings of the children’s autonomy level was low. The frequency of participation among the children was high in school activities, although their teachers rated their active participation as restricted. The results also showed that the age norm in the AMPS is valid for use in a Nordic context. Conclusions: This thesis demonstrates that children with SB have difficulties <b>getting</b> <b>things</b> <b>done</b> due <b>to</b> deficient quality of task performance. It is therefore crucial for Occupational Therapists to assess, understand and support the development of the performance skills in children with SB, in order to enhance their autonomy and active participation in everyday life, school and society...|$|R
