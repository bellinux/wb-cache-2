40|$|Recent {{fascination for}} dynamic {{scheduling}} {{as a means}} for exploiting instruction-level parallelism has introduced significant interest in the scalability aspects of dynamic scheduling hardware. In order to overcome the scalability problems of centralized hardware schedulers, many decentralized execution models are being proposed and investigated recently. The crux of all these models is to split the instruction window across multiple processing elements (PEs) that do independent scheduling of instructions. The decentralized execution models proposed so far can be grouped under 3 categories, based on the criterion used for assigning an instruction to a particular PE. They are: (i) execution unit dependence based decentralization (EDD), (ii) control dependence based decentralization (CDD), and (iii) data dependence based decentralization (<b>DDD).</b> <b>This</b> paper investigates the performance aspects of these three decentralization approaches.

40|$|Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is {{a chronic}} {{process that can}} become {{clinically}} manifest in multiple disorders such as idiopathic low back pain, disc herniation, radiculopathy, myelopathy, and spinal stenosis. The limited available technology {{for the treatment of}} these and other pathologic and disabling conditions arising from DDD is highly invasive (eg, surgical discectomy and fusion), manifesting a certain degree of complications and unsatisfactory clinical out-comes. Although the precise pathophysiology of DDD remains to be clearly delineated, the progressive decline in aggrecan, the primary proteoglycan of the nucleus pulposus, appears to be a final common pathway. It has been hypothesized that imbalance in the synthesis and catabolism of certain critical extracellular matrix components can be mitigated by the transfer of genes to intervertebral disc cells encoding factors that modulate synthesis and catabolism of these components. The successful in vivo transfer of therapeutic genes to target cells within the intervertebral disc in clinically relevant animal models of DDD is one example of the rapid progress that is being made towards the development of gene therapy approaches for the treatment of <b>DDD.</b> <b>This</b> chapter reviews the ability of gene therapy to alter biologic processes in the degener-ated intervertebral disc and outlines the work needed to be done before human clinical trials can be contemplated...|$|E

40|$|Dense deposit disease (DDD) is a rare, {{progressive}} and incurable kidney disease characterized by complement C 3 accumulation along the {{glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM). It is the prototypical form of C 3 glomerulopathy, which comprises renal disorders due to excessive C 3 activation via the alternative pathway (AP). Human and murine studies indicate that renal inflammation in DDD is initiated by the specific C 3 activation product iC 3 b. I have assessed the role of iC 3 b in DDD using the uniquely informative experimental model of C 3 glomerulopathy in factor H (FH) -deficient mice. I demonstrate that coexisting deficiency of CD 11 b, the specific leukocyte receptor for iC 3 b, exacerbates the spontaneous renal phenotype in FH-deficient mice. This suggests that the iC 3 b-CD 11 b interaction may mediate partial renal protection in DDD. I also show that CD 11 b deficiency produces hypersensitivity to experimentally triggered glomerular injury in both FH-deficient and FH-sufficient mice.

Furthermore this study intends to identify predictive parameters for anterior lumbar interbody fusion outcome. Methods. A retrospective cohort study with additional telephone interview to obtain missing data was performed. All patients who underwent a L 4 -L 5 and/or L 5 -S 1 ALIF-procedure {{in the period}} between 2006 and 2011 were identified. The medical files of 123 patients with 154 fusion levels were reviewed. All patients were contacted by phone to gather supplementary and missing information.

40|$|Chronic lumbar pain due to {{degenerative}} disc disease {{affects a}} large number of people, including those of fully active age. The usual self-repair system observed in nature is a spontaneous attempt at arthrodesis, which in most cases leads to pseudoarthrosis. In recent years, many possible surgical fusion techniques have been introduced; PLIF is one of these. Because of the growing interest in minimally invasive surgery and the unsatisfactory results reported in the literature (mainly due to the high incidence of morbidity and complications), a new titanium lumbar interbody cage (I-FLY) has been developed to achieve solid bone fusion by means of a stand-alone posterior device. The head of the cage is blunt and tapered {{so that it can be}} used as a blunt spreader, and the core is small, which facilitates self-positioning. From 2003 to 2007, 119 patients were treated for chronic lumbar discopathy (Modic grade III and Pfirrmann grade V) with I-FLY cages used as stand-alone devices. All patients were clinically evaluated preoperatively and after 1 and 2  years by means of a neurological examination, visual analogue score (VAS) and Prolo Economic and Functional Scale. Radiological results were evaluated by polyaxial computed tomography (CT) scan and flexion–extension radiography. Fusion was defined as the absence of segmental instability on flexion–extension radiography and Bridwell grade I or II on CT scan. Patients were considered clinical “responders” if VAS evaluation showed any improvement over baseline values and a Prolo value > 7 was recorded. At the last follow-up examination, clinical success was deemed to have been achieved in 90. 5 % of patients; the rate of bone fusion was 99. 1 %, as evaluated by flexion–extension radiography, and 92. 2 %, as evaluated by CT scan. Morbidity (nerve root injury, dural lesions) and complications (subsidence and pseudoarthrosis) were minimal. PLIF by means of the stand-alone I-FLY cage can be regarded as a possible surgical treatment for chronic low-back pain due to high-degree <b>DDD.</b> <b>This</b> technique is not demanding and can be considered safe and effective, as shown by the excellent clinical and radiological success rates...|$|E

Methods: All patients had anteroposterior and lateral standing x-rays of the lumbar spine preoperatively and at 3 months, 12 months and 24 months after surgery. Lordosis of the lumbar spine, segmental lordosis and ratio of {{the height of the}} intervertebral disc spaces (IVS) measured preoperatively and at 3 months, 12 months and 24 months after surgery. All patients underwent MRI and/or CT preoperatively, 3 months, 12 months and 24 months postoperatively. The ratio of intervertebral disc space to vertebral body height (IVS) and segmental and lumbar lordosis were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Pain scores were evaluated via Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: In both groups, the VAS and ODI scores decreased significantly from preoperatively to postoperatively. There was no difference in the scores between groups except that a lower VAS and ODI scores were observed after 3 months in the LPDSS group. In both groups, the IVS ratio remained unchanged between preoperative and postoperative conditions.

40|$|Background: Degenerated disc disease (DDD) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} responsible for increased morbidity in a productive age group. Its etiology is multifactorial and genetic factors have been predominantly implicated. Disc prolapse results due to tear in the annulus, which is a fibrous structure composed largely of type I collagen. Functional polymorphism at the Sp 1 site of the collagen I alpha 1 (COL 1 A 1) gene has shown a positive association with DDD in Dutch and Greek populations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess COL 1 A 1 Sp 1 gene polymorphism in the Indian population. Materials and Methods: Fifty clinically and radiologically proven patients with disc prolapse requiring surgery were included as cases and 50 healthy, age-matched volunteers served as controls. After isolating DNA from their blood sample, genotyping for COL 1 A 1 polymorphism (rs 1800012) was performed and identified as GG, GT, and TT. Results: The mean age and body mass index in cases and controls were similar. 76 % of the patients were males. The most common site of disc degeneration was L 4 –L 5 (36 %), followed by L 5 –S 1 (34 %). Homozygous–GG, heterozygous GT, and homozygous TT genotypes were seen in 38 (76 %), 10 (20 %) and 2 (4 %) cases respectively, controls had similar percentage of genotypes as well.

Our goal is to produce a tool that facilitates meaningful and systematic dialogue for practitioners and researchers to ensure that well-intentioned health interventions lead to productive health systems while reducing the undesirable distortions of such efforts. We apply the DDD tool to plan for development rather than distortions in health markets, using intervention research being conducted under the Future Health Systems consortium in Bangladesh, China and Uganda. Through a review of research proposals and interviews with principal investigators, we use the DDD tool to systematically understand how a project fits within the broader health market system, and to identify gaps in planning for sustainability. We found that while current stakeholders and funding sources for activities were easily identified, future ones were not. The implication is that the projects could raise community expectations that future services will be available and paid for, despite this actually being uncertain. Each project addressed the ‘rules’ of the health market system differently. The China research assesses changes in the formal financing rules, whereas Bangladesh and Uganda’s projects involve influencing community level providers, where informal rules are more important.

Deficiency of and mutations in complement Factor H (CFH) {{are associated with the}} development of DDD, suggesting that dysregulation of the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement cascade is important in disease pathophysiology. Patients with DDD are studied to determine whether specific allele variants of the genes of the alternative pathway of the complement system segregate preferentially with the DDD. We have screened coding and intronic regions of genes of the complement system in DDD cases and controls using PCR, restriction digest and bidirectional sequencing. We have been able to identify novel mutations, allele variants and haplotypes in several genes of the complement system which are associated with the DDD phenotype based on statistical analyses. Since we have identified several genes associated with DDD, we have determined possible gene-gene interactions using computational analyses. We have found a strong synergistic interaction between polymorphisms in CFH and C 3. To ascertain if the associated allele variants had a functional impact in the complement activity of an individual, we have obtained blood samples from normal individuals and measured AP complement activity and genotyped CFH and C 3 for these samples. Association between AP activity and genotypes is analyzed using statistical methods. Significant association of CFH and C 3 variants with AP complement activity has been observed. We also have generated a mice deficient of CFH and Factor D (CFD). CFH deficient mice develop renal pathology similar to DDD in humans. Renal function and complement activity have been determined in the double knockout in comparison to CFH deficient and CFD deficient mice. Results have shown that absence of Factor D can inhibit complement activation in CFH mice. Our data imply that DDD is a complex genetic disease and that genes of the AP complement system contribute to level of complement activity and the pathogenesis of <b>DDD.</b> With <b>this</b> study, we hope to develop an effective diagnosis and treatment plan for DDD patients...|$|R
40|$|A 60 -year-old {{man with}} hypertrophic obstructive {{cardiomyopathy}} (HOCM) was implanted dual-chamber ICD {{for the purpose}} of both the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient reduction by ventricular pacing and the primary prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Because the LVOT gradient reduction and improvement of symptoms by pacing were insufficient, however, a new pacing lead was inserted in the right ventricular apex at a different position 1. 5 cm away from the site of the defibrillation lead, and the LVOT gradient greatly declined from 108 to 30 mmHg. <b>This</b> <b>DDD</b> pacing was continued over seven years. On this occasion, he was referred to our hospital because of battery depletion, and a cardiac catheterization study was performed after ICD replacement. The LVOT gradient was 10 mmHg in sinus rhythm. After administration of isoproterenol (0. 02 γ), the gradient was increased to 92 mmHg in sinus rhythm. DDD pacing using a newly placed ventricular pacing lead significantly decreased the gradient to 36 mmHg. This case study indicated that DDD pacing from a suitable location in the right ventricular apex caused a marked early reduction in the LVOT gradient, and at long-term follow up a further significant effect was obtained, also in sinus rhythm...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives. Extended {{spectrum}} &#x 03 B 2;-lactamase (ESBL) {{production is}} increasing {{all over the}} world, and organisms other than E. coli and K. pneumoniae are acquiring this character. ESBL production is detectable by automation, E-test, double disk diffusion (<b>DDD),</b> and PCR. <b>This</b> study aimed to determine the prevalence of ESBL production among clinical isolates of gram-negative rods, and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of augmentation of clavunate with Cefotaxime, Ceftazoxime, Aztreonam, Ceftriaxone, and Cefpodoxime in detecting ESBL production. Methods. 472 clinical gram-negative isolates identified by standard methods were tested for ESBL-production by (DDD) method using six cephalosporins and amoxicillin-clavulinate discs. Results. 108 / 472 (22. 9 &# 37;) of the isolates were ESBL producers, and were prevalent in tertiary care hospitals. 88. 2 &# 37; of E. cloacae, 71. 4 &# 37; of K. pneumoniae, 28. 6 &# 37; of K. oxytoca, 12. 5 &# 37; of C. freundii, 11. 1 &# 37; of A. calcoacceticus, and 10. 8 &# 37; of E. coli were ESBL producers. The DDD test demonstrated some variations in the efficacy of the different cephalosporins in detecting all the ESBL producers. The inclusion of ceftizoxime discs increased the efficacy of the test. It is concluded that ESBL-producing bacteria were prevalent among our hospitalized patients, and involved genera other than Klebsiella and Escherichia, and the inclusion of ceftizoxime increased the efficacy of ESBL detection by the DDD test...|$|R
40|$|Event cameras, such as dynamic vision sensors (DVS), {{and dynamic}} and active-pixel vision sensors (DAVIS) can {{supplement}} other autonomous driving sensors {{by providing a}} concurrent stream of standard active pixel sensor (APS) images and DVS temporal contrast events. The APS stream is a sequence of standard grayscale global-shutter image sensor frames. The DVS events represent brightness changes occurring at a particular moment, with a jitter of about a millisecond under most lighting conditions. They have a dynamic range of > 120 dB and effective frame rates > 1 kHz at data rates comparable to 30 fps (frames/second) image sensors. To overcome some {{of the limitations of}} current image acquisition technology, we investigate in this work the use of the combined DVS and APS streams in end-to-end driving applications. The dataset <b>DDD</b> 17 accompanying <b>this</b> paper is the first open dataset of annotated DAVIS driving recordings. DDD 17 has over 12 h of a 346 x 260 pixel DAVIS sensor recording highway and city driving in daytime, evening, night, dry and wet weather conditions, along with vehicle speed, GPS position, driver steering, throttle, and brake captured from the car's on-board diagnostics interface. As an example application, we performed a preliminary end-to-end learning study of using a convolutional neural network that is trained to predict the instantaneous steering angle from DVS and APS visual data.

40|$|Drug {{delivery}} devices (DDDs) {{are small}} implantable devices making sustained release of drug possible over defined time period. DDDs have numerous advantages compared to conventional ways of dosing drugs. Traditional ways like oral pills have numerous disadvantages. More {{safety and efficacy}} methods are needed while better patient compliance is achieved. At the same time, unwanted side effects can be minimized while drug is targeted into specific site with minimal released concentration. So far, mostly nondegradable DDDs have been available. Their major drawback is that they need removal after the drug is released. There {{is a need for}} biodegradable implants that are metabolised from body after DDD has performed needed actions. There are many kinds of <b>DDDs,</b> but <b>this</b> thesis concentrated in matrix type biodegradable DDDs, where drug is homogenously dispersed in a matrix polymer. For study, two very different drugs were chosen: ascorbic acid salt and dexamethasone. Polymers were prepared by polymerizing lactide and caprolactone in presence of ethylene glycol as co-initiator. Block structure was formed where PEG was left in middle of polymer chain. Commercial copolymer of caprolactone and lactide, P(CL-LA) was used as comparative polymer. Drug release test series was done to both, porous and nonporous samples. Characterization was done by using techniques like differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, size-exclusion chromatography, capillaryviscometry and microcomputed tomography. Drug release was monitored using ultraviolet/visible-spectrophotometer. Many different factors were observed to {{have an effect on the}} drug release. In general PEG incorporation into backbone increased release rates. Also, type of lactide had effect to on the release. Content of drugs was not observed to have much effect on the release profile in general, but it was possible to tailor release rates. Processing samples with super critical CO 2 increased release rates of all samples. Most of all, properties of drugs affected in great extent to release kinetics and release profiles of drug-polymer combinations. AAs had relatively weak interaction with matrix polymers. Release was very fast in most of cases and standard deviations were relatively high in every measurement. For dexamethasone, sustained nearly zero-order kinetics was possible to achieve for some materials. These materials clearly have great potential in drug release applications in future. More material characterization and degradation study could be useful to do for better understanding of behavior of used drug-polymer combinations...|$|R
30|$|Currently, several {{multiscale}} methods exist including quasi-continuum [11], bridging domain [12] and {{finite element}} (FE) combined with atomistic modeling [13]. All these methods couple energies or displacements between two different domains: MD and FE. The authors {{are developing a}} 3 D direct-coupling method between MD and DDD, which is named CADD 3 D 1 and {{is an extension of}} the CADD 2 D [14] approach. In this approach, MD is used where dislocation nucleation are expected (and where DDD would require an ad-hoc treatment), whereas in the remaining zones standard DDD is employed. The key point of the CADD 3 D method is to deal with dislocations passing seamlessly between these two different domains. One notable difficulty is that a dislocation line can cross the interface between the coupled models. Then, the distinct representation of a dislocation, being either an atomistic structure or a set of DDD segments should match perfectly at the coupling interface. This can be achieved effectively by imposing respective boundary conditions to both MD and <b>DDD</b> regions. In <b>this</b> paper, we focus on the MD boundary conditions imposed by DDD: an adequate position and displacement field matching the MD core structures has to be imposed to all boundary atoms within the influence region of dislocations. The details of this approach, commonly called the core template technique will be described in Section “Coupled atomistic and discrete dislocations in 3 D: core template”. Because the dislocation structure is varying with its character angle 2, the core template of an arbitrary mixed angle has to be built.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} effect of right atrial {{appendage}} pacing on atrial electromechanical interrelations in patients with DDD pacemakers. DESIGN [...] Prospective study by M mode echocardiogram, Doppler echocardiogram, and apexcardiogram, along with electrocardiogram and phonocardiogram. SETTING [...] Tertiary cardiac referral centre. PATIENTS [...] 20 patients with DDD pacemakers and 20 age matched normal controls. RESULTS [...] Age, RR interval, atrial size, left ventricular size, and fractional shortening were similar in the two groups. Atrial electromechanical delay (the time from the onset of P wave or atrial pacing spike on ECG to the onset of atrial contraction on M mode echogram) was 68 (SD 7) ms at the lateral site of right atrium, 82 (9) ms at the central fibrous body, 93 (11) ms at the lateral site of left atrium in normals. In patients with <b>DDD</b> pacing, however, <b>this</b> delay increased to 85 (22) ms, 117 (23) ms, and 138 (25) ms respectively (all P 0. 05). Peak atrial shortening rate was not different {{between the two groups}}. Differences of atrial electromechanical activity between the two groups were also reflected on Doppler echocardiogram and apexcardiogram. CONCLUSIONS [...] Right atrial appendage pacing disturbs the normal coordinate sequence of right atrial mechanical activity and leads to a striking and variable increase in intra-atrial conduction time as well as in interatrial conduction time. Left atrial contraction remains synchronous although the timing of the start of its contraction was delayed. These values can be determined in individual patients to allow optimal setting of DDD pacemakers...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{framework}} {{to quantify the}} effect of hydrogen on dislocations using large scale three-dimensional (3 D) discrete dislocation dynamics (<b>DDD)</b> simulations. In <b>this</b> model, the first order elastic interaction energy associated with the hydrogen-induced volume change is accounted for. The three-dimensional stress tensor induced by hydrogen concentration, which is in equilibrium {{with respect to the}} dislocation stress field, is derived using the Eshelby inclusion model, while the hydrogen diffusion is treated as a continuum process. This newly developed framework is utilized to quantify the effect of different hydrogen concentrations on the dynamics of a glide dislocation {{in the absence of an}} applied stress field as well as on the spacing between dislocations in an array of parallel edge dislocations. A shielding effect is observed for materials having a large hydrogen diffusion coefficient, with the shield effect leading to the homogenization of the shrinkage process leading to the glide loop maintaining its circular shape, as well as resulting in a decrease in dislocation separation distances in the array of parallel edge dislocations. On the other hand, for materials having a small hydrogen diffusion coefficient, the high hydrogen concentrations around the edge characters of the dislocations act to pin them. Higher stresses are required to be able to unpin the dislocations from the hydrogen clouds surrounding them. Finally, this new framework can open the door for further large scale studies on the effect of hydrogen on the different aspects of dislocation-mediated plasticity in metals. With minor modifications of the current formulations, the framework can also be extended to account for general inclusion-induced stress field in discrete dislocation dynamics simulations...|$|R
40|$|Dowling-Degos disease (DDD), or reticular {{pigmented}} anomaly of the flexures, {{is a type}} of rare autosomal-dominant genodermatosis {{characterized by}} reticular hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation of the flexures, such as the neck, axilla, and areas below the breasts and groin, and shows considerable heterogeneity. Loss-of-function mutations of keratin 5 (KRT 5) have been identified in <b>DDD</b> individuals. In <b>this</b> study, we collected DNA samples from a large Chinese family affected by generalized DDD and found no mutation of KRT 5. We performed a genome-wide linkage analysis of this family and mapped generalized DDD to a region between rs 1293713 and rs 244123 on chromosome 20. By exome sequencing, we identified nonsense mutation c. 430 G>T (p. Glu 144 ∗) in POFUT 1, which encodes protein O-fucosyltransferase 1, in the family. Study of an additional generalized DDD individual revealed the heterozygous deletion mutation c. 482 delA (p. Lys 161 Serfs∗ 42) in POFUT 1. Knockdown of POFUT 1 reduces the expression of NOTCH 1, NOTCH 2, HES 1, and KRT 5 in HaCaT cells. Using zebrafish, we showed that pofut 1 is expressed in the skin and other organs. Morpholino knockdown of pofut 1 in zebrafish produced a phenotype characteristic of hypopigmentation at 48  hr postfertilization (hpf) and abnormal melanin distribution at 72 hpf, replicating the clinical phenotype observed in our DDD individuals. At 48 and 72 hpf, tyrosinase activities decreased by 33 % and 45 %, respectively, and melanin protein contents decreased by 20 % and 25 %, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that POFUT 1 mutations cause generalized DDD. These results strongly suggest that the protein product of POFUT 1 plays a significant and conserved role in melanin synthesis and transport...|$|R
