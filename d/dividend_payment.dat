25|$|The {{benefits}} Mitsubishi {{had seen}} {{because of its}} strong presence in south-east Asia reversed themselves {{as a result of}} the economic crisis in the region which began in 1991 with the advent of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, referred to in Japan as the beginning of the Lost Decade and continued to 1997. The collapse was partly the result of the Plaza Accord agreement in 1985, which sought to equalize the United States dollar with the Japanese yen and the German mark. In September of that year the company closed its Thai factory in response to a crash in the country's currency and plummeting consumer demand. The large truck plant, which had produced 8,700 trucks in 1996, was shut down indefinitely. In addition, Mitsubishi had little support from sales in Japan, which slowed considerably throughout 1997 and were affected by that country's own economic uncertainty into 1998. Other Japanese automakers, such as Toyota and Honda, bolstered their own slipping domestic sales with success in the U.S. However, with a comparatively small percentage of the American market, the impact of the turmoil in the Asian economy had a greater effect on Mitsubishi, and the company's 1997 losses were the worst in its history. In addition, it lost both its rank as the third largest automaker in Japan to Mazda, and market share overseas. Its stock price fell precipitously, prompting the company to cancel its year-end <b>dividend</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|E
40|$|Cash {{dividends}} and rights {{issues on the}} Istanbul Stock Exchange are commonly accompanied by large stock <b>dividend</b> <b>payments.</b> This paper tests the proposition that stock dividends {{have no effect on}} company value, using a novel GARCH process with event-related intercept terms to capture induced changes in the volatility of stock prices. Returns rise in advance of stock <b>dividend</b> <b>payments,</b> but this effect becomes statistically insignificant when proper allowance is made for heteroscedasticity. Volatility rises after stock <b>dividend</b> <b>payments,</b> and this is attributed to persistence following exceptionally large price movements around the ex dividend day, rather than to any transitory rise in the unconditional returns variance. The study does document some irrationality in responses to cash dividends, with prices rising/ falling after increased/ decreased <b>dividend</b> <b>payments,</b> rather than after the much earlier dividend announcements...|$|R

By the end of 1890 many City figures were suspicious of the Hansard Union, and were calling it [...] "Bottomley's swindle". Despite Bottomley's outward optimism, in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the debenture holders petitioned for the company's compulsory winding-up. In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least £100,000 from the company, filed a petition for bankruptcy. Under examination by the Official Receiver, he could not say where the money had gone, and professed total ignorance of the company's book-keeping. After further enquiries, the Board of Trade instituted prosecutions for fraud against Bottomley, Isaacs and two others.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{responsiveness}} of corporate payout policy to individual-level taxes. We predict {{and find a}} surge of special dividends in the final months of 2010, immediately before individual-level dividend tax rates were expected to increase (but did not). Consistent with prior research on dividend taxes and payout, we find {{that much of the}} increase is concentrated in firms largely held by insiders. In addition, we find evidence that firms alter the timing of their regular <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> by shifting what would normally be January, 2011 regular <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> into December of 2010. To our knowledge this is the first evidence in the literature about the timing of regular <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> in response to tax law changes. The changing of the timing of regular <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> is consistent with Slemrod’s (1992) framework of taxpayer responsiveness to tax changes...|$|R
40|$|Dividend {{taxation}} is {{an important}} component of investors’ taxes and has attracted the attention of policymakers and financial economists. However, the theory of dividends and the reform of dividend taxation remain a puzzle. This paper analyzes the effect of dividend taxation on firms’ dividend policies. Using a natural experiment and difference-in-difference estimation, we find that China’s dividend tax cut in 2005 led firms to increase their <b>dividend</b> <b>payments.</b> Companies with higher proportions of tradable individual shares or investment fund shares were more likely to increase their <b>dividend</b> <b>payments.</b> However, opportunistic behavior also exists, where companies with higher proportions of shares held by executives {{were also more likely to}} increase their <b>dividend</b> <b>payments.</b> These findings support the existence of a causal relationship between China’s tax cut and firms’ increased <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> and imply that the reform of dividend taxation in 2005 achieved its goal...|$|R

2500|$|Penn Central {{management}} {{created a}} holding company, the Penn Central Company, {{and tried to}} diversify the troubled firm into real estate, pipelines, trucking, and other non-railroad ventures. However, in a slow economy, these businesses performed little better than the railroad assets. [...] In addition, these new subsidiaries diverted management {{attention away from the}} problems in the core railroad business. [...] To make matters worse, management insisted on paying dividends to shareholders to create the illusion of success. [...] The Pennsylvania Railroad had a gold-plated reputation on Wall Street since it had the longest record of <b>dividend</b> <b>payment</b> in American corporate history. It was this stellar reputation on Wall Street that permitted the PC to borrow money easily and cheaply. [...] The company had to borrow enormous sums to keep operating. [...] The interest on the loans became an unbearable financial burden, but this fact was kept hidden from shareholders and the general public.|$|E
2500|$|The 1901 meeting {{authorised}} a <b>dividend</b> <b>payment</b> of 6% and {{the issue}} of 2,746 shares at £10 each in order to aid investment in plant and extended premises for the purpose of manufacturing [...] "high-speed engines". This issue of shares amounted to 20% of the then issued capital, and they were taken up by existing shareholders. In the same year the company considerably extended its Knott Mill factory, at which time a visitor noted in particular the work in progress on [...] "several exceptionally large engines for iron and steel works" [...] (one had a 45 ton, 24 foot diameter flywheel and a total weight of 230 tons) and also a wood treatment plant for the Northern Wood Haskinising Company (haskinising was a wood preservation technique). There were reports at this time that the company had licensed and was developing Pictet's discovery of an improved method for the production of oxygen gas, although there were suggestions that this may have been as part of a syndicate involving other Manchester businesses. The plan was for Pictet to experiment further at the Galloway works and if the outcome was successful then a new company would be formed.|$|E

40|$|The {{individual}} {{income tax}} burden on dividends was lowered sharply in 2003 from a maximum rate of 35 % to 15 %, creating {{a unique opportunity}} to analyze the effects of dividend taxes on <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> by U. S. corporations. This paper uses data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) spanning 1980 to 2004 -Q 1 to analyze this issue. We find a sharp and widespread surge in dividend distributions following the tax cut, along several dimensions. First, the fraction of publicly traded firms paying dividends began to increase precisely in 2003 after having declined continuously for more than two decades. Nearly 150 firms have initiated <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> after the tax cut, adding more than $ 1. 5 billion to aggregate quarterly dividends. Most of these firms initiated regular, recurrent payments rather than one-time “special ” distributions. Second, many firms that were already paying dividends prior to the reform raised regular <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> significantly after the tax cut. Third, special dividends also rose, but the magnitude of this effect is likely to be small relative to the increases in regular distributions in the long run. All three of these effects are significant among all company sizes, and are robust to controls for profits and other firm characteristics. The surge in regular <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> after the 2003 reform is unprecedented in recent years. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which also reduced the top individual tax rate on dividends significantly, led to a temporary rise in special <b>dividend</b> <b>payments,</b> but did not affect regular <b>dividend</b> <b>payments...</b>|$|R

40|$|China {{has some}} unique {{institutional}} features. For example, {{the shares of}} listed firms are segmented into negotiable and nonnegotiable ones. The controlling shareholders, usually connected to the government, hold nonnegotiable shares. We examine how these institutional features affected cash <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> in China during the period 1994 - 2006. We find that <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> are positively associated with the proportion of nonnegotiable shares in a firm {{and the proportion of}} nonnegotiable shares held by the controlling shareholder; moreover, the 2001 China Securities Regulatory Commission stipulation requiring cash <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> does not benefit negotiable shareholders. However, we also find that <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> are downside flexible, and controlling shareholders cannot force firms to pay or to pay more dividends when firms' earnings decline significantly. The conventional factors, especially profitability or the capability to pay, still {{play an important role in}} determining the dividend policy. The propensity to pay and the payout ratio in China are not high compared to those of other countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
