50|$|Some EU {{member states}} are {{currently}} receiving large-scale immigration: for instance Spain, {{where the economy}} has created {{more than half of}} all new jobs in the EU over the past five years. The EU, in 2005, had an overall net gain from international migration of +1.8 million people. This accounts for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth in 2005. In 2004, total 140,033 people immigrated to France. Of them, 90,250 were from Africa and 13,710 from Europe. In 2005, immigration fell slightly to 135,890.British emigration towards Southern Europe is of special relevance. Citizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Spain. They mainly come from countries like the UK and Germany, but the British case is of special interest due to its magnitude. The British authorities estimate that the British population in Spain at 700,000.Mid- and long term EU demographics indicate a shortage of skilled laborers on a scale that would endanger economic growth and the stability of numerous industries. For this reason the European Union launched an initiative called the <b>EU</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Card,</b> In 2009. The <b>EU</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Card</b> is initially a temporary residence and work permit.

40|$|While the {{proportion}} of Luxembourgish nationals among the resident working population was above 50. 3 % in 2015, it dropped below 50 % {{in the first quarter}} of 2017. Some 44 % of the working population were EU 28 nationals and 6 % non-EU nationals. Luxembourg’s economy is reliant on its employment of cross-border workers. In 2016, French nationals maintained and increased their proportion of over 50 % of the cross-border working population, reaching 51. 4 % in Q 1 2017, at the expense of both Belgian (24. 4 %) and German (24. 2 %) cross-border workers. They mainly work in sectors such as construction, administrative/support service, accommodation/food service, as well as in the financial/insurance sector or professional, scientific and technical activities. Between 2010 and 2017, the number of foreign salaried workers showed the greatest continuous increase in sectors such as professional, scientific and technical activities, administrative and support services, and financial and insurance services. Regarding specific permits, nationals of China (119 permits), India (70 permits) and Montenegro (40 permits) accounted for 31 % of all first issues of residence permits for salaried workers. Indian nationals were the single largest nationality group receiving their first issue of <b>EU</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Cards,</b> with 90 issued during 2016. This was followed by US nationals (58 permits) and Russian nationals (36 permits). After reaching a peak in 2015, the number of applications for international protection slightly decreased in 2016, from 2447 in 2015 to 2035 in 2016 (decrease of 16. 8 %). Even if the trend slowed down, it remains higher than the levels of 2013 - 2015. Syrian nationals remain the first nationality of applicants for international protection (14. 3 %), Iraqi nationals dropping to 4 th place (7. 9 %) after Albanian nationals (11. 2 %) and Kosovars (10. 2 %). Luxembourg remains the Member State hosting the 4 th highest number of applicants for international protection applicants in relation to the national population. The international protection recognition rate increased from 228 (200 refugee status and 28 subsidiary protection) in 2015 to 790 (764 refugee status and 26 subsidiary protection) in 2016. This represents an increase of 246. 5 % of positive decisions year-on-year. Luxembourg continues to demonstrate its solidarity in respect of the relocation and resettlement of international protection applicants. In 2015, Luxembourg pledged to relocate 557 individuals to Luxembourg in the framework of the EU Council decision to relocate 160, 000 international protection applicants from Greece and Italy. Within this framework, 197 refugees had been relocated by the end of 2016. From January 2017 to 18 August 2017, Luxembourg relocated 186 people. With regards to resettlement, 52 refugees were resettled from Turkey in 2016 as a result of Luxembourg’s pledge to resettle 194 refugees from Turkey in the context of the EU-Turkey agreement of March 2016. 115 people were resettled between 1 st January 2017 and 18 th August 2017. New pieces of legislation were enacted during 2016 / 2017 to assist with the specific migration situation in Luxembourg.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{policies}} {{put in place}} by the main Western destination countries to attract highly skilled migrants. Two main systems can be identified. On the one hand, employer-driven schemes typically call for the migrant to meet a set of minimum skill requirements and to have a job offer before a work visa can be issued. On the other, employee driven schemes typically do not require a job offer, and instead select the migrant based on a set of characteristics chosen by the policy maker. Employer driven schemes are the dominant policy tool in the sample of countries we consider in the analysis, and only Australia, Canada and New Zealand have made employee-driven schemes the mainstay of their skill selective immigration policy. The preliminary evidence we review suggests that the latter are more effective in increasing the skill level of the immigrant population, and casts doubts on the usefulness of new initiatives like the <b>EU</b> <b>blue</b> <b>card</b> that are still based on an employer driven system...|$|E
40|$|Highly skilled {{immigrants}} {{are considered to}} be “sort after” individuals. They provide countries with skilled labour often, if they originate from developing or least developed countries, with significantly less wage demands than similarly skilled domestic workers. Furthermore they provide an attractive solution to skills’ shortages in the labour market of western States. Schemes to encourage this type of immigration have a long history, with the most well-known example supposedly being the US Green Card for labour migrants. Member States of the European Union have also operated similar schemes but it is only recently that the EU itself has entered this field with the adoption of Directive 2009 / 50 /EC, the “Blue Card” Directive. The UK however has opted out of this scheme and has introduced its own points based system for highly skilled migrants. In fact it is not the US Green Card that should be used as the instrument for a comparative analysis with the <b>EU</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Card</b> but the H- 1 B visa. This paper will conduct a comparative analysis of the US, EU and UK schemes for attracting highly skilled migrants. The three schemes will be examined, including the rationale for their implementation, before critically analysing their strengths, weaknesses and likely success in achieving their stated aims, including considering the effects on the migrant’s home State. The merits of each scheme will be assessed with the intention of making recommendations for amendments to ensure that their aims can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|For Germany, India is {{the second}} most {{important}} source of foreign postgraduate students, after China. Student flows from India are contributing significantly to Germany's efforts to internationalise higher education in the country and address labour market skills shortages. Understanding what is driving postgraduate student migration from India to Germany is crucial for further increasing these flows. In India, awareness about Germany as a study destination has been growing in recent years but remains low compared to awareness regarding more traditional study destinations for Indian students, such as the USA, the UK, and Australia. Indian students heading to Germany are attracted by the low cost of education, courses taught in English, the perceived high quality of education, the availability of paid part-time work opportunities during study, an 18 -month post-study visa, and the <b>EU</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Card</b> scheme, together with the perceived availability of good jobs. Overall, the cost advantage German universities offer over universities in the USA, the UK, and Australia is the main draw for most students heading to Germany. Engineering and information technology (IT) courses are the most popular among Indian students in Germany, with the vast majority of these students enrolled on such courses. Students first encounter the possibility of study in Germany through their social networks or private education consultancies, both of which - along with social media sites - serve as important conduits of information and support to aspirant student migrants to Germany. Policy Implications: To benefit from rising Indian student flows to Europe, the cost advantage of German universities must be preserved. Also, students should be given more opportunities to directly interact with representatives of German universities, as education consultancies have limited incentives to recommend study in Germany. The value of embarking on courses other than engineering should be demonstrated...|$|E

First policies {{on the matter}} date from the 1960 s in Canada and the 1970 s in Australia while the USA selective migration programme {{dates back to the}} early 1950 s. However, competition among developed industrialised countries for highly skilled migrants has taken up new urgency in the last 15 years with the onset of the knowledge based economy and society. The UK was the first European country to develop an open high-skill migration policy in the late 1990 s already, but other EU countries like the Netherlands or Germany followed suit in the mid 2000 s. Five years after the adoption of the <b>EU</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Card</b> scheme, developed to attract the best and brightest of the world to the European Union countries, data on the usage of the Blue Card scheme in selected member states show that the Directive has failed to achieve its objectives. Many critiques so far have focused on the low level of mobility that the Blue Card grants. When adopted by a member state, the Blue Card does not offer access to the EU labour market as a whole and is still related to rather cumbersome bureaucratic procedures if the highly skilled worker wants to take up a job in another EU country. Studies on Australia and the USA have shown that temporary migration visas addressing highly skilled migrants may create best opportunities for migrants and employers who sponsor them, Having high employment outcomes and good salaries, such migrants are usually enabled to move on to permanent settlement schemes smoothly. This Policy Brief focuses on the limitations that the Blue Card has with regard to the path that it offers to long term stay and settlement if the highly skilled migrant wishes, alongside the limited intra EU mobility rights that it grants. This Policy Brief suggests that the European Commission should launch a consultation with member states and relevant stakeholders with a view to making the Blue Card more attractive both for member states and for prospective high skill migrants from third countries...|$|E

Low fertility rates and increased life expectancy have been causing changes in the population structure. It is expected that by 2060 the number of elderly population in Europe will have doubled. Consequently, the old-age dependency ratio is expected to drop to 2 to 1 and the average EU age-related public spending is likely to increase by 2. 3 per cent of individual member state’s GDP in the same period.
