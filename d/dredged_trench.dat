By beginning of November 2009, the land approaches to the tunnel had been excavated, and construction of the tunnel, in four 90 m sections, had been completed nearby. The dredger used to excavate the river section of the tunnel cutting arrived on site on 4 November 2009 to excavate 400,000 cubic metres of sediment, which was used to infill the defunct Tyne Dock, reclaiming 13 acre of land for use by Port of Tyne.

40|$|In {{relatively}} shallow coastal waters, {{a submarine}} outfall pipeline is often laid in a <b>dredged</b> <b>trench</b> and the wastewater jet discharges inside a concentric enclosure (a protective riser tube) before release at the seabed. The effect of such lateral confinement over a finite vertical length on {{the mixing of}} a buoyant jet is studied experimentally {{for a wide range}} of geometries. A confinement index β = Hr/(Dr - D) is proposed to categorize the confined buoyant jet, where Hr and Dr are the height and diameter of the confinement, respectively, and D is the jet diameter. Compared to the dilution of the corresponding free buoyant jet, it is found that mixing is impaired for β ≥ 3. For β » 1, the jet is highly confined and there is virtually no dilution within the riser. For β ≤ 1. 5, the confinement has no effect. For 1. 5 ≤ β ≤ 3, a wall-attached swirling plume with enhanced dilution is observed, and the mixing behavior is complex. Simple relations for predicting the initial dilution of a laterally confined plume are presented. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} an analysis {{and evaluation of}} the environmental impact during the initial dredging stage of the Jebel Ali New Container Terminal (6 / 12 / 2005 - 10 / 03 / 2006). Methods of analysis include continuous turbidity monitoring, weekly water sampling for chemical and suspended sediment tests, and the set up of a hydro-meteo database. The <b>dredged</b> <b>trench</b> material is relocated a few kilometers further offshore, into the Reclamation Area and the Stilling Basin. The generated sediment plume is monitored both by mobile and fixed monitoring. During the trench dredging, the turbidity remained well within threshold levels imposed by the client. However with the CSD Marco Polo moving up closer towards the fixed monitoring stations, {{it has to be}} kept in mind that the monitoring platforms, which had to be installed very close to the dredging area due to safety reasons (outside the pipelines corridor), will be situated within the influence radius of the sediment plume. The chemical composition of the seawater showed no significant variance due to the dredging. When the dredging activities were halted during bad weather conditions, it was noticed that the levels of turbidity around the fixed monitoring stations were much higher than while dredging works were going on. Due to the enforced action of wind, wave and current, the sediment is brought into suspension. So these natural actors also {{have an impact on the}} natural increased turbidity and were causing values of suspended sediment in the seawater reaching the threshold determined for dredging activities. Already can be stated that under influence of bad weather much higher turbidity values are reached than dredging works have done up until now. Unfortunately the rough conditions at sea make it impossible to execute a synoptic monitoring at the same time to check and verify the turbidity values at the other mobile locations. Biofouling of the optical scatter instruments results into over-estimated turbidity values. Every sensor needs regularly cleaning. With increasing seawater temperatures the biofouling will speed up. One has to consider to apply anti-fouling agents in order to control the growth of bacteria and algaes. In general it can be concluded that further detailed and thorough investigation is necessary seen the increasing importance of issues related to marine coastal environments, not only for this project, but also in other regions. The strict way in which this project is handled can be used as a model for future environmental monitoring programs and impact assessments...|$|E

Many excavations take place on dry land, but they are also frequently required in completely saturated conditions, and the methods necessary to accomplish them consequently vary widely. This book provides an overview of cutting theories. It begins with a generic model, valid for all types of soil (sand, clay and rock), and continues with the specifics of dry sand, water-saturated sand, clay, atmospheric rock and hyperbaric rock. Small blade angles and large blade angles are discussed for each soil type, and for each case considered the equations/model for cutting forces, power and specific energy are given.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the morphology and the Holocene seismic and sequence stratigraphy and architecture of the infralittoral sedimentary environment of the El Masnou coast (Catalonia, NW Mediterranean Sea) was carried out using multibeam bathymetry and GeoPulse seismic data. This environment extends down to 26 - 30 m water depth, and is defined morphologically by two depositional wedges whose seafloor is affected by erosive furrows, slides, fields of large- and small-scale wavy bedforms, and <b>dredging</b> <b>trenches</b> and pits. Erosive terraces are also identified in the transition domain toward the inner continental shelf. The Holocene stratigraphy of the infralittoral environment is defined by two major seismic sequences (lower and upper), each one formed by internal seismic units. The sequences and units are characterised by downlapping surfaces made up of deposits formed by progradation of coastal lithosomes. The stratigraphy and stratal architecture, displaying a retrogradational arrangement with progradational patterns of minor order, were controlled by different sea-level positions. The stratigraphic division represents the coastal response to the last fourth-order transgressive and highstand conditions, modulated by small-scale sea-level oscillations (≈ 1 - 2 m) of fith to sixth order. This study also highlights the advantage of an integrated analysis using acoustic/seismic methods for practical assessment of the anthropogenic effects on infralittoral domains based on the association of marine geological observations...|$|R

The {{productions}} (and thus the dimensions) of the excavating equipment range from mm 3 /sec - cm 3 /sec to m 3 /sec. In oil drilling layers with a thickness of a magnitude of 0. 2 mm are cut, while in dredging this can be of a magnitude of 0. 1 m with cutter suction dredges and meters for clamshells and backhoe’s. Some equipment is designed for dry soil, while others operate under water saturated conditions. Installed cutting powers may range up to 10 MW. For both the design, the operation and production estimation of the excavating equipment {{it is important to}} be able to predict the cutting forces and powers. After the soil has been excavated it is usually transported hydraulically as a slurry over a short (TSHD’s) or a long distance (CSD’s) or mechanically. Estimating the pressure losses and determining whether or not a bed will occur in the pipeline is of great importance. Fundamental processes of sedimentation, initiation of motion and erosion of the soil particles determine the transport process and the flow regimes.

Fundamental processes of sedimentation, initiation of motion and erosion of the soil particles determine the transport process and the flow regimes.

Although some basic knowledge about the subject is required and expected, dimensionless numbers, the terminal settling velocity (including hindered settling), the initiation of motion of particles, erosion and the flow of a liquid through a pipe are summarized. An overview is given of experiments and theories found in literature. The results of experiments are considered to be the physical reality. Semi empirical theories based on these experiments are considered to be an attempt to describe the physical reality in a mathematical way. These semi empirical theories in general match the experiments on which they are based, but are also limited to the range of the different parameters as used for these experiments. Some theories have a more fundamental character and may be more generic as long as the starting points on which they are based apply. Observing the results of many experiments gives the reader the possibility to form his/her own impression of the processes involved in slurry transport. Flow regimes are identified and theoretical models are developed for each main flow regime based on constant volumetric spatial concentration. The 5 main flow regimes are the fixed or stationary bed regime, the sliding bed regime, the heterogeneous regime, the homogeneous regime and the sliding flow regime. A new model for the Limit Deposit Velocity is derived, consisting of 5 particle size regions and a lower limit. Based on the Limit Deposit Velocity a (semi) fundamental relation is derived for the slip velocity. This relation also enables us to determine the bed height as a function of the line speed. The concentration distribution in the pipe is based on the advection diffusion equation with a diffusivity related to the LDV. Finally a method is given to determine relations for non-uniform sands and gravels based on the superposition principle. <br/...|$|R

In the paper, the motions and stress of the element under wave actions were studied. The linear wave diffraction theory and the three-dimensional source distribution method were applied to calculate the wave loads and motion responses of the tunnel element under different incident wave conditions. In the study, there have no cable on the element. On the basis of the above theories, the stress and the motions of the element were studied. The first order wave forces and the second order wave force were deduced, and the motions equation was made.

It starts with a generic model, which is valid for all types of soil (sand, clay and rock) after which the specifics of dry sand, water saturated sand, clay, atmospheric rock and hyperbaric rock are covered. For each soil type small blade angles and large blade angles, resulting in a wedge in front of the blade, are discussed. The failure mechanism of sand, dry and water saturated, is the so called Shear Type. The failure mechanism of clay is the so called Flow Type, but under certain circumstances also the Curling Type and the Tear Type are possible. Rock will usually fail in a brittle way. This can be brittle tensile failure, the Tear Type for small blade angles, but it can also be brittle shear failure, which is of the Shear Type of failure mechanism for larger blade angles. For practical cutting angles in dredging a combination may occur, the Chip Type. Under hyperbaric conditions rock may also fail in a more apparent ductile way according to the Flow Type or Crushed Type of failure mechanism. This is also called cataclastic failure. For each case considered, the equations/model for the cutting forces, power and specific energy are given. The models are verified with laboratory research, mainly at the Delft University of Technology, but also with data from literature. Dr. ir. Sape A. Miedema (November 8 th 1955) obtained his M.

In order to understand the pattern of P. oceanica colonization, shoot density was quantified over 3 years (2001 – 2003) on different mound locations (crests, sides, valleys). Seagrass coalescence was observed only in valleys between mounds where shoot density averaged 133 ± 50 shoots m? 2, while values for sides and crests were significantly lower (30. 5 ± 14 and 5. 8 ± 2. 6 shoots m? 2, respectively). Although sediment accumulated on both crests and valleys, a significantly thicker sediment layer was recorded in the valleys (9. 8 ± 0. 4 cm) than on crests (1. 1 ± 0. 2). Plaster dissolution rate (an indicator of the hydrodynamic regime) tended to decrease from crests to valleys but even in the valleys, the currents were still higher than in the adjacent vegetated control location. This pattern was constant over time and depths. This is the first study to report on P. oceanica vegetative recruitment on artificial rubble after a disturbance event. It appears that the valleys between the rubble mounds are suitable for seagrass recruitment as sediment deposited between the rubble provides the necessary resources for plant settlement and growth.
