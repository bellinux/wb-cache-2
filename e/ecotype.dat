5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One <b>ecotype</b> prefers to feed on Adenostoma while the other <b>ecotype</b> prefers to feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma <b>ecotype</b> possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation {{to blend in with}} the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus <b>ecotype</b> does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma <b>ecotype</b> is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E

As a result of this genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible.|$|E
5|$|Regionally {{developed}} ecotypes can {{be threatened}} with extinction when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that <b>ecotype.</b> This {{is sometimes called}} genetic mixing. Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material {{can lead to the}} replacement of local genotypes if the hybrids are more fit and have breeding advantages over the indigenous <b>ecotype</b> or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population {{to such a degree that}} none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.|$|E
40|$|To {{completely}} {{understand the}} ecology of a bacterial community, we need to identify its ecologically distinct populations (<b>ecotypes).</b> The greatest promise for enumerating a community's constituent <b>ecotypes</b> is held by molecular approaches that identify bacterial <b>ecotypes</b> as DNA sequence clusters. These approaches succeed when <b>ecotypes</b> correspond with sequence clusters, but some models of bacterial speciation predict a one-to-many and others a many-to-one relationship between <b>ecotypes</b> and sequence clusters. A further challenge is that sequence-based phylogenies often contain a hierarchy of clusters and subclusters within clusters, {{and there is no}} widely accepted theory to guide systematists and ecologists to the size of cluster most likely to correspond to <b>ecotypes.</b> While present systematics attempts to use universal thresholds of sequence divergence to help demarcate species, the recently developed ‘community phylogeny’ approach assumes no universal thresholds, but demarcates <b>ecotypes</b> based on the analysis of a lineage's evolutionary dynamics. Theory-based approaches like this one can give a conceptual framework as well as operational criteria for hypothesizing the identity and membership of <b>ecotypes</b> from sequence data; ecology-based approaches can then confirm that the putative <b>ecotypes</b> are actually ecologically distinct. Bacterial <b>ecotypes</b> that are demonstrated to have a history of coexistence as ecologically distinct lineages (based on sequence analysis) and as a prognosis of future coexistence (based on ecological differences), are the fundamental units of bacterial ecology and evolution, and should be recognized by bacterial systematics...|$|R

5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences.

The research supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients as a distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago.

40|$|The {{degree of}} genetic {{diversity}} {{within and between}} 21 Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh <b>ecotypes</b> was estimated by AFLP analysis. Within seven of the 21 <b>ecotypes,</b> a low but significant level of polymorphism was detected, and for five of these <b>ecotypes</b> two or three distinct subgroups could be distinguished. As these <b>ecotypes</b> represent natural populations, this intraecotypic diversity reflects natural genetic variation and diversification within the <b>ecotypes.</b> The source of this diversity remains unclear but is intriguing {{in view of the}} predominantly self-fertilizing nature of Arabidopsis. Interrelationships between the different <b>ecotypes</b> were estimated after AFLP fingerprinting using two enzyme combinations (EcoRI/MseI and SacI/MseI) and a number of selective primer pairs. SacI recognition sites are less evenly distributed in the genome than EcoRI sites, and occur more frequently in coding sequences. In most cases, AFLP data from only one enzyme combination are used for genetic diversity analysis. Our results show that the use of two enzyme combinations can result in significantly different classifications of the <b>ecotypes</b> both in cluster and ordination analysis. This difference most probably reflects differences in the genomic distribution of the AFLP fragments generated, depending on the enzymes and selective primers used. For closely related varieties, {{as in the case of}} Arabidopsis <b>ecotypes,</b> this can preclude reliable classification...|$|R

In order to study the phenology and morphology characteristics of 43 <b>ecotypes</b> and line of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) under salinity of irrigation water (5. 2 dS. m- 1) a field experiment was conducted at research farm of center of excellence for special crops, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, during growing season of 2009 - 2010 based on a randomized complete block design with three replications. Results showed that four sesame <b>ecotypes</b> could not emerge, 14 sesame <b>ecotypes</b> had appropriate emergence but died before reproductive stage and only 58 % of sesame <b>ecotypes</b> could alive until maturity. There was significant difference between sesame <b>ecotypes</b> for phenological stages and were varied from 64 to 81 days for vegetative and 60 to 65 days for reproductive stages. Plant height, number and length of branches also were different between sesame <b>ecotypes.</b> The highest and the lowest plant height were observed in MSC 43 and MSC 12 <b>ecotypes,</b> respectively. Number of branches per plant was from 1 to 8 and length of branches in 32 percent of <b>ecotypes</b> was more than 100 cm. There was a considerable correlation between seed weight in plant with reproductive growth (r= 0. 38 **) and plant height (r= 0. 25).

The two collections were assessed at separate field experiments. MANOVA for all the morphological traits showed significant difference between <b>ecotypes.</b> Univariate ANOVA verified these differences for most of the traits in the northern <b>ecotypes</b> (first collection) while for southern <b>ecotypes</b> no significant differences were obtained for the studied traits except seed yield. Among and within <b>ecotypes</b> genotypic coefficient of variation indicated higher level of variation among <b>ecotypes</b> than within <b>ecotypes.</b> In both of the experiments, there was a large genetic variation for silybin and silymarin quality and quantity. Cluster analysis of 34 accessions was performed for morphological traits and silymarin and silybin characteristics, separately. The resulting dendrogram based on silybin and silymarin characteristics revealed that the native accessions such as Dezfoul, Fereydounkenar and Nour, had highest flavonolignans and they were better than the foreign varieties.

Plant breeding may provide a relatively cost effective short-term solution to the salinity problem by producing cultivars able to remain productive at low to moderate levels of salinity. Five alfalfa cultivars, �Seyah-Roud�, �Ahar-Hourand�, �Oskou�, �Malekan� and �Sefida-Khan� were assessed for salt tolerance at mature plant stage. A greenhouse screening system {{was used to evaluate}} individual alfalfa plants grown in perlit medium, and irrigated with water containing different amounts of NaCl. Three salt levels were achieved by adding 0, 100 and 200 mM NaCl to Hoagland nutrient solution, respectively. Forage yield, sodium and potassium contents and K/Na ratio was determined. Also, leaf samples were analyzed for proline and chlorophyll contents. The <b>ecotypes</b> Seyha-Roud and �Sefida-Khan� had comparatively less sodium contents than �Oskou�, �Ahar-Hourand� and �Malekan� <b>ecotypes,</b> also potassium content increased under saline condition. Forage yield of different alfalfa <b>ecotypes</b> was significantly influenced by the salinity.

Tests made use of dogwood <b>ecotypes</b> from Utah, Massachusetts (Mass), Chalk River (CR), Saskatoon, Northwest Territories (NWT) and Alaska. Under all systems, the northern <b>ecotypes</b> (Alaska and NWT) attained VM first. Order of VM attainment was consistent between systems. Certain southern <b>ecotypes</b> (Utah and CR) did not attain VM under Saskatoon conditions, however, all plants survived winter temperatures lower than - 30 °C. Controlled environment studies indicated that northern <b>ecotypes</b> can be induced to true VM by either short days (8 hr), low night temperatures (5 °C), or a combination of both. The more southern <b>ecotypes</b> required short days for VM induction, but low temperatures could enhance earliness of induction. Low temperatures in the absence of short days were not effective for southern <b>ecotypes.</b> Controlled freezing studies of short day/warm temperature (SD/WT) treated plants indicated that all tested <b>ecotypes</b> acquired a high degree of acclimating ability prior to the attainment of VM. Following 4 weeks of acclimation, hardiness levels at budset (prior to VM) exceeded - 22 °C. Planting of dogwoods into established turf led to early growth cessation, but not dormancy induction.

Though these two populations spend {{a period of}} the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey–habitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence. A study has identified the remains of a population of extinct Pleistocene Beringian wolves with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these were specialist megafauna hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived. Analogous to the modern wolf <b>ecotype</b> that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to more successfully adapt to the human habitat.|$|E

After 7 days of water stress, Souihli, Sidi Bouzid and Tozeur 1 <b>ecotypes</b> maintained higher leaf water potential allowing them to keep hydrated tissue cells, a significant accumulation of proline and a high peroxidases activity which allowed them to withstand the effect of oxidative stress and preserve their chlorophyll content.

Although the peroxidases activity decreased for Sidi Bouzid and Souihli <b>ecotypes</b> and remained moderate for Tozeur 1 under severe stress compared to what was registered after moderate stress, it remained important compared to their control. This must be due to an acclimatation of these <b>ecotypes</b> to water stress.

25|$|The theory {{proposed}} {{was that}} this pattern matched the south to north disappearance of the wolf due to European colonization and its resulting loss of habitat. Bounties led to the extirpation of wolves initially in the south east, and as the wolf population declined wolf–coyote admixture increased.

The Great Lakes wolves largely reflect lineages that have descendants in the modern wolf and coyote populations, but also reflect a distinct gray wolf <b>ecotype</b> which may have descendants in the modern wolf populations.

30|$|After {{establishing}} the procedure {{to determine the}} AA content in D-AA treated plants, 17 different <b>ecotypes</b> from Arabidopsis thaliana were randomly chosen for further analysis. It was one goal of this approach to find <b>ecotypes</b> with aberrant AA patterns after application of D-AAs. Such lines {{could be used as}} genetic starting material for the elucidation of the metabolic pathway of D-AAs in plants. This set of <b>ecotypes</b> should underline that this method and approach is able to reach this goal.|$|R
