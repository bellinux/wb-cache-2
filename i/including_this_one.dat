500|$|Wolf 359 {{first came}} to the {{attention}} of astronomers because of the relatively high rate of [...] motion against the background, known as the proper motion. A high rate of proper motion can indicate that a star is located nearby, as more distant stars must move at higher velocities in order to achieve the same rate of angular travel across the celestial sphere. The proper motion of Wolf 359 was first measured in 1917 by German astronomer Max Wolf, with the aid of astrophotography. In 1919 he published a catalog of over one thousand stars with high proper motions, <b>including</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> that are still identified by his name. He listed this star as entry number 359, and the star has since been referred to as Wolf 359 in reference to Max Wolf's catalogue.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{introduced}} {{the characters of}} The Lone Gunmen—conspiracy theorists John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) and Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood). The characters, who were used to help Mulder appear more credible, were originally meant to only appear in this episode, but due to their popularity on the internet, they returned in the second-season episode [...] "Blood" [...] and became recurring characters. The inspiration for the Lone Gunmen came {{from a group of}} men that writers Glen Morgan and Marilyn Osborn met at a UFO convention in June 1993. The trio would eventually feature in the spin-off series The Lone Gunmen. Tom Braidwood, who plays Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike, was the first assistant director for the series, and became Frohike after passing by the office where the producers were casting the roles of the Gunmen. Braidwood's name had been used in several episodes, <b>including</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> as an in-joke due to his assistant director role.|$|E
500|$|The {{libretto}} {{was written}} by Christian Friedrich Henrici, better known as Picander, Bach began {{to work with him}} in 1725, and they collaborated notably on the major St Matthew Passion.

The poet included as the first movement two verses from a psalm (...) and as the closing chorale the third stanza of Martin Schalling's hymn [...] "". The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that battle scenes were often depicted in art and music. In the opening lines taken from a psalm, the battle of Michael against Satan is already won. Satan is mentioned only in the first movement. A focus of the later sequence of alternating arias and recitatives is on guardian angels seen as [...] "holy watchmen". The libretto was published in the 1728/29 year of his collection [...] They appeared in quarterly volumes to help the congregation following the text.|$|E

With millions of dollars at stake, pirates have little incentive to stop. In Finland, one case involved pirates who had been captured and whose boat was sunk. As the pirates attacked a vessel of Singapore, not Finland, and are not themselves EU or Finnish citizens, they were not prosecuted.

2500|$|As {{customary}} in royal families, Louis-Charles was {{cared for}} by multiple people. Queen Marie Antoinette appointed governesses to look after all three of her children. Louis-Charles' original governess was Yolande de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac, who left France {{on the night of}} 16–17 July 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, at the urging of Louis XVI. She was replaced by the marquise Louise Élisabeth de Tourzel. Additionally, the queen selected Agathe de Rambaud to be the official nurse of Louis-Charles. Alain Decaux wrote: [...] "Madame de Rambaud was officially in charge of the care of the Dauphin from the day of his birth until 10 August 1792; in other words, for seven years. During these seven years, she never left him, she cradled him, took care of him, dressed him, comforted him, and scolded him. Many times, more than Marie Antoinette, she was a true mother for him". Some have suggested that Axel von Fersen, who was romantically linked with Marie Antoinette, was the father of her son. The fact that Louis Charles was born exactly nine months after he returned to court was noted, but this theory was debunked by most scholars, who reject it, observing that the time of his conception corresponded perfectly in the time that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had {{spent a lot of time}} together. Marie Antoinette, who gained massive weight because of her pregnancies, <b>including</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> (she was described as [...] "very fat" [...] by the king of Sweden), retained her charisma with an imposing figure in her court, where she had lot of admirers, but she remained a faithful, strong-willed wife and a stern but loving mother.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded it five {{stars and}} lauded {{it as an}} [...] "unashamedly epic {{reflection}} on love and loss" [...] and a [...] "mad and magnificent film." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter states [...] "Brandishing an ambition it's likely no film, <b>including</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> could entirely fulfill, The Tree of Life is nonetheless a singular work, an impressionistic metaphysical inquiry into mankind's place {{in the grand scheme}} of things that releases waves of insights amidst its narrative imprecisions." [...] Justin Chang of Variety states the film [...] "represents something extraordinary" [...] and [...] "is in many ways his simplest yet most challenging work, a transfixing odyssey through time and memory that melds a young boy's 1950s upbringing with a magisterial rumination on the Earth's origins." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone states [...] "Shot with a poet's eye, Malick's film is a groundbreaker, a personal vision that dares to reach for the stars." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film much praise and stated, [...] "The sheer beauty of this film is almost overwhelming, but as with other works of religiously minded art, its aesthetic glories are tethered to a humble and exalted purpose, which is to shine the light of the sacred on secular reality". Total Film gave the film a five-star review (denoting 'outstanding'): [...] "The Tree of Life is beautiful. Ridiculously, rapturously beautiful. You could press 'pause' at any second and hang the frame on your wall." [...] Richard Corliss of Time named it one of the Top 10 Best Movies of 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Wilds {{originally}} {{lived at}} Western Pavilion, directly opposite Gothic House, {{but he is}} recorded at living at Gothic House (then named Priory Lodge) between 1843 and 1845. At some point after this it was divided internally into three houses. An early photograph shows the house with blank and pointed-arched windows at ground-floor level, set behind a low wall and with a tree next to it. Its appearance was altered in 1880 when it entered commercial use: W.H. Strevens, an auctioneer, redesigned the façade in a simpler interpretation of the Gothic Revival style and extended it westwards, taking in five adjacent houses. [...] In 1898 it was further altered when Sharman's Drapery took over and converted {{the whole of the}} ground floor into a shop. The department store Plummer Roddis then bought the building in 1920 and extended the shopfront further west and to the south along Western Terrace. Henry Ward was responsible for this work. The house [...] " [...] now the nucleus of their premises" [...] and had been greatly altered: the whole ground floor had been removed and the plain Gothic-style addition of 1880 gave the appearance of being [...] "grafted on". [...] Plummer Roddis was taken over by Debenhams, and the building was still in their ownership in 1993. By 1998, the store had moved to new premises in the Churchill Square shopping centre and the building was split up into smaller shop units. [...] Branches of the Blockbuster video rental shop and the Brighton-based independent supermarket Taj occupied the western part, and by 2001 Loch Fyne Restaurants operated a seafood restaurant in the unit on the corner of Western Terrace. [...] After this closed, Spanish restaurant Pintxo People traded from the premises, but this in turn closed in February 2009. In February 2010, Brighton and Hove city council granted an alcohol licence for a new bar, and the Rock 'N' Roller American Restaurant and Pool Bar opened in April that year. This later closed down and was offered for sale on a leasehold basis. Meanwhile, Blockbuster went into administration in January 2013 and closed many stores, <b>including</b> <b>this</b> <b>one.</b> [...] On 29 March 2014, the eastern section of the building (on the corner of Western Terrace) reopened as the Verano Lounge restaurant and bar. [...] The sale and refurbishment cost £450,000. [...] On 24 September 2016, the Verano Lounge closed and was put on the market.|$|E
