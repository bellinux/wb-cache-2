Stefani commented that [...] "...all <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> was look at Tony and pray that God would {{let me have a}} baby with him." [...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of Tragic Kingdoms songs, such as [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "Sunday Morning", and [...] "Hey You!", chronicle {{the ups and downs of}} their relationship.|$|E
500|$|The French and Indian War {{began in}} 1754 and Adams began to {{struggle}} {{with the issue of}} a young man's responsibility in the conflict; contemporaries of his social position were largely spectators, while those who were less solvent joined the battle as a means to make some money. Adams later said, [...] "I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> to be a Lawyer." [...] He was acutely aware that he was the first in his family that [...] "degenerated from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{his brother}} died in 1929, Pond married Katherine N. de Nancrede, who was 47 years old, at a {{ceremony}} in Ann Arbor. [...] Pond said at the time, [...] "It's the first time <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> it, and I thought I ought to be pardoned because of my youth." [...] Pond was also an amateur acrobat and remained a physical fitness buff all of his life. [...] At {{the time of his}} wedding in 1929, the Associated Press reported that he is [...] "almost as well known for his present athletic agility as for his architectural accomplishments. A part of his daily routine is to turn handsprings and flipflops and do other strenuous exercises." [...] He drew applause when, on his 80th birthday, he grabbed his bare knees with both hands and performed a backflip. [...] A photograph of Pond's feat was published in Life magazine in June 1937.|$|E

500|$|Away from acting, Hawke {{directed}} the music video for the 1994 song [...] "Stay (I Missed You)," [...] by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb, {{who was a}} member of Hawke's theater company at the time. In a 2012 interview, Hawke said that the song, which was included in Reality Bites, is the only number-one popular song by an unsigned artist in the history of music. He published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, [...] "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> And it was just one of the best things I ever did." [...] The book met with a mixed reception. Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke [...] "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues." [...] The New York Times thought Hawke did [...] "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately [...] "a sweet love story".|$|E

[...] "I remembered Verity as being bright and, to use the phrase, full of piss and vinegar! She was gutsy and she used to fight and argue with me, {{even though she was}} not at a very high level as a production assistant." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, Wood was {{assigned}} to the Advanced Planning Group charged with creating Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), the NATO headquarters organization. The chief of the Advanced Planning Group was now-Lieutenant General Alfred Gruenther, who was still using Wood as his [...] "personal dog robber", or staff troubleshooter, so Wood took the job of staff secretary as it seemed to them to be the best control point.

2500|$|In Berlin, he insinuated {{himself into}} the Nazi Party and read Nazi propaganda, in {{particular}} Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. Sorge attended so many beer halls with his new acquaintances that he gave up drinking {{so as not to}} say anything inappropriate. His abstinence from drinking did not make his Nazi companions suspicious. It was an example of his devotion to and absorption in his mission, as he was a heavy drinker. He later explained to Hede Massing, [...] "That was the bravest thing <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> Never will I be able to drink enough to make up for this time." [...] Later, his drinking came to undermine his work.|$|E
2500|$|Crohmălniceanu {{sees in the}} Bizarre Pages {{indication}} of a [...] "singular" [...] and tragic experience, while Geo Șerban argues that Urmuz's [...] "verve" [...] comes from destructive pressures on his own psychology. Reviewer Simona Vasilache also suggests that the Bizarre Pages hide a [...] "long digested" [...] rage, with serious and even dramatic undertones. Other essayists have spoken about Urmuz's [...] "cruelty" [...] in depicting anguishing situations, in criticizing social life and in using language stripped of its metaphors; they call him [...] "one of the cruelest authors <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> read" [...] (Eugène Ionesco) and [...] "cruel in a primitive sense" [...] (Irina Ungureanu). As Ciprian reports, Urmuz was also self-deprecatory, amused by the others' attention, and claiming that his own elucubrații ("phantasmagorias") could only still be used to [...] "trip the seminary brethren". One of his aphorisms hints to his internal drama {{and its role in}} creation: [...] "There are cases when God can only help you by giving you more and more suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Good Morning America, Simon Cowell was asked of the then six American Idol winners, who he thought had the best voice. Cowell immediately answered that Clarkson did [...] "by a mile", noting that she was [...] "up there" [...] with other great singers such as Celine Dion. Esquire wrote that Clarkson has [...] "the best voice {{in the history of}} pop music". Reviewing Stronger, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone states, Clarkson has, [...] "One of music's most remarkable voices." [...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard considered Clarkson {{as one of the greatest}} singers in pop music." [...] Regarding the controversial practice of lip-syncing, Clarkson claims that she never has, and never will lip-sync, elaborating in {{an interview}} with Cory Myers; [...] "I've actually never done that because I'm terrified, if <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> that, something horrible would happen, the track would skip. I have a really unhealthy fear about it. So no, I've never done that". Clarkson has earned the title [...] "Queen of Covers" [...] for her ability to perform songs from artists of various genres.|$|E

Originally I was knocked for being too left-wing, and now apparently I've sold out and I'm too right-wing, but all the time I've been being me, and that certainly isn't the person I recognise in anything that's written about me." [...] He denies being anti-establishment though, [...] "I wrote a sitcom for the BBC when I was 21! [...] How the fuck can I be anti-establishment? From the first interview <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did,</b> I talked about Morecambe and Wise, and every time {{they wanted me to}} talk about Lenny Bruce I'd say, 'Yeah, he's fine, but he doesn't make me laugh the way Eric 'n' Ernie do." [...] He also points out he was a socialist at a time when [...] "the media was on the whole slavishly worshipping of Thatcher". He said of his political views [...] "I believe in the politics of Clement Attlee. I'm a Welfare State Labour voter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse. [...] "It {{was one of}} those wild things where I went to audition. And I thought I was funny and the person I auditioned for didn't, and so I had blown the job and I guess weeks later they got new casting people," [...] Merkerson said on the NPR program Tell Me More. [...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did,</b> I think it was a big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said I {{have to look at the}} plate. So the entire [...] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, Paul Reubens". Merkerson has also appeared on The Cosby Show, among other series.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stylistically, Rosenthal {{attempted}} {{to recreate the}} elements and themes of the original film. The opening title features a jack-o'-lantern that splits in half to reveal a human skull. In the original, the camera zoomed in on the jack-o'-lantern's left eye. [...] The first scene {{of the film is}} presented through a first-person camera format in which a voyeuristic Michael Myers enters an elderly couple's home and steals a knife from the kitchen. Rosenthal attempts to reproduce the [...] "jump" [...] scenes present in Halloween, but does not film Myers on the periphery, which is where he appeared in many of the scenes of the original. Under Rosenthal's direction, Myers is the central feature of a majority of the scenes. In an interview with Luke Ford, Rosenthal explains,The first movie <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> [...] was a sequel, but {{it was supposed to be}} a direct continuation. It started one minute after the first movie ended. You have to try hard to maintain the style of the first movie. I wanted it to feel like a two-parter. You have the responsibility and the restraints of the style that's been set. It was the same crew. My philosophy was to do more of a thriller than a slasher movie.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{members of}} the Rocko's Modern Life staff created other {{successful}} ventures. Stephen Hillenburg pitched SpongeBob SquarePants to Nickelodeon in 1997. Murray said of the pitch, [...] "If it goes well, it'll be a blessing to us all." [...] The network bought the show, which premiered in 1999, {{and it became a}} popular, critical and financial success, and one of the biggest shows on Nick. Hillenburg stated that he [...] "learned a great deal about writing and producing animation for TV" [...] from his time on Rocko's Modern Life. Two writers for the series, Dan Povenmire and Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, went on to create Phineas and Ferb for the Disney Channel; the show became a ratings success and received numerous award nominations. When Murray returned with a new animated series, Camp Lazlo, in 2005, much of the former staff of Rocko's Modern Life joined him. Murray stated that [...] "We always kept in touch and they told me to look them up if <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> another project", adding that the crew already knew his sensibilities and an extra decade worth of experience. Carlos Alazraqui, who played Rocko, also ended up playing the main character of Lazlo. Derek Drymon and Nick Jennings, both part of the staff, went on to be responsible for the tone and visual looks of a lot of very successful animated series that came later.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Eminem also {{addressed}} the mindstate he had {{while working on}} 2009's Relapse saying: [...] "It was interesting, man.

Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E
