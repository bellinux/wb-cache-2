5|$|After {{talks of}} closure for years, Wayzata Bay Center closed its doors on August 15, 2011. Demolition began shortly after in April 2012, when all {{stores in the}} mall had either {{relocated}} or closed. The Original Pancake House, a restaurant, was the final tenant to close in the mall. The restaurant, a tenant of the center since 1994, relocated to neighboring Plymouth, while Adele's Frozen Custard, a tenant in the mall since 2009, closed their Wayzata location entirely. Among the mall's other final tenants were a True Value hardware store, a jewelry store, a <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>store,</b> and a furniture store.|$|E
5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>store</b> called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E

500|$|In 1941, a 33-year-old George McGrew {{arrived in}} Los Angeles and began playing {{piano in the}} Eutropheon, a small <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>store</b> and raw food {{restaurant}} on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The café was owned by John and Vera Richter, who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany. Their followers, known as [...] "Nature Boys", wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name [...] "eden ahbez", writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there, while living in a cave near Palm Springs, that ahbez wrote [...] "Nature Boy". Partly autobiographical, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 1960s, Wilson began an {{obsession}} with fitness that led him to move the furniture out of his living room in order to make room for tumbling mats and exercise bars; later briefly serving as the co-owner of his own <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>store.</b> Wilson reported in 1967, [...] "I want to turn people on to vegetables, good natural food, organic food. Health is an important element in spiritual enlightenment. But I do not want to be pompous about it, so we will engage in a satirical approach." [...] Derek Taylor remembers: [...] "He'd be sitting with me in this restaurant going on and on about this supposedly strict vegetarian diet of his, preaching vegetarianism at me while at the very same moment he'd be whacking down some massive hamburger." ...|$|E

At the same time, Brennan notes, [...] "little by little, Steve and I separated. But we were never able to fully let go. We never talked about breaking up or going our separate ways and we didn't have that conversation where one person says it's over." [...] They continued to grow apart, but Jobs would still seek her out, and visit her while she was working in a <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>store</b> or as a live-in babysitter.

2500|$|Sometime in 1969, Wilson {{opened a}} {{short-lived}} <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>store</b> called The Radiant Radish. The store closed in 1971 due to unprofitable produce expenditures and Wilson's {{general lack of}} business acumen. Reports from this era detailed Wilson as [...] "increasingly withdrawn, brooding, hermitic... and occasionally, he is {{to be seen in}} the back of some limousine, cruising around Hollywood, bleary and unshaven, huddled way tight into himself." [...] This notion was contested by lyricist Stanley Shapiro. Nevertheless, Wilson's reputation suffered {{as a result of his}} purported eccentricities, and he quickly became known as a commercial has-been whom record labels feared. When Shapiro persuaded Wilson to rewrite and rerecord a number of Beach Boys songs in order to reclaim his legacy, he contacted fellow songwriter Tandyn Almer (whom Wilson would later characterize as his [...] "best friend") for support. The trio then spent a month reworking cuts from the Beach Boys' Friends album. As Shapiro handed demo tapes to A Records executives, they found the product favorable before they learned of Wilson and Almer's involvement, and proceeded to veto the idea. Wilson commented in 1976: ...|$|E

40|$|Alternative health {{practices}} {{have become increasingly}} popular in recent years. Many patients visit specific complementary practitioners, while others attempt to educate themselves, trusting advice from employees at local <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> or the Internet. Thirty-two retail <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> were surveyed {{on the nature of}} the information provided by their staff. A research assistant visited the stores and presented as the mother of a child in whom Crohn’s disease had been diagnosed. Seventy-two per cent (23 of 32) of store employees offered advice, such as to take nutritional and herbal supplements. Of the 23 stores where recommendations were made, 15 (65 %) based their recommendation on a source of information. Fourteen of the 15 stores using information sources used the same reference book. This had a significant impact on the recommendations; the use of nutritional supplements was favoured. In conclusion, retail <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> are not as inconsistent as hypothesized, although there are many variances in the types of supplements recommended for the same chronic disease...|$|R
