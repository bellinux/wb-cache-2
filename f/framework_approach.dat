It considers bottom up and clustering methods and then details the research plans for implementing and improving existing <b>framework</b> <b>approaches</b> based on the overall usage profile. The work focuses on adapting and applying analysis <b>framework</b> <b>approaches</b> to UK energy data {{in order to determine}} the effectiveness of creating a few (single figures) archetypical users with the intention of improving on the current methods of determining usage profiles. The work is currently in progress and the paper details initial results using data collected in Milton Keynes around 1990. Various possible enhancements to the work are considered including a split based on temperature to reflect the varying UK weather conditions...|$|R

50|$|The modern {{formulation}} of moduli problems and definition of moduli spaces {{in terms of}} the moduli functors (or more generally the categories fibred in groupoids), and spaces (almost) representing them, dates back to Grothendieck (1960/61), in which he described the general <b>framework,</b> <b>approaches</b> and main problems using Teichmüller spaces in complex analytical geometry as an example. The talks in particular describe the general method of constructing moduli spaces by first rigidifying the moduli problem under consideration.|$|R

The <b>framework’s</b> <b>approach</b> has brought up incentives, which has encouraged the production of many works in recent years, such as Franch (2012): an approach that relates the goal-oriented and agent paradigms and brings attention to the environment’s intentional properties, as well as their relationships, instead of immediate behaviors.

50|$|In logic, {{a logical}} {{framework}} {{provides a means}} to define (or present) a logic as a signature in a higher-order type theory {{in such a way}} that provability of a formula in the original logic reduces to a type inhabitation problem in the framework type theory. This approach has been used successfully for (interactive) automated theorem proving. The first logical framework was Automath; however, the name of the idea comes from the more widely known Edinburgh Logical Framework, LF. Several more recent proof tools like Isabelle are based on this idea. Unlike a direct embedding, the logical <b>framework</b> <b>approach</b> allows many logics to be embedded in the same type system.|$|E
