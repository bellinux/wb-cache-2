But my conviction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E

My own interpretation of spirituality isn't important, because {{we all have our}} own. What matters <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> something greater than me as an individual that helps bring me peace." ...|$|E
500|$|Journalist Caitlin Flanagan, {{who wrote}} an exposé in The Atlantic titled [...] "The Dark Power of Fraternities: A yearlong {{investigation}} of Greek houses", told On the Media {{that she was}} concerned that Erdely's article could inhibit reforms of the Greek system. She said: [...] "I think we've gone backwards 30 years. And I think the level of devastation that this Rolling Stone report that's now looking to go from a misremembered event to perhaps an actual hoax." [...] Flanagan noted that [...] "what Rolling Stone has pushed me into <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> now become someone {{who is on the}} side of fraternities and defending fraternities." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think the thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a lot of younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|Brodie {{suggested}} that Stevens's hatred of Johnson {{was the only}} thing keeping him from despair, aware as he was of the continued violence in the South, some of which was committed by the Ku Klux Klan. [...] Several of the southern states had been re-admitted by this time, and the murders and intimidation were aiding the Democrats there in restoring white rule. With the Republicans unwilling to embrace black suffrage in their platform and the Democrats opposed to it, Stevens feared Democratic victory in the 1868 elections might even bring back slavery. He told his fellow Pennsylvania politician, Alexander McClure, [...] "My life has been a failure. [...] With all this great struggle of years in Washington, and the fearful sacrifice of life and treasure, I see little hope for the Republic.", He took pride, he continued, in his role in establishing free public education in Pennsylvania. When interviewed by a reporter seeking to gain his life story, Stevens replied, [...] "I have no history. My life-long regret <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lived so long and so uselessly." [...] Nevertheless, in his last formal speech to the House, Stevens stated that [...] "man still is vile. [...] But such large steps have lately been taken in the true direction, that the patriot has a right to take courage." ...|$|E

2500|$|By all accounts, Hale comported himself {{well before}} the hanging. Over the years, there has been {{speculation}} {{as to whether he}} specifically uttered the line: [...] "I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country."

She later wrote: [...] "I was not a card-carrying member, but at that meeting I was a member in body, spirit and soul... So I think that Congress was really an eye-opener for me. That, maybe, is when I started to be politicized. Although there is another thing, which I have always felt, which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always resented being dominated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Navratilova was a {{guest on}} CNN's Connie Chung Tonight show on July 17, 2002. During the show, Chung quoted a German {{newspaper}} which quoted Navratilova as saying: [...] "The most absurd part of my escape from the unjust system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> exchanged one system that suppresses free opinion for another. The Republicans in the U.S. manipulate public opinion and sweep controversial issues under the table. It's depressing. Decisions in America are {{based solely on the}} question of how much money will come out of it and not on the questions of how much health, morals or environment suffer as a result." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first day}} of Abe's trial was November 25, 1936, and by 5a.m. crowds were already {{gathering}} to attend. The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused {{by some of the}} details involved in the case, yet made sure that the trial was held with the utmost seriousness. Abe's statement before receiving sentencing began, [...] "The thing I regret most about this incident <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to be misunderstood as some kind of sexual pervert... There had never been a man in my life like Ishida. There were men I liked, and with whom I slept without accepting money, but none made me feel the way I did toward him." ...|$|E

Though nominated many times, Khan has not attended any Indian film award ceremonies and has stated that [...] "Indian film awards lack credibility". When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian film awards, Aamir Khan said, [...] "Fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no objections to film awards per se. I just feel that if I don't value a particular film award, then I won't attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I don't see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I don't trust them. I have no faith in them so I would prefer to stay away." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the news}} broke {{at the end}} of the week tributes have poured in for the former Ajax and Netherlands legend, with all Eredivisie games {{featuring}} a round of applause on 14 minutes, Cruyff’s former shirt number. Ahead of their league game against Eibar at the Camp Nou (25 October 2015), Barcelona players showed their support for Cruyff by wearing orange T-shirts bearing the words 'Ànims Johan' (Catalan for 'Get well soon Johan'). Writing in his weekly De Telegraaf column, Cruyff admitted, “Often the media are an additional tax, but the last week that has been different. The way in which a reply is posted via a variety of media in my situation, was emotional and heartwarming. I am extremely proud of the appreciation shown by all responses.” On his condition, Cruyff added, “Meanwhile, we have to wait. It’s really annoying that it has been leaked so quickly, because the only thing I know now <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lung cancer. No more. Because the investigation is ongoing.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At 96 by 78inches, The Gross Clinic {{is one of}} the artist's largest works, and {{considered}} by some to be his greatest. Eakins' high expectations {{at the start of the}} project were recorded in a letter, [...] "What elates me more <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just got a new picture blocked in and it is very far better than anything I have ever done. As I spoil things less and less in finishing I have the greatest hopes of this one" [...] But if Eakins hoped to impress his home town with the picture, he was to be disappointed; public reaction to the painting of a realistic surgical incision and the resultant blood was ambivalent at best, and it was finally purchased by the college for the unimpressive sum of $200. Eakins borrowed it for subsequent exhibitions, where it drew strong reactions, such as that of the New York Daily Tribune, which both acknowledged and damned its powerful image, [...] "but the more one praises it, the more one must condemn its admission to a gallery where men and women of weak nerves must be compelled to look at it. [...] For not to look it is impossible...No purpose is gained by this morbid exhibition, no lesson taught—the painter shows his skill and the spectators' gorge rises at it—that is all." [...] The college now describes it thus: [...] "Today the once maligned picture is celebrated as a great nineteenth-century medical history painting, featuring one of the most superb portraits in American art".|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie [...] "Hex" [...] Bendixsen (Series 5–12) {{took over}} the role from Junglist in time for series 5. Bendixsen had also auditioned for ABC3, but won the role on Good Game after {{approaching}} Bajo at Supanova as a fan, and being told Good Game was looking for someone. She sent {{in a series of}} reviews, the style of which she said she already knew how to do having already watched the show for a couple of years. She later did a screen test and ended up getting the job [...] "quite quickly". Her first episode was on 26 October 2009. Hex got into games relatively late as she did not have a gaming household. Her first games were MUDs – specifically the game Lensmoor which she started playing at age 15), and enjoyed as it was like [...] "collectively writing a book". Hex says she is okay with the harder parts of production as they are a part of her job. She said she finds great satisfaction in seeing a completed show go to air as so much time and love has gone into it. Hex states that, [...] "The only thing that's sometimes difficult <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> less time to play the games that I want to play recreationally, because the games I'm reviewing for work take priority." [...] While she is happy to weigh in on gender-related issues, she also acknowledges that she {{does not want to be}} a [...] "poster girl" [...] for it and instead wants to be thought of as [...] "a PERSON who just enjoys gaming".|$|E
