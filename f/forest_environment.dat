500|$|Steven Hansen at Destructoid {{welcomed the}} choice-based dialog tree gameplay, {{going on to}} praise the dialog itself, {{as well as the}} voice performances. The game's most {{impressive}} achievement, as stated by Hansen, was the [...] "thematic cohesion", which was said to revolve around self-imposed isolation. The sound design was lauded to have evoked a Hitchcockian sense of fear. Reviewing Firewatch, Game Informer's Jeff Cork wrote, [...] "I was immediately drawn into the game's world, partly because of the power of its simple text intro, and also because of the novelty of taking part in something so mundane". Cork observed that its interactive dialog, though simple, [...] "breathes life into the game" [...] and called the conversations [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "engaging". He enjoyed exploring the <b>forest</b> <b>environment,</b> yet felt the ending was unsatisfactory in light of the story's achievements.|$|E
500|$|After {{the train}} leaves the station, it turns180-degrees right and exits the mountain, leading into a [...] chain lift hill. Once at the top, the train enters a shallow, {{right-hand}} drop and {{runs along the}} side of the mountain. It makes a banked right turn back into the mountain, then a tarpaulin drops, blocking the entrance to prevent light from entering. The train slows and the cars rotate 90 degrees to face the screens. Stansein tells riders to prepare to battle the enemies. The first scene takes place in <b>forest</b> <b>environment</b> where riders fight Sneaky Spiders and Beasty Bats. At the end of the first scene, riders who began the ride facing forward see Stansein's first appearance, in which he points in the direction riders should go next. Backward-facing riders do not see this transition. In the next scene, riders—who are surrounded by a lake inside the mountain—battle Wet Ones and Crazy Crabs. The scene starts above the surface of the water but later moves downwards. As the scene ends, the train passes two waterfalls; this transition is absent for backward-facing riders.|$|E

40|$|From January 2010 to December 2011, a {{total of}} 138 cases of ticks feeding on humans were {{reported}} from 11 locations in central Panama. Five of these locations were situated in <b>forest</b> <b>environments,</b> three in rural landscapes and three in urban areas. The ticks were submitted to the Gorgas Memorial Institute, where nine species were identified among 65 specimens: Amblyomma cajennense s. l., A. dissimile, A. naponense, A. oblongoguttatum, A. ovale, A. sabanerae, A. tapirellum, Haemaphysalis juxtakochi and Rhipicephalus sanguineus s. l. The remaining 73 specimens consisted of unidentified immature ticks, all belonging to the genus of Amblyomma. Rhipicephalus sanguineus s. l. was the species most frequently associated with humans, particularly in urban environments. In rural landscapes, tick bites were most often caused by A. cajennense s. l., whereas A. tapirellum was the species most often found parasitizing humans in <b>forest</b> <b>environments.</b> These data provide information on the tick species most commonly associated with humans in <b>forested</b> <b>environments,</b> rural areas and cities around the Panama Canal...|$|R
2500|$|The Negritos {{are among}} the least-known of all living human groups, and their origin is much debated. The Malay name for them is orang asli, or [...] "original people". They are most likely {{descendants}} of the indigenous populations of the Sunda landmass and New Guinea, predating the Mongoloid and Australoid peoples who later entered Southeast Asia. Alternatively, some scientists claim they are a group of Australo-Melanesians who have undergone island dwarfing over thousands of years, reducing their food intake in order to cope with limited resources and adapting to a tropical rain <b>forest</b> <b>environment.</b> Regardless {{of the theory of}} origin, geographically speaking, they probably came to Thailand via the lower portion of the Malay Peninsula, through present-day Malaysia.|$|E
2500|$|The Northern {{boundary}} of the Southern Range is Old Packhouse Road and its Southern the {{boundary of}} a commercial orchard. [...] This range is the least visited and most ecologically precarious of the three with only a single trail leading into this area—the Trexler boarder trail. [...] At one time, large parts of this range were in production as an apple orchard. [...] Stands of old apple trees interspersed with autumn-olive dot this landscape. [...] At the far south of the park is a large glade of Eastern Hemlock and other conifers which provides a distinctly different <b>forest</b> <b>environment</b> from elsewhere in the preserve.

2500|$|In 1915, the Babcock Lumber Company began {{a massive}} logging {{operation}} in the northern Unicoi Mountains. [...] The company logged {{nearly two-thirds of the}} Slickrock Creek watershed until 1922, when the construction of Calderwood Dam along the Little Tennessee River threatened to flood the railroad tracks leading into the area and forcing an end to the company's logging operations in what is now the Joyce-Kilmer Slickrock Wilderness. [...] That same year, however, Babcock began logging the Citico Creek watershed on the Tennessee side of the mountains. [...] This operation continued until 1925, when a massive forest fire destroyed the company's logging tramways and wiped out nearly half the forest. [...] The company continued low-scale logging in the Doublecamp area until 1929. [...] The logging practices of Babcock and other logging companies proved extremely detrimental to the <b>forest</b> <b>environment</b> of the Unicoi Mountains, and the U.S. Forest Service began buying up the land in the 1930s. [...] The forest service's policy of letting natural processes heal the forest has allowed the forest to recover to a great extent.|$|E
2500|$|Ants, in general, are {{excellent}} organisms to study differences in thermal ecology {{for a number}} of reasons: they are ectothermic, can be collected easily, their environmental temperatures can be manipulated, and they can be held in captivity for extended periods of time. Eciton burchellii colonies have been found to inhabit areas with no direct sunlight, regulate their bivouac's temperature and airflow, and prefer the closed-canopy <b>forest</b> <b>environment</b> over a fragmented one. Temperature {{has been found to be}} the largest contributing factor to whether or not a swarm will cross into the open from a forest edge. When the ants meet an excessively hot patch, they will accelerate their movement, [...] "shuttling" [...] to minimize their exposure to the heat. If the temperature is too hot (>43 degrees Celsius), the ants will abandon that path and look for a new, cooler one. If need be, the ants retreat to the cool, humid bare soil or huddle beneath stones and logs in order to recover from the endurance of high temperatures. This [...] "cooling off" [...] behavior has been observed to last upwards of 30 minutes in some colonies.|$|E
