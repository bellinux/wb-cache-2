2500|$|A common {{guideline}} called [...] "alternation" [...] {{observes that}} in a five-wave pattern, waves 2 and 4 often take alternate forms; a simple sharp move <b>in</b> <b>wave</b> 2, for example, suggests a complex mild move <b>in</b> <b>wave</b> 4. [...] Corrective <b>wave</b> patterns unfold <b>in</b> forms known as zigzags, flats, or triangles. In turn these corrective patterns can come together to form more complex corrections. Similarly, a triangular corrective pattern is formed usually <b>in</b> <b>wave</b> 4, but very rarely <b>in</b> <b>wave</b> 2, and is the indication {{of the end of}} a correction.|$|R

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving <b>in</b> <b>waves.</b> There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E

The division would be opposed primarily by the German 3rd Guards Infantry Division, along with elements of the 3rd Reserve Division and 111th Division, dug-in among trench lines and 280 concrete pillboxes and bunkers. To secure these various objectives, the division planned to attack <b>in</b> <b>waves,</b> with fresh troops constantly moving forward to tackle the next objective.|$|E

The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E

New trenches were dug and {{the division}} made practice attacks on them using novel tactics: attacking <b>in</b> <b>waves</b> in conjunction with artillery and machine gun fire. Towards {{the end of the}} month, the division moved further south to the Somme valley. They then joined II Corps and were placed in reserve. The role of the division was as a second wave to exploit the expected success. After the breach of the German lines, the Reserve Army cavalry divisions would capture Bapaume. The 38th (Welsh) Division would then move forward to relieve the cavalry and secure the town, to allow the cavalry to advance north towards Arras.|$|E

Games which do not pit the player against antagonists instead feature elaborate challenges constructed mainly from inanimate objects, testing the player's speed and accuracy. More conventional games may feature these types of challenges as minigames.|$|E
5|$|Players build a {{space station}} on a flat plane using tetromino-shaped floors that {{represent}} rooms. Rectangular workers generate the resources to build more spaces by working in these rooms. The workers occasionally must defend the base against attackers, who come <b>in</b> <b>waves</b> of increasing difficulty. The player can have the workers research four TMA-1-style monoliths for additional shield, speed, and generator upgrades. Rooms are used for special purposes: mineral mining (extractors), growing food (gardens), cooking it (kitchens), making workers (quarters), and creating power (reactors). The goal is to flourish and protect the station's inhabitants, but there are three concrete objectives: research all four monoliths, survive 28 waves, and research all monoliths in under 45 minutes. The game ends if all workers are killed. There is a tutorial, but no story. The player is not specifically told about the endgame goals.|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates a novel robust path {{following}} controller for marine surface vessels <b>in</b> <b>wave</b> fields. Due to complex wave structure interactions, most {{path following}} control designs neglect the wave impact at the design stage, {{and rely on}} simulation or experiment to assure the satisfactory performance <b>in</b> <b>wave</b> fields. <b>In</b> this paper, we first introduce a numerical test-bed that combines the ship dynamics and wave effects on vessels to facilitate the model-base performance evaluation of path following control systems <b>in</b> <b>wave</b> fields. Then, a novel robust path following controller is described and its key features are summarized. Simulation results of the path following controller <b>in</b> the <b>wave</b> field are presented. Several issues, such as steady state errors and rudder oscillations, have been identified, thereby motivating controller modification and gain re-tuning. Mitigating strategies for improving the controller performance are proposed and numerically evaluated. The simulation {{results show that the}} performance of the modified controller can be substantially improved <b>in</b> <b>wave</b> fields...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies investigating “study addiction” have conceptualized it as a behavioral addiction, defined {{within the framework}} of work addiction. This study is the first attempt to examine the longitudinal relationship between study addiction and work addiction. Methods: The Bergen Study Addiction Scale (BStAS), the Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS), and the Ten-Item Personality Inventory were administered online together with questions concerning demographics and study-related variables <b>in</b> two <b>waves.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Wave</b> 1, a total of 2, 559 students in Norway and 2, 177 students in Poland participated. A year later, <b>in</b> <b>Wave</b> 2, 379 Norwegians and 401 Polish who began to work professionally completed the survey. Results: The intraclass correlation between BStAS and BWAS revealed that the scores were somewhat related; however, the relationship was slightly weaker than the temporal stability of both constructs. In the Norwegian sample, scoring higher on neuroticism and lower on learning time outside educational classes <b>in</b> <b>Wave</b> 1 was positively related to work addiction <b>in</b> <b>Wave</b> 2, whereas gender was unrelated to work addiction <b>in</b> <b>Wave</b> 2 when controlling for other studied variables in either samples. Conclusion: Study addiction and work addiction appear to be closely related suggesting that the former may be a precursor for (or an early form of) the latter...|$|R

5|$|Fighting paused. Mortier and Gazan {{waited for}} Dupont's arrival while Kutuzov and Miloradovich waited for Strik's and Dokhturov's. Schmitt's column was {{expected}} to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance. The timing of the respite12:00 or 14:00varies, depending on whose reports are consulted. Strik arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan's line with three battalions, pushing the French out of Dürenstein. Caught between two strong forces, Gazan attempted to push his way back through Dürenstein, to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops. Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear, Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik's Russians appeared to block their retreat. The narrow defiles hampered the Russians; Strik's men had to march out of the canyons, form ranks and attack <b>in</b> <b>waves.</b> Despite Strik's continuous assault in the next two to three hours, Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up the narrow fissure in the hillside. At this point, Dokhturov's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle. The French were outnumbered more than three to one, assaulted in the front by Miloradovich's column, in the middle by Strik's and in the rear by Dokhturov.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 2013, Rovio teased on its Facebook {{page that}} Red, the main protagonist of the game, would receive an ability {{in a new}} episode. On June 26, Rovio {{released}} a YouTube video, uncovering three new facts: the episode would be called Red's Mighty Feathers, the update would come in July, and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design. On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new gameplay. Instead of knocking over the pigs' castles, the player's goal {{is to keep the}} pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it. The pigs arrive <b>in</b> <b>waves</b> of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new ability is to target the nearest pig. There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try. The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen. The second is to pop all the pigs in the level. The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level. Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style. On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.|$|E
