6000|$|Clerk. Mr. No-Truth, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{the face}} to plead not guilty, when you were so manifestly the doer of all this wickedness? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great heavens, man!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "That's my idea exactly. In fact, {{those are}} my very phrases. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> guessed it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The worst!" [...] exclaimed the girl. [...] "What {{could be}} worse than that which you already have divulged? Oh, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{permitted}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If the old Coll. weren't {{a little}} above {{themselves}} already, we'd chair {{you down the}} corridor," [...] said the Engineer. [...] "Oh, Bates, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> might <b>have</b> caught it yourself, and where would we have been, then?" ...|$|R
60|$|CURTIS--[Despairingly.] Martha, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>have</b> {{allowed this}} to happen? Oh, I suppose I'm talking foolishness. It wasn't your seeking, I know.|$|R
6000|$|Ethel (looking up at Gerard's {{picture of}} the Countess de Florac). What odd dresses you wore {{in the time of}} the Empire, Madame de Florac! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>have</b> such high waists, and such {{wonderful}} fraises! (MADAME DE FLORAC kisses ETHEL. Tableau.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] said Jem resolutely, [...] "this thing must {{be cleared}} up. SOMEBODY {{has made a}} mistake. Sunday WAS fine, Faith. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> thought Saturday was Sunday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know but}} what it would,' sobbed Miss Squeers. 'Oh! 'Tilda, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> acted so mean and dishonourable! I wouldn't have {{believed}} it of you, if anybody had told me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad Margaret {{did not see}} me like this," [...] he said, with {{an attempt}} at a smile, [...] "bearded too, and what a beard! Lady, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> nursed one so hideous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But why,' {{said the}} young man, 'why run {{the chance of}} that {{occurring}} which so nearly happened? If Rose had--I cannot utter that word now--if this illness <b>had</b> terminated differently, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>have</b> forgiven yourself! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I ever have know happiness again!' ...|$|R
500|$|Shand: <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> really <b>have</b> {{thought that}} he had behaved in a manner {{befitting}} worthy representatives of Australia and {{on and off the field}} his conduct was exemplary if you thought his conduct was so serious as to warrant his omission from the team? How do you reconcile those two? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hans," [...] added Ragnall, to whom I had {{translated}} {{as much of}} this as he did not understand, [...] "it is {{too early in the}} day to tell good stories. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> possibly <b>have</b> killed that serpent without a gun--for you took none with you--or with it either for that matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{suppose there}} wasn't! Suppose {{there had been}} no one else alive on the earth except you, and I, and he, and Constance, and Su--and Constance! <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> offered him such a job?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Violet! You have ruined our happiness. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{the heart}} to do it! It is not for myself I speak, God knows. But {{to think of her}} {{feelings}} being so abused, her confidence so shaken--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{could you}} leave me so, Jinny? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the heart to do it? I thought you were dead. I mourned for your death--ay, and you have made me mourn for you living. You have {{withered}} my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew," [...] she continued, [...] "I {{have known}} {{ever since that}} autumn morning when I went to you as you saddled--when I dreaded that you would leave us. Father asked you to marry me, the day you took Mr. Stewart from the mob. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> so <b>have</b> {{misunderstood}} me, Richard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Urmston grew impatient. [...] "Pshaw!" [...] he said hoarsely, [...] "one goes past conventions. You {{never loved}} {{him in the}} least. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you?</b> It would <b>have</b> been preposterous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir, I cannot see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done otherwise," [...] said Aurelia, {{who could}} not bear to hear his tone of self-reproach.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{wondering}} vaguely, Philip," [...] she said, {{when he had}} told the story, [...] "how it was {{that you should have}} appeared so suddenly, and should have a disguise in readiness for me. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> guessed that I should be ready to go with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cheyne's voice {{seemed a}} trifle strained, {{as though the}} music had troubled him. [...] "I know the march, but the {{composer}} never wrote what you have played to-night," [...] he said. [...] "It was--may mine be defended from it!--the shuffle of beaten men. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> felt what you put into the music?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{fell back}} in her chair. [...] "In New York?" [...] She leaned forward over the table toward him, {{as if to make}} sure that she heard aright, and said, with all the keen reproach that he could have expected: [...] "In New York, Basil! Oh, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> let me go on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is princely!" [...] Peter Ruff declared. [...] "I cannot imagine, Monsieur, <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{believed}} me capable of filling such a position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}}," [...] said Miss Rose, as {{she wiped}} a tear-dimmed eye--"I can't understand <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> thought I {{should be so}} stupid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> helped coming," [...] said Miss Hernshaw, [...] "when {{you thought}} I might write to Mr. St. John at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|VERA. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> known it? It is {{too well}} laid a plot for that. This great White Czar, whose hands are red {{with the blood}} of the people he has murdered, whose soul is black with his iniquity, is the cleverest {{conspirator}} of us all. Oh, how could Russia bear two hearts like yours and his! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gracious Providence! And Andries {{has kept}} me in ignorance of all this; he knew my purse {{would have been}} his, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been in want {{in the midst of}} the {{abundance}} that reigns in this settlement, which is only fifteen or twenty miles from your hut, as I know from the chainbearer's letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shouldn't wish to {{remember}} them; I'm afraid, Bertram, there's a melancholy strain in you, and I don't mean {{to let you}} indulge in it. Besides, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> had bad hours? You have been made much of and given everything you could wish for since you were a boy. Indeed, I sometimes wonder how you escaped from being spoiled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Austen!" [...] she cried, [...] "I do not--I--do not! They {{would be}} hateful to me--without you. I would rather live with you--at Jabe Jenney's," [...] {{and her voice}} caught in an {{exquisite}} note between laughter and tears. [...] "I love you, do you understand, <b>you!</b> Oh, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>have</b> doubted it? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you?</b> What you believe, I believe. And, Austen, I have been so unhappy for three days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; she {{was very}} anxious to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> come home again. She missed you very much, and she <b>could</b> not {{understand}} <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> the heart to leave her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could he <b>have</b> taken <b>you</b> out hunting unless <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been here? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> he and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{known each}} other at all unless I had been kind to you? Now you will understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You {{do not yet}} {{appreciate}} how grave it was,’ he replied. ‘It was necessary for you that your cousin should go, and go at once. You yourself had to leave to-night under cover of darkness, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done that with the Viscount in the next room? He must go, then; he must leave without delay. And that was the difficulty.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{only wish}} {{is to leave}} your house," [...] cried Kate, with an angry flash in her deep blue eyes. [...] "You are a cruel, wicked, hypocritical old man. You have deceived me about Mr. Dimsdale. I read it in your son's face, and now I read it in your own. How could you do it--oh, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the heart?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{do not yet}} {{appreciate}} how grave it was," [...] he replied. [...] "It was necessary for you that your cousin should go, and go at once. You yourself had to leave to-night under cover of darkness, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done that with the Viscount in the next room? He must go, then; he must leave without delay. And that was the difficulty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> MUST <b>have</b> known it!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I am like my father--witless {{in matters}} of the heart, and of a poor way with women; yet the jewels that strew these royal garden paths--the trees, the flowers, the sward--all must have read the love that has filled my heart since first my eyes were made new by imaging your perfect face and form; so <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> alone <b>have</b> been blind to it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I never figured <b>you</b> <b>had</b> that many, and I don't quite see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{let them}} get away from you here. Something <b>you</b> didn't expect <b>has</b> happened?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought we}} had talked all that out long ago," [...] I answered, a little wearily. [...] "You {{would have been very}} foolish if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> acted differently. I don't see <b>how</b> else <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> acted." ...|$|R
