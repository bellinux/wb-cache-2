5|$|In June 2007, Blair {{resigned}} {{as the leader}} of the Labour Party and Gordon Brown, previously the Chancellor of the Exchequer, succeeded him following the 2007 Labour Party conference. Three years earlier, Blair had announced that he would not be contesting a fourth successive general election as Labour Party leader if he won the 2005 general election. Brown initially had strong public support and plans for a quick general election were widely publicised, though never officially announced. On 18th February 2008, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the <b>failing</b> <b>bank,</b> Northern Rock, would be nationalised, supporting it with loans and guarantees of £50,000,000,000. The bank had been destabilised by the US subprime mortgage crisis the previous year, and a private buyer of the bank could not be found.|$|E
50|$|The National Credit Corporation was an {{organization}} created in 1931 by the Hoover administration {{to try to}} stop bank failure. The organization attempted to convince large surviving banks to loan money to <b>failing</b> <b>banks</b> as a solution to bank runs. Many large banks however did not think that investing in <b>failing</b> <b>banks</b> would be secure, so most of them did not support the <b>failing</b> <b>banks.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1931 Hoover urged bankers {{to set up}} the National Credit Corporation so {{that big}} <b>banks</b> could help <b>failing</b> <b>banks</b> survive.

2500|$|After a {{round of}} {{mediation}} between Geithner and Bair, the FDIC declared that Wachovia was [...] "systemically important" [...] {{to the health of}} the economy, and thus could not be allowed to fail. [...] It was the first time the FDIC had made such a determination since the passage of a 1991 law allowing the FDIC to handle large bank failures on short notice. Later that night, in an FDIC-brokered deal, Citigroup agreed to buy Wachovia's retail banking operations in an [...] "open bank" [...] transfer of ownership. The transaction would have been facilitated by the FDIC, with the concurrence of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the President. The FDIC's open bank assistance procedures normally require the FDIC to find the cheapest way to rescue a <b>failing</b> <b>bank.</b> However, when a bank is deemed [...] "systemically important," [...] the FDIC is allowed to bypass this requirement. Steel had little choice but to agree, and the decision was announced on the morning of September 29, roughly 45 minutes before the markets opened. [...] From this point on, Citigroup became the source of liquidity allowing Wachovia to continue to operate until the acquisition was complete.|$|E

40|$|Not for {{the first}} time, the global banking crisis {{illustrated}} the vulnerability of banks {{to a loss of}} confidence by their depositors, other creditors and counterparties. The experience highlighted the need to have special arrangements for dealing with <b>failing</b> <b>banks</b> - ‘special resolution regime’ — that provides the authorities with the tools necessary to reduce the systemic risks arising from a bank’s failure {{while at the same time}} limiting the taxpayers’ exposure to the costs. The United Kingdom’s own Special Resolution Regime for dealing with <b>failing</b> <b>banks</b> and building societies was born out of the difficulties in dealing with the failure of Northern Rock in the autumn of 2007. ...|$|R

But bankers were reluctant to invest in <b>failing</b> <b>banks,</b> and the National Credit Corporation did almost nothing to address the problem. In 1932 Hoover reluctantly established the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2 billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions.
