30|$|Equally {{important}} {{are the kind}} of boundaries that individuals have crossed hitherto. Depending on the types of boundaries crossed, it may be hard to argue that two persons with apparently the same objective career success are “really” equally successful. For example, take two women of the same age, each with a similar job as a web designer for a high-end software company and with similar income. Woman  A grew up in an orphanage and after a short jail-term for drug abuse took evening classes at an adult education centre, qualifying her for clerical work during which she detected her interest and gift for web design. This provided the basis for her current job. Woman  B is the daughter of a mother who is a technical engineer with a multinational oil company and a father who is a teacher, has a bachelor's degree in engineering and took additional web-design courses at a renowned private institute. Everything else being equal, intuitively it is difficult to speak of equal success between these cases. Woman  A had to cross a number of boundaries, many of which were hard to cross. In terms of professional background, her formal education was insufficient and she had to convince a potential employer that even outside the boundaries of her certified competencies she was able to do the job. The current job puts her beyond her original social context, especially in light of her track record as a convicted drug abuser. Among other things, she had to cross boundaries linked to stereotypes and prejudices, to type of language used as well as to social networks. The situation is different for Woman  B. She had to cross few professional and social boundaries. <b>Her</b> <b>current</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> perfectly in line with her educational background. Likewise, her social status as a web designer is not inconsistent with her context of origin. Some would argue that this is like comparing apples and oranges. However, this is exactly what happens in part of career research, for example, when comparing individuals by the achieved hierarchical or income level. Unless the study does control for a number of background and historical variables, it is all too often that in a “snapshot-logic” the current situation is evaluated without taking into account the broader circumstances and the historical pattern.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, CEO {{turnover}} in U. S. hospitals has ranged between 14 to 18 % per year. Although top executive turnover has severe implications for any organization, the circumstance {{and impact of}} hospital CEO turnover until now has not been fully investigated. To help understand the background {{and the impact of}} such a change, a nationwide survey of hospital CEOs was conducted in the spring of 2005. Through a national sample, 2, 118 hospital CEOs were requested to complete a survey sponsored by the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE). Of these, after repeated mailings, 805 (38 %) completed the survey. The following is a summary of the findings based on data provided by the respondents. Almost 97 % of the CEOs who responded to this survey held permanent positions; the remaining 3 % were serving as interim CEOs. While the average tenure of a CEO in his or <b>her</b> <b>current</b> <b>position</b> <b>was</b> a little more than 5. 5 years (SD = 5. 9 years) with a median of 43 months, only a very small proportion (3. 4 %) had served at the same institution as a CEO for more than 20 years.

40|$|In {{location}}-based services, it {{is common}} for a user to issue a query based on <b>her</b> <b>current</b> <b>position.</b> An example <b>is</b> the location-dependent range query, where the user’s location {{is at the center of}} the query range. Very often, the query issuer’s location is imprecise due to measurement error, sampling error, or message delay. She may also want to protect her privacy by providing a less precise location. In this paper, we study the efficiency of queries that return probabilistic guarantees for location data with uncertainty. We classify this query into two types, based on whether the data (1) has no uncertainty (e. g., shops and restaurants), or (2) has a controlled degree of uncertainty (e. g., moving vehicles). Based on this classification, we develop three methods to improve the computational and I/O performance. The first method expands the query range based on the query issuer’s uncertainty. The second method exchanges the roles of query and data. The third method exploits the fact that users may only be interested in answers with probabilities higher than some threshold. Experimental simulation over a realistic dataset reveals that our approaches improve the query performance significantly...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is based on}} a project which is currently in progress in conjunction with the Curriculum Development Institute (CDI) and two partner schools. It focuses on the use of information technology (IT) resources to explore and establish learning and teaching strategies for coping with individual differences in primary classrooms. The teachers involved have developed a resource base that supports innovative delivery models for implementation in their classrooms. In preparing these resources a careful selection is made of appropriate IT resources and tools {{that can be used to}} cater for individual learning differences. These resources are designed to run on an online Integrated Learning Environment (ILE) which provides students with the flexibility of working at their own pace at any time from anywhere. The idea is to assist teachers to make use of this tool in an effective way so that they can easily adapt their teaching strategies for specific contexts in order to enhance classroom learning and achieve a beneficial educational outcome. Through continual refinement, the system will then become truly adaptive and sensitive to individual learning differences. The ILE allows teachers to use a variety of teaching strategies, provides a secure basis from which teachers can plan lessons to meet the needs of all students in the class, and, allows teachers to use a wide range of learning resources to provide students with opportunities to develop initiative and independent learning and enable students to enjoy learning through use of IT and be motivated by it.
