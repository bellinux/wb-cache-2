5|$|He {{then set}} about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the {{geometrical}} rate law and assuming an egg-shaped ovoid orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon {{the idea of}} an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to <b>have</b> <b>overlooked.</b> Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus—Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for Astronomia nova, though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, most {{historians and}} economists are {{conditioned}} {{to believe that}} steadily and sharply falling prices must result in depression: hence their amazement at the obvious prosperity and economic growth during this era.

Prices will fall, and the consequences will be not depression or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too), economic growth, and the spread of the increased living standard to all the consumers.|$|E

25|$|Given {{conflicting}} {{evidence of the}} costs and benefits of smoking, controversy remains on what the clinical response to smoking in people with schizophrenia should be. Historically, mental health providers <b>have</b> <b>overlooked</b> smoking in schizophrenia, based on the rationale that patients with serious mental illness already suffer from significant stress and disability and as such should be allowed to engage in smoking as an activity that is pleasurable though destructive. There is also historical precedent of mental health providers, particularly in patient settings, to use cigarettes as a way to manipulate patient behavior, such as rewarding good behavior with cigarettes or withholding cigarettes to encourage medication compliance. However, research showing that eliminating even one risk factor for disease can significantly improve long-term health outcomes has resulted in the dominant view among clinicians opposing smoking.|$|E

500|$|The {{walls of}} the castle are mainly built from ashlar stone, with some red brick used on the south side. The walls are pierced by {{a small number of}} gunloops, {{including}} in the [...] "ears" [...] of the bastion, which would <b>have</b> <b>overlooked</b> the moat. When first built the interior of the castle formed a sequence of buildings around a courtyard, but the southern half of the castle was filled in shortly afterwards to produce a solid gun platform able to support heavy guns. It was later raised again in the 17th century to its current height. The parapet is now covered with turf, with 19th-century rounded corners, and the platform still has the rails on which the four naval guns would have traversed, dating from 1855. A small lodging room, built on the platform {{at the top of the}} stairs, has since been destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The Romans {{built the}} fort on a {{naturally}} defensible sandstone bluff that overlooked a nearby crossing over the River Medlock. The area {{became an important}} junction {{for at least two}} major military roads through this part of the country. One highway ran east to west between the legionary fortresses of Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York) the other ran north to Bremetennacum (Ribchester). In addition, Mamucium may also <b>have</b> <b>overlooked</b> a lesser road running north west to Coccium (Wigan). The fort was one of a chain of fortifications along the Eboracum to Deva Victrix road, with Castleshaw Roman fort lying [...] to the east, and Condate (Northwich) [...] to the west. Stamps on tegulae indicate that Mamucium had administrative links not only with Castleshaw, but also with Ardotalia, the nearest fort (12 miles), Slack and Ebchester; all the forts probably got the tegulae from the same place in Grimescar Wood near Huddersfield.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1797. It was later {{reduced to a}} variety of Lycoperdon gemmatum (as L.gemmatum var. echinatum; L.gemmatum is now known as Lycoperdon perlatum) by Elias Magnus Fries, but American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, who extensively studied the North American distribution of the genus, raised it again to species level in 1879. He thought it worthy of status as a species distinct from L.gemmatum because of the different character of its warts, its much spinier appearance, and the smoother surface of the peridium underneath the spines. Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome wrote of the fungus in 1871, but believed their specimen, collected from Reading, Berkshire, by Hoyle, represented a new species, which they called Lycoperdon Hoylei. They wrote that their specimen agreed [...] "exactly with an authentic specimen of Persoon's L.echinatum externally, who could, however, scarcely <b>have</b> <b>overlooked</b> the lilac spores." [...] Despite the apparent difference in spore color, L.Hoylei is currently considered synonymous with L.echinatum. Utraria echinata, named by Lucien Quélet in 1873, is another synonym for L.echinatum.|$|E

500|$|Taft was {{convinced}} {{he would be}} vindicated by history. After he left office, he {{was estimated to be}} about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict. Coletta noted that this places Taft in good company, with James Madison, John Quincy Adams and McKinley. Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft, and argued that historians <b>have</b> <b>overlooked</b> them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker. According to Gould, [...] "the clichés about Taft's weight, his maladroitness in the White House, and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth, but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene, a man of consummate ambition, and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party." [...] Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice [...] "an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics, played out over years, the likes of which we are not likely to see again in American history".|$|E
500|$|Wood (2006) has {{maintained}} that Adams' political philosophy had become irrelevant {{by the time}} the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by {{more than a decade of}} vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of popular sovereignty was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to <b>have</b> <b>overlooked</b> this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics. Yet Wood ignored Adams' peculiar definition of the term [...] "republic," [...] and his support for a constitution ratified by the people. He also underestimated Adams' belief in checks and balances, such as Adams' statement that, [...] "Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest." [...] This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's famous statement that, [...] "mbition must be made to counteract ambition", in The Federalist No. 51, explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution. Adams was unsurpassed in his dedication to establishing checks and balances as a governing strategem.|$|E

So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She pours 'the right proportion' in, too." ...|$|E
