40|$|Using {{quantum dot}} {{fluorescence}} imaging, we investigated the interference of surface plasmon beams in branched silver nanowire structures. Depending on the phases and polarizations of the <b>incident</b> light, <b>interferences</b> of plasmon beams modulate the plasmon propagation in the branched structures and the output light intensity in the distal ends. The interference visibility is strongly {{dependent on the}} incident polarization at the main wire terminal, and the mechanism is revealed by quantum dot fluorescence imaging of the near field distribution of propagating plasmons. The near field distribution pattern resulting from the beating of different plasmon modes plays a critical role in the plasmon interference. The overlap of the antinode in the near field pattern with the connection junction in the nanowire structure is required for a large interference visibility, since the overlap makes the electric field intensity difference of the two plasmon beams smaller.

40|$|International audiencePeriodic {{self-organization}} {{of matter}} beyond the diffraction limit is a puzzling phenomenon, typicalboth for surface and bulk ultrashort laser processing. Here we compare {{the mechanisms of}} periodicnanostructure formation {{on the surface and}} in the bulk of fused silica. We show that volumenanogratings and surface nanoripples having subwavelength periodicity and oriented perpendicularto the laser polarization share the same electromagnetic origin. The nanostructure orientation isdefined by the near-field local enhancement {{in the vicinity of the}} inhomogeneous scattering centers. The periodicity is attributed to the coherent superposition of the waves scattered at inhomogeneities. Numerical calculations also support the multipulse accumulation nature of nanogratings formationon the surface and inside fused silica. Laser surface processing by multiple laser pulses promotes thetransition from the high spatial frequency perpendicularly oriented nanoripples to the low spatialfrequency ripples, parallel or perpendicular to the laser polarization. The latter structures also share theelectromagnetic origin, but are related to the <b>incident</b> field <b>interference</b> with the scattered far-field ofrough non-metallic or transiently metallic surfaces.

Rules for their interpretation, such as measurement of their intensity, and energy, thus need to be stated. We address this task here.

The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are rights to land known as servitudes, such as the right to light through windows or the right of support. An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming they are aware of the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust, which established that in such situations [...] "the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances".

30|$|Given the {{detailed}} description of the ULIP technique, the expected performance of a system employing this mechanism can be explored. There are multiple analysis techniques that deal with such problems, more specifically with system capacity analysis. In [29 – 31], a reverse link capacity analysis assuming non-cooperative BSs (similar to the design of practical cellular systems) is unfortunately shown to be a long-standing open problem in information theory, but has been solved when treating the interference as Gaussian noise [32]. Clearly, since in ULIP the <b>interference</b> <b>incident</b> on each RB is dependent on the interference tolerances of other-cell high-priority MSs allocated that RB, the interference is most certainly not Gaussian. Hence, such an analysis is infeasible for a system employing ULIP. In [29, 33], the area spectral efficiency is introduced as a capacity measure that utilises stochastic geometry (statistical analysis of the positions and gains of MSs in the system) to estimate the expected capacity of a cellular network. Because in ULIP the users in a cell are split into three interdependent groups, such an analysis would be difficult as it is not always clear (by position) which MSs are assigned high-, mid-, or low-priority. Furthermore, in [33] the interference is estimated stochastically, and since in ULIP the interference is dependent on individual MS requirements, this analysis would be misguided.|$|R

Since the invading waves are treated as periodic ones in this work, a straightforward application of the theory to the evaluation of the effective mesh length for the leading part of tsunamis might be a little dubious (for the later phase, the present results are applicable). But when a dimension of the irregular part of the bottom (a simple hump) is small as compared with a wave-length of the <b>incident</b> waves, an <b>interference</b> effect produced by a coupling of the progressive and retrogressive waves is likely to be also small, so that the application {{of the results of the}} periodic waves might be still possible to the leading part of tsunamis dismissing the tip of the leading waves in which no interference effect taking place in the case of periodic waves is expected.

40|$|Recently, the {{coupling}} {{of two different}} modes of a homogeneous plasmonic particle and their sharply varying spectra were elucidated as Fano resonances; an 'interference' of two spatially orthogonal modes driving each other. On the other hand, the scattering (and extinction) cross-section of a non-absorbing dielectric particle is always {{the sum of the}} cross-sections of all mode numbers; and this rules out any such Fano type interference between two different mode numbers. So delectric particles exhibit an interference structure in their extinction spectra only if it manifests in the individual modes describing the scattered field of the particle. We show that in a all-dielectric core-shell particle such strong interferences in multiple mode numbers can be attained, and notably even as a spectral region of transparency and directional scattering of <b>incident</b> light. Here <b>interference</b> between the complementary normal modes of the nanoshell and core regions can be realized for each mode number, resulting in a sharp interference structure in the extinction of the particle. This manifests as spectral regions of minimal/maximal interaction with the incident electromagnetic field. Such spectral properties are significant for many applications where the non-radiative losses of plasmonic structures are a liability. Note that this behaviour is useful for optical antennas, cloaking materials and a quantum mechanical interpretation of this classical effect may be signicant for single-photon based applications...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate documented initial regional medical responses to major incidents by applying a set of 11 measurable performance indicators for regional medical command and control and test the feasibility of the indicators. Methods Retrospective data were collected from documentation from regional medical command and control at major incidents that occurred in two Swedish County Councils. Each incident was assigned to one of nine different categories and 11 measurable performance indicators for initial regional medical command and control were systematically applied. Two-way analysis of variance with one observation per cell was used for statistical analysis and the post hoc Tukey test was used for pairwise comparisons. Results The set of indicators for regional medical command and control could be applied in 102 of the 130 major incidents (78 %), but 36 incidents had to be excluded due to incomplete documentation. The indicators were not applicable as a set for 28 incidents (21. 5 %) due to different characteristics and time frames. Based on the indicators studied in 66 major incidents, the results demonstrate that the regional medical management performed according to the standard in the early phases (1 – 10 min after alert), but there were weaknesses in the secondary phase (10 – 30 min after alert). The significantly lowest scores were found for Indicator 8 (formulate general guidelines for response) and Indicator 10 (decide whether or not resources in own organization are adequate). Conclusions Measurable performance indicators for regional medical command and control can be applied to incidents that directly or indirectly involve casualties provided there is sufficient documentation available.
