The article presents some perspectives on gifts (etymological, mythological, psychological, psychotherapeutically, sociological) and a research upon parents preferences and criteria for choosing Easter gifts. Lot survey included 85 parents with preschool children of whom 62 subjects (72. 9 %) were female; the remaining 23 subjects (27. 1 %) were male. This research was a questionnaire-based survey with a questionnaire (realised especially for this occasion) that includes three dimensions: availability of parents to give gifts on Easter, components of the gift and <b>indicative</b> <b>criteria</b> for purchase the gift...|$|E

40|$|Nexus thinking, in {{the form}} of {{integrating}} water security with agriculture, energy and climate concerns, is normatively argued to help better transition societies towards greener economies and the wider goal of sustainable development. Yet several issues emerge from the current debate surrounding this concept, namely the extent to which such conceptualisations are genuinely novel, whether they complement (or are replacing) existing environmental governance approaches and how – if deemed normatively desirable – the nexus can be enhanced in national contexts. This paper therefore reviews the burgeoning nexus literature to determine some common <b>indicative</b> <b>criteria</b> before examining its implementation in practice vis-à-vis more established integrated water resources management (IWRM) models. Evidence from two divergent national contexts, the UK and Bangladesh, suggests that the nexus has not usurped IWRM, while integration between water, energy, climate and agricultural policy objectives is generally limited. Scope for greater merging of nexus thinking within IWRM is then discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{approach in}} clinical practice in Rheumatology is mainly {{based on the}} recognition of pain origin. Patient’s experience of pain may be similar in different diseases involving bones, joints, tendons, muscles or peripheral nervous system. The analysis of some characteristics of pain may be helpful in the diagnostic approach. In this perspective pain must be analyzed according to the type, localization, occurrence, elicitation and concomitant clinical signs. In {{the majority of cases}} this analysis allows a preliminary differential diagnosis which is essential to drive further assessments. The diagnostic approach to arthropaties is based on a group of <b>indicative</b> <b>criteria</b> which include diffusion of the arthropathy, the involved sites, the course of the joint disease, the joint damage, the history of preceding events and the presence of extra-articular features which accompany joint disease.

40|$|Millisecond dips in the RXTE/PCA light {{curve of}} Sco X- 1 were {{reported}} recently (Chang et al. 2006), which were {{interpreted as the}} occultation of X-rays from Sco X- 1 caused by Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNO) of hundred-meter size. Inconclusive signatures of possible instrumental effects {{in many of these}} dip events related to high-energy cosmic rays were later found (Jones et al. 2006) and the TNO interpretation became shaky. Here we report more detailed analysis aiming at distinguishing true occultation events from those related to cosmic rays. Based on some <b>indicative</b> <b>criteria</b> derived from housekeeping data and two-channel spectral information, we suggest that about 10 % of the dips are probable events of occultation. The total number of TNOs of size from 60 m to 100 m is estiamted to be about 10 ^{ 15 } accordingly. Limited by the coarser time resolution of standard data modes of RXTE/PCA, however, definite results cannot be obtained. Adequately configured observations with RXTE or other new instruments in the future are very much desired. Comment: 12 pages (including 14 figures), submitted to MNRA...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Offer an {{alternative}} method to assess operational performance of companies in transport infrastructure {{of a region}} by making a comparison between transaction costs. The method {{is supposed to be}} a cross-functional and possibly applied to an analysis of economic entities of a different order (country, region, sector, companies) while evaluating “viscosity” / complexity of the outside and the inside. Design/methodology/approach: The paper includes an analysis of various methodological approaches to assess a development level of the transport infrastructure in a region. Within the author's approach and for purposed of the research, an index of transaction capacity or the transactionalness index is proposed, which determines a level of transaction costs calculated against the cost of production and revenue. The approach is piloted using the region-wise consolidated financial data of companies involved in the Russian transport infrastructure for 2005 / 2013. Findings: The proposed alternative way to measure corporate operating efficiency has proved its academic consistency. A specific comparison between the transaction costs using the transactionalness index allows first to identify companies or regions/sectors, where there is excess complexity of economical communication in bargaining. Secondly, the index does not only point out indirectly to a degree of development in the institutional environment, but also the infrastructure (the transport one in the example given). Third, the transactionalness level may say of uncertainty and risks. As an addition to theoretical and methodological aspects of transaction costs, the authors justify an approach to their size estimation, as well as their differentiation dividing them into two groups: those of a natural type and a background type. In a course of their discussion, the authors have concluded that there are such transaction costs in place, which are standard in a manner of speaking. Originality/value: There is a discussion whether it is scientifically reasonable to use an index of transactionalness. There are reasons for applicability of the alternative approach to assess operational performance of companies in transport infrastructure as an <b>indicative</b> <b>criterion</b> of favouring external conditions to execute exchange transactions. According to the authors, a high level of transactionalness is associated with a low development level of transport infrastructure in a region. This says that their competitiveness is specifically less. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Immigrants and refugees often have unique and increased mental health needs secondary to their migration to a new country and the acculturative stressors and living difficulties that often accompany resettlement, as well as prior experiences of trauma. However, little to no prior {{research has been conducted}} regarding the mental health of African immigrants and refugees living in Sweden. This thesis describes data from a study which was conducted in Stockholm, Sweden from 2002 to 2005 that investigated African immigrant and refugee health and quality of life. Stratified quota sampling based on the 2001 Swedish census was used to recruit a representative sample of participants by gender and country of origin. Four hundred and twenty participants completed semi-structured interviews that utilized cross culturally validated survey instruments to measure depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acculturation, traumatic events, and post-migration living difficulties. Twenty percent of participants met symptom <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> of depression, and 18. 5 % met <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> of anxiety. Eighty-ninepercent of participants reported experiencing at least one traumatic event prior to immigration,and 47 % met DSM-IV symptomology and functional impairment criteria for PTSD. Mental health outcomes were found to be significantly associated with pre-migration trauma, acculturation level and type, and post-migration stressors.

A typical LS-VFS incorporates a bypass structure that diverts excess stormwater flows, usually to a grassed swale and a concrete channel with a level control weir (level spreader) that evenly distributes flow to a downslope vegetated filter strip designed for stormwater infiltration.

40|$|The altered {{phenotypic}} {{expression and}} chromosomal characteristics of mouse and human malignant keratinocyte {{lines have been}} studied in vitro and in vivo (in comparison with normal primary cultures). The cell lines exhibited different morphologic aspects that are probably more related to their respective degree of differentiation than to different stages in malignancy. Although all cell lines studied were deficient in some aspects of keratinization, certain basic structural and biochemical features were maintained, and these may serve as valid criteria for the identification of their epithelial nature. The altered expression of keratin proteins and morphologic differentiation can be modulated under in vivo growth conditions, but they cannot be reverted toward normality. Chromosomal alterations (in number and structure) occur early and are highly <b>indicative</b> <b>criteria</b> for malignancy, even though no tumor-specific aberrations have been identified. Two new approaches for evaluating characteristics of abnormal growth and differentiation in vitro, and of invasiveness in vivo, have been developed and have proved sensitive test methods for identifying malignant cells, While several abnormalities in growth and differentiation of cell lines in vitro are highly indicative of their malignant nature, the final proof that they are tumor cells still requires in vivo assay.

A large amount of fuel oil was spilled and part of it reached the shore. To evaluate the spatial and temporal impact of this oil spill, a field study, and several laboratory toxicity tests were performed using Mytilus galloprovincialis as biological indicator of environmental contamination and the biomarkers glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as <b>indicative</b> <b>criteria.</b> Fifteen days after the oil spill, mussels collected at stations located near the ship presented higher and lower values of GSTs and AChE activity, respectively. These results, and those obtained in the laboratory toxicity tests, evidence that these biomarkers were sensitive indicators of exposure to this kind of pollution and were able to monitor a spatial impact of the oil spill of at least 10 km, confirming the higher level of contamination near the ship and a contamination gradient along the sampling stations. One year after the accident, such a contamination gradient was no longer evident. This study highlight the potential suitability of a biomarker approach for assessing spatial and temporal impacts of marine pollution accidents, such as fuel oil spills, suggesting the inclusion of these biomarkers in risk assessment studies, as cost-effective and early warning recognized tools. Major advantages and limitations of the biomarker approach used in this study are further discussed. [URL]...|$|E

We only consider M≥ 5 events in hazard calculations.

40|$|Diagnosing spondyloarthritis (SpA) {{early in}} young {{patients}} with inflammatory back pain and normal findings on radiographs of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) remains {{a challenge in}} routine practice. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {{is regarded as the}} most sensitive imaging modality for detecting early SpA before the radiographic appearance of structural lesions. The recently published Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society classification criteria for axial SpA include {{for the first time a}} positive MRI demonstrating sacroiliitis as an imaging <b>criterion</b> <b>indicative</b> of SpA together with at least 1 clinical feature of SpA. A systematic and standardized evaluation of the SIJ in patients with SpA showed that MRI has much greater diagnostic utility than documented previously and allowed a data-driven definition of a positive MRI for SpA. Single MRI lesions suggestive of inflammation can be found in the SIJ and the spine in up to one quarter of healthy controls and young patients with mechanical back pain...|$|R
40|$|Background: Panic {{disorder}} is a heterogeneous disorder, comprising {{a variety of}} somatic, physiological, and cognitive symptoms during repeated panic attacks. As a result, considerable data have examined whether panic attacks may be classified into distinct diagnostic or functional subtypes. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the existing literature regarding the validity of panic attack subtypes. Methods: This review focuses on data published since 2000, with the publication of DSM-IV-TR, augmented by replicated data published since 1980, with the publication of DSM-III and subsequently DSM-IV. Published reports evaluating empirical evidence for the validity of panic attack subtypes are reviewed. Results: Five sets of panic symptoms (respiratory, nocturnal, nonfearful, cognitive, and vestibular) have been shown to cluster together at varying degrees of consistency. However, none of these potential subtypes have been associated with sufficient and reliable external validation <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> of functional differences. This apparent lack of findings may be related to methodological inconsistencies or limitations across the reviewed studies. Conclusions: Although at present the data do not warrant the utility o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Temporary {{immunodeficiency}} {{is often}} associated with various pathological conditions, such as myocardial infarction, severe trauma, or major surgery. However, there are no clinical <b>criterions</b> <b>indicative</b> for presence or absence of such immune deficiency. Meanwhile, clinical signs of infectious complications may be absent because of deficient immune response. A technique for monitoring septic conditions in the patients with open traumas and during postsurgical period has been proposed, employing a flow-cytometric approach. The evaluation principle for septic conditions consists of measuring expression of HLA-DR antigens at the surface of peripheral blood monocytes. As a criterion of patient evaluation in septic state, a relative amount of monocytes expressing HLA-DR may be applied, and the disease prognosis is considered as favorable, if the amounts of positive cells exceed 40 % by day 5 after the patient was admitted to the hospital, and an adequate treatment was carried out. This technique may find wide application for estimation and monitoring of septic conditions in the patients. (Med. Immunol., vol. 10, N 4 - 5, pp 379 - 388). </p...|$|R

Lauterbach's support for an "olenelline"-chelicerate clade is found to include interdependent characters which are reduced here to two testable derived similarities Only one of these may conform to general <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> of homology, such as detailed similarity and topology It is, however, rejected {{on the basis of}} parsimony We emphasize that resolution of the chelicerate-"olenelline"-trilobite three-taxon problem must be based on recognition of homologies among each of these taxa Nectaspida are excluded from Trilobita as defined by cuticle calcification, but as ingroup "Arachnata " (sensu Lauterbach) they are important for determining character generality in this clade...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a need}} {{within the}} {{criminal}} justice systems of many countries to create a valid and applicable system of investigative interviewing and credibility assessment. The present study assesses the general validity one such system, called Assessment <b>Criteria</b> <b>Indicative</b> of Deception (ACID). ACID comprises interviewing strategies that facilitate the detection of deception and content criteria that highlight differences in verbal behavior. Sixty university undergraduates performed a staged theft under time pressure and with incentives designed to increase external validity. The participants were interviewed and assessed using the ACID procedure. Half of them were instructed to answer honestly {{and the other half}} to deny his/her participation in the theft. Results showed that honest statements were longer, more vividly detailed, and more spontaneously structured than deceptive statements. Also, the addition of affective details as a dependent measure significantly improved the ACID system. Overall, 48 of 60 statements were accurately classified (26 of 30 honest statements and 22 of 30 deceptive statements). The ACID procedure was effective and benefited from the addition of affective details. The strengths and weaknesses of this study are discussed in light of basic research into deception and potential forensic application...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that T cell proliferation, although initiated by antigen or lectin, is actually mediated by a lymphocytotrophic hormone designated as interleukin 2 (IL- 2) 1 (1 - 4). As detailed previously (5, 6), the IL- 2 -T cell interaction is effected by means of binding sites on membrane molecules that satisfy the <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> of authentic hormone receptors, i. e., high affinity, saturability, ligand specificity, and target cell specificity. The biologic relevance of IL- 2 -specific receptors is reflected by the coincidence of the IL- 2 binding and proliferative response curves, and further, by {{the finding that the}} rate of the T cell proliferative response is directly dependent on the concentration of IL- 2 available to the cells (4, 6). Moreover, monoclonal antibodies reactive with IL- 2 or the IL- 2 receptor inhibit T cell proliferation by preventing IL- 2 -receptor binding (7, 8). The immunologic importance of the IL- 2 receptor system and the unique nature of this hormone receptor mechanism stem from the finding that IL- 2 receptors must be induced by appropriate immune stimuli (5, 9, I 0). Thus, the immune specificity of T cell cional expansion is guaranteed by th...|$|R

40|$|Lakes are of {{importance}} for their heritage, ecological and aesthetical value. However, lakes are subjected to enormous pressure from industry emissions, sewage, agricultural run-off, hydrological modifications and human induced climate changes. These {{are responsible for the}} six major pressures affecting lakes today: 1) excessive inputs of nutrients leading to eutrophication; 2) hydromorphological modifications; 3) acidification; 4) alien species; 5) hazardous substances; 6) climate changes. Effective management is therefore of critical importance for lake preservation as both heritage asset and also as a resource benefiting for human population and requires a focus on <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> of these pressures. Having a comprehensive suite of criteria at a lake manager¿s disposal will allow the evaluation of the extent of pressure affecting a lake and its influence on the ecosystem¿s structure and functioning. The appropriate unit of management of water quality is at watershed level and it is in this context that criteria relating to pressures in lakes should be incorporated into a decision support system to allow interpretation regarding their influence on the structure and functioning of lake ecosystems. The usefulness of criteria should be reevaluated both in context of their ability to reflect pressure and also their relevance to lake biota. JRC. H. 5 -Rural, water and ecosystem resource...|$|R

40|$|Archival {{paraffin}} embedded {{material was}} used to examine whether additional quantitative criteria would be helpful to discriminate between histologically benign and malignant rat mammary tumours. To this end nuclear DNA content expressed as DNA ploidy index (DI) was measured using flow cytometry (FCM). A total of 63 benign and malignant mammary tumours were investigated. Thirteen out of 38 (34 %) mammary carcinomas were DNA aneuploid against 0 out of 25 benign mammary tumours. Aneuploidy was not significantly increased in tumours showing histological signs of greater malignancy such as cribriform-comedo type or invasive growth. In addition to DI other quantitative <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> for malignancy, such as mitotic count and nuclear morphometric characteristics, were estimated in 24 benign and malignant tubulopapillary tumours, a category where the histological classification may be difficult. It appeared that five out of nine noninvasive tubulopapillary carcinomas and six out of seven invasive carcinomas had abnormal values for either DI, mitotic count or nuclear area or for a combination of these parameters. Each single parameter however was abnormal only in a minority of the malignant tumours. In this respect our data are in accordance with the fact that rat mammary carcinomas are clinically and histologically less malignant than their human counterpart...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} Information Systems (IS) in Queensland {{reflects}} the highly decentralised {{nature of the}} state. Relative to its population, Queensland has {{a large number of}} universities, each of which is engaged in Information Systems teaching and research. The study reveals little evidence of a distinctive Queensland-flavour of Information Systems. Rather, there is a diversity of curriculum approaches and an equally broad range of research foci and approaches to research. Two of the state’s regional universities are notable for the relative strength of their IS presence, in terms of number of IS staff, number of IS students and range of campuses across which IS is taught. The breadth of topics and approaches to IS in Queensland is evidenced by the existence of separate, competing IS groups in two of the largest universities; in each case, one of the IS groups is highly technical in orientation while the other is Business oriented. Across the nine Queensland universities there is wide variability in terms of the administrative location of the Information Systems academic staff in the university structure. The study assesses the state of IS in Queensland universities in relation to <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> of the maturity of a discipline. Measured against these criteria, Information Systems in Queensland universities cannot be considered a mature, distinct academic discipline...|$|R
40|$|The {{interruption}} {{of the manufacturing}} process of agalsidase beta {{has led to a}} worldwide shortage of this drug. In the EU, nearly all patients initially reduced their agalsidase beta dose, and many of these switched to agalsidase alfa (Replagal Shire HGT). The clinical consequences of this period of drug shortage need to be further evaluated. A gradual increase of agalsidase beta supply is now expected. This implies that patients could resume or even commence agalsidase beta treatment. Guidance for prioritization of patients is needed to support equitable distribution of agalsidase beta to EU member states. To achieve this, in absence of level I clinical evidence, a draft consensus proposal was initiated and distributed. No full consensus was achieved, as there is disagreement regarding the indications for switching patients from agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta. Some physicians support the concept that the 1. 0 mg/kg EOW dose of agalsidase beta is more effective than agalsidase alfa at 0. 2 mg/kg EOW, while others believe that at recommended dose, the preparations are equivalent. In light of these difficulties and the uncertainties with respect to supply of agalsidase beta, recommendations were agreed upon by a subgroup of physicians. These current recommendations focus on prioritization of <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> of disease progressio...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} true and invented memories can be distinguished between using the reality monitoring criteria. Two different coding schemes were used to examine the correct classification of reports as truthful or deceptive on the basis of individual reality-monitoring (RM) criteria. Method. Drawing upon the RM framework the present experiment examined transcripts of verbal accounts of eyewitnesses to a staged event or made up details about the incident. The statements were elicited during a face-to-face cognitive interview (CI) and were analysed by coders trained in the identification of <b>criteria</b> <b>indicative</b> of self-experienced and invented accounts (referred to here as Version 1) and a similar coding method (referred to here as Version 2). Results. A distinction was made between 'external memories' (affective, perceptual, and contextual details) and 'internal' memories (cognitive operations). For Version 1, the results indicated a higher number of contextual and external details in the descriptions of experienced events and as is commonly found in the deception literature, truthful accounts were longer. For Version 2, temporal and auditory details were more frequent in true accounts. Contrary to prediction, there were also more references to cognitive operations in true accounts. Conclusions. Any forensic application of RM should consider how external factors (characteristics of the event, motivation to deceive, and questioning style) influence the presence of RM criteria. © 2010 The British Psychological Society...|$|R
