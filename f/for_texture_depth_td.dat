40|$|ABSTRACT: Texture is {{a surface}} {{characteristic}} {{which has a}} very wide influence on pavements functional quality. It is currently assessed {{by a number of}} test methods. Road Administrations face the problems of dealing with data acquired by different methods and, in addition to that, the repeatability and reproducibility of the results. This paper presents an analysis of test methods used <b>for</b> <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> evaluation in Portugal: the volumetric patch method and two methods based on surface profiles. Hence, three roads with low (dense asphalt), medium (“open texture asphalt”) and high (porous asphalt) <b>texture</b> <b>depths</b> were selected, where five profilometers made five runs. Two subsections of 150 m length were also selected to carry out the volumetric patch test. The texture indicators analysed were: the mean <b>texture</b> <b>depth,</b> the mean profile depth and the sensor measured <b>texture</b> <b>depth.</b> The average and the standard deviation were the statistical parameters used for the analysis. The results obtained for each method are significantly different and a good correlation between the mean profile depth and the sensor measured <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> was established...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{encoding}} of both <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of mul-tiview images, {{captured by}} a set of spatially correlated cameras, is important for any 3 -D visual communication system based on depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation among <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of multiview images. More specifically, suppose we are given a coding tool to encode <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps at the encoder and a view-synthesis tool to construct intermediate views at the decoder using neighboring encoded <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps. Our goal is to determine how to best select captured views for encoding and distribute available bits among <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of se-lected coded views, such that the visual distortion of desired con-structed views is minimized. First, in order to obtain at the encoder a low complexity estimate of the visual quality {{of a large number of}} desired synthesized views, we derive a cubic distortion model based on basic DIBR properties, whose parameters are obtained using only a small number of viewpoint samples. Then, we demon-strate that the optimal selection of coded views and quantization levels <b>for</b> corresponding <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps is equivalent to the shortest path in a specially constructed 3 -D trellis. Finally, we show that, using the assumptions of monotonicity in the predictor’s quantization level and distance, suboptimal solutions can be ef-ficiently pruned from the feasible space during solution search. Experiments show that our proposed efficient selection of coded views and quantization levels <b>for</b> corresponding <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps outperforms an alternative scheme using constant quanti-zation levels for all maps (commonly used in video standard im-plementations) by up to 1. 5 dB. Moreover, the complexity of our scheme can be reduced by at least 80 % over the full solution search. Index Terms — Bit allocation, depth-image-based rendering, 3 -D image coding...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{bit allocation}} algorithm {{based on a}} novel view synthesis distortion model is proposed for the rate-distortion optimized coding of multiview video plus depth sequences in this paper. We decompose an input frame into nonedge blocks and edge blocks. For each nonedge block, we linearly approximate its texture and disparity values, and derive a view synthesis distortion model, which quantifies the impacts of the <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> distortions on the qualities of synthesized virtual views. On the other hand, for each edge block, we use its texture and disparity gradients for the distortion model. In addition, we formulate a bit-rate allocation problem {{in terms of the}} quantization parameters <b>for</b> <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> data. By solving the problem, we can optimally divide a limited bit budget between the <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> data, in order to maximize the qualities of synthesized virtual views, {{as well as those of}} encoded real views. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields the average PSNR gains of 1. 98 and 2. 04 dB in two-view and three-view scenarios, respectively, as compared with a benchmark conventional algorithm. close 0...|$|R

40|$|The {{lifespan}} {{of asphalt}} surfacing materials {{can vary from}} a very short duration, when temporary surfacing is considered, to up to 25 years for permanent surfacings. Throughout their lifespan the surfacings are expected {{to contribute to the}} provision of adequate levels of friction. The purpose of this research is to examine the variation of friction characteristics of road surfacing materials with time. The asphalt industry has undergone considerable change over the past two decades. This has seen the dominance of hot rolled asphalt and bituminous macadams (now asphalt concrete) being replaced by a spectrum of asphalt mixes specifically designed to offer a wider range of enhanced characteristics. Skidding resistance has remained as a priority requirement. Research has highlighted that there are distinct periods during the life of asphalt road surface materials. The existing standards are based on an equilibrium period during which there is seasonal variation with an overall downward trend to a value at which the surface warrants investigation prior to possible resurfacing or some other type of treatment. For some materials, there is an initial period of lower than expected skidding resistance found to last from a number of days, weeks to months and is termed early life. The majority of laboratory studies undertaken in this thesis were designed to reflect either real or hypothetical scenarios that could be encountered on an in-service highway surface. The programme of work considered the development of skid resistance for a range of surfacing materials from initial compaction until they have reached their equilibrium and are failing for different reasons. There were distinct generic relationships and the development of friction properties has different timelines depending on factors such as aggregate type, asphalt type, bitumen type and stressing conditions. The findings of the research will necessitate the revision of current Irish standards that will bring it closer in line with other European countries. This will probably involve the use of smaller stone size mixes and lowering the requirements <b>for</b> <b>texture</b> <b>depth.</b> It is anticipated that the improved understanding of the implications of poor practise will lead to better quality road surfaces in Ireland.

40|$|A 3 D {{video stream}} is {{typically}} {{obtained from a}} set of synchronized cameras, which are simultaneously capturing the same scene (multiview video). This technology enables applications such as free-viewpoint video which allows the viewer to select his preferred viewpoint, or 3 D TV where {{the depth of the}} scene can be perceived using a special display. Because the user-selected view does not always correspond to a camera position, {{it may be necessary to}} synthesize a virtual camera view. To synthesize such a virtual view, we have adopted a depthimage-based rendering technique that employs one depth map for each camera. Consequently, a remote rendering of the 3 D video requires a compression technique <b>for</b> <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> data. This paper presents a predictivecoding algorithm for the compression of depth images across multiple views. The presented algorithm provides (a) an improved coding efficiency for depth images over block-based motion-compensation encoders (H. 264), and (b), a random access to different views for fast rendering. The proposed depth-prediction technique works by synthesizing/computing the depth of 3 D points based on the reference depth image. The attractiveness of the depth-prediction algorithm is that the prediction of depth data avoids an independent transmission of depth for each view, while simplifying the view interpolation by synthesizing depth images for arbitrary view points. We present experimental results for several multiview depth sequences, that result in a quality improvement of up to 1. 8 dB as compared to H. 264 compression...|$|R

The algorithm will either incrementally increase the number of bits <b>for</b> encoding <b>texture</b> or <b>depth</b> maps of already encoded viewpoints, or it will introduce into the scalable representation new <b>texture</b> or <b>depth</b> maps of previously uncoded captured viewpoints. The incremental choice of either refining an existing view or introducing a new one is carried out one layer at a time, such that the associated rate-distortion tradeoff is locally optimized. By employing our novel bit allocation strategy the proposed coder outperforms the state-of-the-art H. 264 /SVC codec as well as the same wavelet-based coder when armed with a simple suboptimal bit allocation with the same rate allocated to each map, in all coding scenarios studied in our experiments.

Multi-class fuzzy sets using S-membership functions were generated <b>for</b> soil <b>texture,</b> soil <b>depth</b> and slope because of correlation or equivalence between farmers' definitions and scientific classifications of such land characteristics. In contrast, binary fuzzy relations, which are also fuzzy sets, were generated for cropping season and soil color because farmers' perceptions of such land characteristics are intrinsically binary. Despite variations in individual farmers' perceptions of land suitability, 12 unique FK rules for classifying land suitability were defined by hierarchical grouping of such different perceptions based on decreasing importance of factors. The FK rules form inference engines in combining fuzzy factor maps using appropriate fuzzy operators to create agricultural land suitability maps. Suitability maps resulting from application of Fuzzy AND and Fuzzy OR operators were found consistent with the FK rules.

The problem becomes even more complicated when the view is extrapolated from a single view, since the hole is large and has no stereo depth cues. Although many techniques have been developed to address this problem, most of them focus only on view interpolation. We propose a space-time joint filling method for color and depth videos in view extrapolation. <b>For</b> proper <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> to be sampled in the following hole filling process, the background of a scene is automatically segmented by the random walker segmentation in conjunction with the hole formation process. Then, the patch candidate selection process is formulated as a labeling problem, which can be solved with random walks. The patch candidates that best describe the hole region are dynamically selected in the space-time domain, and the hole is filled with the optimal patch for ensuring both spatial and temporal coherence.

40|$|Chipseal is {{the most}} common road surface in New Zealand due to its low cost and high {{performance}} monitoring. One of the parameters surveyed is the road <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> which is currently measured by a volumetric technique known as the circular sand patch method, a method that is slow to perform, requires traffic control and depends on operator skill. The objective of our research is to design and build a portable device able to estimate the <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> and evaluate its performance by correlating the results with the depths obtained with the sand patch method. The method chosen falls under the circular texture meters (CTM) category where a surface profile is acquired using a laser displacement sensor mounted on an arm that is rotated around an axis. The mechanical design follows the specifications from current practice established by a number of standards in Australia, USA and Europe. Profile processing is realized on board by a purpose built embedded system the results are available to the operator on an LCD display. Parameters used in estimation of <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> are the standardized mean profile depth (MPD) and three parameters borrowed from surface metrology: average roughness (Ra), average square roughness (Rq) and average maximum height (Rz) which was redefined to allow for shorter CTM profiles. Algorithms were first developed into a Matlab toolbox then ported to the embedded system. The efficiency of the parameters was determined by the extent of how parameters correlate with <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> obtained with the sand patch method characterised by the slope α and the intercept β of the linear relation that result in the best r-square for the parameter. The intercept was derived from mean of the parameters measured over a flat surface.

Secondly, the slope was estimated from tracks acquired from a variety of sites using the correlation method with the intercept being constrained to the value found from the flat surface measurements. The results show that all parameters have an improved r-square when a second order fit is applied to the profile segments. The slopes estimated with the correlation method are in average 67 % percent smaller than the slopes projected with the square meter test. Considering both the coefficient of determination of the correlations and the slope, the circular texture meter returns best estimates from the average maximum height when a second order fit is applied to the profile segments...|$|R

Unlike <b>texture,</b> <b>depth</b> video is a gray scale map that represents {{the distance between the}} camera and 3 D points in a scene. Existing multiview video coding (MVC) techniques including 3 D- High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard encode both <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> videos jointly by exploiting <b>texture</b> video information <b>for</b> the corresponding depth video coding (DVC) to reduce computational time as the <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> videos have motion similarity in representing the same scene. This strategy has two limitations: (i) more bits and computational time might be required due to the large residuals for the misalignment between <b>depth</b> and <b>texture</b> edges and (ii) switching between different views may require more times due to the increased dependency between <b>texture</b> and <b>depth.</b> In this paper, we propose an independent DVC technique using HEVC (a video coding standard for single view) so that we can improve the rate distortion (RD) performance and reduce computational time by improving switching speed. For this, we use motion features to reduce a number of motion estimation (ME) and motion compensation (MC) modes in HEVC.

This phenomenon including adhesive and hysteresis forces influences the contact stresses which are responsible for appropriate interaction between tyre and pavement. Skid resistance of the pavement surface is evaluated by measurements of <b>texture</b> characteristics (<b>depth</b> of <b>texture,</b> morphology) and physical (sliding friction). World Road Association indicates that the friction coefficient decreased on the road below 0. 45 will {{increase the risk of}} accident 20 times; when it goes below 0. 30 the risk is 300 times higher. The macro-texture measuring is realised at present by non-contact profilometers evaluated texture of surface as a mean profile depth – MPD; and by volumetric method evaluated texture by mean <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> – MTD. The micro-texture measuring can be realised by direct methods by using of microscope or another equipment with high resolution. However, these methods are used very rarely, indirect methods by pendulum tester is used more frequently. University of Žilina (UNIZA) uses for skid resistance measuring the own equipment TWO that measures the coefficient of longitudinal friction with 17. 8 % slide. Slovak Road Administration operated 23 long-time observed road sections for analysis of the pavement serviceability parameters. Friction coefficient is measured by Skiddometer BV 11, texture with using one separately laser installed on measurement beam of Profilograph GE. Measuring of texture is along with analysis of surface unevenness.

Statistical analysis was performed to compare the performance of high friction surfaces prepared with different aggregate epoxy combinations. The results show that flint aggregate can be a suitable substitute for the calcined bauxite in HFST. Field measurements also showed marked improvements in <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> with HFST...|$|R

The emulsion used in micro surfacing is CQS- 1 h and added with natural latex as its polymer modifier. This study was carried out to evaluate the performance of micro surfacing applied on expressway. In 2008, a number of preventive maintenance projects in North South Expressway used micro surfacing especially in the northern region. This study involved particular sections of expressways located at km 58. 60 to km 59. 60 south bound and km 84. 60 to km 85. 60 south bound from Bukit Kayu Hitam. The construction was completed on 7 th January 2009. The performance of micro surfacing in this specific expressway sections was monitored for one year. The Portable Pendulum Tester was used to evaluate skid resistance performance while the <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> of micro surfacing was measured using Sand Patch Test. The surface irregularities data was collected using a 3 m rolling straight edge while the rutting measurement was based on 3 m static straight edge. The measurement was carried out after 4, 6, 9 and 12 months period of operations starting from April 2009 to January 2010. The result shows that the skid resistance, <b>texture</b> <b>depth,</b> surface irregularities and rut depth for micro surfacing comply with the specification requirements after one year of operation. The pendulum test value obtained is greater than 46 with a <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> of 0. 50 mm. The average number of surface irregularities is below 4. 0 mm while the rut depth average value is less than 5. 0 m...|$|R

Least-squares regression of DSRM-measured mean profile depth (MPD) on sand patch mean <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> (MTD) was statistically significant (r 2 = 0. 95,...|$|R
40|$|Road surface macro-texture is an {{indicator}} {{used to determine}} the skid resistance levels in pavements. Existing methods of quantifying macro-texture include the sand patch test and the laser profilometer. These methods utilise the 3 D information of the pavement surface to extract the average <b>texture</b> <b>depth.</b> Recently, interest in image processing techniques as a quantifier of macro-texture has arisen, mainly using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This paper reviews the FFT method, and then proposes two new methods, one using the autocorrelation function and the other using wavelets. The methods are tested on pictures obtained from a pavement surface extending more than 2 km's. About 200 images were acquired from the surface at approx. 10 m intervals from a height 80 cm above ground. The results obtained from image analysis methods using the FFT, the autocorrelation function and wavelets are compared with sensor measured <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> (SMTD) data obtained from the same paved surface. The results indicate that coefficients of determination (R 2) exceeding 0. 8 are obtained when up to 10 % of outliers are removed...|$|R
40|$|In 3 D video applications, {{the virtual}} view is {{generally}} rendered by the com-pressed <b>texture</b> and <b>depth.</b> The <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> compression with different bit-rate overheads {{can lead to}} different virtual view rendering qualities. In this paper, we analyze the compression-induced rendering distortion for the virtual view. Based on the 3 D warping principle, we first address how the <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> compression affects the virtual view quality, and then derive an upper bound for the compression-induced rendering distortion. The derived distortion bound depends on the compression-induced <b>depth</b> error and <b>texture</b> intensity error. Simulation results demonstrate that the theoretical upper bound is an approximate indication of the rendering quality {{and can be used}} to guide sequence-level texture/depth rate allocation for 3 D video compression. 1...|$|R
