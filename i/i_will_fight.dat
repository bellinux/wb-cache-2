500|$|For {{the rest}} of the film, Chris Corbould, the special effects and {{miniature}} effects supervisor, returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects. According to Corbould, [...] "CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go". Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami Airport chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.|$|E

500|$|For many of {{the effects}} in the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor Chris Corbould used a more {{realistic}} style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects compared with previous Bond films. Corbould noted that, [...] "CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> to the tooth and nail {{to do something for}} real. It's the best way to go". Corbould used the 007 stage at Pinewood for the sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film, which featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film. Casino Royale featured music composed by David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the Bond film series. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 that Chris Cornell would perform the title song, entitled [...] "You Know My Name", which he co-wrote with Arnold.|$|E
500|$|By February 1938 Reich's visa had expired. Several Norwegian {{scientists}} {{argued against}} an extension, Kreyberg saying, [...] "If it {{is a question}} of handing Dr. Reich over to the Gestapo, then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> that, but if one could get rid of him in a decent manner, that would be the best." [...] The writer Sigurd Hoel asked: [...] "When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in a microscope when one was not a trained biologist?" [...] Reich received support from overseas, first from the anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, who in March wrote to the press in Norway that Reich's sociological works were [...] "a distinct and valuable contribution toward science," [...] and from A.S. Neill, founder of Summerhill, a progressive school in England, who argued that [...] "the campaign against Reich seems largely ignorant and uncivilized, more like fascism than democracy..." ...|$|E
500|$|Marcus also {{involved}} himself in issues {{of civil rights}} and social justice. One unusual case involved three male students at W. W. Samuell High School who, in 1966, were stopped at the school's front door and ordered to cut their hair {{in order to be}} admitted to the school. The young men filed a lawsuit against the Dallas Independent School District, claiming the restriction interfered with their constitutional freedom of expression. Despite not knowing the boys involved, Marcus stepped forward to champion their case before the public, taking out a newspaper ad defending the choice as a simple fashion decision rather than rebellion against authority. Additionally, he offered legal support if needed, noting in a telegram to school board president Lee McShan, Jr., [...] "I don’t like long hair any more than the principal does, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> for the rights of those students to wear hair any way they choose." [...] Though the case was lost and appealed {{all the way to the}} U.S. Supreme Court without success, decades letter the men still appreciated Marcus' support. Paul Jarvis, one of the plaintiffs, said of Marcus after his death in 2002: [...] "He was just a nice man and a great contributor to Dallas and to the arts. He wanted to do what was right." ...|$|E

As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't know much about guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, but I hope that I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> for you / Hey! Just when I ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E

2500|$|Foch was {{surprised}} by the German offensive ("Bluecher") on the Chemin des Dames (27 May). Foch believed it was a diversion to draw Allied reserves away from Flanders. This was partly true, although the planned German Flanders Offensive ("Hagen") never took place. The Allied armies under Foch's command ultimately held the advance of the German forces. The celebrated phrase, [...] "I will fight in front of Paris, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> in Paris, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> behind Paris", attributed both to Foch and Clemenceau, illustrated the Généralissime's resolve to keep the Allied armies intact, even at the risk of losing the capital. The British General Sir Henry Rawlinson, commanding the British Fourth Army, commented after meeting Foch: [...] "I am overjoyed at his methods and far-sighted strategy. I was in close touch with him in 1916. He is a better man now than he was then, for his fiery enthusiasm has been tempered by adversity." [...] Rawlinson also noted Foch's intense Frenchness: [...] "He knew nothing of Britain. The Rhine was for him a river of life and death." ...|$|E

Chief Joseph surrendered to General Oliver O. Howard of the U.S. Cavalry. During the surrender negotiations, Chief Joseph sent a message, usually described as a speech, to the US soldiers. It has become renowned {{as one of the}} greatest American speeches: [...] "...Hear me, my chiefs, I am tired. My heart is sick and sad.

[...] Bragg dealt with this rivalry in the Tullahoma Campaign by assigning Wheeler to guard the army's right flank while Forrest guarded the left. A Union cavalry advance on Shelbyville on June 27 trapped Wheeler and 50 of his men {{on the north side}} of the Duck River, forcing Wheeler to plunge his horse over a 15-foot embankment and escape through the rain-swollen river.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 July 2017 President Poroshenko {{issued a}} decree {{stripping}} Saakashvili of his Ukrainian citizenship, {{but without a}} reason for his doing so being stated. Ukraine's migration service {{said in a statement}} that [...] "according to the Constitution of Ukraine, the president takes decisions on who is stripped of Ukrainian citizenship based on the conclusions of the citizenship commission". [...] Saakashvili, in response to his being stripped of citizenship, replied: [...] "I have only one citizenship, that of Ukraine, and I will not be deprived of it! Now there is an attempt under way to force me to become a refugee. This will not happen! <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> for my legal right to return to Ukraine!" [...] A Ukrainian legislator from the Petro Poroshenko Bloc faction in parliament, Serhiy Leshchenko, said that Saakashvili was (when Poroshenko issued his decree) in the United States, but that if he sought to return to Ukraine, he would face extradition to Georgia to face charges for alleged crimes that occurred during his presidency there. According to The Economist, most observers saw Poroshenko's stripping Saakashvili of his citizenship [...] "simply as the sidelining of a political rival" [...] (at the time political polls gave Saakashvili's political party Movement of New Forces around 2% in a hypothetical early election). On 28 July (2017) Saakashvili told Newshour he wanted to return to Ukraine to [...] "get rid of the old corrupt elite" [...] there.|$|E
2500|$|Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao, after {{negotiations}} {{spread over}} a number of years, on May 2, 2015, inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Mayweather dictated the pace early, controlling range with the jab. His deft movement and pivoting made Pacquiao, who landed only 19% of his punches, consistently miss. Mayweather was able to counter Pacquiao with his right hand constantly throughout the fight and won via unanimous decision with the scorecards reading 118–110, 116–112, and 116–112. The vast majority of media outlets (16/18) scored the bout in his favor. In the days following the fight, many casual observers felt the match {{failed to live up to}} expectations. Pacquiao told the media after the match that he was limited in the fight due to an injured right arm. Sports Illustrated reported that Pacquiao fought through a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder, which will require surgery. Bob Arum revealed Pacquiao's injury to have been a persistent one dating back to 2008. Additionally Pacquiao's camp never requested a cortisone injection, which is allowed by the US Anti-Doping Agency, but rather a last minute toradol injection, which was declined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Mayweather, who originally had no plans on a rematch with Pacquiao, told ESPN's Stephen A. Smith in a text that he would be open to a rematch after Pacquiao recovers from shoulder surgery, however as of May 9, 2015, Mayweather stated [...] "Did I text Stephen A. Smith and say <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> him again? Yeah, but I change my mind. At this particular time, no, because he's a sore loser and he's a coward." [...] On July 6, 2015, the World Boxing Organization (WBO) stripped Mayweather of his welterweight championship on technical grounds.|$|E
