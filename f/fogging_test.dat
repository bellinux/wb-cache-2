40|$|BACKGROUND: The velopharyngeal {{sphincter}} (VPS) {{plays the}} main role in speech formation. The cleft palate, {{due to the}} damage of the soft palate, leads to dysfunction of the velopharyngeal sphincter thus causing speech disorder. AIM: To establish {{a link between the}} nasal air escape and the perceptual symptoms in the speech of patients with cleft palate or cleft lip and palate using auditory-visual perceptual procedures for determining the influence the velopharyngeal dysfunction has on speech. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients with speech disorders, out of which 10 have cleft palate or cleft lip and palate (experimental group), participated in the perceptual assessment by means of Czermak mirror <b>fogging</b> <b>test</b> for assessing the nasal air escape and Pittsburgh Weighted Speech Scale (PWSS) for assessing the probable nature of the velopharyngeal sphincter. RESULTS: The respondents with a considerable nasal air escape have a higher velopharyngeal inability, that is, probably incompetent nature of the velopharyngeal sphincter. There is a strong correlation between the nasal air escape and the probable nature of the velopharyngeal sphincter (the coefficient of linear correlation r = 0. 9756). The calculated р-value is р = 0. 000002. CONCLUSION: The perceptual speech symptoms and the nasal air escape provide unique insight into the state and role the velopharyngeal sphincter has in speech...|$|E
50|$|Born in Cleveland, Ohio, {{he was a}} {{graduate}} of Dartmouth College. He later did postgraduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Harold Edgerton, graduating from MIT in 1941. After World War II he worked with Edgerton to develop techniques to photograph atomic experiments in the Pacific Ocean. With little resources in the field, he solved chronic <b>fogging</b> problems during <b>tests</b> in the Marshall Islands in 1954, thus saving the entire photographic record of the project. He was later engaged by CBS to analyze the famous Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination. In 1975, with Edgerton and Robert Rines he made headlines by allegedly photographing the Loch Ness monster.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three different}} topics in phosphorus-containing heterocycles. The first {{topic is about}} novel phosphorus-containing flame-retardants {{to be used in}} poly-urethane foams. The background and importance of flame-retardants is discussed as well as the synthesis and testing data of compounds that were expected to have good flame-retardant properties. More importantly, these compounds represent a class of flame-retardants that can be chemically incorporated into the polymer, which will overcome current negative aspects such as leaching and <b>fogging.</b> The <b>test</b> results show that the tested compounds perform about as well as commercially available materials and that there are indications that they are chemically incorporated into the polymer.;The second topic is about the cytotoxic effects of aziridines. The phosphate moiety of a DNA-chain can act as a nucleophile that ring-opens an aziridine. This reaction results in the formation of a phosphate triester with a potential nucleophile, namely an amino group, in a beta-position. These two factors make the hydrolysis of the DNA chain at this particular point much more likely. A model study was designed to investigate the likelihood of DNA-chain cleavage by aziridines as these form an important class of anti-tumour agents. From this model study it can be concluded that the cytotoxic effects of aziridines have to be contributed to alkylation of other nucleophilic sites at DNA than to strand cleavage preceded by alkylation of the phosphate backbone.;The last topic covers a stereochemical investigation of the metal catalysed hydrolysis of a cyclic nucleotide. It presents the first stereochemical assignment of the metal catalysed hydrolysis of a phosphate ester. In line with most enzyme catalysed hydrolyses of phosphate esters the reaction investigated here was assigned to go with inversion of configuration...|$|R
