5|$|Accompanying <b>injuries</b> often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. <b>Injuries</b> that may {{accompany}} TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, <b>injuries</b> to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating <b>injuries</b> to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with <b>injuries</b> in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with <b>injuries</b> higher on the spine. Women with <b>injuries</b> above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral <b>injuries</b> (59% vs 17%). In men, <b>injuries</b> above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral <b>injuries</b> might interrupt.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the incidence of}} secondary contiguous or non-contiguous subchondral bone impactions (SBI) in subaxial cervical spinal <b>injury</b> and associated primary <b>injury</b> patterns. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and medical records was carried out for 47 patients who had sustained a subaxial cervical spinal <b>injury.</b> Presence, number, level, and sites of secondary contiguous or non-contiguous SBI were recorded. To evaluate primary <b>injury</b> patterns, the level and number of primary <b>injury</b> sites of subaxial cervical spine <b>injury,</b> <b>injury</b> morphology, anterior/posterior discoligamentous complex (ADC/PDC) <b>injury,</b> posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) <b>injury,</b> spinal cord <b>injury,</b> and mechanism of <b>injury</b> (MOI) were analyzed.

5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head <b>injuries</b> are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related <b>injuries</b> per year. An estimated 51% of <b>injuries</b> occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. <b>Injuries</b> are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for <b>injuries,</b> while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience <b>injuries.</b> Fifty percent of <b>injuries</b> occur in the lower extremities (with knee <b>injuries</b> alone counting for roughly 36% of all <b>injuries)</b> and 30% occur in the upper extremities.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic <b>injuries</b> are {{not common}} in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal <b>injuries</b> {{resulting}} in permanent neurological damage across all {{high school sports}} in the United States from 1982 to 2011. In football, catastrophic <b>injuries</b> are rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head <b>injuries</b> has remained low since {{the introduction of the}} modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher {{at the high school level}} than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head <b>injuries</b> per year: there were 0.67 <b>injuries</b> per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 <b>injuries</b> per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent neurological damage, and 36 made a full recovery. Fifty-nine percent of these players had a history of head <b>injuries,</b> 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic <b>injuries</b> resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{evaluated}} a continuous, immediate, localized ischemic preconditioning regimen in a rat {{model of}} ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> and assessed whether it attenuated <b>injury</b> at the histologic and molecular levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen adult male Lewis rats received sham operation, left unilateral warm ischemia (45 minutes of cross-clamping of the renal pedicle; ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> group), or 15 minutes of ischemia {{followed by a}} 20 -minute reperfusion period, 45 minutes of ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury,</b> and subsequent reperfusion (ischemic preconditioning/ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> group). Kidney tissue was retrieved 48 hours later, sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined. We used RNA extraction and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis to assess acute kidney <b>injury</b> markers, cytokines, and microRNA- 21. RESULTS: Forty-five minutes of unilateral ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> caused marked changes in histology at 48 hours, characterized by endothelial loss, tubulointerstitial damage (inflammation, cast formation), tubular cell necrosis, and glomerular capsule thickening. The ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> and ischemic preconditioning/ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> groups showed no measurable differences in histology. Expression of the acute kidney <b>injury</b> markers was significantly increased in the ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> versus Sham group; however, no difference {{was found between the}} ischemia reperfusion <b>injury</b> and ischemic preconditioning/ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> groups. Similarly, expression of interleukin 17, interleukin 18, and tumor necrosis factor ? was significantly increased in the ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> versus Sham group. No significant difference was found between the ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> and ischemic preconditioning/ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> groups for interleukin 17 and interleukin 18; however, tumor necrosis factor ? expression was significantly increased in the ischemic preconditioning/ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> versus ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury</b> group. CONCLUSIONS: In our ischemic preconditioning model, tumor necrosis factor α expression was increased without altering the sequelae of ischemia-reperfusion <b>injury.</b> The long-term consequences of this augmented early inflammatory response and whether these consequences are altered by variations in ischemic preconditioning or a subsequent <b>injury</b> require further study...|$|R

5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic <b>injuries</b> can be caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic <b>injuries,</b> a greater number of NFL players have reported major <b>injuries</b> and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E

30|$|<b>Injury</b> {{prevalence}} {{refers to}} “the percentage of players {{out with an}} <b>injury</b> or playing hurt” (Binney 2015). It is cumulative.

For present purposes the key point is that the same <b>injury</b> which occurs at home is typically included in the <b>injury</b> report for the team when it plays away and vice versa. An <b>injury</b> which occurs at home in 1  week registers as an away <b>injury</b> if the player is still out and the team’s next game is away.

40|$|Does {{inhalation}} <b>injury</b> {{increase the}} mortality rate in burn patients? Investigation of relationship between inhalation <b>injury</b> and severity of burn surface Objective. Inhalation <b>injury</b> accounts for 20 % to 80 % of deaths in burn patients due to severe cardiopulmonary distress not seen in cutaneous <b>injury</b> alone. However, there are few comparative studies or retrospective analyses of the <b>injury</b> severity or deaths of patients with inhalation <b>injury.</b> Methods. We evaluated 59 patients (31 with inhalation <b>injury</b> and 27 without inhalation <b>injury)</b> who had sustained a severe burn <b>injury</b> and were treated {{in the intensive care}} unit at our medical center from 2004 through 2006. Of the 31 patients with inhalation <b>injury,</b> 14 (45. 2 %) died, and of the 27 without inhalation <b>injury,</b> 4 (16. 7 %) died. Results. We investigated specific aspects of the severity and mortality of burn patients. The median (mean) burn index in patients without and with inhalation <b>injury</b> were 45 and 50 points (17. 9 and 34. 4), and the median (mean) prognostic burn index scores between patients with and without inhalation <b>injury</b> were 88. 5 and 55. 5 points (86. 8 and 69. 4). The median (mean) prognostic burn index scores in surviving patients with and without inhalation <b>injury</b> were 49. 5 and 67 points (60. 0 and 70. 0), which suggest that patients with inhalation <b>injury</b> sustained significantly more severe cutaneous burns than did patients without inhalation <b>injury.</b> Conclusions.
