40|$|In summary, the {{deliberate}} indirect approach taken by Blau and Duncan involve {{them in a}} larger number and a more difficult set of mea-surement problems than I find in trying to pro-pose a grammar for responding to questions. In this sense Blau and Duncan generate more measurement error than I <b>do.</b> <b>SUMMARY</b> A characterization of ethnomethodology has been presented, distinguishing three levels of work in that field. Some ways in which eth-nomethodologists view quantitative research methods in sociology, as exemplified in path Ratio Measurement / 191 models, were presented. Finally, a discussion of measurement problems in path models was pre-sented by comparing measurement problems there with measurement problems in develop-ing a grammar of a social activity, {{one of the three}} levels of ethnomethodological work...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulins, {{as well as}} T cell receptors, play a {{key role}} in {{adaptive}} immune responses because of their ability to recognize antigens. Recent advances in next generation sequencing improved also the quality and quantity of individual B cell receptors repertoire sequencing. Unfortunately, appropriate software to exhaustively analyze repertoire data from NGS platforms without limitations of the number of sequences are lacking. Here we introduce a new R package, bcRep, which offers a platform for comprehensive analyses of B cell receptor repertoires, using IMGT/HighV-QUEST formatted data. Methods for gene usage statistics, clonotype classification, as well as diversity measures, are included. Furthermore, functions to filter datasets, to <b>do</b> <b>summary</b> statistics about mutations, as well as visualization methods, are available. To compare samples in respect of gene usage, diversity, amino acid proportions, similar sequences or clones, several functions including also distance measurements, as well as multidimensional scaling methods, are provided...|$|E
40|$|About 6. 5 million {{children}} under age 18 – or nearly 9 percent of all U. S. children – received part of their family income from Social Security in 2005. They include 3. 1 {{million children}} who receive benefits as dependents of deceased, disabled, or retired workers and an estimated 3. 4 million other children who do not themselves receive Social Security but live with relatives who <b>do.</b> <b>Summary</b> Social Security benefits often make the difference in lifting children out of poverty. Of the 6. 5 million children in families that received Social Security, fully 1. 3 million were lifted out of poverty by Social Security income. Social Security is the most widespread form of life insurance for American families. Almost all U. S. workers – including {{men and women in}} the armed forces – have life insurance through Social Security when tragedy strikes. For example, Social Security continues to pay benefits to more than 2, 000 children whose parents died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Children, their parents, and caretakers have an important stake in the future of Social Security. While the program is in strong financial shape over the next decade, it is not in balance for the full 75 years used to assess its finances. Policymakers are considering ways to balance the system by raising revenues, cutting benefits, or both. Because children’s benefits are directly tied to benefits earned by their working parents, any across-the-board reduction in workers ’ benefits would cut insurance protection for children, unless they were specifically exempted. Moreover, even if children’s own benefits were exempted, children would share the impact of reductions in benefits paid to others in their families. Analysts and advocates for children have an important role to fill in Social Security policy discussions...|$|E

40|$|Privatization in Africa: What has happened? What {{is to be}} <b>done?</b> <b>Summary</b> Sub-Saharan African states {{urgently}} need {{expanded and}} more dynamic private sectors, more efficient and effective infrastructure/utility provision, and increased investment from both domestic and foreign sources. Privatization {{is one way to}} address these problems. But African states have generally been slow and reluctant privatizers; a good percentage of industrial/manufacturing and most infrastructure still remains in state hands. Given prevailing public hostility towards privatization, and widespread institutional weaknesses, such caution is defensible, but nonetheless very costly. The long-run and difficult solution is the creation and reinforcement of the institutions that underpin and guide proper market operations. In the interim, African governments and donors have little choice but to continue to experiment with the use of externally supplied substitutes for gaps in local regulatory and legal systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} an {{increased}} interest {{in the role of}} a human rights framework to mobilize resources for health. Discussion This paper argues that the human rights framework does provide us with an appropriate understanding of what values should guide a nation's health policy, and a potentially powerful means of moving the health agenda forward. It also, however, argues that appeals to human rights may not necessarily be effective at mobilizing resources for specific health problems one might want to do something about. Specifically, {{it is not possible to}} argue that a particular allocation of scarce health care resources should be changed to a different allocation, benefiting other groups. Lack of access to health care services by some people only shows that something has to be done, but not what should be <b>done.</b> <b>Summary</b> The somewhat weak claim identified above together with the obligation to realize progressively a right to health can be used to mobilize resources for health. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} use {{the results of a}} {{randomised}} trial, it is necessary to understand whether the overall observed benefit or harm applies to all individuals, or whether some subgroups receive more benefit or harm than others. This decision is commonly guided by a statistical test for interaction. However, with binary outcomes, different effect measures yield different interaction tests. For example, the UK Hip trial explored the impact of ultrasound of infants with suspected hip dysplasia on the occurrence of subsequent hip treatment. Risk ratios were similar between subgroups defined by level of clinical suspicion (P = 0. 14), but odds ratios and risk differences differed strongly between subgroups (P Discussion Interaction tests on different effect measures differ because they test different null hypotheses. A graphical technique demonstrates that the difference arises when the subgroup risks differ markedly. We consider that the test of interaction acts as a check on the applicability of the trial results to all included subgroups. The test of interaction should therefore be applied to the effect measure which is least likely a priori to exhibit an interaction. We give examples of how this might be <b>done.</b> <b>Summary</b> The choice of interaction test is especially important when the risk of a binary outcome varies widely between subgroups. The interaction test should be pre-specified and should be guided by clinical knowledge. </p...|$|R
