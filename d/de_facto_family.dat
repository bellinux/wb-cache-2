According to the semi-salic version of the succession law advocated by the carloctavistas, if the direct male line dies out the nearest female relative of the last king inherits the crown with succession to her heirs male. With only descent through equal marriages allowed, the claim would have passed {{on the death of}} Franz Josef in 1975 to Juan, Count of Barcelona. This would make the former <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> king, Juan Carlos I, the Carlist king. All of his children have contracted unequal marriages, so the Carlist claim would pass on his death to Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria. However, many Carlists regard the current <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> Spanish Royal <b>Family</b> as disqualified for the same reasons as his ancestor, Alfonso XII. If Alfonso XII's heirs are discounted, the heir to the Spanish throne under the carloctavista succession rules with descent only through equal marriages is Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, the current pretender to the throne of Portugal.|$|R

40|$|The {{criminal}} justice system has expanded dramatically {{over the last several}} decades, extending its reach into family life. This expansion has disproportionately and negatively impacted Black communities and social networks, including Black families. Despite these pervasive shifts, legal scholars have virtually ignored the intersection of criminal, family, and racial justice. This Article explores the gap in literature in two respects. First, the Article weaves together criminal law, family law, and racial justice by cataloging ways in which the modern {{criminal justice}} state regulates family life, particularly for Black families. Second, the Article examines the depth of criminal justice interference in family life and autonomy through analysis of the impact of community supervision on families. These explorations reveal that community supervision, and criminal justice more broadly, operate as a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>family</b> law regime, negatively restructuring Black family autonomy, stability and loyalty, all of which family law seeks to promote. The Article recommends that the practice of community supervision return to its roots in human services and calls on legal scholars to focus critical attention on criminal law’s creation of disparate and unequal family law systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{fascinating}} {{correspondence between}} Mme de Genlis and her English admirer Margaret Chinnery was discovered {{at a private}} art gallery in London in 1996. Margaret Chinnery was an intelligent, wealthy mother of three who educated her own children, and the letters offer proof that she implemented Mme de Genlisâs method, as expounded in the latterâs novel AdÃ¨le et ThÃ©odore. The correspondence documents a warm friendship which began in 1802, and which came to crisis point, as did so many of Mme de Genlisâs friendships, {{with the publication of}} her MÃ©moires in 1825. Approximately half the letters to Margaret Chinnery date from 1802, when the Chinnery family and the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>family</b> member, the violinist G. B. Viotti, came to Paris during the Peace of Amiens. Most of the others date from 1807, when Mme de Genlis sent her adopted son Casimir Baecker to London in an attempt to repeat the successes of his Paris harp concerts. The forty letters from Mme de Genlis are extraordinarily candid in their description of her daily activities, her financial situation, and her hopes and disappointments. They reveal an emotionally fragile, driven woman, almost pitiable in her obsession to promote her favourite pupil Casimir. The letters provide valuable information on Mme de Genlisâs educational works, her novels and on her periodical contributions that were in progress at the time of writing, as well as on many of her other manuscripts. Some of the letters describe her attempts, through the Chinnery family and Viotti, to sell her manuscripts in England. Because copies of Margaret Chinneryâs letters have been preserved the subjects treated in the letters are not only contextualised, but are given continuity and coherence. In addition, over twenty-two related letters and documents provide an elucidating backdrop to {{the main body of the}} correspondence. This is the only known correspondence that documents a friendship between Mme de Genlis and an English woman and the completeness of its preservation makes it a valuable resource indeed.

40|$|<b>De</b> <b>facto</b> states, {{defined as}} {{entities}} that possess {{control over a}} defined territory, population, and government, but without recognition from other states, have become increasingly important {{over the past three}} decades. Although the universe of cases is small (there have been 24 <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states since the 1960 s), <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states {{play an important role in}} regional security and stability. Despite this relevance, we still know little about why <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states emerge, how their preferences are formed, and what shapes their behaviour and decision-making. Shedding light on these overlooked issues will allow us to better understand the role of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states in regional and international politics. The existing literature, although insightful, does not fully explain the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. In particular, the literature has fallen short in explaining the behaviour of Iraqi Kurdistan. In order to better understand the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states, this thesis asks the following questions: what are the factors that shape and influence <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state preferences and behaviour? What are the factors that determine if a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state will declare independence or preserve the status quo? More specifically, in terms of the cases under examination, why did Kosovo and South Sudan declare independence, while Iraqi Kurdistan has not? The goal of this dissertation is to identify the conditions under which a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state may declare independence and when it may preserve the status quo. To address these questions, this thesis employs international relations theories and adopts a comparative analysis method to the behaviour of Kosovo, South Sudan, and Iraqi Kurdistan. Following extensive fieldwork in Iraqi Kurdistan, the thesis argues that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states will forgo independence when the parent state furnishes the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state with autonomy and offers sufficient economic incentives. Other mitigating factors include the domestic environment of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state and the parent state, the role of regional and international governments, and the presence or absence of the old regime of the parent state. The main point is that the preference for independence is neither fixed nor inevitable...|$|R
