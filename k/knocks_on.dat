25|$|The sovereign, {{along with}} the Senate and the House of Representatives, {{being one of the}} three {{components}} of parliament, is called the Queen-in-Parliament. The authority of the Crown therein is embodied in the mace (House of Representatives) and Black Rod (Senate), which both bear a crown at their apex. The monarch and viceroy do not, however, participate in the legislative process save for the granting of Royal Assent by the Governor-General. Further, the constitution outlines that the Governor-General alone is responsible for summoning, proroguing, and dissolving parliament, after which the writs for a general election are usually dropped by the Prime Minister at Government House. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which either the monarch or the Governor-General reads the Speech from the Throne. As the monarch and viceroy, by convention, cannot enter the House of Representatives, this, as well as the bestowing of Royal Assent, takes place in the Senate chamber; Members of Parliament are summoned to these ceremonies from the House of Representatives by the Crown's messenger, the Usher of the Black Rod, after he <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> the doors of the lower house that have been slammed closed on him to symbolise the barring of the monarch from the House of Representatives.|$|E

500|$|Puccini's {{score is}} built around a series of motifs which recur through the opera, {{generally}} representing characters, situations and moods though sometimes without specific associations. The opening motif is a rapid burst of rhythmic music, described by Greenfield as of [...] "almost Stravinskian sharpness", which quickly transforms into a mock-solemn dirge depicting the hypocritical grief of the Donati relatives. This juxtaposition of the humorous and the solemn pervades the opera; critic Ernest Newman suggests that it [...] "keeps us perpetually suspended between the comic and the tragic". Other principal motifs include the theme associated with the lovers Rinuccio and Lauretta, introduced in Rinuccio's first solo [...] "Salvati! Salvati!", and a short, formal woodwind statement which represents Donati's will. Rinuccio sings the name [...] "Gianni Schicchi" [...] to a jaunty four-note phrase which becomes Schicchi's personal motif, and it is heard again as Schicchi <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> the door before his first appearance. The best-known theme in the opera, that associated with Lauretta, is introduced {{in the second part}} of Rinuccio's aria [...] "Avete torto". The theme is briefly played on clarinet and violin as Lauretta enters with Schicchi, before its full expression in O mio babbino caro.|$|E

Rihanna is in her room; she is bored and {{wondering}} which clothes to wear, and she finds a gold necklace. As the song starts, Rihanna lies in bed and sings, while Ne-Yo continues walking along the street, approaches the hotel and cautiously looks around before entering it. Meanwhile, Rihanna dresses, leaves the room and walks through the hallway of the hotel. Ne-Yo goes in an elevator {{to the floor of}} Rihanna's room. As Rihanna waits near the elevator, it opens. Ne-Yo and Rihanna meet and smile at each other as Rihanna enters the elevator and Ne-Yo exits. It is then revealed that Rihanna and Ne-Yo are not singing about each other, but different people. As the video progresses, Rihanna is downstairs, chanting the lyrics of the song and Ne-Yo is in a hallway. He <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> a door, which his girlfriend opens, and he enters the room. Rihanna simultaneously climbs into her lover's car and they smile at each other. The video ends with the previous scenes showing Rihanna leaving her hotel room. A reviewer from MTV UK commented, [...] "After Shut Up And Drive the 19 year old is going even raunchier for this vid- writhing around on a bed in her underwear and pearls." ...|$|E

Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help. Clara chooses the word [...] "Pond", which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest.|$|E
