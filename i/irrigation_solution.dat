40|$|BACKGROUND: Lysozyme is {{an innate}} immune peptide with {{bactericidal}} and fungicidal activity (FA). Despite increased expression of lysozyme protein in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) sinus mucosa, CRS patients experience repeated bacterial and/or fungal infections. Commercial sinus <b>irrigation</b> <b>solutions</b> {{are often used}} to provide symptomatic relief. However, one of the mechanisms of action of lysozyme involves ionic interactions with the microbial cell wall, which may be inhibited by ionic solutions such as commercial sinus <b>irrigation</b> <b>solutions.</b> OBJECTIVE: Determine if the FA of lysozyme is reduced {{in the presence of}} solutions with increasing ionic strength and inhibited in the presence of commercial sinus <b>irrigation</b> <b>solutions.</b> METHODS: Using an in vitro colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, the FA of lysozyme (5 μM) was tested against a fungi commonly isolated from CRS patients, Aspergillus fumigatus, in solutions of increasing ionic strength or commercial sinus <b>irrigation</b> <b>solutions.</b> FA was presented as percent of control. RESULTS: FA of lysozyme against A. fumigatus was 95 % in a 21 -mM ionic strength solution. However, with increasing ionic strength, FA decreased and was abolished in a 46 -mM ionic strength <b>solution.</b> Commercial sinus <b>irrigation</b> <b>solutions</b> abolished the FA of lysozyme against A. fumigatus. CONCLUSION: The in vitro FA of lysozyme is dependent on the ionic strength of the solution. The use of sinus <b>irrigation</b> <b>solutions</b> should be further evaluated with regard to maintaining functional activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides involved in sinonasal innate immunity.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of different <b>irrigation</b> <b>solutions</b> and ultrasonic activation of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>solutions</b> on the removal of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) from the simulated immature root canals after apexification. Materials and methods: One-hundred and one single-rooted teeth were used. The root canals were shaped with ProTaper rotary files up to F 5. Simulation of roots with immature apices was carried out using size 4 Unicore drills. An injectable Ca(OH) 2 was injected into each root canal, and packed to the working length. Then, cotton pellets were placed over canal orifices, and apical and coronal parts of the roots were sealed with resin-modified glass ionomer cement, and light cured. Specimens were stored in distilled water for 3 months at 37 °C. After 3 months, the temporary coronal seal was removed and the samples were randomly divided into: (a) saline (n[*]=[*] 20), (b) ultrasonic activation of saline (n[*]=[*] 20), (c) sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (n[*]=[*] 20), (d) ultrasonic activation of NaOCl (n[*]=[*] 15), (e) chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) (n[*]=[*] 20) and one positive control group (n[*]=[*] 3) and one negative control group (n[*]=[*] 3).

Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACF) is an effective <b>irrigation</b> <b>solution</b> in general open craniotomy and endoneurosurgery, but no evidence of its use in burr-hole surgery exists. Objective: To identify the potential of ACF irrigation to prevent CSDH recurrence. More specifically, to investigate the perioperative and intraoperative prognostic factors, and to identify controllable ones. Methods: To examine various prognostic factors, 120 consecutive patients with unilateral CSDH treated with burr-hole drainage between September 2007 and March 2013 were analyzed. Intraoperative irrigation was performed with one of two irrigation solutions: normal saline (NS; n = 60) or ACF (n = 60). All patients were followed-up for at least 6 months postoperatively.

Group 1, dentin bars were immersed in 5 % NaOCl; group 2, in 2. 5 % NaOCl; group 3, in 15 % EDTA; group 4, in 0. 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX); and group 5, in saline (as control) respectively. Each group was immeresed for 2 hours. Each dentin bar was subjected to a three-point bend using MTS Universal Testing Machine to test the flexural strength. Data were analyzed using one way Anova, followed by Tukey's test performed at the 0. 05 level of significance. Results: All <b>irrigation</b> <b>solution</b> {{have an effect on the}} flexural strength (P< 0. 05). EDTA caused the greatest effect on dentin mechanical properties, which revealed the lowest flexural strength (100. 64 ± 7. 23).

40|$|Introduction: Irrigation of {{the root}} canal system is an {{important}} part of the endodontic treatment principle which aims to improve the hygiene {{of the root}} canal system from any debris and medicament residue with the hydrodynamic system. Root irrigation technique can be done with the manual and sonic system by using 2. 5 % NaOCI <b>irrigation</b> <b>solution.</b> Calcium hydroxide is used as a medicament for root canal sterilization. Root canal treatment will fail due to the imperfect removal of calcium hydroxide residue. The objective of this research was to analyze the comparison of the removal of calcium hydroxide medicaments on the root canal treatment irrigated with manual and sonic agitation technique using 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite solution. Methods: The methods used in this study was experimental laboratory. The sample used was 30 maxillary incisors. The teeth were then divided into two groups randomly, then the root canal preparation was done by the crown down technique with manual irrigation using 2. 5 % NaOCI solution. The radicular part of the teeth was then split longitudinally, given a standardized groove in the one-third of the apical part, then applied with water-solved calcium hydroxide. The teeth were unified afterwards by using flowable composites, then soaked in the artificial saliva at the temperature of 37 ºC. The sample of the 1 st group was irrigated by manual agitation technique, and the sample of the 2 nd group 2 was irrigated by sonic agitation technique, then both were viewed by stereo microscope.

However, transfer of intracameral moxifloxacin (MFLX) to the vitreous {{has not been}} examined in detail. We investigated vitreous antibiotic concentrations following intracameral MFLX in both ruptured and intact posterior capsular eyes. Methods: Experiment 1 : Intraocular lenses were inserted into 21 extracted porcine eyes {{by one of the}} following three methods: (1) Irrigation: Throughout surgery, 33 -fold diluted MFLX <b>irrigation</b> <b>solution</b> (150 µg/mL) was used; (2) Bag and chamber flushing: After surgery, the anterior chamber and area behind the intraocular lenses were irrigated with 30 -fold diluted MFLX (167 µg/mL) using a 5 mL syringe; (3) Simple injection: Tenfold diluted MFLX (50 µg in 0. 1 mL) was injected intracamerally at the conclusion of surgery. The eyeballs were frozen and the anterior, central, and posterior portions of the vitreous were cubed. After defrosting, concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Experiment 2 : The same procedure was conducted for 18 eyes in which the posterior capsule had been ruptured. Results: Experiment 1 : Transfer of intracameral MFLX to the anterior vitreous was approximately 1 % (1. 56 – 2. 20 µg/mL) regardless of the administration method. Experiment 2 : MFLX reached a high concentration in the vitreous with <b>irrigation</b> <b>solution</b> administration (maximum 30. 22 µg/mL).

The first step {{in this study was}} to determine the presence of bacteria in samples of both the agglomerated ores taken from the heaps and the samples from the <b>irrigation</b> <b>solution</b> used in the leaching process. No bacteria were detected in either sample, probably because of the very low pH, the high concentration of sulfate (200 g/l), and the presence of other ions in the <b>irrigation</b> <b>solution.</b> On the other hand, the cultivation of bacteria from recently crushed, fresh mixed ore (oxide- sulfide), and from cured, agglomerated ore, showed the presence of a small bacterial population, with ferrous iron-oxidizing activity. This indicates that the ore initially contained viable bacteria that were inhibited in the heap. Based on these results, a glass laboratory column containing 700 g of agglomerated ore from a partially, chemically leached heap was set up. The ore in the column was irrigated in a closed circuit with nutrient medium containing 2 g of ferrous sulfate per liter. Bacteria were detected, and the redox potential in the leaching solution began to increase on day 20 of the bioleaching experiment, indicating the beginning of the bioleaching stage of the sulfide mineral. The data indicate that the bacteria initially present on the ore can be recovered after acid curing, and also after prolonged contact with a solution containing a high concentration of sulfate.
