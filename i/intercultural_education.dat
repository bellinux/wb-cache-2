500|$|The 1990s saw {{the onset}} of {{diametric}} changes in official Mexican government policies towards indigenous and linguistic rights. Developments of accords in the international rights arena combined with domestic pressures (such as social and political agitation by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and indigenous social movements) led to legislative reforms {{and the creation of}} decentralized government agencies like National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (CDI) and Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI) with responsibilities for the promotion and protection of indigenous communities and languages. In particular, the federal Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas [...] recognizes all the country's indigenous languages, including Nahuatl, as [...] "national languages" [...] and gives indigenous people the right to use them in all spheres of public and private life. In Article 11, it grants access to compulsory, bilingual and <b>intercultural</b> <b>education.</b> Nonetheless, progress towards institutionalizing Nahuatl and securing linguistic rights for its speakers has been slow.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1980s, with {{assistance}} {{from family and friends}} already there, Armenians from the former Soviet Union began arriving. In the Glendale Unified School District, by 1988, along with students from the Middle East, they had become the largest ethnic group in the public schools, now having a larger number than the Latinos. Glendale became the municipality with the largest number of ethnic Armenians other than Yerevan. Rick Young, a Glendale Police Department spokesperson, stated, [...] "In five to eight years, the [...] community went from a few thousand to about 40,000." [...] Levon Marashlian, an instructor of Armenian history at Glendale College, stated that in the early 1990s Glendale's Armenian community became the largest in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, surpassing the Armenian community of Hollywood. Alice Petrossian, the GUSD director of <b>intercultural</b> <b>education,</b> stated that Burbank lies within the middle of other Armenian communities, so it attracted Armenians.|$|E

40|$|This chapter explores {{critical}} {{approaches to}} online <b>intercultural</b> language <b>education,</b> {{also referred to}} as telecollaboration or online intercultural exchange. The origins of online <b>intercultural</b> language <b>education</b> lie in a critical view of the traditional language classroom. As the practice has evolved, several researchers have adopted a critical approach, questioning the many assumptions that have become ingrained in foreign and online <b>intercultural</b> language <b>education.</b> Major contributors have challenged notions such as intercultural learning being a natural outcome of online contact or the concept of a static, monolithic, national standard language as the target of language learners, whose ideal interlocutors are “native” speakers of this language and experts of its equally static culture. They have also unpacked conceptualizations of sociocultural competence and communicative language teaching as well as the notion that technology is merely a tool through which learners communicate. Recent work has looked, for example, at lingua franca exchanges, which challenge the power dynamics of traditional exchanges and offer a wider range of identities than the nonstandard, deficient communicator that the native speaker target implies. The ecologies of online <b>intercultural</b> language <b>education</b> and the mediating and shaping role of technology and its relations with society have also garnered interest recently. Problems and difficulties in the adoption of critical approaches include the reluctance of teachers to take a political stance and the need to constantly question one’s practice. The chapter concludes with reflections on preferred futures for online <b>intercultural</b> language <b>education...</b>|$|R

Likewise, when considering inclusion, if we should aim to deal with the specific nature of groups linked to <b>intercultural</b> bilingual <b>education</b> with or without a base in universal policies or what type of universalism this should be based on; or rather, whether equity involves guaranteeing access to education for these groups or differentiating curriculum approaches and pedagogic strategies to lend education meaning and relevance for them.|$|R
