5|$|In the 75th Elder election, {{there are}} four finalists; Hatsune Minase <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> votes to Kaoruko and Makiyo Shingyouji <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> votes to Chihaya. Then Chihaya and Kaoruko gain the same votes of 368 together. Though a {{candidate}} which gains 75% {{or more of the}} votes becomes the Elder, Hatsune, as the student council president, proposes that both Chihaya and Kaoruko become the Elders; the motion is adopted unanimously. This is the first time there have been two Elders in the history of Seio Girls' Academy.|$|E
500|$|In his defence, Tabak {{claimed that}} the killing had not been sexually motivated, and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed {{when he tried to}} kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a [...] "flirty comment" [...] and invited him to drink with her. He said that after she screamed he held his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth and around her neck to silence her. He denied {{suggestions}} of a struggle, claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force, and [...] "... for about 20 seconds". He told the court that after dumping the body he was [...] "... in a state of panic".|$|E
500|$|The Elder {{election}} {{is an old}} tradition at Seio Girls' Academy where every June {{one of the students}} is elected by her peers to be the [...] "Elder", who is seen as the number one [...] "Elder Sister" [...] in the school. Until her graduation, she is referred to by her peers as [...] To become an Elder, a candidate must gain at least 75% of the votes. If none of the candidates get at least 75% {{in the first round of}} voting, one of the candidates <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> votes to another candidate, and the candidate who finally obtains at least 75% of the votes becomes the Elder. If there is no one else in the election, the current year's student council president becomes the Elder. In Otoboku, Mizuho gains 82% of the votes in the first round, effectively becoming the 72nd Elder in the school's history. After becoming Elder, Mizuho progressively gets more popular among the student body since he is now a symbol of the school's excellence. In the following months, Mizuho starts to get to know some of the girls better and helps them with their problems.|$|E
