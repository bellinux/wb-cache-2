5000|$|Idle speed (idling, or idle) is the {{rotational}} speed {{the engine runs}} on when the engine is uncoupled to the drivetrain and the throttle pedal isn't depressed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft of a combustion <b>engine).</b> The <b>idle</b> differs in two ways <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> and vehicle idle. At <b>idle</b> speed, the <b>engine</b> generates enough [...] power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile. For a passenger-car <b>engine,</b> <b>idle</b> speed is customarily between 600 rpm and 1,000 rpm. For buses and trucks it is approximately 540 rpm. In case of many single-cylinder motorcycle <b>engines,</b> <b>idle</b> speed is set between 1200-1500 rpm.|$|R

50|$|While {{a higher}} {{compression}} ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines {{are much more}} efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and at <b>engine</b> <b>idle.</b> Unlike the petrol engine, diesels lack a butterfly valve (throttle) in the inlet system, which closes at idle. This creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol <b>engines</b> at <b>idle.</b> In many applications, such as marine, agriculture, and railways, diesels are left idling and unattended for many hours, sometimes even days.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on {{the cause of}} severe vibration problem of a coach with four-cylinder engine running at an idle state using vibration and impact hammer modal experiments to obtain the main vibration frequency components and the natural characteristics of the coach.

Based on structural simulation analysis of the coach’s chassis frame and comparison with modal testing, the coach severe vibration problem was due to coupling resonance between the <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> frequency and the fourth natural frequency of the chassis frame.

50|$|Air {{injection}} {{can also}} be achieved {{by taking advantage of}} the negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system at <b>engine</b> <b>idle.</b> A sensitive reed valve assembly called the aspirator valve is placed in the air injection pumping, which draws its air directly from the clean side of the air filter. During <b>engine</b> <b>idle,</b> brief but periodic negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system draw air through the aspirator valve and into the exhaust stream at the catalytic converter. This system, marketed as Pulse Air, was used by American Motors, Chrysler, and other manufacturers beginning in the 1970s. The aspirator provided advantages in cost, weight, packaging, and simplicity compared to the pump, but the aspirator functions only at idle and so admits significantly less air within a significantly narrower range of engine speeds compared to a pump. This system is still used on modern motorcycle engines, e.g. the Yamaha AIS (Air Injection System).|$|R

Sensitivity studies reveal the effectiveness of various parameter control schemes. Experimental implementation of the semi-active hydraulic mounts on a commercial vehicle confirm their ability to reduce frame vibration levels at <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> speeds. A simplified vehicle system model is used to investigate frame vibration control with active engine mounts.

40|$|In {{response}} to a United States Department of Energy (DOE) solicitation, the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA), in partnership with CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), submitted a proposal to DOE to support the demonstration of Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) technology on fifty-six CSXT locomotives. The project purpose was to demonstrate the idle fuel savings, the Nitrous Oxide (NOX) emissions reduction and the noise reduction capabilities of the APU. Fifty-six CSXT Baltimore Division locomotives were equipped with APUs, Engine Run Managers (ERM) and communications equipment to permit GPS tracking and data collection from the locomotives. Throughout the report there is mention of the percent {{time spent in the}} State of Maryland. The fifty-six locomotives spent most of their time inside the borders of Maryland and some spent all their time inside the state borders. Usually when a locomotive traveled beyond the Maryland State border it was into an adjoining state. They were divided into four groups according to assignment: (1) Power Unit/Switcher Mate units, (2) Remote Control units, (3) SD 50 Pusher units and (4) Other units. The primary data of interest were idle data plus the status of the locomotive [...] stationary or moving. Also collected were main <b>engine</b> off, <b>idling</b> or working. Idle data were collected by county location, by locomotive status (stationary or moving) and type of idle (<b>Idle</b> 1, main <b>engine</b> <b>idling,</b> APU off; <b>Idle</b> 2, main <b>engine</b> off, APU on; <b>Idle</b> 3, main <b>engine</b> off, APU off; <b>Idle</b> 4, main <b>engine</b> <b>idle,</b> APU on). Desirable main <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> states are main engine off and APU off or main engine off and APU on. Measuring the time the main engine spends in these desirable states versus the total time it could spend in an <b>engine</b> <b>idling</b> state allows the calculation of Percent Idle Management Effectiveness (%IME). IME {{is the result of the}} operation of the APU plus the implementation of CSXT's Warm Weather Shutdown Policy. It is difficult to separate the two. The units demonstrated an IME of 64 % at stationary idle for the test period. The data collected during calendar year 2004 demonstrated that 707, 600 gallons of fuel were saved and 285 tons of NOX were not emitted as a result of idle management in stationary idle, which translates to 12, 636 gallons and 5. 1 tons of NOx per unit respectively. The noise reduction capabilities of the APU demonstrated that at 150 feet from the locomotive the loaded APU with the main engine shut down generated noise that was only marginally above ambient noise level...|$|R
40|$|Inventories of {{particulate}} matter (PM) emissions from civil aviation and air quality models {{need to be}} validated using up-to-date measurement data corrected for sampling artifacts. We compared the measured black carbon (BC) mass and the total PM mass determined from particle size distributions (PSD) and effective density for a commercial turbofan engine CFM 56 - 7 B 26 / 3. The effective density was then {{used to calculate the}} PM mass losses in the sampling system. The effective density was determined using a differential mobility analyzer and a centrifugal particle mass analyzer, and increased from <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> to take-off by up to 60 %. The determined mass-mobility exponents ranged from 2. 37 to 2. 64. The mean effective density determined by weighting the effective density distributions by PM volume was within 10 % of the unit density (1000 kg/m 3) that is widely assumed in aircraft PM studies. We found ratios close to unity between the PM mass determined by the integrated PSD method and the real-time BC mass measurements. The integrated PSD method achieved higher precision at ultra-low PM concentrations at which current mass instruments reach their detection limit. The line loss model predicted ~ 60 % PM mass loss at <b>engine</b> <b>idle,</b> decreasing to ~ 27 % at high thrust. Replacing the effective density distributions with unit density lead to comparable estimates that were within 20 % and 5 % at <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> and high thrust, respectively.

40|$|Vibration {{in motor}} {{vehicles}} is largely {{influenced by the}} engine and thus has {{become the focus of}} much automotive testing. <b>Engine</b> <b>idle</b> vibration is focused on since deviations in the vibration signature are prevalent at this operating condition. The objective of this thesis was to derive a best-practice method for the analysis of <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> vibration. Variability of the engine vibration signatures was calculated through the implementation of multiple analysis techniques. These methods included: angle domain analysis, the fast Fourier transform, the discrete cosine transform, the moving average model, and the auto-regressive moving average model. Also included in the investigation were examinations of data normalization, detrending, and filtration. The results of the analyses were then evaluated with reference to the correlation between similar engines and the identification of outliers. It was found that the fast Fourier transform analysis technique provided the best overall results. The moving average model and the auto-regressive moving average models were also identified as methods that have great potential in vibration analysis but are limited by their computational intensity...|$|R
