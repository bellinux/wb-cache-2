5|$|Brodie and Hall {{opened the}} Port Phillip second innings; they added 12 {{in ten minutes}} before Brodie was caught at long off by Tabart and was {{replaced}} by Hamilton. Hall was dismissed leg before wicket from the bowling of McDowall shortly afterwards for six. Lister was caught off the bowling of Field <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>and</b> Henty bowled Thomas for a duck. William Phillpot was run out by Tabart <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>and</b> Cooper was bowled by Henty for a duck, the fifth man out with the score on 28. Wickets continued to fall, although Hamilton was batting well at the other end. Roger Phillpot, who scored just a single, was caught by Westbrook off Henty; Marsden was bowled by McDowall for two and Hervey bowled by Henty for one. Meanwhile, Hamilton had batted for an hour to score 35 runs, the highest individual score of the match; he was last man out, leg before wicket to McDowall to end the innings for 57 runs. The innings had lasted 17 overs and taken 80 minutes. The other batsmen had contributed 21 runs (one bye was scored) between them. Henty took five for 26 and McDowall returned figures of three for 21. Van Diemen's Land required 36 runs to win.|$|E
5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>and</b> a half days. During that time, {{he signed a}} few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle {{as much as any}} other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|The 1900 season {{revealed}} grave {{problems with}} Rostislavs boilers. Black smoke from burning oil was more conspicuous than coal smoke.

Oil delivered by the Rothschild-controlled Russian Standard Oil was not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the Baltic Fleet.|$|E
