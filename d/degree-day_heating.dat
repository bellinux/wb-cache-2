40|$|The HVAC systems {{utilizing}} {{renewable energy}} sources {{are one of the}} main contributors towards the fossil fuel dependency reduction. Among these, the ground source heat pump systems, especially those based on vertical ground heat exchanger, are very attractive, due to their high efficiency. The size of the systems depends on the building (geometry, construction materials, orientation etc. but also usage and internal gains), on the ground thermophysical characteristics, on the climatology of the area and on the ground heat exchanger design and construction. As a result, the ground heat exchanger length required for heating may result significantly different from the one required for cooling. In this work, the ground heat exchanger lengths required for heating and cooling are calculated for two model-buildings, a residential and an office one, located at 40 different Greek cities, covering a wide range of country's climate conditions. Assuming that a ratio of these lengths in the 0. 8 - 1. 2 range is required for efficient long-term operation of the autonomous GSHP system with minimum installation cost, the results suggest that autonomous systems may be used in areas with the <b>heating</b> <b>degree-days</b> in the 800 - 950 Â K-days range.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the climate of a large area with few reporting stations requires a special approach. Northern Saskatchewan, examined in this study, {{is an example of}} such an area. The objectives of this study, therefore, are to determine how to evaluate the climatic environment of a large area with few reporting stations and to apply the methods to an analysis of the climate of northern Saskatchewan. A completeness index, developed by the author, was used to measure how satisfactory the climatological records were in terms of length and number of gaps. A correlation analysis, the point distribution coefficient and the spatial pattern of the completeness index were employed for the {{evaluation of}} the network of observing stations. Methods for temporal and spatial estimation were applied and the results were tested. It was found that monthly data and normals could be estimated satisfactorily but that daily data could not be as adequately estimated. The results of the spatial estimation were found to be acceptable, although estimated precipitation values were usually less acceptable than estimated temperature values. The improved data base was then used to evaluate the temperature and precipitation climate of northern Saskatchewan. Several intriguing features were disclosed. For example, it was found that stations in the central portion of the study area have January extreme minima that are as much as 6 Â° C. higher than those of the stations of the southern margin of the study area. The frequency of occurrence of mean monthly temperatures proved useful in both temporal and spatial analyses. Cold and warm spells, that is, periods of consecutive days with temperatures below or above certain levels, respectively, were also examined. A noticeable pattern in the distribution of cold spells was found. The distribution shows an abrupt increase in the average number of cold spells per winter north of about 57 Â° North. Other aspects of the climate of northern Saskatchewan such as the frost-free season, growing <b>degree-days,</b> <b>heating</b> <b>degree-days,</b> wind chill and humidex were evaluated, where possible. It was found that wind chill factors at locations in the study area are less than those at Regina, the comparison station in southern Saskatchewan.

40|$|The Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris), a {{subspecies}} of the West Indian manatee, {{is one of}} {{the most}} endangered marine mammals in United States waters. The Florida manatee is the only manatee that ranges into subtropical and temperate regions. During the winter months manatees adopt a “refuging strategy” where they aggregate at warm-water sources immediately following decreases in the ambient water temperature to below 20 ° C (68 ° F) in order to avoid cold stress syndrome (CSS). During the winter manatees aggregate in warm water refuges, including natural warm water springs and the effluent discharges of power plants. The purpose of this study was to determine the number of manatees that aggregate and utilize the waters of the Florida Power and Light (FPL) Plant in Port Everglades (PPE), Florida, its effluent canal, and the surrounding Intracoastal Waterway during the winter months. This study documents the importance of Port Everglades as a wintering refuge for the Florida manatee. This study analyzed the inverse relationship between the number of manatees present at a warm water effluent and water temperature. In this study data were collected over five manatee winter seasons (between 15 November and 31 March) from 1999 - 2004, from both boat-based and land-based surveys monitoring the presence of manatees in the effluent canal from the FPL electricity generating facility in Port Everglades, FL and the Intracoastal Waterway.

40|$|By {{using data}} of daily {{electricity}} consumption and temperature for the period 2003 – 2007 in Shanghai, the variation of energy consumption and the correlations between energy consumption and temperature are analyzed. The results indicate that winter and summer are the two peak seasons of energy consumption due to the urban residential heating and cooling demand. The base temperature of electricity and daily temperature is 10 °C in winter and 22 °C in summer respectively. When the outdoor temperature is below 10 °C, the heating demand becomes obvious, and with over 22 °C the cooling demand. The spatial distribution of cooling <b>degree-days</b> (CDD) and <b>heating</b> <b>degree-days</b> (HDD) clearly shows urbanization effects. By the influence of urbanization the central city experiences greater CDD in summer and lower HDD in winter.

30|$|The {{technique}} {{we consider}} {{to capture the}} dependence of present-time Italy electricity demand on meteorological variables is that presented by Scapin et al. (Scapin et al. 2015). They model the demand of ordinary days {{by means of a}} linear regression model made up of i) a time-dependent term capturing long-term trends, ii) a term accounting for the differences among the different days of the week and iii) a set of terms depending on temperature-derived variables that can be obtained from high-resolution Tn, Tm, and Tx fields. The latter are national averages over Italian urbanised areas of cooling <b>degree-days</b> (CDD), <b>heating</b> <b>degree-days</b> (HDD) and solar radiation deficit with respect to a defined threshold (S), with solar radiation estimated using daily temperature range as a proxy. Applying this technique, Scapin et al. (Scapin et al. 2014) quantified the present-time dependence of the Italian electricity demand of an ordinary day on CDD, HDD and S in, respectively, 24.6 GWh degree-day− 1, 6.6 GWh degree-day− 1 and 2.9 GWh day− 1  MJ− 1  m 2. These values give evidence of a relevant contribution of meteorological conditions on the electricity demand, especially in the summer period: in this season, the fraction of the electricity demand driven by meteorological conditions can exceed 20  %. Temperature is indeed the most important meteorological variable influencing the electricity demand: it regulates the request for conditioning in summer and for heating in winter (Pardo et al. 2002; Moral-Carcedo & Vicéns-Otero 2005; Hor et al. 2005; Bessec & Fouquau 2008; Hekkenberg et al. 2009; Apadula et al. 2012).

The Texas Mental Health and Mental Retardation agency, {{now part of the}} Texas Health and Human Services Commission, was challenged to deal with regularly deteriorating infrastructure at twentythree large campuses located throughout the state during large statewide budget cuts in 2003. Repair and replacement funding was considerably reduced with costs amounting to more than $ 250 million. The agency therefore decided to take advantage of new state legislation passed in the prior biennium allowing state agencies to use utility savings performance contracting as a means to replace aging and inefficient equipment. In such contracts, the utility savings will pay for the more efficient equipment cost over a fifteen-year period. The utility savings are measured {{over the life of the}} contract in order to ensure the savings stream and maintain the savings guarantee. The agency chose an energy services firm specializing in performance contracting. This company uses a utility bill analysis software tool based on cooling <b>degree-days</b> and <b>heating</b> <b>degree-days.</b> To date, savings have accrued for over two years for the first phase of the project and are presented in this paper for one of the measured electric meters. This paper focuses on the on-going savings stream to demonstrate the importance of continued measurement and verification on a representative meter at the Austin State Hospital located in Austin, Texas. In this paper, the Energy Services Company (ESCO) savings results are compared to savings results calculated from a regression analysis software package using average outdoor air temperature data and actual preand post-retrofit data. The software used as the comparison calculates simple mean, two-parameter (2 P), three-parameter (3 P) change point, or fourparameter (4 P) change point models to be used as the utility baseline. To accurately account for the guaranteed savings, it is necessary to apply detailed as well as practical measurement and verification techniques.

40|$|Air {{conditioning}} of dwellings {{in developing}} countries is currently rather rare, but increasing personal income is expected to change that. This study examined the potential energy demand for cooling in the 50 most populous metropolitan areas of the world, and assessed the incremental demand {{in developing countries}} that this would create {{on top of the}} current energy demand due to heating. The analysis used local cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>degree-day</b> data. The main results are as follows: (1) Most of the largest metropolitan areas are in developing countries (38 out of 50), and most of them, in turn, are in warm to hot climates. (2) All but two of the top 30 metropolitan areas in terms of cooling degree days are in developing countries. (3) The potential cooling demands are greater than heating demands in most of the metropolitan areas that are in developing countries (24 out of 38). The main implication of these findings is that increasing personal income is likely to lead to an unprecedented increase in energy demand in many developing countries. For example, the potential cooling demand in metropolitan Mumbai is about 24 % of the demand for the entire United States. Energy demand Cooling Developing countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} new {{developments}} in the implementation of regional and federal building energy performance codes in Russia. Since mid- 2000, the number of regions with codes has more than doubled: now more than thirty regions have adopted codes and have received registration by federal officials. These regions have a collective population of more than 60 million people, and together account for some 70 percent of Russia’s new construction and renovation. Buildings built in compliance with new codes consume forty percent less energy for heating than minimally code-compliant buildings built before 1995. Almost all Russian regional codes are based on the same model code, developed by the authors and other Russian and American colleagues. The regional codes embody essentially the same energy-performance requirements, normalized per <b>degree-day</b> in the <b>heating</b> season. The regional codes do vary from each other in a number of ways, reflecting economic conditions, construction-industry particularities, and policy priorities. The onset of codes has yielded significant market transformation, as new requirements have prompted manufacturers to develop new generations of advanced walls and windows. New technologies include porous lightweight concrete for one-layer walls, porous hollow bricks, and exterior insulation. The Russian market has also been witnessing ongoing advances in fenestration, including increased use of vinyl frames and selective coatings...|$|R
40|$|The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{important}} crops that are consumed worldwide. In Colombia, the department of Boyaca is characterized as being the biggest producer of tomatoes, with production centered in the municipalities of Sutamarchan, Sachica, Santa Sofia and Villa de Leyva, where different cultivars and hybrids are produced that present different physiological behaviors, resulting in changes in conventional agronomic management. This study aimed to evaluate the growth and development of fruits from the tomato hybrid Ichiban under greenhouse conditions. This study evaluated the parameters of polar and equatorial diameters, diameter ratio, fresh mass and dry mass, and absolute and relative growth rates. The results were subjected to a descriptive analysis. Furthermore, the growth model was determined. The Ichiban hybrid had a simple sigmoid behavior, common in fleshy fruits, while the fresh mass and dry mass were fitted to a logistic, nonlinear model. Anthesis was seen at 50 days after transplant and the fruits reached physiological maturity 49 days after anthesis; during this period, 510. 2 <b>heating</b> <b>degree-days</b> were accumulated. All of the variables presented significant differences (P≤ 0. 01) and coefficients of determination above 0. 9, indicating that the models are suitable for explaining the studied biological phenomena...|$|R
40|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of building performance is essential to reduce their energy consumption and corresponding greenhouse gas emissions. <b>Heating</b> <b>degree-days</b> (HDD) encapsulates the severity and duration of cold weather, which is routinely used for weather related analysis of fuel consumption, performance benchmarking, and compliance. The accuracy of HDD-based prediction largely depends on the correct base temperature, which varies depending on building thermal characteristics, and their operation and occupancy. We analysed four years’ (2012 - 2016) half-hourly metered gas consumption from 119 non-domestic buildings representing seven types, to: (a) identify their base temperature using a three-parameter change point (3 PH) regression model, and (b) their relationships with intrinsic building parameters. The highest mean base temperature, 17. 7 °C was found for clubs and community centres, and the lowest, 12. 8 °C was for storage buildings. The average of all base temperatures is 16. 7 °C, which is 1. 2 °C higher and 1. 6 °C lower than the British (15. 5 °C) and American (18. 3 °C) standards respectively. The current practice of a fixed base temperature degree-days for all buildings {{has been found to}} be unrealistic. Building type specific base temperatures must be developed, agreed upon and published for increasing accuracy in energy analytics and legislative compliance, as well as for developing effective standards and policies...|$|R
