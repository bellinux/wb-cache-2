5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid it will <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> <b>as</b> the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

25|$|The Pacers {{duplicated}} their 52–30 {{record in}} 1995–96, but were hurt severely by {{an injury to}} Reggie Miller's eye socket in April, from which {{he was not able}} to return until Game 5 of their first-round series against the Hawks. Reggie scored 29 points in that game, but the Hawks came away with a two-point victory to put an early end to Indiana's season. This 1995–96 team did manage to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> <b>as</b> the only team to defeat the Chicago Bulls twice that year, a Bulls team which made history with a then all-time best 72–10 record. The Pacers could not withstand several key injuries in 1996–97, nor could they handle the absence of Mark Jackson, who had been traded to the Denver Nuggets before the season (though they did re-acquire Jackson at the trading deadline). The Pacers finished 39–43 and missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years, after which coach Larry Brown stepped down.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years after}} aggregation, Prime, which {{had had a}} stop/start {{approach}} to local news in Canberra, decided to take on CTC head-to-head with a one-hour local/national/international 6pm news bulletin. Prime's first attempt at news in Canberra saw the station lure CTC alumnus John Bok back from Adelaide in 1989 to produce and front a 30-minute local news bulletin. However Prime couldn't drag the audience from CTC and in April 1991 the bulletin was scaled back to a five-minute update shown {{at the end of}} Seven Nightly News from Sydney. In 1993 Prime decided to try again and a team of 26 including Ken Begg and Geoff Hiscock, both poached from CTC, were brought together to upgrade Prime's news. The now nationally known faces of Melissa Doyle and Jessica Rowe would also join Prime's news team. Meanwhile, sports presenter Greg Robson took over from Hiscock anchoring Capital Eyewitness News at CTC alongside Kininmonth and WIN maintained its half-hour local news bulletin anchored by veteran Canberra broadcaster Peter Leonard. Prime's 6 O'clock News commenced on 1 March 1993 amid a high-profile advertising campaign. For the first time since aggregation, viewers had the choice of three locally produced television 6pm news bulletins, two of which were composite local, national and international. 1993 would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> <b>as</b> the pinnacle of local TV choice for Canberra, with buses and newspapers plastered with the faces of three newsrooms. But it wasn't to last and by Christmas 1993 Prime had scaled back its one-hour composite to a half-hour local bulletin. Capital Eyewitness News prevailed as the number one news program followed by fierce rival WIN. The newscast, with the purchase of Southern Cross Broadcasting of the channel, became Ten Capital Eyewitness News in 1994, and later on as Ten News on Capital that same year, in line with the Network Ten news rebrand, moving back to 5PM after 2 years.|$|E

Manson said in a June 2015 Reddit AMA that he considered the record to be his best work, and, that same month, NME {{referred to it as}} the band's best album. A 2016 feature in Houston Press called Holy Wood [...] "the album that really cemented the band as more than just shock-rockers, but true musical mavericks with an intelligent perspective on social issues."

500|$|Schumacher and {{producer}} Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of Batman & Robin on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production. [...] "There {{was a lot}} of pressure from Warner Bros. to make Batman & Robin more family-friendly," [...] Schumacher explained. [...] "We decided to do a less depressing Batman movie and less torture and more heroic. I know I have been criticized a lot for this, but I didn't see the harm in that approach at all." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized the toyetic approach and Mr. Freeze's one-liner jokes in his two-star review of the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times believed the film [...] "killed" [...] the Batman film series, and felt Batman & Robin depended too much on visual effects. Desson Thomson of The Washington Post largely disapproved of Schumacher's direction and Akiva Goldsman's script. Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, said, [...] "George Clooney is the big zero of the film, and should <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> <b>as</b> the George Lazenby of the series." [...] However, Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave a positive review. She praised Uma Thurman's acting, as well as the production and costume design.|$|E
500|$|Writing in The New York Times, Richards Vidmer {{opened his}} account of the game as follows: [...] "The {{greatest}} naval disaster of them all took place on Ferry Field today when a hungry pack of Wolverines set upon the Navy eleven from Annapolis, snarled and snapped, chewed and clawed, and finally buried the Easterners under a defeat of 54 to 0. [...] It probably was the worst defeat the Navy ever has suffered on land or sea." [...] Vidmer added that the Michigan squad played [...] "like one big monster" [...] and opined that the team would probably <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> <b>as</b> Fielding Yost's masterpiece. [...] Writing in the Chicago Daily Tribune, James Crusinberry also employed a naval metaphor: [...] "Under a maze of forward pass plays, double passes, delayed passes, and criss-cross, Uncle Sam's proud gridiron dreadnaught, rocked by a great Michigan tidal wave, limped into port tonight on the leeward side of a 54 to 0 score." [...] Crusinberry opined that Michigan had [...] "played more new football [...] [...] [...] than any team ever did in one game" [...] and declared quarterback Benny Friedman the star of the game:"If any one man stood out, it was Benny Friedman, who hurled forward passes with accuracy and abandon time after time[...] [...] [...] Besides that, Benny was a regular whirligig in carrying the ball. [...] And it was Benny who was the field general. [...] His selections of plays was something that would make any general envious." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian and {{journalist}} Richard Gott considered Castro to be [...] "one {{of the most}} extraordinary political figures of the twentieth century", noting that he had become a [...] "world hero in the mould" [...] of Giuseppe Garibaldi to people throughout the developing world for his anti-imperialist efforts. Balfour stated that Castro's story had [...] "few parallels in contemporary history", for there existed no other [...] "Third World leader" [...] {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century who held [...] "such a prominent and restless part on the international stage" [...] or remained head of state for such a long period. Bourne described Castro as [...] "an influential world leader" [...] who commanded [...] "great respect" [...] from individuals of all political ideologies across the developing world. Russian President Vladimir Putin described Castro as both [...] "a sincere and reliable friend of Russia" [...] and a [...] "symbol of an era", while Chinese Premier Xi Jinping similarly referred to him as [...] "a close comrade and a sincere friend" [...] to China. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed him [...] "one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century" [...] and a [...] "great friend", while South African President Jacob Zuma praised Castro for aiding black South Africans in [...] "our struggle against apartheid". He was awarded a wide variety of awards and honors from foreign governments, and was cited as an inspiration for foreign leaders like Ahmed Ben Bella, and Nelson Mandela, who subsequently awarded him South Africa's highest civilian award for foreigners, the Order of Good Hope.

500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> <b>as</b> probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be with my friends. Out of everything in this whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} of the Saturn is mixed, but generally praises its game library.

[...] In 2009, IGN chose the Saturn to be their 18th best video game console of all time, praising its unique game library. According to the reviewers, [...] "While the Saturn ended up losing the popularity contest to both Sony and Nintendo... Nights into Dreams, the Virtua Fighter and Panzer Dragoon series are all examples of exclusive titles that made the console a fan favorite." [...] The staff of Edge noted [...] "hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like Burning Rangers, Guardian Heroes, Dragon Force and Panzer Dragoon Saga." [...] In 2015, The Guardians Keith Stuart declared [...] "the Saturn has perhaps the strongest line up of 2D shooters and fighting games in console history." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran stated [...] "Even today, despite the widespread availability of sequels and re-releases on other formats, the Sega Saturn is still a worthwhile investment for those who appreciate the unique gameplay styles of the companies that supported it." [...] IGN's Adam Redsell wrote [...] " [...] devil-may-care attitude towards game development in the Saturn and Dreamcast eras is something that we simply do not see outside of the indie scene today." [...] Necrosoft Games director Brandon Sheffield expounded that [...] "The Saturn was a landing point for games that were too 'adult' in content for other systems, as it {{was the only one that}} allowed an 18+ rating for content in Japan... some games, like Enemy Zero used it to take body horror to new levels, an important step toward the expansion of games and who they served." [...] Sewart praised the Saturn's first-party titles as [...] "Sega's shining moment as a game developer", with Sonic Team demonstrating its creative range and AM2 producing numerous technically impressive arcade ports, but also commented on the many Japan-exclusive Saturn releases, which he connected with a subsequent boom in the game import market. IGN's Travis Fahs was critical of the Saturn library's lack of [...] "fresh ideas" [...] and [...] "precious few high-profile franchises", in contrast to what he described as Sega's more creative Dreamcast output.|$|E
