40|$|The {{effect of}} changes in {{carbohydrate}} status on the synthesis of specific proteins was investigated in millet (Pennisetum americanum L., Leeke, Tift 23 B 1 E 1) seedlings grown in sterile solution culture. Carbohydrate status was altered by extended darkness and sucrose feeding. Root proteins from intact seedlings were labeled with [35 S]methionine, phenol-extracted, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. In four separate experiments, two proteins showed a consistent change in labeling when root carbohydrate levels were varied between 200 and 1000 micromole hexose per gram residual <b>dry</b> weight. <b>Labeling</b> of the first protein (P 47, Mr 47 kD) increased as the carbohydrate levels rose above 500 micromole hexose per gram residual <b>dry</b> weight. <b>Labeling</b> of the second protein (P 34, Mr 34 kD) increased as carbohydrate levels declined from 500 to 200 micromole hexose per gram residual dry weight. Under extreme conditions, when carbohydrate levels fell below 100 micromole hexose per gram residual <b>dry</b> weight, the <b>labeling</b> pattern of most proteins was drastically altered. It is suggested that P 47 and P 34 are `carbohydrate responsive proteins,' i. e. proteins whose concentrations are controlled {{either directly or indirectly}} by tissue carbohydrate status. In contrast, the changes in protein labeling that occur once carbohydrate pools are depleted may be involved in adaptation to periods of prolonged starvation...|$|R

40|$|Cities {{are usually}} {{considered}} unnatural places lacking ecological benefits. Many ecological {{studies have been}} done in suburban or rural areas and have excluded the city. However, urban ecology has become increasingly important. Today, {{it is well known that}} rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation accompanied by insufficient infrastructure has resulted in the degradation of many forests and grasslands in metropolitan areas. Land use changes due to urbanisation during the second half of the 20 th century have caused widespread decline of biodiversity of many animal and plant taxa, especially in densely populated regions such as Kadıköy district, Istanbul, Turkey. In this study, different kinds of urban habitats within the boundaries of Kadıköy are described. Plant samples were collected, <b>dried,</b> <b>labelled</b> and identified according to standard herbarium procedures and all the greenery in the district was explored during vegetation seasons. A total of 561 vascular plant taxa were determined, wherein 412 (337 species, 44 subspecies and 31 varieties) were native and 149 (143 species and 6 varieties) were exotic and cultivated. The major native taxa were Asteraceae (46 species) while Rosaceae had the most exotics (22 species). Archaeophytes and neophytes, endemics, rare, endangered, medicinal, and poisonous species are also reported. In addition, the requirements of making ecological studies in other urban areas are mentioned...|$|R

We used NSOM to image fluorescently labeled plasma membranes of fixed human skin fibroblasts, either dried or in buffer. A patchy distribution of a fluorescent lipid analog suggestive of lipid domains was observed in the fixed, dried cells. The sizes of these patches were consistent with the sizes of domains implied by fluorescence photobleaching recovery measurements. Patches of fluorescent lipid analog were not spatially correlated with patches of transmembrane proteins, HLA class I molecules labeled with fluorescent antibody; the patchiness of the HLA class I molecules was on a smaller scale and was not localized to the same regions of membrane as the lipid analog. Sizes of HLA patches were deduced from a two-dimensional spatial autocorrelation analysis of NSOM images that resolved patches with radii of approximately 70 and approximately 600 nm on fixed, <b>dried</b> cells <b>labeled</b> with IgG and 300 - 600 nm on cells labeled with Fab and imaged in buffer.

No one seemed forgotten--villagers, children, servants, friends. Some of these tokens are before me still.
