50|$|Starting a {{continuous}} casting machine involves placing a <b>dummy</b> <b>bar</b> (essentially a curved metal beam) up through the spray chamber to close off {{the base of the}} mould. Metal is poured into the mould and withdrawn with the <b>dummy</b> <b>bar</b> once it solidifies. It is extremely important that the metal supply afterwards be guaranteed to avoid unnecessary shutdowns and restarts, known as 'turnarounds'. Each time the caster stops and restarts, a new tundish is required, as any uncast metal in the tundish cannot be drained and instead freezes into a 'skull'. Avoiding turnarounds requires the meltshop, including ladle furnaces (if any) to keep tight control on the temperature of the metal, which can vary dramatically with alloying additions, slag cover and deslagging, and the preheating of the ladle before it accepts metal, among other parameters. However, the cast rate may be lowered by reducing the amount of metal in the tundish (although this can increase wear on the tundish), or if the caster has multiple strands, one or more strands may be shut down to accommodate upstream delays. Turnarounds may be scheduled into a production sequence if the tundish temperature becomes too high after a certain number of heats or the service lifetime of a non-replaceable component (i.e., the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) in a thin-slab casting machine) is reached.|$|E
50|$|The starter bar, {{also called}} a <b>dummy</b> <b>bar,</b> has a free end portion which is {{flexible}} for storage and a substantially rigid portion {{at the end}} which plugs the mold. The starter bar is constructed in discrete blocks secured {{to one side of}} a planar spine provided in segments and arranged end to end. Adjustable spacers in the form of tapered blocks are disposed between the blocks of the bar to allow the starter bar to be self-supporting in a curved configuration corresponding to the casting path. A more flexible spine in the end portion of the starter bar allows the starter bar to be curved to a tighter radius than that of the casting path while the blocks fan out in an unsupported configuration. A storage ramp is provided to support the flexible end in the stored position. Before a cast is started, the starter bars are fed through the caster (in reverse direction of casting) using hydraulic actuators. Once fed {{all the way to the}} bottom of the mold, the process of packing the mold can continue to ensure a smooth start up.|$|E
40|$|A silicon {{substrate}} with {{the dimensions of}} 100 × 140 × 0. 3 [*]mm was grown directly from liquid silicon with gas pressure. The silicon melt in the sealed melting part was injected into the growth part at applied pressure of 780 – 850 Torr. The solidified {{silicon substrate}} was then transferred by {{the pull of the}} cooled <b>dummy</b> <b>bar.</b> A desirable structure with a liquid-solid interface perpendicular to the pulling direction was formed when the mold temperature in the solidification zone of the growth part was much higher than that of the <b>dummy</b> <b>bar,</b> as this technique should be able to overcome thermal loss through the molds and the limited heat flux derived from the very narrow contact area between the silicon melt and the <b>dummy</b> <b>bar.</b> In addition, because the metallic impurities and expansion of volume during solidification are preferably moved to a liquid phase, a high-quality silicon substrate, without defects such as cracks and impurities in the substrate, could be manufactured in the interface structure. The present study reports the experimental findings on a new and direct growth system for obtaining silicon substrates characterized by high quality and productivity, as a candidate for alternate routes for the fabrication of silicon substrates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For thick resist implant layers, {{such as a}} {{high voltage}} P well and a deep N well, {{systematic}} and uncor-rectable overlay residues {{brought about by the}} tapered resist profiles were found. It was found that the tapered profile is closely related to the pattern density. Potential solutions of the manufacturing problem include hardening the film solidness or balancing the exposure density. In this paper, instead of focusing on the process change methodology, we intend to solve the issue of the overlay metrology error {{from the perspective of the}} overlay mark design. Based on the comparison of the overlay performances between the proposed overlay mark and the original design, it is shown that the optimized overlay mark target achieves better performance in terms of profiles, dynamic precision, tool induced shift (TIS), and residues. Furthermore, five types of overlay marks with <b>dummy</b> <b>bars</b> are studied, and a recommendation for the overlay marks is given. Key words: overlay metrology error; dynamic precision; tool induced shift; statistical process control; depth of focus; exposure latitude DOI: 10. 1088 / 1674 - 4926 / 30 / 6 / 066002 EEACC: 2550 G 1...|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} badges on each level; the silver GTO badge {{and the golden}} GTO badge, awarded to those who passed all the tests, {{fulfilling}} the respective norms. On the fourth level, [...] "Physical perfection", {{there was also a}} special GTO With Honours golden badge, awarded to those, who fulfilled all norms required for the golden badge of the fourth level and was the First Class Sportsman in one sports discipline or the Second-Class Sportsman in two disciplines. Among the tests were running (100m, 1000m, 3000m), long jump, high jump, pull-ups, rising up with a turn on the high <b>bar,</b> <b>dummy</b> grenade throwing, cross-country skiing (5 km or 10 km; or 5 km running in southern regions), 50m small bore rifle shooting, swimming (100m with time, or 200m without time).|$|R
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Stephen" [...] was {{directed}} by the production team Skinny. The video was released on the deluxe repacking of her debut album Animal, under its re-release entitled Animal + Cannibal. It was later uploaded to the singer's Vevo account on April 4, 2011. The video is composed of still shots that show the singer [...] "going to some extreme lengths to show 'Stephen' how much she's feeling him." [...] The video opens with the singer looking through a scrapbook; following this the video then proceeds into depicting the singer's interactions with the protagonist. The video's first setting is located at a bar where the singer gets into a verbal altercation with the man's girlfriend. Kesha, who later leaves with the then unconscious man, takes him back to her house to takes pictures of him and later cuts off some of his hair for her shrine. The singer then duct-tapes the man and locks him in her closet; which he later escapes from. Following this, the singer is distraught and then builds another man out of a dummy, and using the hair she had clipped earlier, proceeds to bring the <b>dummy</b> to a <b>bar,</b> getting into another altercation with it and later leaving it in the street – ending the video.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} produce AZ 91 and AZ 31 {{magnesium}} alloy billets semisolid continuous casting by using an inclined cooling plate was carried out. The molten magnesium alloy in an electric furnace was flowed on the inclined cooling plate and then poured in a tundish. The slurry prepared using this process was solidified by drawing a <b>dummy</b> <b>bar</b> from a water-cooled copper mold, consequently producing a billet. As a result, we could produce the magnesium alloy billets by semisolid continuous casting. Magnesium alloy billets with refined and globular primary α crystals were successfully and continuously cast by optimizing the solidification conditions. In this case, the grain size of AZ 91 billets was about 55 μm and that of AZ 31 billets was 50 μm. The AZ 91 billets produced by semisolid continuous casting were employed in thixocasting experiments. The experiments revealed that thixocasting could produce the mobile phone casings with spherical primary α crystals at 858 K. Moreover, we proved that the difference of shot cycle did not influence the microstructures for up to 251 shots...|$|E
