Different domestic and wild animal species are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs worldwide. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of the infection, {{it is likely that}} essentially all animals are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs, and that co-evolution of TTVs with their hosts probably occurred. Although TTVs are potentially related to many diseases, the evidence of the widespread infection in healthy human and nonhuman hosts raised doubts about their pathogenic potential. Nonetheless, their role as superimposed agents of other diseases or as triggers for impairment of immune surveillance is currently under debate. The possible contribution of animal TT viruses to interspecies transmission and their role as zoonotic agents are currently topics of discussion...|$|R
40|$|Four Xanthomonas {{species are}} known to cause {{bacterial}} spot of tomato and pepper, but the global distribution and genetic diversity of these species are not well understood. A collection of bacterial spot-causing strains from the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia, and New Zealand were characterized for genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships using multilocus sequence analysis of six housekeeping genes. By examining strains from different continents, we found unexpected phylogeographic patterns, including the global distribution of a single multilocus haplotype of X. gardneri, possible regional differentiation in X. vesicatoria, and high species diversity on tomato in Africa. In addition, we found evidence of multiple recombination events between X. euvesicatoria and X. perforans. Our results indicate {{that there have been}} shifts in the species composition of bacterial spot pathogen populations <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of dominant genotypes and that recombination between species has generated genetic diversity in these populations.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of communication technology <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> {{of the internet}} and the digital information revolution has given rise to a huge increase in the use and transmission of multimedia information. Encryption technology is studied in this paper, and a new image encryption algorithm based on correlation of pixels is proposed. The main goal of this paper is security management. Researchers have proposed incompatible methods to encrypt images. So, here we go through a new way of image encryption and decryption using block based image encryption using affine transform. First of all the plain image is divided into fixed size blocks. All these blocks then shuffled according to the proposed algorithm and we get a block shuffled image. At last the encrypted algorithm of affine is used iteratively for each of the pixels. It uses the keys for the purpose of encryption...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) has represented a serious public health issue, mainly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of the hypervirulent strain NAP 1 / 027 /BI. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to evaluate the utility of a PCR coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) commercial assay for the detection of C. difficile virulence markers. Non-duplicative C. difficile isolates from patients with CDI diagnosed in a tertiary level hospital from Bucharest were tested for toxin A, toxin B, binary toxin genes and deletion in tcdC gene using PCR/capillary gel electrophoresis and PCR/ESI-MS. The study analysed 45 non-duplicative isolates, 33 strains (73. 3 %) belonging to ribotype 027. The concordance between PCR/capillary gel electrophoresis and PCR/ESI-MS was 100 % for toxin A gene, 97. 8 % for toxin B gene, 91. 1 % for binary toxin subunit A gene and 95. 6 % for binary toxin subunit B gene. The general concordance for the complete panel of markers was 88. 9 % but was 100 % for ribotype 027 isolates. PCR/ESI-MS might be a valid method for the detection of C. difficile virulence markers, including binary toxin...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the results of}} a molecular epidemiological survey of 15 carbapenemase-encoding genes from a recent collection of clinical isolates fromMercy Hospital in Bo, Sierra Leone. The most salient findings revealed that (i) 60 % of the isolates harbored multiple carbapenemase genes; (ii) the blaDIM- 1 gene, which has previously only been reported in The Netherlands, is also circu-lating in this environment; and (iii) blaOXA- 51 -like and blaOXA- 58 genes, which were thought to reside exclusively in Acinetobacter species, can also be found in members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Carbapenem antibiotics are currently themost potent-lactamantibiotics clinically available and are used as a last resort to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The significance and usage of this family of antibiotics have risen dramatically over the last decade, especially in hospital settings, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> and increasing prevalence of bacterial pathogens that harbor extended-spectrum -lactamase genes that confer resistance to all -lactam compounds except for carbapenems (1). Not surprisingly, the positive selection pressure provided by the increased usage of carbapenems has resulted in the emergence and expansion of carbapenem resistance in a num...|$|R
50|$|Human {{mortality}} from H5N1 or {{the human}} fatality ratio from H5N1 or the case-fatality rate of H5N1 {{refer to the}} ratio of the number of confirmed human deaths resulting from confirmed cases of transmission and infection of H5N1 to the number of those confirmed cases. For example, if there are 100 confirmed cases of humans infected with H5N1 and 10 die, then there is a 10% human fatality ratio (or mortality rate). H5N1 flu is a concern <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of H5N1 that constitutes a pandemic threat. The majority of H5N1 flu cases have been reported in southeast and east Asia. The case-fatality rate is central to pandemic planning. While estimates of case-fatality (CF) rates for past influenza pandemics have ranged from about 0.1% (1957 and 1968 pandemics) to 2.5% (1918 pandemic); the official World Health Organization estimate for the current outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza to date is around 60%. While the real H5N1 CF rate (what it would be if we had perfect knowledge) could be lower (one study suggests that the real H5N1 CF rate is closer to 14-33%); it is unlikely that, if it becomes a pandemic, it will go to the 0.1-0.4% level currently embraced by many pandemic plans.|$|R
40|$|Influenza A and B viruses {{are highly}} {{contagious}} respiratory pathogens with a considerable medical and socioeconomical burden and known pandemic potential. Current influenza vaccines require annual updating and provide only partial protection in some risk groups. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of viruses with {{resistance to the}} M 2 proton channel inhibitor amantadine or the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, novel antiviral agents with an original mode of action are urgently needed. We here focus on emerging options {{to interfere with the}} influenza virus entry process, which consists of the following steps: attachment of the viral hemagglutinin to the sialylated host cell receptors, endocytosis, M 2 -mediated uncoating, low pH-induced membrane fusion, and, finally, import of the viral ribonucleoprotein into the nucleus. We review the current functional and structural insights in the viral and cellular components of this entry process, and the diverse antiviral strategies that are being explored. This encompasses small molecule inhibitors as well as macromolecules such as therapeutic antibodies. There is optimism {{that at least some of}} these innovative concepts to block influenza virus entry will proceed from the proof of concept to a more advanced stage. Special attention is therefore given to the challenging issues of influenza virus (sub) type-dependent activity or potential drug resistance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The charismatic and {{controversial}} Indian guru Sathya Sai Baba is {{the centre of}} attention and devotion for {{a great number of}} adherents from various national, religious, and ethnic backgrounds. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> its <b>global</b> <b>spread,</b> the Sathya Sai Baba movement is an ideal case for examining displaced religious practices. Singing is {{a vital part of the}} religious practice of Sai devotees. In this article I will discuss the contents and usage of the songbook that Swiss devotees compiled. We can observe the extent to which Indian contents are carried over and how they are supplemented with Swiss songs, but also with songs perceived as being part of a universal spiritual treasury of songs (e. g. Native American, Hebrew or International Christian songs). I will suggest that the concept of de- and reterritorialization helps us to analyze the practices of this global religious community. Additionally, I will argue that the devotees’ choice of songs and their singing practices are indeed a manifestation of their claim to universalism as well as their need to be rooted locally. I will further argue that a globalized religious movement is limited in dealing with the encounter of diverse cultural contents by the strategy of reterritorialization, but beyond that creates a new and supraterritorial cultural context...|$|R

40|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of multidrug {{resistant}} pathogenic bacteria, {{alternative approaches}} in combating infectious diseases are required. One such {{approach is the}} use of probiotics. Lactobacillus fermentum 3872 is a promising probiotic bacterium producing a range of antimicrobial compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid. In addition, previous studies involving genome sequencing and analysis of L. fermentum 3872 allowed the identification of a gene encoding a cell surface protein referred to as collagen binding protein (CBP) (not found in other strains of the species, according to the GenBank database), consisting of a C-terminal cell wall anchor domain (LPXT), multiple repeats of ‘B domains' that form stalks presenting an “A domain” required for adhesion. In this study, we found that the CBP of L. fermentum 3872 binds to collagen I present {{on the surface of the}} epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, we found that this host receptor is also used for attachment by the major gastrointestinal pathogen, Campylobacter jejuni. Furthermore, we identified an adhesin involved in such interaction and demonstrated that both L. fermentum 3872 and its CBP can inhibit binding of this pathogen to collagen I. Combined with the observation that C. jejuni growth is affected in the acidic environment produced by L. fermentum 3872, the finding provides a good basis for further investigation of this strain as a potential tool for fighting Campylobacter infections...|$|R

40|$|The English {{language}} is changing <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of the language, {{and it is}} now used in culturally determined local contexts with culturally specific meanings (Kachru, 1991). The local contexts of English use also influence <b>global</b> communication. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> these simultaneously <b>global</b> and local phenomena, or “glocalization” (Robertson, 1997), the needs of English language learners in Japan also diversify. In Japan, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) regulates education and authorizes textbooks used in schools. Since English is not an official language in Japan, textbooks can be the main source of learners’ input of the language, and therefore, may have the power to disseminate certain ideologies of the language and construct learners’ “realities” of their learning (e. g. Matsuda, 2012; Tajima, 2011). This dissertation research examines {{the extent to which the}} diversifying needs of learners are addressed in the curriculum guidelines of MEXT generally, and in English language textbooks used at junior high schools more specifically. My research questions address the power of textbook discourses and their possible influence on how learners speak and behave (Gee, 2005). Using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) (Fairclough, 1995), I investigate more deeply how textbook discourses may be constructing learners’ realities and constitutive of those realities. This study reveals that the English {{language is}} often represented in textbooks as being owned by native speakers particularly from the United States, Canada, or Australia. Thus, the language is presented as independent of Japanese social and cultural influences. This conforms to MEXT discourses of English as a “foreign” language and seemingly denies the ownership of the language and the linguistic identity by learners in Japan. These representations may be perceived as static realities by learners despite the varied uses of English in the world today and the ongoing changes and hybridization of languages and cultures. When learners accept the essentialized realities made available in textbooks and act accordingly, the realities of the discourses surrounding English language learning can be intensified and reproduced through classroom practices and the learners’ conforming behaviours, thereby being stabilized by the learners’ own participation in the discourses...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: ICT {{supported}} {{learning has}} come {{more and more}} in focus during the last two decades. The wide spread introduction during 1993 of the World Wide Web (WWW) was a catalyst for deepened interest and extended implementation of learning and knowledge transfer systems. It is a well-documented (unfortunately) truth that the development within didactics has been very gentle during the latest centuries. Lately the development has taken a quantum leap <b>due</b> <b>to</b> standardization and <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of the Internet based applications and communication support. We are in fact right now {{in the middle of an}} intense development phase where creative ideas on ICT tools and tools to design tools (meta tools) as well as new organization of the learning environment and enhanced pedagogical methods are tried out. This summer (2004) the ITcon Journal publishes a special issue on ICT supported learning. The special issue focuses on both practical and theoretical aspects of learning and knowledge transfer with special emphasis on experiences and future developments within the area. The issue reports experiences mostly from the AEC domain, but with findings and research results that are valid outside this area. This editorial paper elaborates on properties of virtual learning spaces and ICT tools to support teaching, learning, and (meta) information handling taking into account improvement of learning styles, course content and learning material. Experiences from many years involvement in ICT supported learning and development of ICT in construction courses are reported with particular emphasis on the Aalborg University Project Oriented Problem Based, PPBL, learning model. Finally the six papers of the special ITcon edition on distributed learning are summarized...|$|R
