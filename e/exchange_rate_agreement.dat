The analysis indicates that a credible fixed peg has {{a positive impact on}} the value of bilateral trade. Moreover, the positive impact on trade is more pronounced with a stricter definition of the fixed peg or a longer duration of the peg. This supports the argument that the credibility of an <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> peg is an important element to determine bilateral trade.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the linkages between {{the credibility of}} a target zone regime, the volatility of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> and {{the width of the}} band where the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is allowed to fluctuate. These three concepts should be related since the band width induces a trade-off between credibility and volatility. Narrower bands give less scope for the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> to fluctuate but may make agents perceive a larger probability of realignment which by itself increases the volatility of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> We build a model where this trade-off is made explicit. The model is used to understand the reduction in volatility experienced by most EMS currencies after their target zones were widened on August 1993.

Contrary to BE’s premise, relaxing the assumption of shocks of equal size {{is not just a matter}} of scale. The empirical properties of the exchange regime are modified, especially as regards the correlation of shocks. Given the VAR setting used in the related studies, it is also established that zero-constraints on either instantaneous or long-run impulse responses provide identical results.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{adequacy}} of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime of 16 African countries that are pegged to the euro since 1999. The evaluation is based on three key criteria borrowed from the optimal currency area literature. A first conclusion is that the peg to the euro has granted the 16 countries a good inflation performance. However, with the clear exception of Cape Verde, the peg is not supported by the other economic requirements, namely trade integration and synchronisation of business cycles. We also assess whether the US dollar would be a better currency to anchor. Since the results are ambiguous, pegging to the euro seems to be a better alternative as these countries benefit from established <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> cooperation <b>agreements.</b> Given that most of the countries in the sample are historically grouped together in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) or the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CAEMC), the paper further assesses whether the grouping of countries in these two CFA monetary unions receives economic support. The conclusion is that the composition of CAEMC does not conform to basic requirements. In contrast, for a wide group of WAEMU countries there is room for sharing a common monetary policy.

The over-valued dollar is also causing long term damage by eroding manufacturing which is a key engine of productivity growth. This augurs for lower future growth and living standards. U. S. policymakers must abandon the rhetoric of a “strong ” dollar, a rhetoric which sends misleading signals to foreign exchange markets. The Federal Reserve must work with its foreign counter-part central banks to lower {{the value of the}} dollar. China’s currency is under-valued and must be revalued upward, and Japan must cease using yen devaluation to try and escape its domestic recession. Longer term, there is need for a system of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> management that prevents future damaging misalignments of <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> Finally, trade <b>agreements</b> must have <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> provisions that guard against sudden currency movements which swamp agreed tariff reductions...|$|R

It is argued that deficiencies in the education system, and preferences of individuals and politicians are responsible for the persistence of poor institutional arrangements. External factors such as real and financial openness, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> and international <b>agreements</b> have provided a disciplining effect for policy makers to improve institutional arrangements in Central Asia, despite poor initial conditions.

40|$|Using recent {{advances}} in the classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, this paper finds no support for the popular bipolar view that countries will tend over time {{to move to the}} polar extremes of free float or rigid peg. Rather, intermediate regimes have shown remarkable durability. The analysis suggests that as economies mature, the value of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes. For developed countries that are not in a currency union, relatively flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes appear to offer higher growth without any cost in credibility. <b>Exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes;Economic conditions;exchange <b>rate,</b> inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility, inflation performance, terms of trade, foreign exchange, lower inflation, monetary policy, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, macroeconomic performance, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation targeting, money growth, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> high inflation, annual inflation, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, dual <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime classification, inflation <b>rates,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> foreign currency, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy, <b>exchange</b> arrangements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> rigidity, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pegs, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, terms of trade shocks, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> currency unions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, rigid <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> reserves, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, market <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variability, multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> inflationary expectations, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, <b>exchange</b> reserves, money supply, classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> natural <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> rate of inflation, real interest <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, currency values, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> change, post-crisis period, currency boards, official <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, variable inflation, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, average inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> stability, monetary economics, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, stable <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> black market, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> price inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> behavior, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> band, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, currency areas, currency convertibility, effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> low inflation, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> path, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, inflation growth, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime classifications, macroeconomic stability, explicit <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> controls, inflation target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> choice, freely floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real rates, independent central bank, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> unification, average inflation <b>rate,</b> intermediate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> annual inflation <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangement, bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> history of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> information, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee, real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> crises, basket of currencies, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> choices...|$|R
