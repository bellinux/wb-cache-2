She claims {{to have been a}} member of the Russian {{aristocracy}} before the Russian Rebellion and suffered greatly as a result, but <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> story is true is an open question. Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life. Poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justice.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} the subsidy given to a family {{to cover the cost}} of a premium is {{calculated}} using a formula that includes the family's income relative to the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is related to a determined percentage that defines <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health insurance premiums and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.|$|E

500|$|Jason Rohrer was {{inspired}} by German-style board games to build a turn-based strategy game. He wanted to harness the unique qualities that a video game could bring to a board game, and so focused {{on their ability to}} deliver different views of the board to each player. He wanted to create a game which explored [...] "knowledge chains", where the player must not only be aware of his knowledge and movements on the board, but also <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> has been exposed to the opponent. In March 2009, he was invited by publisher Majesco Entertainment to pitch an idea for a Nintendo DS game, and keeping these mechanics in mind, he pitched a game called Deception. In Deception, two players would play one half of a married couple, with the aim to gather as much damaging evidence regarding their spouse's infidelities as ammunition for a forthcoming divorce case. Majesco rejected this concept as being [...] "too sensitive a subject for the DS market".|$|E
500|$|One of the family's keenest {{customers}} was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, {{a wealthy}} collector from Lincolnshire, who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became {{disturbed by the}} family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, {{they were at the}} point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf. He wrote to the palaeontologist Gideon Mantell on 5 March that year to say that the sale was [...] "for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost all the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what I am about to part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied." [...] The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised £400 (worth the equivalent of over £26,000 in 2010). <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.|$|E
2500|$|Heritability {{is defined}} as the {{proportion}} of variance in a trait which is attributable to genotype within a defined population in a specific environment. A number of points must be considered when interpreting heritability. [...] Heritability, as a term, applies to populations, and in populations there are variations in traits between individuals. [...] Heritability measures <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> variation is caused by genetics. [...] The value of heritability can change if the impact of environment (or of genes) in the population is substantially altered. A high heritability of a trait does not mean environmental effects, such as learning, are not involved. Since heritability increases during childhood and adolescence, one should be cautious drawing conclusions regarding the role of genetics and environment from studies where the participants are not followed until they are adults.|$|E

Flickering, unquiet lights, are {{sometimes}} pleasing--to children and idiots always so--but in the embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth, even strong steady lights are inadmissible.

60|$|There {{was now a}} great {{confusion}} in the cabin. Knowing that she must really leave, Mrs. Morris set to work to gather her most precious things into several bundles which might be carried on horseback. As well as he was able Rodney helped her, and little Nell also took a hand, bound to save the few precious toys she possessed, including the doll White Buffalo had made for her. It made the good woman's heart ache sorely when she realized how little could be carried and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> all <b>that</b> was dear to her must be left behind for the Indians to burn or plunder.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, {{the word}} [...] "deficiency" [...] {{has more than}} one {{technical}} meaning under the Internal Revenue Code: one kind of [...] "deficiency" [...] for purposes of [...] relating to statutory notices of deficiency, U.S. Tax Court cases, etc. (meaning, usually, the excess of the amount that the IRS claims is the correct tax over the amount the taxpayer claims is the correct tax—both computed without regard to <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> tax has been paid) as opposed to another kind of [...] "deficiency" [...] for purposes of the case law under the tax evasion and other criminal statutes (meaning, essentially, the amount of unpaid tax actually owed). Tax law, like other areas of law, is replete with words like [...] "voluntary," [...] "assessment," [...] and [...] "deficiency" [...] that have varying meanings depending on the varying legal contexts in which those terms are used.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} varies {{greatly in}} length from piece to piece {{and from time}} period to time period, sometimes being relatively short compared to the exposition (e.g., the first movement of Eine kleine Nachtmusik) and in other cases quite long and detailed (e.g., the first movement of the [...] "Eroica" [...] Symphony). Developments in the Classical era are typically shorter due to <b>how</b> <b>much</b> composers <b>of</b> <b>that</b> era valued symmetry, unlike the more expressive Romantic era in which development sections gain a much greater importance. However, it almost always shows {{a greater degree of}} tonal, harmonic, and rhythmic instability than the other sections.

60|$|Pierston {{shook his}} head. It then {{occurred}} to him that never since the reappearance of Marcia had he seen her in full daylight, or without a bonnet and thick veil, which she always retained on these frequent visits, and that he had been unconsciously regarding her as the Marcia of their early time, a fancy which the small change in her voice well sustained. The stately figure, the good colour, the classical profile, the rather large handsome nose and somewhat prominent, regular teeth, the full dark eye, formed still the Marcia of his imagination; the queenly creature who had infatuated him when the first Avice was despised and her successors unknown. It was this old idea which, in his revolt from beauty, had led to his regret at her assumed handsomeness. He began wondering now <b>how</b> <b>much</b> remained <b>of</b> <b>that</b> presentation after forty years.|$|R

30|$|It is {{particularly}} important for the mitigation of earthquake hazards to understand why such a great earthquake as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake with magnitude 9.0 did occur along the plate boundary east off northeastern Japan, since the occurrence of a M 9 class earthquake there was not predicted in the long-term evaluation of earthquake occurrence in Japan by the Japanese government (Earthquake Research Committee, Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion, [URL] Stress acting on the plate boundary which caused this earthquake is one of basic information for this purpose. It {{is important to know}} how large the shear stress is to cause earthquake rupture and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>that</b> stress is released by it. Of particular interest is whether the shear stress is nearly completely released by such a great earthquake which ruptured a half or two thirds of the entire main thrust zone east of northeastern Japan at once. However, estimation of magnitude of the shear stress acting on faults at depths prior to large earthquakes remains the subject of controversy.|$|R

40|$|Where {{the dust}} in a protoplanetary disk is as the disk evolves over time is {{essential}} to know for further studies of the planet formation process. A new star is created alongside a stellar nebula. The nebula contains rock, ice and gas which are not accreted to the star. Our nebula is constructed using the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula model and the column density is studied as the protoplanetary disk evolves over time. The Minimum Mass Solar Nebula model takes the mass of dust from the planets we see today {{in our solar system}} and spreads it out between the planets. To estimate the gas column density, simply multiply by about a hundred. The dust in a protoplanetary disk will feel a head wind from the more slowly orbiting gas and start to drift towards the star. The ice particles sublime inside 2. 7 AU as the temperature rises. A computer model is used here to simulate the changes in the column density over time. Micron-sized particles are simulated as they grow and drift towards the star. The ice-line at 2. 7 AU results in a slight buildup of dust inside this radius. When a pebble grows it is due to <b>how</b> <b>much</b> dust it collides with and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it <b>that</b> stick...|$|R
