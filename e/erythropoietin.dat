5|$|In April 2009, it was {{announced}} that Rebellin had tested positive for Continuous <b>erythropoietin</b> receptor activator (CERA, a third-generation form of <b>erythropoietin)</b> during the Olympics. After his B-sample subsequently confirmed initial results, he returned his medal and repaid the prize money he had won from the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) while still maintaining his innocence. Cancellara and original fourth-place finisher Alexandr Kolobnev were later awarded new medals corresponding to their updated finishing positions.|$|E
5|$|Inhaling a xenon/oxygen mixture {{activates}} {{production of}} the transcription factor HIF-1-alpha, which may lead to increased production of <b>erythropoietin.</b> The latter hormone is known to increase red blood cell production and athletic performance. Reportedly, doping with xenon inhalation {{has been used in}} Russia since 2004 and perhaps earlier. On August 31, 2014, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) added xenon (and argon) to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although no reliable doping tests for these gases have yet been developed. In addition, effects of xenon on <b>erythropoietin</b> production in humans have not been demonstrated, so far.|$|E
5|$|Mayo and Piepoli {{would both}} test {{positive}} for <b>erythropoietin</b> later {{in their careers}} at the Tour de France, and Di Luca likewise at the 2009 Giro d'Italia, all leading to lengthy suspensions, while Petacchi made a successful return to top-level cycling and to the Giro in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The chronically low oxygen {{levels in}} the blood also lead to {{increased}} release of <b>erythropoietin</b> and the activation of erythropoeisis, the production of red blood cells. This results in polycythemia, abnormally increased numbers of circulating red blood cells and an elevated hematocrit.|$|E
5|$|F. On November 18, 2009, the IOC {{announced}} that Rashid Ramzi of Bahrain {{had been stripped}} of {{the gold medal in}} the men's 1500 m race. Ramzi had been the first athlete from Bahrain to win an Olympic gold medal. His frozen blood sample was re-tested and found to contain traces of Continuous <b>erythropoietin</b> receptor activator (CERA), a stamina-building blood-booster. Kenyan Asbel Kipruto Kiprop was upgraded to gold, Nicholas Willis of New Zealand was given the silver and Mehdi Baala of France received the bronze.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin became {{notable for}} a scandal {{involving}} the emerging trend of blood doping, {{the use of}} blood transfusions or synthetic hormones such as <b>Erythropoietin</b> (EPO) to improve oxygen flow and thus reduce fatigue. The Italian police conducted a raid on the Austrian cross-country ski team's residence during the Games where they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment. This event followed the pre-Olympics suspension of 12 cross-country skiers who tested positive for unusually high levels of haemoglobin, which is evidence of blood doping.|$|E
5|$|American Greg LeMond {{became the}} first non-European to win the Tour in 1986. LeMond missed out in 1987 and 1988, but {{returned}} in 1989 to win the Tour by finishing eight seconds ahead of Laurent Fignon, the smallest winning margin in the Tour's history. LeMond also won in 1990. In 1991, Spaniard Miguel Indurain won his first Tour. Indurain came to dominate the Tour, winning four more Tours consecutively—making him {{the first person to}} win five consecutive Tours. He tried to win a record-high sixth Tour in 1996, but was beaten by Bjarne Riis, who later admitted to using <b>Erythropoietin.</b> Jan Ullrich and Marco Pantani won in 1997 and 1998, respectively; however, Pantani's victory was overshadowed by doping scandals.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian {{weightlifter}} Fabrício Mafra {{lost his}} bronze {{medal in the}} men's 105 kg competition. He tested positive for abnormal levels of testosterone, and Damian Abbiate, the competitor from Argentina, received the medal in his place. Colombian cyclist Libardo Niño Corridor, who won a silver medal in the men's individual road time trial, {{tested positive for the}} banned substance <b>erythropoietin</b> (EPO), and consequently the silver medal went to Matias Medici of Argentina and the bronze medal to Dominique Rollin of Canada. Nicaraguan baseball player Pedro Wilder Rayo Rojas tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid boldenone, and lost his bronze medal from the men's baseball competition, but his teammates kept their medals.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} sports, some {{competitors}} in cross-country skiing {{have chosen to}} enhance their performance through doping. Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used {{to cover up the}} use of <b>erythropoietin</b> (EPO). EPO boosts the oxygen-carrying capability of hemoglobin. In addition, the team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport. At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the cross-country skiers, Martin Tauber, Jürgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, the IOC {{announced}} that six athletes had tested positive during the 2008 Summer Olympics, without mentioning names or sports. Later, rumours emerged that the athletes included two cyclists, {{one of them}} a medal winner. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) then confirmed that a male Italian cyclist had tested positive for Continuous <b>erythropoietin</b> receptor activator (CERA) during the men's road race, without identifying him. The next day, on 29 April 2009, the Committee confirmed that Davide Rebellin was an involved athlete. Rebellin's agent sent a request for the analysis of the B sample. On 8 July 2009, Rebellin, along with Stefan Schumacher, were confirmed as having tested positive. Schumacher was already serving a ban after testing positive in the 2008 Tour de France, but faces further punishment, and Rebellin subsequently had his medal removed by the UCI and the IOC. On 27 November, Rebellin returned his silver medal to CONI, per their and the UCI's request. Per UCI regulations, Cancellara and Kolobnev were moved up to second and third in the official results, but did not initially receive new medals. On December 18, 2010, Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin, in a ceremony held in his hometown of Ittigen, Switzerland. The medal originally given to Cancellara will in turn be given to Kolobnev.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythropoietin</b> is {{the primary}} erythropoietic factor that cooperates with various other growth factors (e.g., IL-3, IL-6, glucocorticoids, and SCF) {{involved}} {{in the development of}} erythroid lineage from multipotent progenitors. The burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cells start <b>erythropoietin</b> receptor expression and are sensitive to <b>erythropoietin.</b> Subsequent stage, the colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E), expresses maximal <b>erythropoietin</b> receptor density and is completely dependent on <b>erythropoietin</b> for further differentiation. Precursors of red cells, the proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts also express <b>erythropoietin</b> receptor and are therefore affected by it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythropoietin</b> {{has been}} shown to exert its effects by binding to the <b>erythropoietin</b> {{receptor}} (EpoR). EPO binds to the <b>erythropoietin</b> receptor on the red cell progenitor surface and activates a JAK2 signaling cascade. This initiates the STAT5, PIK3 and Ras MAPK pathways. This results in differentiation, survival and proliferation of the erythroid cell. SOCS1, SOCS3 and CIS are also expressed which act as negative regulators of the cytokine signal. High level <b>erythropoietin</b> receptor expression is localized to erythroid progenitor cells. While there are reports that EPO receptors are found {{in a number of other}} tissues, such as heart, muscle, kidney and peripheral/central nervous tissue, those results are confounded by nonspecificity of reagents such as anti-EpoR antibodies. In controlled experiments, EPO receptor is not detected in those tissues. In the bloodstream, red cells themselves do not express <b>erythropoietin</b> receptor, so cannot respond to EPO. However, indirect dependence of red cell longevity in the blood on plasma <b>erythropoietin</b> levels has been reported, a process termed neocytolysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythropoietin</b> (EPO).|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythropoietin</b> is an {{essential}} hormone for red blood cell production. Without it, definitive erythropoiesis does not take place. Under hypoxic conditions, the kidney will produce and secrete <b>erythropoietin</b> to increase the production of red blood cells by targeting CFU-E, proerythroblast and basophilic erythroblast subsets in the differentiation. <b>Erythropoietin</b> has its primary effect on red blood cell progenitors and precursors (which {{are found in the}} bone marrow in humans) by promoting their survival through protecting these cells from apoptosis, or cell death.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys secrete {{a variety}} of hormones, {{including}} <b>erythropoietin,</b> and the enzyme renin. <b>Erythropoietin</b> is released in response to hypoxia (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. Calcitriol, the activated form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption of phosphate. Part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, renin is an enzyme involved in the regulation of aldosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythropoietin</b> is {{required}} for a myeloid progenitor cell to become an erythrocyte. On the other hand, thrombopoietin makes myeloid progenitor cells differentiate to megakaryocytes (thrombocyte-forming cells).|$|E
25|$|Iron {{deficiency}} anemia, {{which increases}} in prevalence as kidney function decreases, is especially prevalent in those requiring haemodialysis. It is multifactoral in cause, but includes increased inflammation, reduction in <b>erythropoietin,</b> and hyperuricemia leading to bone marrow suppression.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with this}} {{syndrome}} usually have early onset of secondary polycythemia, {{most of them}} at birth. They are diagnosed with typical physical characteristics (red cheeks, flushing, swelling of the extremities), which are then confirmed through lab results that show abnormally increased <b>erythropoietin</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Azacitidine {{is a drug}} used {{to treat}} CMML and is {{approved}} by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency. Stem cell transplant {{is also used to}} treat CMML, and involves the transplantation of donor haematopoietic stem cells into the recipient. Blood transfusion and <b>erythropoietin</b> are used to treat disease associated anaemia.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to RTK pathway, fibroblast growth factors can also activate the Jak-STAT signaling cascade. Instead of carrying covalently associated tyrosine kinase domains, Jak-STAT receptors form noncovalent complexes with tyrosine kinases of the Jak (Janus kinase) class. These receptors bind are for <b>erythropoietin</b> (important for erythropoiesis), thrombopoietin (important for platelet formation), and interferon (important for mediating immune cell function).|$|E
25|$|In October 2012 USADA {{released}} {{a report on the}} U.S. Postal Service cycling team and doping. The report contained affidavits from the following riders, each of whom described widespread use by Tour racers of banned substances such as <b>Erythropoietin</b> (EPO), transfused blood, and testosterone. The affidavits implicated Lance Armstrong, who was consequently banned for life and stripped of all titles.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{levels of}} {{hemoglobin}} {{are associated with}} increased numbers or sizes of red blood cells, called polycythemia. This elevation {{may be caused by}} congenital heart disease, cor pulmonale, pulmonary fibrosis, too much <b>erythropoietin,</b> or polycythemia vera. High hemoglobin levels may also be caused by exposure to high altitudes, smoking, dehydration (artificially by concentrating Hb), advanced lung disease and certain tumors.|$|E
25|$|On 11 July news {{broke that}} Spanish rider Manuel Beltrán tested {{positive}} for <b>erythropoietin</b> after {{the first stage of}} the tour. Blood abnormalities before the tour start had led AFLD to target the rider. Beltrán's team Liquigas withdrew him from the tour with immediate effect. French law enforcement authorities questioned Beltrán over possible offences and searched his hotel room, but he claimed his innocence. The B-Sample has not yet been tested.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Goldwasser and Kung {{purified}} EPO. Pure EPO {{allowed the}} {{amino acid sequence}} to be partially identified and the gene to be isolated. Synthetic EPO was first successfully used to correct anemia in 1987. In 1985, Lin et al isolated the human <b>erythropoietin</b> gene from a genomic phage library {{and used it to}} produce EPO. In 1989, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the hormone Epogen for use in certain anemias.|$|E
25|$|Since G protein–coupled receptors {{are known}} to {{activate}} Signal transduction in cells, {{it should not be}} surprising to find MC1R involved in development. As one example at the cellular level, preventing signalling by MC1R stopped erythropoiesis from proceeding from the polychromatic cell stage (poly-E in the figure) to the orthochromatic cell stage (ortho-E in the diagram). The same report showed that neutralizing antibodies to MC1R prevented phosphorylation of STAT5 by <b>erythropoietin,</b> and that MC2R and MC5R were also involved, as shown in their model.|$|E
25|$|Erythropoiesis is {{the process}} by which new red blood cells are produced; it lasts about 7 days. Through this process red blood cells are {{continuously}} produced in the red bone marrow of large bones. (In the embryo, the liver is the main site of red blood cell production.) The production can be stimulated by the hormone <b>erythropoietin</b> (EPO), synthesised by the kidney. Just before and after leaving the bone marrow, the developing cells are known as reticulocytes; these comprise about 1% of circulating red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|The Pacak-Zhuang {{syndrome}} is a recently described disease manifestation in females that includes multiple paragangliomas and somatostatinomas (in some), both neuroendocrine tumors, and secondary polycythemia {{associated with high}} <b>erythropoietin</b> levels. Paragangliomas in these patients are mainly localized to the abdomen whereas somatostatinomas {{are found in the}} second portion of the duodenum, as shown by imaging or biochemistry. This {{syndrome is}} of special interest as finding more than one type of neuroendocrine tumor in one individual is unusual. Such co-occurrences are usually seen in patients carrying hereditary syndromes like multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), or von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease.|$|E
25|$|In October 2012, the United States Anti-Doping Agency {{released}} a report on doping by the U.S. Postal Service cycling team, implicating, amongst others, Armstrong. The report contained affidavits from riders including Frankie Andreu, Tyler Hamilton, George Hincapie, Floyd Landis, Levi Leipheimer, and others describing widespread use of <b>Erythropoietin</b> (EPO), blood transfusion, testosterone, and other banned practices in several Tours. In October 2012 the UCI acted upon this report, formally stripping Armstrong of all titles since 1 August 1998, including all seven Tour victories, and announced that his Tour wins would not be reallocated to other riders.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of doping tests in 1964, many cyclists {{were caught in the}} Tour de France. In recent years, 1996 Tour de France winner Bjarne Riis and points classification winner Erik Zabel, along with most of their Team Telekom team-mates, confessed to using <b>erythropoietin</b> (EPO). In 1997, former points classification winner Djamolidine Abdoujaparov was disqualified from the Tour de France for doping use. In 1998, the Festina affair had several main contenders removed from the race. In the next years, several riders were removed from the Tour de France for doping (see List of doping cases in cycling).|$|E
25|$|Other {{signs and}} symptom may include haematuria; loin pain; {{abdominal}} mass; malaise, {{which is a}} general feeling of unwellness; weight loss and/or loss of appetite; anaemia resulting from depression of erythropoietin; erythrocytosis (increased production of red blood cells) due to increased <b>erythropoietin</b> secretion; varicocele, which is seen in males as an enlargement of the pampiniform plexus of veins draining the testis (more often the left testis) hypertension (high blood pressure) resulting from secretion of renin by the tumour; hypercalcemia, which is elevation of calcium levels in the blood; sleep disturbance or night sweats; recurrent fevers; and chronic fatigue.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in the Rome newspaper, La Repubblica, in January 2000 that Francesco Conconi, a professor at the University of Ferrara involved with administering <b>erythropoietin</b> (EPO) to riders on the Carrera team with which Roche had some of his best years, had provided riders including Roche with EPO. Roche denied the allegations. This was further reported in the Irish Times several days later, Roche again denying EPO. In March 2000 the Italian judge Franca Oliva published a report detailing the investigation into sports doctors including Conconi. This official judicial investigation unequivocally found that Roche was administered EPO in 1993, his last year in the peloton.|$|E
25|$|From {{studies on}} rats and mice, {{researchers}} have found that satellite glial cells express many neurotransmitter receptors, such as muscarinic acetylcholine and <b>erythropoietin</b> receptors. In order to differentiate between SGCs and other glial cells researchers have used markers to identify which proteins are found in different cells. Although SGCs express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and different S-100 proteins, the most useful marker available today for SGC identification is glutamine synthetase (GS). The levels of GS are relatively low at rest, but they greatly increase if the neuron undergoes axonal damage. Furthermore, SGCs also possess mechanisms to release cytokines, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and other chemical messengers.|$|E
25|$|Genetic engineering, {{recombinant}} DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) {{and gene}} splicing are terms {{that apply to}} the direct manipulation of an organism's genes. Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect method of genetic manipulation, genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of target genes. Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop technology (not a medical application, but see biological systems engineering), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin {{through the use of}} modified bacteria, the manufacture of <b>erythropoietin</b> in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythropoietin</b> was {{reported}} to have a range of actions beyond stimulation of erythropoiesis including vasoconstriction-dependent hypertension, stimulating angiogenesis, and promoting cell survival via activation of Epo receptors resulting in anti-apoptotic effects on ischemic tissues. However this proposal is controversial with numerous studies showing no effect. It is also inconsistent with the low levels of Epo receptors on those cells. Clinical trials in humans with ischemic heart, neural and renal tissues have not demonstrated the same benefits seen in animals. In addition some research studies have shown its neuroprotective effect on diabetic neuropathy, however these data were not confirmed in clinical trials that have been conducted on the deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, tibial and sural nerves.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythropoietin</b> {{levels in}} blood are quite {{low in the}} absence of anemia, at around 10 mU/ml. However, in hypoxic stress, EPO {{production}} may increase up to 1000-fold, reaching 10,000 mU/ml of blood. In adults, EPO is synthesized mainly by interstitial cells in the peritubular capillary bed of the renal cortex, with additional amounts being produced in the liver, and the pericytes in the brain. Regulation is believed to rely on a feedback mechanism measuring blood oxygenation and iron availability. Constitutively synthesized transcription factors for EPO, known as hypoxia-inducible factors, are hydroxylated and proteosomally digested in the presence of oxygen and iron. During normoxia GATA2 inhibits the promoter region for EPO. GATA2 levels decrease during hypoxia and allow the promotion of EPO production.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys {{measure the}} oxygen content (mmolO2/liter blood, {{rather than the}} partial {{pressure}} of O2) of the arterial blood. When the oxygen content of the blood is chronically low, as at high altitude, the oxygen-sensitive kidney cells secrete <b>erythropoietin</b> (often known only by its abbreviated form as EPO) into the blood. This hormone stimulates the red bone marrow to increase its rate of red cell production, which leads {{to an increase in}} the hematocrit of the blood, and a consequent increase in its oxygen carrying capacity (due to the now high hemoglobin content of the blood). In other words, at the same arterial partial pressure of O2, a person with a high hematocrit carries more oxygen per liter of blood than a person with a lower hematocrit does. High altitude dwellers therefore have higher hematocrits than sea-level residents.|$|E
