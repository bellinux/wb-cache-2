50|$|Like most ferrous materials, {{ductile iron}} is {{susceptible}} to corrosion, therefore its useful life depends {{on the impact of}} corrosion. Corrosion can occur in two ways in ductile iron pipes: <b>graphitization,</b> the leaching away of iron content through corrosion leading to a generally weakened pipe structure, and corrosion pitting, which is a more localized effect also causing weakening of the pipe structure.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{chemical}} composition {{to obtain a}} graphitic microstructure is 2.5 to 4.0% carbon and 1 to 3% silicon by weight. Graphite may occupy 6 to 10% {{of the volume of}} grey iron. Silicon is important for making grey iron as opposed to white cast iron, because silicon is a graphite stabilizing element in cast iron, which means it helps the alloy produce graphite instead of iron carbides; at 3% silicon almost no carbon is held in chemical form as iron carbide. Another factor affecting <b>graphitization</b> is the solidification rate; the slower the rate, the greater the time for the carbon to diffuse and accumulate into graphite. A moderate cooling rate forms a more pearlitic matrix, while a fast cooling rate forms a more ferritic matrix. To achieve a fully ferritic matrix the alloy must be annealed. Rapid cooling partly or completely suppresses <b>graphitization</b> and leads to the formation of cementite, which is called white iron.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{graphite}} {{is derived}} from mining. The quality of natural graphite varies {{as a result of}} the ore quality and post-mining processing of the ore. The end product is graphite with a content of carbon (high grade graphite 96−98% carbon), sulfur, SiO2 and ash. The higher the carbon content and the degree of <b>graphitization</b> (high crystalline) the better the lubricity and resistance to oxidation.|$|E
50|$|The powder {{is made by}} heating {{powdered}} {{petroleum coke}} above the temperature of <b>graphitization,</b> sometimes with minor modifications. The graphite scrap comes from pieces of unusable electrode material (in the manufacturing stage or after use) and lathe turnings, usually after crushing and sizing.

50|$|Iron was {{a popular}} {{material}} used in lighthouse construction. Multiple types of iron were used including: cast iron, wrought iron, steel, galvanized iron, galvanized steel, and stainless steel. Cast iron {{was the most popular}} material because it resists corrosion and can be cast into a multitude of shapes. Though iron is sturdy it can be prone to deterioration through corrosion (oxidation, glavanic corrosion, and <b>graphitization),</b> weathering, and flaws from the manufacturing process. Degradation of iron is visible through pitting, cracks, erosion, rust, blistering, flaking, and scaling.|$|E
50|$|Ferrosilicon {{is used as}} {{a source}} of silicon to reduce metals from their oxides and to deoxidize steel and other ferrous alloys. This {{prevents}} the loss of carbon from the molten steel (so called blocking the heat); ferromanganese, spiegeleisen, silicides of calcium, and many other materials are used for the same purpose. It {{can be used to make}} other ferroalloys. Ferrosilicon is also used for manufacture of silicon, corrosion-resistant and high-temperature resistant ferrous silicon alloys, and silicon steel for electromotors and transformer cores. In the manufacture of cast iron, ferrosilicon is used for inoculation of the iron to accelerate <b>graphitization.</b> In arc welding, ferrosilicon can be found in some electrode coatings.|$|E
50|$|Next follows heat {{treatment}} of the “green brushes” under artificial atmosphere (usually hydrogen and nitrogen). Temperatures range up to 1200 °C. This process is called sintering or baking. During sintering, the binders either burn off or carbonize and form a crystalline structure between the carbon, copper and other additives. Baking is followed by <b>graphitization</b> ({{heat treatment}}). The heat treatment is transformed by a temperature curve exactly defined for each material mixture. Besides the mixture composition, the used temperature curve is the second big “secret” of each brush manufacturer. After the heat treatment, the brush structure is modified {{in a way which}} makes copying of the brush nearly impossible for competing companies.|$|E
50|$|The high {{strength}} of carbon fiber {{can be attributed}} to these four main processes. Having high levels of crystalline regions allows the fibers to withstand high levels of stress. These crystalline regions are formed via the melt spinning process; the crystals are stiff areas that do not deform when an external stress is applied. Orienting and aligning these crystalline regions gives further strength to the fibers, specifically if the orientation is along the fiber axis. Carbonization and <b>graphitization</b> are the two processes responsible for this alignment of the crystalline regions. Pitch based carbon fiber is lower in strength than fiberglass; however, it has a very high elastic modulus.|$|E
50|$|Catalytic {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CCVD) {{or simply}} CVD with variants like thermal and plasma-assisted is the dominant commercial technique for the fabrication of VGCF and VGCNF. Here, gas-phase molecules are decomposed at high temperatures and carbon is deposited {{in the presence of}} a transition metal catalyst on a substrate where subsequent growth of the fiber around the catalyst particles is realized. In general, this process involves separate stages such as gas decomposition, carbon deposition, fiber growth, fiber thickening, <b>graphitization,</b> and purification and results in hollow fibers. The nanofiber diameter depends on the catalyst size. The CVD process for the fabrication of VGCF generally falls into two categories: 1) fixed-catalyst process (batch), and 2) floating-catalyst process (continuous).|$|E
50|$|Prebaked anodes {{are divided}} into {{graphitized}} and coke types. For manufacturing of the graphitized anodes, anthracite and petroleum coke are calcined and classified. They are then mixed with coal-tar pitch and pressed. The pressed green anode is then baked at 1200 °C and graphitized. Coke anodes are made of calcined petroleum coke, recycled anode butts, and coal-tar pitch (binder). The anodes are manufactured by mixing aggregates with coal tar pitch to form a paste with a doughy consistency. This material is most often vibro-compacted but in some plants pressed. The green anode is then sintered at 1100-1200 °C for 300-400 hours, without <b>graphitization,</b> to increase its strength through decomposition and carbonization of the binder. Higher baking temperatures increase the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, and decrease the air and CO2 reactivity. The specific electrical resistance of the coke-type anodes is {{higher than that of}} the graphitized ones, but they have higher compressive strength and lower porosity.|$|E
50|$|A common {{method of}} {{manufacture}} involves heating the spun PAN filaments to approximately 300 °C in air, which breaks many of the hydrogen bonds and oxidizes the material. The oxidized PAN is then placed into a furnace having an inert atmosphere of a gas such as argon, and heated to approximately 2000 °C, which induces <b>graphitization</b> of the material, changing the molecular bond structure. When heated in the correct conditions, these chains bond side-to-side (ladder polymers), forming narrow graphene sheets which eventually merge to form a single, columnar filament. The result is usually 93-95% carbon. Lower-quality fiber can be manufactured using pitch or rayon as the precursor instead of PAN. The carbon can become further enhanced, as high modulus, or high strength carbon, by heat treatment processes. Carbon heated {{in the range of}} 1500-2000 °C (carbonization) exhibits the highest tensile strength (820,000 psi, 5,650 MPa or N/mm²), while carbon fiber heated from 2500 to 3000 °C (graphitizing) exhibits a higher modulus of elasticity (77,000,000 psi or 531 GPa or 531 kN/mm²).|$|E

40|$|Five carbons with {{different}} <b>graphitization</b> degrees, which were heat-treated at temperatures of 1273 to 3273 K, were prepared.

Carbon heat-treated at 1273 K remains amorphous, whereas most of the carbons heat-treated at 3273 K change into graphite because the <b>graphitization</b> degree increases with increasing heat treatment temperature. Strong bonding of amorphous carbon to nickel is not accomplished. The bending strength or joinability of carbon (with a <b>graphitization</b> degree lower than 0. 28) /nickel joints depends on the joining temperature.

40|$|We {{have started}} to {{establish}} a small-mass sample preparation system at Nagoya University. In the first step, NIST Ox-II standard samples < 0. 5 mgC, graphitized using our regular sample preparation protocol, were measured for 14 C. The 14 C/ 12 C ratios of these small-mass samples were affected by the decrease in beam current intensity and incomplete <b>graphitization</b> especially for samples < 0. 3 mgC. In the second step, we have designed a compact <b>graphitization</b> system suitable for small-mass samples and compared its performance to that of our regular <b>graphitization</b> system. During the <b>graphitization</b> reaction following our regular protocol, by-product water vapor was incompletely trapped, which resulted in low graphite yield or no <b>graphitization</b> for samples of < 0. 5 mgC. Meanwhile graphite was successfully produced for samples of 0. 2 mgC using the new reactor. The SEM images of small-samples using the new reactor show spotted graphite covering the spherical iron particles. No or very little graphite was observed for the samples graphitized using our regular <b>graphitization</b> system. During the <b>graphitization</b> reaction using the sealed tube method, water vapor was incompletely trapped, which resulted in low graphite yield especially for samples of < 0. 5 mgC.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Graphitization</b> {{process in}} steels is {{referred}} to the decomposition of meta-stable cementite phase to more stable phases of graphite and ferrite. In steels this transformation often occurs {{in the range of}} 600 - 700 ºC. In common commercial steels the occurrence of <b>graphitization</b> process requires long periods of time {{due to the lack of}} carbide stabilizer elements such as chromium and manganese.

This paper describes a fabrication method of three-dimensional (3 D) graphene conformally coated on nanoporous insulating substrate with uniform nanopore size. 3 D graphene films were formed by controlled <b>graphitization</b> of diamond-like amorphous carbon precursor films, deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD).
