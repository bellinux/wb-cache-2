2500|$|The {{reality of}} the New South Africa is decidedly violent, and crime is a {{well-known}} theme in post-apartheid Afrikaans protest music. [...] The punk group Fokofpolisiekar (which translates to [...] "fuck off police car") sings in [...] "Brand Suid-Afrika" [...] : [...] "For you knives lie in wait, in the garden outside you house," [...] and Radio Suid-Afrika sings in [...] "Bid" [...] : [...] "Pray that no-one will be waiting in the garden, pray for strength and for mercy in each dark day." [...] Theirs is a country of [...] "murder and child rape" [...] where the only respite is alcohol abuse. [...] In [...] "Blaas hom" [...] by the industrial band Battery9, the narrator sings how he gleefully unloads his gun on a burglar after being robbed for the third time, and in [...] "Siek bliksems" [...] Kristoe Strauss asks God to help against the [...] "sick bastards" [...] responsible for hijackings. The metal band KOBUS! pleads for a reinstatement {{of the death penalty}} in [...] "Doodstraf", because they feel the promise of peace <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>realized.</b> In [...] "Reconciliation Day", Koos Kombuis sings: [...] "Our streets run with blood, every day a funeral procession, they steal all our goods, on Reconciliation Day." [...] Elsewhere he states, [...] "we're in a state of war." [...] The video of this song features a lawless microcosm of theft, rape and abuse – a lawlessness reflected in Valiant Swart's [...] "Sodom en Gomorra": [...] "two cities in the north, without laws, without order, too wonderful for words." [...] Hanru Niemand rewrites the traditional Afrikaans song Sarie Marais, turning it into a murder ballad speculating on where Sarie's body will be found. [...] The new protest musicians also parody Voëlvry's music: Johannes Kerkorrel's [...] "Sit dit af" [...] – a satire on P. W. Botha of the apartheid regime – is turned into [...] "Sit dit aan" [...] by Koos Kombuis, now a song protesting mismanagement resulting in chronic power failures.|$|E

60|$|The cloud {{which for}} {{the space of a}} month hung gloomily over the civilized world, black with far worse evils than those of simple war, has passed from over our heads without bursting. The fear <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>realized,</b> that the only two first-rate Powers who are also free nations would take to tearing each other in pieces, both the one and the other in a bad and odious cause. For while, on the American side, the war would have been one of {{reckless}} persistency in wrong, on ours {{it would have been a}} war in alliance with, and, to practical purposes, in defence and propagation of, slavery. We had, indeed, been wronged. We had suffered an indignity, and something more than an indignity, which, not to have resented, would have been to invite a constant succession of insults and injuries from the same and from every other quarter. We could have acted no otherwise than we have done: yet it is impossible to think, without something like a shudder, from what we have escaped. We, the emancipators of the slave--who have wearied every Court and Government in Europe and America with our protests and remonstrances, until we goaded them into at least ostensibly coöperating with us to prevent the enslaving of the negro--we, who for the last half century have spent annual sums, equal to the revenue of a small kingdom, in blockading the African coast, for a cause in which we not only had no interest, but which was contrary to our pecuniary interest, and which many believed would ruin, as many among us still, though erroneously, believe that it has ruined, our colonies,--we should have lent a hand to setting up, in one of the most commanding positions of the world, a powerful republic, devoted not only to slavery, but to pro-slavery propagandism--should have helped to give a place in the community of nations to a conspiracy of slave-owners, who have broken their connection with the American Federation on the sole ground, ostentatiously proclaimed, that they thought an attempt would be made to restrain, not slavery itself, but their purpose of spreading slavery wherever migration or force could carry it.|$|E

In 2010, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Pillay expressed concern about women being accused of, arrested for, and/or attacked by mobs for being witches.

50|$|Japan's expansionary {{monetary}} policy failed to achieve recovery. From a high of 6 percent, the discount rate has been lowered to 4.5 percent in 1991, 3.25 percent in 1992, 1.75 percent during 1993-1994, and 0.5 percent during 1995-2000. This dramatic easing of interest rates has not stimulated Japan's economy, but the failure of interest-rate easing {{is not necessarily a}} failure of monetary theory. Japan's banking system is widely regarded as in need of restructuring. Much of the stimulus that reduced rates could provide <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>realized</b> because the banking community has been increasing its liquidity instead of increasing its lending. Many banks have bad loans with collateral now worth only 60-80 percent of their value when the loans were made. Some banks are merging, and others have been nationalized. Such problems have contributed to the ineffectiveness of {{monetary policy}}.|$|E
