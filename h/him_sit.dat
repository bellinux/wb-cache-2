25|$|Alice Mitchell, née Johnson — Dennis' stay-at-home mother Alice {{is usually}} the reassuring figure Dennis can run to when things get too overwhelming, ready to greet him with a warm hug. Although she grew up among animals on a chicken ranch, a running gag is that Alice Mitchell has a phobia of snakes. Another running gag {{involves}} Dennis's ever-changing parade of new babysitters: no one will take the job twice. Alice is also known for punishing Dennis's misbehavior by having <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> in the corner {{in a rocking chair}} for timeout, although a couple of times she has instituted tougher disciplinary measures such as spanking, where afterward Dennis is shown crying or grumbling about the adversity.|$|E

500|$|As in Libya, Mackay {{shared the}} hardships {{of living in the}} field with his men, and {{impressed}} them by his coolness during air raids. They watched <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> in the open during attacks; on one such occasion on 19 April 1941, Mackay waited out a two-and-a-half-hour raid when his car was hit and his driver wounded. One staff officer [...] "noticed Mackay moving in front of his tent quite unconcerned about the movement of enemy planes. He neither looked at the planes nor at the men dashing about, but they saw him, and those moving towards shelter stopped, and many of those who had gained shelter returned to their duties. Personal example is the only paying proposition in such circumstances". For his actions in Greece, he was mentioned in despatches a sixth time, and awarded the Greek War Cross (First Class).|$|E
500|$|Vlasic {{because he}} wanted to find a young quarterback to observe and succeed Dan Fouts. He signed with the team in late July, and spent the preseason {{competing}} with Rick Neuheisel, Tom Flick, and others for the backup quarterback job. While he performed well in the preseason, the Chargers were looking to have <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> out a year so he could learn the ins-and-outs or pro football. After Flick was cut and Mark Herrmann named the primary backup, Vlasic beat out Neuheisel for the final quarterback spot on the Chargers' roster, though Neuheisel would rejoin the team later that season due to the strike. Despite making the roster, Vlasic spent most of the season after the players' strike on the team's inactive list. [...] However, when Fouts was scratched from a December game against the Denver Broncos due to a shoulder injury, Vlasic was called up to be Herrman's backup. He made his professional debut on December 27, 1987, playing the final 5:29 of the game. He completed three of six passes for eight yards, was sacked, and threw an interception in the Chargers' 24-0 loss against Denver.|$|E

He was not happy with it, and told [...] newspaper gossip columnist Walter Winchell, [...] "When they catch [...] John Dillinger, they're going to make <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> through it twice." [...] Although Educational Pictures dropped his contract, he soon signed with Warner Brothers, making movies during the day and performing in Broadway shows in the evenings.|$|E
2500|$|Little Slackwater was {{a tricky}} place to navigate. Not {{only did it}} {{have a lot of}} hairpin turns, but also just before Guard lock #5, there was a strip of land in the water called [...] "the pier" [...] : loaded boats going {{downstream}} would have to go outside the pier, and unloaded boats on the inside, thus making steering difficult for the loaded boats to get into the lock. If the current was fast in the river it could go as fast as the boat, rendering the tiller useless, and thus, a boat could be almost impossible to steer. One man reported that at the slackwater, they had <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> {{at the front of the}} boat with a hatchet in case they had to cut the towline , and had a couple of [...] hatches turned upside down, so that they could escape to shore on the hatches. On 1 May 1903, the towline to Boat No. 6 broke, with Captain Keim, Mrs. Keim, their two daughters, and Harry Newkirk aboard. One daughter drowned, another suffered a broken leg, and the captain died later of injuries. The rest (including the mules aboard) survived.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{obviously}} {{the foundation and}} progeny curse {{was not the only}} religious invocation by the political powers during the Akkadian empire, it demonstrates a certain standardization, and with it, stagnation, of the position of the gods that likely did not sit well with the people of Lagaš. Ur-Ningirsu I, with whom the Gudean dynasty of Lagaš begins, leaves {{little in the way of}} inscriptions, and though some mention of various gods seems to indicate a more central role, it is not until Gudea that there can be a side-by-side comparison with the old curse of Sargon. The inscription on a statue of Gudea as architect of the House of Ningirsu, warns the reader of doom if the words are altered, but there is a startling difference between the warnings of Sargon or his line and the warnings of Gudea. The one is length; Gudea’s curse lasts nearly a quarter of the inscription’s considerable length, and another is creativity. The gods will not merely reduce the offender’s progeny to ash and destroy his foundations, no, they will, [...] "let <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> down in the dust instead of on the seat they set up for him". He will be [...] "slaughtered like a bull… seized like an aurochs by his fierce horn".|$|E

2500|$|Homer and Bart {{participate}} at an [...] "Ugliest Dog" [...] {{contest in}} Springfield" [...] contest, entering Santa's Little Helper. At the contest, Moe feels neglected because {{nobody wants to}} let <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> next to them (Agnes Skinner even sets {{the chair next to}} her on fire). Moe sits on the ground until he notices that the judge, Krusty the Clown, is not managing to entertain the crowd due to his lack of enthusiasm over his work. He taunts and insults Krusty for his inability to be funny, despite being a clown. Angry, Krusty leaves and offers his job to Moe, much to the delight of the crowd, who then urges him to replace Krusty, and to which Moe agrees as he now has a place to sit. During the competition, Moe makes sardonic, offensive but undoubtedly funny comments about all the ugly dogs, but chooses the Simpsons' dog (under the alias of Satan's Little Helper) was the winner because the Simpsons disguised their dog's buttocks as if it were his face, leaving Santa's Little Helper upset over his appearance until Lisa comforts him later. After that, Moe becomes the judge of most Springfield competitions (including a bully competition at the beach) and is offered a job as one of jurors of American Idol, since that several other programs with the opportunity of this kind of job were suddenly cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year later}} in 1952, Cage applied his aleatoric methods to tape-based composition. Also in 1952, Karlheinz Stockhausen {{completed}} a modest musique concrète student piece entitled Etude. Cage's work resulted {{in his famous}} work Williams Mix, which {{was made up of}} some six hundred tape fragments arranged according {{to the demands of the}} I Ching. Cage's early radical phase reached its height that summer of 1952, when he unveiled the first art [...] "happening" [...] at Black Mountain College, and 4'33", the so-called controversial [...] "silent piece". The premiere of 4'33" [...] was performed by David Tudor. The audience saw <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> at the piano, and close the lid of the piano. Some time later, without having played any notes, he opened the lid. A while after that, again having played nothing, he closed the lid. And after a period of time, he opened the lid once more and rose from the piano. The piece had passed without a note being played, in fact without Tudor or anyone else on stage having made any deliberate sound, although he timed the lengths on a stopwatch while turning the pages of the score. Only then could the audience recognize what Cage insisted upon: that there is no such thing as silence. Noise is always happening that makes musical sound. In 1957, Edgard Varèse created on tape an extended piece of electronic music using noises created by scraping, thumping and blowing titled Poème électronique.|$|E
2500|$|The {{type that}} {{replaced}} the B.E.2a and B.E.2b (as {{well as the}} assortment of other types in use at the time) in the reconnaissance squadrons of the RFC in 1915 was the B.E.2c, which had also been designed before the war. The most important difference in the new model was an improvement in stability – a genuinely useful characteristic, especially in aerial photographic work, using the primitive plate cameras of the time, with their relatively long exposures. Unfortunately {{in this case the}} stability was coupled with [...] "heavy" [...] controls and poor manoeuvrability. A suitable engine was not available in sufficient quantities to replace the air-cooled Renault – the RAF 1a being essentially an uprated version of the French engine – so that the improvement in the B.E.2c's performance was less than startling. When bombs were to be carried or maximum endurance was required the observer had to be left behind, so it was still necessary to have <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> over the centre of gravity, in front of the pilot. In this awkward position his view was poor, {{and the degree to which}} he could handle a camera (or, later, a gun) was hampered by the struts and wires supporting the centre section of the top wing. In practice the pilot of a B.E.2c handled the camera, and the observer, when he was armed at all, had a rather poor field of fire to the rear, having, at best, to shoot back over his pilot's head.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I know {{it was a very difficult}} decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel and the fact that we were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've been through so much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having <b>him</b> <b>sit</b> up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
