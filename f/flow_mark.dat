Flexural modulus increased with increasing the volume fraction of bagasse fiber and the prediction by the calculation {{was in good}} agreement with the experiment. However, the flexural modulus of the composites without kneading, which {{is the process of}} making the pellets from bagasse fiber and polypropylene, was lower than that with kneading. Without kneading. the sizes of bagasse fibers in the composite were larger than that without kneading. These bagnsse fibers resulted in a heterogeneous distribution in the composite and bagasse fibers failed to be bridging fibers which transfers load each other. Furthermore, at mold temperature 30 ℃, the flow marks with white turbidity occurred on the surface. In the observation of the <b>flow</b> <b>mark,</b> there were lots of the fibers. which were not bonded with polypropylene. This was another factor to decrease the flexural modulus...|$|E
40|$|Law {{enforcement}} agencies need {{the ability to}} conduct electronic surveillance to combat crime, terrorism, or other malicious activities exploiting the Internet. However, the proliferation of anonymous communication systems on the Internet has posed significant challenges to providing such traceback capability. In this paper, we develop {{a new class of}} flow marking technique for invisible traceback based on Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), utilizing a Pseudo-Noise (PN) code. By interfering with a sender’s traffic and marginally varying its rate, an investigator can embed a secret spread spectrum signal into the sender’s traffic. The embedded signal is carried along with the traffic from the sender to the receiver, so the investigator can recognize the corresponding communication relationship, tracing the messages despite the use of anonymous networks. The secret PN code makes it difficult for others to detect the presence of such embedded signals, so the traceback, while available to investigators is, effectively invisible. We demonstrate a practical flow marking system which requires no training, and can achieve both high detection and low false positive rates. Using a combination of analytical modeling, simulations, and experiments on Tor (a popular Internet anonymous communication system), we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DSSS-based <b>flow</b> <b>mark...</b>|$|E

Steady finite element calculations ofa model injection molding flow using a single mode, exponential Phan-Thien¿Tanner constitutiveequation supply information about the base state streamlines and polymer stresses.

40|$|Debris flow {{is one of}} the {{shattering}} natural disasters, mostly ensuing in mountainous areas. Rational {{estimation of}} debris flow velocity {{is one of the}} key issues in debris hazard mitigation. Among the various procedures, back-calculation of debris flow velocity is a widely used approach. Back-calculation procedure includes determinations of super-elevation and channel properties, and velocities are calculated using the forced-vortex equation (??=√gRΔ?/kb). A debris mass, when travels through a curved flume, leaves the highest <b>flow</b> <b>mark</b> on the outer bend, and the difference between the flow depths of outer and inner bends is referred to as ‘super-elevation’. However, in a post-flow field investigation, only the highest flow marks on both inner and outer bends are visible, which does not portray the actual maximum super-elevation that must have been reached in the unsteady flow event, and eventually leads to a misjudgment of the real velocity. Another important parameter of forced vortex equation is the channel radius of curvature. Any natural channel has hardly been a circle, rather it has varying curvature. How the curve is approximated can affect velocity estimation. Considering the unsteady nature of debris flows, this research work aims to figure out a coherent way of estimating debris flow velocities. Therefore, a series of numerical curved flume tests using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are carried out to check the aptness of the mud-marks derived velocities. Estimated velocities from flow marks underestimate the actual velocities near the source, while they converge on the actual velocities as the distance to source increases. Based on the simulations, a best fit curve is proposed to adjust the mud-marks derived velocities. Law of similarity allows to apply the findings from these small scale simulations to the real debris flow problems. Three debris flow events in Japan are taken for the validation of the proposed procedure and adjusted velocities are proven to be consistent with verbal evidences and previous analyses...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the fundamental problem}} of bandwidth allocation among flows in a packet-switched network. The classical max-min rate allocation has been widely regarded as a fair rate allocation policy. But, for a flow with a minimum rate requirement and a peak rate constraint, the classical max-min policy no longer suffices to determine rate allocation since it is not capable of supporting either the minimum rate or the peak rate constraint from a flow. In this paper, we generalize {{the theory of the}} classical max-min rate allocation with the support of both the minimum rate and peak rate constraints for each flow. Additionally, to achieve generalized max-min rate allocation in a fully distributed packet network, we present a distributed algorithm that uses a feedback-based flow control mechanism. Our design not only offers a fresh perspective on <b>flow</b> <b>marking</b> technique, but also advances the state-of-the-art <b>flow</b> <b>marking</b> technique favored by other researchers. We provide proof that such a distributed algorithm, through asynchronous iterations, will always converge to the generalized max-min rate allocation under any network configuration and any set of link distances. We use simulation results to demonstrate the fast convergence property of the distributed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used manufacturing methods for the production of polymer-based components such as car bumpers and other automotive details. The surface appearance of these products is of great importance since it is directly connected to the perceived quality. Injection-moulded thermoplastics can exhibit a number of surface defects which lower their quality impression. To a large extent, this work deals with characterisation of flow-induced surface defects called tiger stripes or <b>flow</b> <b>marks.</b> They consist in alternating glossy and dull bands which appear on the surface of injection-moulded polymers, especially when long flow lengths are involved. The <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> are approximately perpendicular to the flow direction and they are often opposite in phase on the two sides of the moulded object. The materials typically used for injection moulding of car components, and studied in the present work, are elastomer-modified polypropylene grades containing fillers. Two main theories behind the formation of the <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> are discussed here: a slip-stick phenomenon and a snake-like flow which can initiate an unstable flow front during the filling of the mould. Several techniques were used in order to characterise the banded regions. Stereographic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as gloss evaluation, revealed that the dull regions were rougher and less glossy than the other type of bands. SEM micrographs of the cross section of the stripes indicated differences in the filler distribution between the different bands; the dull bands seemed to contain a lower amount of filler in the proximity of their surface. A course of events leading to this difference is suggested. Rheological studies of the polymer melts suggested that a higher melt elasticity is beneficial since it reduces the propensity for the defects generation. The effect of ageing on the severity of the <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> is discussed in terms of surface roughness, surface hardness and thermal stability. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer is another engineering polymer widely used to produce vehicle interior components as well as domestic appliances, toys, etc. ABS is known to be sensitive towards ageing especially when exposed to UV-light. The effect of ageing on the appearance of injection-moulded ABS samples was studied here, in particular colour changes were evaluated. Natural coloured and grey coloured ABS specimens, containing the same type and the same amount of stabilisers, were exposed to a heat ageing treatment and to artificial weathering. In general, the natural coloured ABS suffered the most severe discolouration and the artificial weathering produced the strongest effect. Interestingly, an imposed surface texture appeared to affect the colour change induced by ageing. Chemical and mechanical changes on the surface layers of the investigated samples were reported...|$|R
