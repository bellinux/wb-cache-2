40|$|Commercial-scale inertial-fusion {{power can}} be {{generated}} by producing a steady succession of thermonuclear microexplosions of small pellet targets whose ignition requires supplying a few magajoules in a few nanoseconds, a goal well beyond the present single-shot capabilities of high-power pulsed laser and electron-beam systems which also lack the needed repetition-rate capability of order one per second. However, existing high-energy accelerator technology with straightforward engineering extrapolations, applied to pulsed beams of heavy ions in low charge states, can meet all requirements. The relevant accelerator capabilities are discussed; three widely differing types of accelerators show promise. Needed developmental work is mostly on lower-energy components and can be conducted at relatively low cost. Some of the work started at several accelerator laboratories on this new approach {{within the past year}} are described, and possible goals of an early <b>demonstration</b> <b>construction</b> project are indicated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Scientific {{studies have}} {{established}} {{the importance of}} engineering demonstrations, yet comparatively {{little is known about}} what makes some demonstrations more effective than others. In this study we investigate the pedagogic effect of <b>demonstration</b> <b>construction</b> quality. This study considers two build qualities: “raw ” and “polished”. Raw demonstrations use prototype-quality construction techniques such as exposed solderless breadboards, and polished demonstrations use production-quality construction techniques designed to emulate typical consumer electronics. The impact of the demonstrations on student interest were assessed by constructing paired sets of demonstrations of raw and polished quality. These were used in lectures to 119 students and student interest and comprehension were assessed by post-lecture surveys. Initial data using only a single demonstration in both raw and polished versions show students in both technical and nontechnical majors score higher in objective testing and report higher interest in the material using raw construction techniques (two-tailed p= 0. 051 and < 0. 01 respectively). Further data using other demonstrations will be obtained in 2009 to determine if these findings can be generalized...|$|E

5000|$|This is {{the basis}} for the idea that <b>demonstration</b> (or the <b>construction</b> of arguments) is {{dependent}} ultimately upon ideas or proofs that are known so well and are so fundamental to human understanding of logic that no other proofs come before it. They must hold true in and of themselves. According to Stump, [...] "the role of maximal propositions in argumentation is to ensure the truth of a conclusion by ensuring the truth of its premises either directly or indirectly." [...] These propositions would be used in constructing arguments through the Differentia, which is the second part of Boethius' theory. This is [...] "the genus of the intermediate in the argument." [...] So maximal propositions allow room for an argument to be founded in some sense of logic while differentia are critical for the <b>demonstration</b> and <b>construction</b> of arguments.|$|R

40|$|Game engine based {{technologies}} {{are becoming a}} more common platform for immersive head mounted displays. Due to the experiences derived from immersive <b>demonstrations,</b> <b>construction</b> industry has adopted the game engines as platforms to produce virtual models for different uses. A virtual model created in game engine can serve as the base for immersive visualization or physic-based simulation of different natural phenomena. Both examples provide information that interests designers and clients in construction industry. The research {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part is definition of a process for production of virtual models through empirical trials. The second part focuses how virtual models could be applied in co-creative design in construction business. The need for virtual models in co-creative design was researched by organizing themed interviews with different parties in construction business. The interviewees had either experience in co-creative design or modern technologies applied in construction and gaming industries. In addition, a case study for using a virtual model {{as a part of a}} facilitated workshop in co-creative design was done with help from University Properties of Finland Ltd. As the result of this thesis, a process for production of virtual models from different data sources in construction project was defined. The process is presented in three parts: data preparation, data refinement and import to the game engine, Unity 3 D. Performance requirements defined in research outlines can be achieved through different optimization techniques explained in the thesis. To illustrate the versatility of virtual models, two case examples explain how virtual models can be evolved into immersive visualizations of the design data on different platforms. Implementation to co-creative design process can be done via an organized workshop or by using the virtual model as a platform to provoke conversation between different parties in a construction project...|$|R
