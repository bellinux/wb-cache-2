There is no {{agreement on the}} best method to assess the nutritional status of hospitalized patients. Objectives: To identify the agreement level of the nutritional diagnosis when patients are evaluated using Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS- 2002) protocol and the one used at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (AN-HCPA). Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients with malnutrition and <b>eutrophy</b> diagnoses. The evaluations were performed at distinct moments, by different researchers. Results: The study involved 247 patients of 50. 7 ± 15. 5 years and BMI of 21. 31 ± 2. 1 kg/m 2. NRS- 2002 classified 43 % of patients with <b>eutrophy</b> and 57 % with malnutrition. AN-HCPA identified 50 % of patients with <b>eutrophy</b> and 50 % with malnutrition. Both systems agreed in 93 cases (38 %) for <b>eutrophy</b> diagnosis and in 110 cases (45 %) for malnutrition diagnosis, with Kappa coefficient of 0. 64 (95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 74) p < 0. 001. AN-HCPA presented a sensitivity of 78. 6 % and a specificity of 86. 9 %, positive predictive value of 88. 7 % and negative predictive value of 75. 6 %.

40|$|We used ISO-compliant {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} to evaluate the comparative environmental performance of high- and low-profitability commodity and deep-bedded niche swine production systems in the Upper Midwestern United States. Specifically, we evaluated the contributions of feed production, in-barn energy use, manure management, and piglet production to farm-gate life cycle energy use, ecological footprint, and greenhouse gas (GHG) and <b>eutrophying</b> emissions per animal produced and per live-weight kg. We found that commodity systems generally outperform deep-bedded niche systems for these criteria, but that significant overlap occurs {{in the range of}} impacts characteristic of high- and low-profitability production between systems. Given the non-optimized status of current deep-bedded niche relative to commodity production, we suggest that optimizing niche systems through improvements in feed and sow herd efficiency holds significant environmental performance improvement potential. Drivers of impacts differed between commodity and deep-bedded niche systems. Feed production was the key consideration in both, but proportionally more important in niche production due to lower feed use efficiencies. Liquid manure management in commodity production strongly influenced GHG emissions, whereas solid manure management increased eutrophication potential due to outdoor storage in deep-bedded niche production. We further observe an interesting but highly imperfect relationship between economic and environmental performance measures, where profitability tracks well with resource (in particular, feed) throughput, but only indirectly with emissions intensity.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{evaluate}} the potential environmental and health impact of dairy cattle livestock and manure management in the Czech Republic. We present a new approach for national assessments of {{the environmental impact of}} an agricultural sector. Emission estimates are combined with a country-specific set of indicators to assess the environmental impact in nine regions with specific environmental characteristics. We estimate the contribution of emissions of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrogen oxides (NO) to acidification and terrestrial eutrophication, nitrate (NO 3) and phosphate (PO 4) to aquatic eutrophication, nitrogen oxides (NO), particulate matter (PM 10) and (PM 2. 5) to human toxicity and methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (NO) to global warming. We present large regional differences in the environmental and health impact per unit of agricultural production. The regional acidifying, <b>eutrophying</b> and global warming impact of dairy cattle is calculated to be up to three times the national average, depending on the dairy cattle intensity. Aquatic eutrophication is found to be a problem in regions with relatively high <b>eutrophying</b> emissions per hectare of so-called nitrate vulnerable zones. Human toxicity problems caused by dairy cattle livestock and manure management are problematic in regions with a high population density in rural areas. The strength of our approach is the use of country-specific characterisation factors to assess the potential environmental and health impact of agriculture at the sub-national scale. We were able to analyse the potential environmental impact without explicit quantification of specific effects on humans and ecosystems.

40|$|The US egg {{industry}} has evolved considerably over recent decades by incorporating {{new technologies and}} production practices. To date, {{there has been no}} comprehensive assessment of the resource demand and environmental effects of these changes. This study quantifies the environmental footprint of egg production supply chains in the United States for 2010 compared with 1960 using life cycle assessment. The analysis considers changes in both foreground (e. g., hen production performance) and background (e. g., efficiencies of energy provision, fertilizer production, production of feed inputs, and transport modes) system variables. The results revealed that feed efficiency, feed composition, and manure management are the 3 primary factors that determine the environmental impacts of US egg production. Further research and improvements in these areas will aid in continual reduction of the environmental footprint of the US egg industry over time. Per kilogram of eggs produced, the environmental footprint for 2010 is 65 % lower in acidifying emissions, 71 % lower in <b>eutrophying</b> emissions, 71 % lower in greenhouse gas emissions, and 31 % lower in cumulative energy demand compared with 1960. Table egg production was 30 % higher in 2010; however, the total environmental footprint was 54 % lower in acidifying emissions, 63 % lower in <b>eutrophying</b> emissions, 63 % lower in greenhouse gas emissions, and 13 % lower in cumulative energy demand compared with 1960. Reductions in the environmental footprint over the 50 -yr interval considered {{can be attributed to the}} following: 27 to 30 % due to improved efficiencies of background systems, which outweighed the declining energy return on energy invested for primary energy sources; 30 to 44 % due to changes in feed composition; and 28 to 43 % due to improved bird performance...|$|E

The project also studied how political decisions and policies concerning water protection affect {{the state of the}} Gulf. In addition, modelling tools were developed to evaluate the effects of practical environmental policy implementation. Lake Ladoga is of prime importance for the state of the Gulf of Finland: it retains 75 % of the phosphorus and 30 % of the nitrogen it receives. About half of the bioavailable nitrogen load that ends up in the Gulf of Finland is removed by nitrogen removal processes (denitrification and anammox). In the western and middle areas of the Gulf the sediments retain very little phosphorus due to the poor oxygen conditions. In the eastern part, where the oxygen conditions usually are better, large amounts of potentially <b>eutrophying</b> phosphorus are stored in the sediments. Significant amounts of silicon are buried in the Gulf of Finland sediments under both reduced and oxidized conditions. Effective purification of all the waste waters of St Petersburg would be the quickest way to improve the state of the Baltic waters around southern Finland. From a longer time perspective, all effective load reductions at the major sources entering the Baltic Proper would also improve the state of the Gulf of Finland and adjacent waters. In Finland, the state of the coastal waters, especially in the Archipelago Sea, would also clearly improve from cuts in the nutrient loads from the largest domestic source, agriculture. According to the integrated economic-ecosystem optimization model it would be optimal to invest immediately in construction of additional wastewater treatment capacity in the city of St Petersburg, instead of aiming at major reductions in Finnish agricultural nutrient loads...|$|E

40|$|Simple {{models are}} often {{used to assess the}} {{potential}} impact of acidifying and <b>eutrophying</b> substances released during the life cycle of products. As fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity are not included in these models, environmental life-cycle assessment of products (LCA) may produce incorrect results for these impact categories. This paper outlines the spatially explicit regional air pollution information and simulation model (RAINS-LCA), which was developed for the calculation of acidification and terrestrial eutrophication potentials of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) air emissions and acidification potentials for sulfur dioxide (SO 2) air emissions for Europe and a number of European regions, taking fate, background depositions and effects into account. Two impact definitions are explored in the calculations: 1) the marginal change in the hazard index of all ecosystems in Europe and 2) the marginal change in the hazard index of ecosystems in Europe where the critical load is actually exceeded. The inclusion of fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity results in a different ranking of substances compared to simpler model outcomes. In the context of acidification, emissions of nitrogen compounds are regarded as about a factor 2 less important relative to sulfur compounds. Furthermore, using RAINS-LCA as opposed to simpler models, it was found that region-specific differences in terrestrial eutrophication and acidification potentials range up to 1. 5 and 3. 5 orders of magnitude, respectively. By means of scenario analysis, it was also shown that "only above critical load" terrestrial eutrophication and acidification potentials for the years 1995 and 2010 differ up to 0. 6 order and 1 order of magnitude, respectively. These results imply {{that it is important to}} use region-specific and time-specific acidification and terrestrial eutrophication potentials, if it is expected that life-cycle emissions of acidifying and <b>eutrophying</b> air pollutants are predominantly situated in a few (European) regions and within a specific year.

Fifty-one dominant bacterial DGGE bands were detected and 92 corresponding clones were sequenced, most of which were affiliated with bacterial phylotypes commonly found in freshwater ecosystems. Actinobacteria were detected in the centre of the lake and not at <b>eutrophied</b> sites whereas the opposite was found with respect to Verrucomicrobiales. Twenty-five dominant archaeal DGGE bands were detected and 31 corresponding clones were sequenced, most of which were affiliated with freshwater archaeal phylotypes. The bacterial community structures in the sediments of different areas with similar water quality and situation tend to be similar in Taihu Lake. This study may expand our knowledge on the relationship between the overall microbial assemblages and the development of eutrophication in the shallow freshwater lake.
