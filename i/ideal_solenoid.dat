50|$|In quantum {{mechanics}} the same particle can travel between two points {{by a variety}} of paths. Therefore, this phase difference can be observed by placing a solenoid between the slits of a double-slit experiment (or equivalent). An <b>ideal</b> <b>solenoid</b> (i.e. infinitely long and with a perfectly uniform current distribution) encloses a magnetic field B, but does not produce any magnetic field outside of its cylinder, and thus the charged particle (e.g. an electron) passing outside experiences no magnetic field B. However, there is a (curl-free) vector potential A outside the solenoid with an enclosed flux, and so the relative phase of particles passing through one slit or the other is altered by whether the solenoid current is turned on or off. This corresponds to an observable shift of the interference fringes on the observation plane.|$|E
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} energy U_em {{stored in the}} magnetic field of an <b>ideal</b> <b>solenoid</b> at rest appears for a moving observer as U'_em, a sum of magnetic and electric energies satisfying: U'_em > γ U_em. We explain this seemingly paradoxical result calculating the stresses in the solenoid structure and showing that the total energy of the solenoid transforms by the expected relativistic factor γ.

40|$|Both {{wire-wound}} solenoids and cylindrical magnets can {{be approximately}} modeled as ideal, azimuthally symmetric solenoids. We present here an exact {{solution for the}} magnetic field of an <b>ideal</b> <b>solenoid</b> in an especially easy to use form. The field is {{expressed in terms of}} a single function that can be rapidly computed by means of a compact, highly efficient algorithm, which can be coded as an add-in function to a spreadsheet, making field calculations accessible even to introductory students. In computational work these expressions are not only accurate but also just as fast as most approximate expressions. We demonstrate their utility by numerically simulating the experiment of dropping a cylindrical magnet through a nonmagnetic conducting tube and then comparing the calculation with data obtained from experiments suitable for an undergraduate laboratory.

40|$|Solenoids {{are widely}} used to {{transport}} or focus particle beams. Usually, they are assumed as being <b>ideal</b> <b>solenoids</b> with a high axial-symmetry magnetic field. Using the Vector Field Opera program, we modeled asymmetrical solenoids with realistic geometry defects, caused by finite conductor and current jumpers. Their multipole magnetic components were analyzed with the Fourier fit method; we present some possible optimized methods for them. We also discuss the effects of 'realistic' solenoids on low energy particle transport. The finding in this paper may be applicable to some lower energy particle transport system design...|$|R
40|$|The large {{aspect ratio}} of typical YBCO {{conductors}} makes them <b>ideal</b> for constructing <b>solenoids</b> from pancake style coils. An {{advantage of this}} method is that each subunit can be tested before assembly into the finished magnet. The fact that conductors are available in relatively short lengths is another reason for using such a fabrication technique. The principal drawback is {{the large number of}} joints required to connect the coils together. When very high field solenoids such as those contemplated for the muon collider are built in this way the magnetic forces between pancakes can be very large. Extensive measurements have been made on the effect of stress on short lengths of conductor, but {{there is little or no}} data on the effect of intercoil loading. The experiment described in this paper was designed to test the ability of YBCO coils to withstand these forces. A spiral wound 'pancake' coil made from YBCO coated conductor has been stressed to a pressure of 100 MPa in the axial direction at 77 K. In this case axial refers to the coil so that the force is applied to the edge of the conductor. The effect on the critical current was small and completely reversible. Repeatedly cycling the pressure had no measureable permanent effect on the coil. The small current change observed exhibited a slight hysteretic behaviour during the loading cycle...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a computer monitor of nuclear DNA {{in the form of}} chromatin fibre. The fibres are modeled as a <b>ideal</b> <b>solenoid</b> consisting of twenty helical turns with six nucleosomes per turn. The chromatin model, in combination with are Monte Carlo theory of radiation damage induces by charged particles, based on general features of tack structure and stopping power theory, has been used to evaluate the influence of DNA structure on initial damage. An interesting has emerged from our calculations. Our calculated results predict the existence of strong spatial correlations in damage sites associated with the symmetries in the solenoidal model. We have calculated spectra of short fragments of double stranded DNA produced by multiple double strand breaks induced by both high and low LET radiation. The spectra exhibit peaks at multiples of approximately 85 base pairs (the nucleosome periodicity), and approximately 1000 base pairs (solenoid periodicity). Preliminary experiments to investigate the fragment distributions from irradiated DNA, made by B. Rydberg at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, confirm the existence of short DNA fragments and are in substantial agreement with the predictions of our theory...|$|E
