5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) {{and was in}} a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E

5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|Frampton {{resigned}} from the project through pressure of work, and Drury and Pomeroy carried out the project, each contributing four monumental statues, which were installed in late 1907. On the upstream piers are Pomeroy's Agriculture, Architecture, Engineering and Pottery, whilst on the downstream piers are Drury's Science, Fine Arts, Local Government and Education. Each statue weighs approximately two tons. Despite their size, the statues are little-noticed by users of the bridge as they are not visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> itself, but only from the river banks or from passing shipping.|$|E

The closure of the bridge for major annual events has continued each year since then.|$|E

5|$|Route 413 {{begins at}} the state line, midway along the BurlingtonBristol Bridge, as a {{continuation}} of PA413.
