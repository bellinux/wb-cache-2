The Guardians Jamie Thomson posits that [...] "the Isis of old gave the impression they were enjoying their meandering jams <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> much, leaving the listener a tad lost.

500|$|Lately is {{the first}} {{extended}} play recorded by American band Ivy, released in May 1994 by Seed Records. Developed {{in the same year}} as the formation of the group, Lately is a French pop album with acoustic and general pop influences. Originally conceived by members Dominique Durand and Andy Chase, the pair recruited Adam Schlesinger for additional production and lyrics. Sessions took place in New York City and Paris, where they recorded four original tracks and a cover of Orange Juice's 1984 song [...] "I Guess I'm <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Too</b> Sensitive".|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Nitsuh Abebe was {{generally}} positive towards Lately, claiming that [...] "its five songs let their dreamier elements come {{straight from the}} [...] songwriting" [...] {{and that it is}} an example of [...] "sophisticated pop that Ivy created". Stowe from Spin was appreciative of the extended play. He wrote that Ivy was unlike other New York City bands {{in the way that they}} catered to [...] "unabashed pop melodies" [...] and later joked that the [...] "concept [...] so far out it's in"; Stowe also described their version of [...] "I Guess I'm <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Too</b> Sensitive" [...] as a [...] "charming" [...] and [...] "special treat".|$|E

[...] Robert Bianco of USA Today was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him [...] "terrific." [...] He also praised the female leads, but was concerned that Perry's role as Chandler was [...] "undefined" [...] and that LeBlanc was [...] "relying {{too much on the}} same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it." [...] The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends thought that the cast was [...] "trying <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> hard", in particular Perry and Schwimmer.|$|E

500|$|The song became {{controversial}} for its supposed {{references to}} drugs. The BBC {{announced that it}} would not broadcast [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] due to the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which, according to the corporation, advocated drug use. Other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke / somebody spoke and I went into a dream". A spokesman for the BBC stated: [...] "We have listened to this song over and over again. And we have decided that it appears to go <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> far, and could encourage a permissive attitude to drug-taking." [...] The ban was eventually lifted on 13 March 1972.|$|E
500|$|In early 1994, musicians Andy Chase and Dominique Durand met up {{to record}} music together, which would {{form the basis}} for Ivy. After enjoying several of the {{finished}} products, the pair formed the group and invited Adam Schlesinger to join them. Together they wrote and produced [...] "Get Enough" [...] which was well received by the public. According to writer Steven Blush in his book New York Rock, after Melody Maker named the track [...] "Single of the Week", work on Lately was initiated. For the project, Ivy recorded four original compositions in addition to a cover of Orange Juice's 1984 single [...] "I Guess I'm <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Too</b> Sensitive". The version of the cover that appears on Lately is slightly different compared to the one featured on Ivy's fourth studio album, Guestroom (2002); it was also the band's first cover of a song released. Coincidentally, Ivy toured with Edwyn Collins, the writer of the song, shortly after the extended play was released.|$|E
500|$|The game artists {{regularly}} drafted {{variations on}} Tali's face throughout the series' development. BioWare's position {{on whether to}} reveal her face was a long-standing internal debate, and the developers announced they were still unsure during Mass Effect 3s development. Concept artist Matt Rhodes felt it would {{interesting to see how}} players compared her personality to her appearance, and how they would respond to an appearance that challenged their expectations as [...] "a little too alien, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> repellant". They were aware that either decision would likely annoy some people, and that no reveal could universally fit all views of Tali. BioWare wished to unveil her face in a [...] "tasteful way" [...] outside of the game engine, and decided that a gift from Tali would be the best way. A stock photo was used to ensure the face's closeness to a real photograph. An in-game photo of Tali's face is available as a gift to the player-character Commander Shepard upon pursuing her Mass Effect 3 romance event tree.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Gerstmann, {{co-founder of}} Giant Bomb, felt that while Forza Motorsport 4 was a [...] "fantastic driving game" [...] it merely {{felt like an}} {{incremental}} improvement on its predecessor. [...] "I found myself getting a very 'annual sports game update' vibe off of it," [...] stated Gerstmann. Justin Calvert of GameSpot agreed; he said that Forza Motorsport 4 refines upon its predecessor, [...] "but also feels <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> familiar". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile also felt that Forza Motorsport 4 an improvement over Forza Motorsport 3, [...] "making it the absolute king of the road." [...] He cited the game's audio and visuals, the number of cars and tracks, the online play and variable skill level all as high points. However, D'Aprile felt that the Kinect implementation was [...] "a gimmick" [...] and expressed disappointment {{that there was not}} more content involving Top Gear. Matthew Kato, reviewer for Game Informer, was unimpressed by Forzas Kinect integration as well. He felt that Kinect-based racing [...] "isn’t satisfying since your arms get tired and the game controls the gas and brake for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Duane Allman {{created the}} idea of having two lead guitarists, which was {{inspired}} by Curtis Mayfield; [...] " [...] wanted the bass, keyboards, and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping," [...] said Allman. Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians. [...] "The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques, often forming intricate, interlocking patterns {{with each other and with}} the bassist, Berry Oakley, setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies." [...] Dickey Betts' playing was very melody-based; [...] "My style is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight, because I’m such a melody guy that even when I’m playing the blues, I go for melody first," [...] he said. His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably: [...] "I played mandolin, ukulele, and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar, which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from." [...] He later characterized their style as [...] "question and answer, anticipation and conclusion," [...] which involved allowing each musician's downbeat to arrive in a different spot, while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the members}} of Ivy, the release {{displayed}} Durand's [...] "heavily accented" [...] vocals and Chase and Schlesinger's [...] "pop melodies and jangly guitars". As described by Ira A. Robbins, author of The Trouser Press Guide to '90 Rocks, Ivy was attempting to bring French pop music back into the American music industry. Doing so, the lyrics–particularly any adjectives used–were summarized as [...] "lifting, wispy, and shimmering" [...] by Jay Stowe, a columnist for Spin. Chase and Schlesinger solely produced the EP, while the two plus Durand handled the lyrical aspects. The record's only single, [...] "I Hate December", was released on January 12, 1996 as a remix on a CD single. However, the release was fronted by Scratchie Records instead of Seed, as the band had departed from the latter label after completing Realistic. A music video for it was produced by Doug Werby and released sometime in 1995. Schlesinger described the inspiration behind the track as being an [...] "anti-Christian single" [...] and called the remixed version [...] "groovy". [...] "I Guess I'm <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Too</b> Sensitive" [...] is of the acoustic genre and was noted by Trouser Press's Vickie Gibbons and Robbins that Durand's pronunciation of [...] "little" [...] in the track sounds more like [...] "lee-dull".|$|E
5000|$|Game Over Online {{was more}} positive, saying it [...] "provides {{everything}} an adventure needs to provide -- no more {{and no less}} -- and is therefore worthwhile to play for that reason." [...] They praised The Mystery of the Druids for its graphics and background locations, especially those of [...] "some places, like Halligan’s office" [...] while noting that developer House of Tales [...] "made other locations look <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>too</b> regular and symmetrical to feel real." ...|$|R

[...] The following day, Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and {{came out of the}} race in good shape. He said he had no regrets, stating, [...] "I'm glad I brought him. Racing needed something like this. He almost pulled it off." [...] Regarding Zayat's talk of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man. We were all pretty disappointed... I know (Zayat) will be going back and forth... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." [...] Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, [...] "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{called it}} [...] "flat-out the best comedy {{series of the}} new season". Varietys Tony Scott had optimistic hopes for the series; he enjoyed the premise but was {{concerned}} that dialogue from the writers of Dream On should be [...] "snappier". Scott was also concerned that the Monica storyline set a bad example to younger viewers; [...] "Friends touts promiscuity and offers liberal samples of an openness that borders on empty-headedness". He singled out Cox and Schwimmer as the best actors of the ensemble. Robert Bianco was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him [...] "terrific". He also praised the female leads, but wrote that Perry's role as Chandler was [...] "undefined" [...] and that LeBlanc was [...] "relying {{too much on the}} same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it". Entertainment Weekly rates the episode B+ and states that [...] "After 22 minutes, these six people are believably set up as lifelong buddies". Ross's line, [...] "Do the words 'Billy, Don't Be a Hero' mean anything to you?" [...] is singled out as the best line of the episode. The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends call it a [...] "good, solid start to the series" [...] but [...] "the regular cast (particularly Perry and Schwimmer) might be trying <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> hard". Schwimmer recalls enjoying the physical humor involving Ross, particularly the scene where Ross greets Rachel and opens an umbrella on her.|$|E
500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} an acoustic-jazz {{version of the}} song at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria in May 15, 2011. During the song, she revealed that her record company had told her to keep new material to a minimum, {{but she said she}} wanted to air the track in full. Another piano version of the song was performed on May 21, 2011, on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, where Gaga wore a metallic black dress, knee-high boots and a semi-circular metallic headdress. The full version was first performed at the final show of American Idol season 10 on May 25, 2011, where she was joined by Clemons in person. Gaga appeared perched atop a mountain top on the [...] "Idol" [...] stage, dressed in a long cape and a bedazzled headpiece. A trio of dancers were {{at the base of the}} set performing choreographed dance steps while Gaga sang from the top. At the end of the performance, Gaga and a dancer embraced each other, took a breath and then jumped off the edge of the stage, landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks, as steam shot up high in the air. Len Melisurgo from The Star-Ledger felt that the performance was too [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] for the audience of American Idol and wondered whether Gaga [...] "went <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> far for a family-oriented show that's geared toward a younger audience?" [...] Conversely, Adam Graham from MTV News listed it as one of Gaga's most memorable television performances.

[...] He especially praised the musical segments, and the portrayal of the North Pole, writing that [...] "the way the episode kept piling more and more ridiculous horrors {{on top of each}} other kept the whole thing funny." [...] He rated the episode an [...] "A-". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the songs and the depiction of Santa's factory, though he found the delivery of the episode's message [...] "heavy-handed." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.6 out of 5 stars. She said, [...] "I had mixed feelings about this one, despite its clever moments and hopeful ending. [...] While I normally have no problems about Family Guys shocking or offensive themes, I felt bit disconcerted about the direction of this Christmas episode." [...] She went on to say, [...] "Perhaps it was the way that the series stomped on something as innocent as Santa and his elves and twisted them all around. Or perhaps it was the cannibalistic reindeer. [...] Whatever the specific reason, the irreverent nature of Family Guy seemed <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> graphic for me this time around." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number twelve on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "Christmas comedy gold", praising the 'Christmastime is Killing Us' song and Boreanaz's cameo.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, [...] "If 2001's Britney was a {{transitional}} album, capturing Spears {{at the point}} when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman." [...] Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but while Aguilera [...] "comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is {{the girl next door}} cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> recklessly, since {{this is the first time}} she can indulge herself." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "For a girl who's always seemed too sexed-up for her age, In the Zone finds Britney finally filling her britches, so-to-speak. Her little girl coquettishness actually works now—maybe because, at 21, she's finally a woman." [...] Jason King of Vibe said the album showcased a transformed Spears, [...] "no longer a girl, and all the woman any man can handle." [...] In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed the album on The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Calling it [...] "a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s", she deemed Spears as the ideal vehicle for a futuristic sound, since she was still trying to break away from her teen pop past. Schriefer praised [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime", and also stated, [...] "While the decade's history of celebrity obsession, paparazzi voyeurism and conflicted constructions of female sexuality and motherhood are written on Spears' body, the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work." ...|$|E
