500|$|All {{the things}} that {{happened}} were really inspiring, because it was frustrating ... But for me at least, every time we get really frustrated and you're hitting a wall and everything is chaos, it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> the music that much better, because you have passion—even if it's negative. That's sometimes better, actually.|$|E
500|$|In a radio {{interview}} with Philadelphia's Power 99FM, Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z spoke in depth {{about the upcoming}} intimate shows and compared her to Michael Jackson stating, [...] "I know that's blasphemy to compare the two because Mike was such an innovator, but I think she's like the second coming. You know, the hard work and dedication that she puts into her shows. It <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> {{you want to work}} harder at your own craft. She's like a machine." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I <b>Just</b> <b>Make</b> Them Up, See!" [...] is a comic poem by Isaac Asimov {{written in}} 1957.

500|$|At first I {{thought we}} were going to work on one song; that was the {{original}} plan. Let's try to work on one song and take it from there -- not spend too much time thinking about the legend, and do something that <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> sense. [...] We did one song and another song, and we were having fun making music. And actually it was a very privileged time. She wasn't under any kind of pressure, she had time to spend on it; it was the only thing she had to work on.|$|E
500|$|... "On the skewed sets I {{force the}} {{perspective}} either vertically or horizontally," [...] Willet explained. [...] "Nothing is square and, although you can't {{put your finger}} on it, it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> you feel like something is not right". [...] Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. [...] "In the real world, the colors are bright and rich," [...] Willet said. [...] "In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. [...] Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, M.I.A. voiced {{her fears}} of the {{influence}} of video game violence on her son and his generation, saying, [...] "I don't know which is worse. The fact that I saw it in my life has maybe given me lots of issues, but there's a whole generation of American kids seeing violence on their computer screens and then getting shipped off to Afghanistan. They feel like they know the violence when they don't. Not having a proper understanding of violence, especially what it's like {{on the receiving end of}} it, <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> you interpret it wrong and makes inflicting violence easier." ...|$|E

500|$|Selänne's primary {{attribute}} is his skating speed. Nicknamed the [...] "Finnish Flash", {{he uses his}} speed to evade opposition defenders. [...] According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström, [...] "He's one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and he knows where {{to be on the}} ice. Former teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère added, [...] "He's just a very elegant player. He's got a very nice stride to his skating, he plays with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm ... with the skill he has, it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> for a heck of a great player." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the sound}} of Frozen, {{director}} Jennifer Lee stated that sound played a huge part in making the film [...] "visceral" [...] and [...] "transported"; she explained, [...] "n letting it tell the story emotionally, {{the sound of}} the ice when it's at its most dangerous <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> you shudder." [...] The complete silence at the climax of the film right after Anna freezes was Lasseter's idea, one he [...] "really wanted". In that scene, even the ambient sound that would normally be there was taken out {{in order to make it}} feel unusual. Lee explained [...] "that was a moment where we wanted everything to feel suspended." ...|$|E

500|$|In AJ's first episode, {{he makes}} {{an enemy of}} Derek Branning when he and Masood crash a {{shopping}} trolley into his car. An insider said that AJ should be worried, explaining: [...] "AJ {{is a bit of}} a talker and tries to blag his way out of the situation but that <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> things even worse. Derek is quick to rough him up a little to make him realise he's not to be messed with. The confrontation really shocks AJ but he's not going to be pushed around by some bullying bloke he's just met." [...] The Daily Star said that [...] "Derek is the one person AJ really shouldn't make into an enemy", while interviewer Phillip Schofield stated: [...] "If you knock the wing mirror off Derek's Jag you are in for trouble." ...|$|E

[...] "Stowaway" [...] marked the first appearance of the character from the prime universe. Gabel described his prime universe character as someone who works for the FBI, [...] "but has no idea about Fringe Division. He's more of a desk jockey [...] eventually comes to believe there is much more than reality suggests". Executive producer Jeff Pinkner described Lincoln's introduction as [...] "insanely fun -- the characterization Seth has created <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> you smile". Gabel also indicated the new character would likely return for more episodes.|$|E
500|$|Dead Head Fred {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. [...] The game's writing and dialogue were considered the main {{strengths of the}} game, with GameSpy's reviewer stating that [...] "In the vast sea of PSP titles, Dead Head Fred stands 'head and shoulders' above the rest." [...] IGN said [...] "The tale of revenge in a dark world is twisted [...] unapologetically humorous". [...] Other publications were not as impressed, however, with one reviewer stating [...] "...the overused profanity <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> it feel like it's been designed by teenagers desperately trying to be edgy." [...] The game's supernatural themes elicited comparisons to The Darkness and Grim Fandango. GamesRadar included it in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli felt that PSP games often lacked creativity and that Dead Head Fred was the exception.|$|E

[...] It <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{personalized}} {{the film}} with several cameos. While filming in Alabama, the crew tracked down Billy Redden, {{one of the}} original banjo players from Deliverance (1972). Redden was working as a part-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to reprise his role in the Spectre vignette. As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine. But if you do – well, it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> me so happy to see him and I think other people will feel the same way." [...] Original Big Fish author Daniel Wallace makes a brief appearance as Sandra's economics teacher in the [...] "Courtship of Sandra Templeton" [...] scene.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke had {{previously}} {{written for the}} WB series Tarzan, and was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network. He used the opportunity for Supernatural, a concept he had been developing for nearly ten years. Kripke envisioned Supernatural as a road trip series, deeming it the [...] "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> so much sense to drive {{in and out of}} these stories." [...] Though the network rejected his initial pitch—a tabloid reporter investigates supernatural occurrences throughout the country—they were still interested in a series featuring urban legends. Kripke quickly suggested a Route 66-style series, and the network loved it. Filming was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on.|$|E

[...] "I was kind of doing the {{opposite}} — being nonchalant and doing other stuff and not having a routine. You get in that physical routine that <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> you ready mentally. You trick yourself into knowing that it's game time and time to play." [...] Kyle Dubas, assistant GM of the Toronto Marlies cited Emery for his mentorship towards the team. On February 5, 2016, Emery signed with Adler Mannheim of the German elite league Deutsche Eishockey Liga {{for the remainder of}} the season, thus ending his professional tryout with the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL) On March 29, 2016, he signed a tryout contract with the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and on April 1, 2016, the Philadelphia Flyers announced signing Emery {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the episode}} [...] "Something Nice Back Home", TV Guides Trish Wethman noted {{that she was}} {{intrigued}} by Lapidus' [...] "seemingly heroic antics" [...] in saving a group of the survivors from Keamy and his men, though overall was confused by the motivations of the freighter folk. Carabott wrote that Frank's return in the fifth season episode [...] "316" [...] was shocking, but seemed {{as though it was}} meant to be. He opined that: [...] "The chances of Frank being on that plane are astronomical {{and the fact that he}} was supposed to be the pilot of Flight 815 <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> the situation all the more unusual. His appearance in this episode is absurd but after four and a half seasons of Lost it makes perfect sense." [...] James Yates of the Staten Island Advance wrote that it was [...] "great" [...] to see Frank again, as he had missed the character's presence, and hoped he would play a major part upon returning to the island.|$|E
500|$|According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster {{who uses}} wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end {{disputes}} verbally instead of by force. He walks {{with a slightly}} drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: [...] "That's {{got to be the}} best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: [...] "So it would seem", in sharp contrast to what he had previously proclaimed: [...] "You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of". In the third film, while he leaves Beckett's ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks him: [...] "Do you think he plans it all out, or <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> it up as he goes along?" ...|$|E
