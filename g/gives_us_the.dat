25|$|In {{modal logic}} (which studies {{theories}} of possibility and necessity), he has argued {{in favour of}} the non-normal system S7, rather than more traditional systems such as S4 or S5. Unlike other systems, S7 allows logicians to choose between competing logics, each of which, if true, would be necessarily true, but none of which are necessarily the correct system of necessary truths. As Irvine puts it, “just as being physically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of physics, being logically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of logic. However, this leaves open the question of which logic and which consistency relation are to be adopted. S7 <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> language to discuss the possible denial of necessary truths. S7 <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> language to assert not only that some propositions really are necessary; it <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> language also to note that their denials, although impossible, remain possibly possible.” In other words, there is a mechanism in which even sets of necessary truths {{can be compared to}} their alternatives.|$|E

25|$|The Armstrong map of 1775 show a 'Laigh' {{in fairly}} close {{proximity}} to the 'Chapel'. This is in all probability Laigh Chapelton, suggesting that a dwelling existed at this date and adding strength to the supposition that Laigh Chapelton was a building, or the site of a building, of some considerable antiquity. A legal document, 'Defences for James Wilson of High Chapelton sued by John Miller of Laigh Chapelton' in 1820 <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> names of the tenants of both of these properties at this time The rental valuie circa 1820 was £180.|$|E
25|$|We {{can view}} Ω {{as a measure}} of our lack of {{knowledge}} about a system. As an illustration of this idea, consider a set of 100 coins, each of which is either heads up or tails up. The macrostates are specified {{by the total number of}} heads and tails, whereas the microstates are specified by the facings of each individual coin. For the macrostates of 100 heads or 100 tails, there is exactly one possible configuration, so our knowledge of the system is complete. At the opposite extreme, the macrostate which <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> least knowledge about the system consists of 50 heads and 50 tails in any order, for which there are 100,891,344,545,564,193,334,812,497,256 (100 choose 50) ≈ 1029 possible microstates.|$|E
25|$|Several other officiants {{served the}} oracle in {{addition}} to the Pythia.

Before 200 BC, while the temple was dedicated to Apollo, there was probably only one priest of Apollo. Priests were chosen from among the main citizens of Delphi, and were appointed for life. In addition to overseeing the oracle, priests would also conduct sacrifices at other festivals of Apollo, and had charge of the Pythian games. Earlier arrangements, before the temple became dedicated to Apollo, are not documented.|$|E

25|$|The formal {{name change}} from Templeton to Chapelton {{did not occur}} {{as a result of}} the re{{discovery}} of the St. Mary's Chapel ruins by the new landowner, James McAlister, for it had clearly never been truly lost as such. However the discovery may help provide an approximate date for the reconstruction / extension of the house at Laigh Chapelton. Paterson says in 1866 that the chapel discovery was some years before, evidence from Dobie <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> date of 1836 and Smith's evidence gives the date of 1845. Aitken shows only a Laigh Chapelton Farm in 1829 and all this suggests that the 'old' Chapelton House and estate were developed in around 1830 to 1850. The early to mid-19th century is a time during which many country houses were built, modernised or extended and OS maps show the increasing importance of the Laigh Chapelton estate around this time, with the development of formal gardens (from the 1858 OS), new driveways, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{observational}} method applied to consciousness <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> science of psychology. This {{is the basis}} and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, {{on the one hand}} from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.|$|E

[...] "If we could take every bit of energy and sweat the studio has and pour all that into the single-player campaign, it <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> resources to make something very, very cool, compared to if we would also have to divert some of our resources to making multiplayer."

Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in [...] "Sorry her lot".

[...] He continues, [...] "the bassoon and basses... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore... in the improbable key of A flat minor.... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on a good old 6/4".|$|E
500|$|The {{composer}} (and former Sibelius pupil) Leevi Madetoja further {{praised the}} score upon review, writing in Uusi Suometar in July 1914 that Sibelius, rather than [...] "repeat endlessly" [...] {{the style of}} his previous works, had yet again shown his penchant for [...] "renewing himself musically... always forward, striving for new aims". The Finnish critic Karl Wasenius (aka BIS), writing in Hufvudstadsbladet after the birthday celebration performances of 1915, wrote approvingly of Sibelius's [...] "refined mastery" [...] of technique. [...] "Not a single note is wasted on brash effects", Wasenius continued. [...] "Yet mighty things are still achieved. Sibelius <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> expanse and magnitude of the ocean, its powerful wave-song but without boastful gestures. He is too noble for that". In Tidning för musik, Otto Anderssen interpreted Sibelius's latest compositions (among them The Oceanides) as yet another indicator that {{he was among the}} most forward-looking modernists: [...] "Sibelius is, I believe, a man of the future... constantly ahead of his time. Now he stands at the heights where the horizon stretches out over fields which the rest of us cannot yet see". Cecil Gray, moreover, calls the piece [...] "daring" [...] and applauds the score's [...] "exceptional complexity and refinement", challenging critics who see Sibelius as a [...] "primitive artist".|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{idea was}} {{developed}} by head writer and co-executive producer Sally Sussman Morina. For this storyline, the soap opera partnered with the American Heart Association in order to highlight the issue of women's heart health. Executive producer Mal Young felt that the character of Jill was the [...] "perfect choice to show how a woman’s life can dramatically change {{as a result of}} heart disease." [...] He further mentioned that [...] "Along with providing us with some very emotional and dramatic episodes, the subject also <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to educate and highlight a very pertinent issue using characters our viewers know well. As well as seeing how it affects Jill as she comes to terms with her condition, the story will also illustrate how it impacts her family and those closest to her." [...] The producers considered Jill to be the right character to tackle this issue due to her being the show's longest-running character, as well as other factors: her unhealthy lifestyle, age and [...] "bullish personality that would deny anything was wrong". Following the episode where Jill is diagnosed, Walton appeared in a public service announcement urging viewers to visit the American Heart Association website. Young knew that the soap opera had to be [...] "very responsible", stating: [...] "We did not want to sensationalize this. We wanted to get the facts in {{while at the same time}} telling a good, dramatic story." ...|$|E
