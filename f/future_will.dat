5|$|The Simpsons {{drive to}} the park for a picnic but {{discover}} {{that it has been}} overrun by mosquitoes. While heading home, the family finds an Indian casino. Bart is turned away because of his age but is able to sneak in by hiding in ventriloquist Arthur Crandall's dummy case. During Crandall's performance at the casino, Bart bursts out of the case and gets caught by casino guards. He is sent to the casino manager's office, where the Native American manager shows him a vision of how his <b>future</b> <b>will</b> turn out if he does not change his ways. Thirty years into the future, Bart is a 40-year-old beer-drinking slacker trying to launch his music career after dropping out of the DeVry Institute, and has resorted to mooching off his parents and their neighbor Ned Flanders. The only gig Bart can get is at a beach bar owned by Nelson Muntz, and even then, Bart is only paid in popcorn shrimp. Bart lives with Ralph Wiggum in a beach cottage by the shore, from which Bart finds out that he has been evicted after his disastrous concert at Nelson's bar. Meanwhile, 38-year-old Lisa is the first straight female President of the United States.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to unpack the {{discourse}} on China's futures, with a particular focus upon the relationship of Chinese people and the environment. The goal is to problematise the dominant discourse, and view the issue though new perspectives. Two tools from Critical <b>Futures</b> Studies <b>will</b> be employed: Sohail Inayatullah's Causal Layered Analysis and his Futures Triangle. Two possible scenarios for China's <b>futures</b> <b>will</b> be used as a focus: Brave New China and the Harmonious Society...|$|R

50|$|The {{exchange}} offers 13,380 (as of January 20, 2016) security futures, including 2662 futures on exchange-traded {{funds and}} 1846 OCX.NoDivRisk. A OneChicago single stock futures contract is {{an agreement to}} deliver 100 shares of a specific stock at a designated date in the future, called the expiration date. In most cases, four expiration dates are available for trading OneChicago single stock futures. The traditional <b>futures</b> symbol <b>will</b> consist of the underlying ticker symbol plus “1C”. For instance, the traditional DIA <b>futures</b> <b>will</b> trade as DIA1C.|$|R

25|$|The {{relation}} between philosophy and religion lies in their common recognition of an underlying unity, which transcends all the apparent differences and divisions due to individual phenomena. Many changes must {{take place in}} the existing religions before they will be suited to modern conditions, and the resulting religion of the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be a concrete monism.|$|E

50|$|Speed {{is not a}} {{real concern}} either as <b>future</b> {{machines}} <b>will</b> be much faster, and an emulation of the UVC on a <b>future</b> machine <b>will</b> consequently run much faster. Furthermore, {{the flexibility of the}} UVC {{is more important than the}} speed of execution. Even so, performance can always still be improved.|$|R
30|$|<b>Future</b> work <b>will</b> {{focus on}} {{refining}} RAP {{in a number}} of ways. Currently, RAP avoids over provisioning resources by allocating them in increments of one. <b>Future</b> work <b>will</b> address more explicit ways to specify resource constraints, e.g., enforcing a budget based on the costs for different types of resource flavours. We will also incorporate constraints that minimize the number of resource instance migrations across applications. In this paper, we do not address the objective of balancing the number of resources among the applications for the sake of fairness [44, 45]. Objective functions based on fairness measures will be investigated in <b>future</b> work. We <b>will</b> also modify RAP to accommodate multiple resource flavours for a given tier.Finally, <b>future</b> work <b>will</b> explore experimental validation using benchmark multi-tier applications.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{a long-standing}} {{agreement}} among many experts that geological disposal can be safe, technologically feasible and environmentally sound, {{a large part}} of the general public in many countries remains skeptical. One of the challenges facing the supporters of these efforts is to demonstrate confidently that a repository will contain wastes for so long that any releases that might take place in the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> pose no significant health or environmental risk.|$|E
25|$|Many mansions/Wait till {{next year}} reply:Better {{technology}} in the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> allow computers to understand. Searle agrees that this is possible, but considers this point irrelevant. His argument is that a machine using a program to manipulate formally defined elements can't produce understanding. Searle's argument, if correct, rules out only this particular design. Searle agrees {{that there may be}} other designs that would cause a machine to have conscious understanding.|$|E

25|$|He was {{eccentric}} and careless. He {{would walk}} with pipe and paper along a thriving thoroughfare oblivious of all; his hat {{shaped like a}} French general's, peak in front and back; shoes well worn; clothes shabby, and was in meeting reticent, even timid... He treated the subject of Socialism plainly and stripped it of utopianism.... The peoples of the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> dwell in peace where this hardy pioneer warred with the accumulated prejudice, passions, and ignorance of the ages.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{proliferation}} of animal protection legislation, animals still had no legal rights. Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied {{to the idea of}} human interests, whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty, or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not damaged. The over-exploitation of fishing stocks, for example, is viewed as harming the environment for people; the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> derive no enjoyment from them; poaching results in financial loss to the owner, and so on.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} has {{gates and}} a nearby runway {{that can handle}} the Airbus A380. This capability was proven when Singapore Airlines briefly offered A380 flights to Beijing in August 2008 during the Summer Olympics. Emirates Airline has started its scheduled daily operation to Dubai as of 1 August 2010. Lufthansa has been using these facilities since October 2010 to handle up to five A380 flights per week. Several other airlines in the near <b>future</b> <b>will</b> operate the A380 out of this terminal, including Malaysia Airlines and British Airways.|$|E

25|$|God {{declared}} that God {{is the first}} and the last, and beside God there is no God, no One Who can proclaim what the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be, no other Rock. Those who fashion graven images shall not profit; they shall be shamed together. The smith makes an ax, and the carpenter forms the figure of a man. He hews down cedars and oaks, and uses the same wood for fuel to warm himself and to make a god to worship. They do not know nor understand that they strive after ashes.|$|E
25|$|Scientists and historians, for example, {{study the}} {{objective}} world, hoping to elicit {{the truth of}} nature—or perhaps the truth of history. In this way, they hope to predict how the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> unfold in accordance with these laws. In terms of history, by studying the past, the individual can perhaps elicit the laws that determine how events will unfold—in this way the individual can predict the future with more exactness and perhaps take control of events {{that in the past}} appeared to fall outside the control of humans.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, student Lucinda Embry hears whispers while {{staring at}} the Sun. When her idea to make a time capsule is chosen by the school, each child draws what they believe the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> look like. Lucinda writes a page of {{seemingly}} random numbers for the time capsule, {{which is to be}} opened in 50 years. Lucinda's teacher calls for the pupils to finish but Lucinda continues until her teacher takes the page off her desk unfinished. Lucinda goes missing after the time capsule is dedicated, and is found in a utility closet scratching numbers into the door with her fingernails bleeding.|$|E
