The Technology Selection and Operation (TSO) model enables a new approach for the optimal selection and operation of energy system technologies that encompasses whole life costing, carbon emissions as well as real-time energy prices and demands; thus, providing a more comprehensive result than current methods. Utilizing historic metered energy demands, projected energy prices and a portfolio of available technologies, the mathematical model simultaneously solves for an optimal technology selection and operational strategy for a determined building based on a preferred objective: minimizing cost and/or minimizing carbon emissions. The TSO is a comprehensive and novel techno-economic model, capable of providing decision makers an optimal selection from a portfolio of available energy technologies. The current portfolio of available technologies is composed of various {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) units. The TSO model framework is data-driven and therefore {{presents a}} high level of flexibility with respect to time <b>granularity,</b> <b>period</b> of analysis and the technology portfolio. A case study depicts the capabilities of the model; optimisation results under different temporal arrangements and technology options are showcased. Overall, the TSO model provides meaningful insights that allow stakeholders to make technology investment decisions with greater assurance...|$|E

30|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this article}} is the presentation of the influence of BSs switching granularity on the possible reductions of network energy consumption in the time domain. We show that appropriate selection of BSs switching <b>granularity</b> during different <b>periods</b> of working and weekend days can result in significant monthly energy savings. In addition, in this article, we analyze the influence of introducing higher service rates on energy savings potential. Providing higher service rates to the users results in a higher network energy consumption, even when the same energy-efficient network management is in use. Such a cognition additionally emphasizes the need for development of the holistic approaches focused on maximizing energy savings, since future cellular networks will certainly be even more throughput demanding.|$|R

As a complementary solution to detecting nodes with functionnal faults, this paper proposes FIND, a novel method to detect nodes with data faults that neither assumes a particular sensing model nor requires costly event injections. After the nodes in a network detect a natural event, FIND ranks the nodes based on their sensing readings as well as their physical distances from the event. FIND works for systems where the measured signal attenuates with distance. A node is considered faulty if there is a significant mismatch between the sensor data rank and the distance rank Theoretically, we show that average ranking difference is a provable indicator of possible data faults. FIND is extensively evaluated in simulations and two test bed experiments with up to 25 MicaZ nodes. Evaluation shows that FIND has a less than 5 % miss detection rate and false alarm rate in most noisy environments. Net...|$|R

We present an approach to automatically analyzing this data to enable personalized and scalable energy efficiency programs for private households. In particular, we de-velop and evaluate a system that uses supervised machine learning techniques to automatically estimate specific “characteristics ” of a household from its electric-ity consumption. The characteristics are related to a household’s socio-economic status, its dwelling, or its appliance stock. We evaluate our approach by analyz-ing smart meter data collected from 4, 232 households in Ireland at a 30 -minute <b>granularity</b> over a <b>period</b> of 1. 5 years. Our analysis shows that revealing charac-teristics from smart meter data is feasible, as our method achieves an accuracy of more than 70 % over all households {{for many of the}} characteristics and even exceeds 80 % for some of the characteristics. The findings are applicable to all smart metering systems without making changes to the measurement infras-tructure. The inferred knowledge paves the way for targeted energy efficiency programs and other services that benefit from improved customer insights. On the basis of these promising results, the paper discusses the potential for utilities as well as policy and privacy implications...|$|R

Bifurcation of organ fate begins between embryonic day (E) 11. 0 -E 12. 0 in mice and likely involves a dynamic transcription network that is poorly understood. To elucidate the first steps of sexual fate specification, we profiled the XX and XY gonad transcriptomes at fine <b>granularity</b> during this <b>period</b> and resolved cascades of gene activation and repression. C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) XY gonads showed a consistent ~ 5 -hour delay in the activation of most male pathway genes and repression of female pathway genes relative to 129 S 1 /SvImJ, which likely explains {{the sensitivity of the}} B 6 strain to male-to-female sex reversal. Using this fine time course data, we predicted novel regulatory genes underlying expression QTLs (eQTLs) mapped in a previous study. To test predictions, we developed an in vitro gonad primary cell assay and optimized a lentivirus-based shRNA delivery method to silence candidate genes and quantify effects on putative targets. We provide strong evidence that Lmo 4 (Lim-domain only 4) is a novel regulator of {{sex determination}} upstream of SF 1 (Nr 5 a 1), Sox 9, Fgf 9, and Col 9 a 3. This approach can be readily applied to identify regulatory interactions in other systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{management}} of supply chains in today 2 ̆ 7 s competitive business environment presents {{one of the most}} important challenges to managers. The competitiveness of products and services in the global economy is increasingly measured not only by individual product or service characteristics but also by the efficiency and effectiveness of their underlying supply chain in catering to differentiated customer requirements. Facing shrinking product life cycles, differentiation and diversification of customer requirements, and cost transparency and accountability, managers are ever eager to pursue strategic, tactical and operational initiatives that will lead to supply chain configurations that afford greater competitive advantage. In fact, the pursuit of such competitive advantage might explain recent mergers such as those of Kmart and Sears in November 2004, Proctor 2 ̆ 6 Gamble and Gillette in January 2005, Coors and Molson in January 2005, and Federated and May in April 2005. To what extent might the core strategic impetus of these mergers be more of capitalizing on potential supply chain synergies than stemming from other levers such as financial, market expansion, product line expansion or technology acquisition? In 2002, the S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 Survey indicated that improvement of supply chain operations, such as a twenty percent reduction in inventory, or a one percent decrease in operational expense can increase a company 2 ̆ 7 s stock by as much as six percent. A company 2 ̆ 7 s logistics operations comprise a significant share of overall costs and their efficiency can favorably impact the company 2 ̆ 7 s supply chain performance and its valuation. A Bain 2 ̆ 6 Company study concluded that the difference in the profitability of companies that have employed sophisticated supply chain methodologies can be as much as a factor of twelve. ^ This dissertation investigates the potential of supply chain synergistic gains brought about by a merger or an acquisition using mathematical programming models. The models are used to assess the extent to which defining characteristics of the two companies such as product structure and cost, distribution network configuration, temporal market demand patterns, and spatial market dispersion, favorably impact a potential merger. The models are used in computational studies which quantify supply chain performance in terms of truck or fleet utilization, inventory levels, and logistics costs. The computational studies examine a variety of scenarios of two prospective companies seeking to merge, to reveal the impacts of different supply chain networks, product characteristics, clustering of market regions, and the <b>granularity</b> of time <b>period</b> that defines operations on potential synergistic gains. ...|$|R
