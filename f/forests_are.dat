5|$|Maple {{and lime}} <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> found in gulleys. These <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> only present in {{isolated}} areas and {{are at risk}} of extinction. Downy oak woods are more common in the Aosta Valley area than in the Piedmont area because of its higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Oak is not a typical species in the park and it is often found mixed with Scots pine. The park's chestnut groves have been affected by human cultivation for wood and fruit. It rarely grows above 1,000 metres (3,280ft), and the most important chestnut <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> in the park's Piedmontese side. The park's conifer woods include Scots pine groves, spruce forests dominated by the Norway spruce, often mixed with larch. Larch and Swiss stone pine woods are found up to the highest sub-alpine level (2200–2300 metres (7,217-7,546ft)).|$|E
5|$|There {{is a wide}} {{diversity}} {{of plants and animals}} in South India, resulting from its varied climates and geography. Deciduous <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> found along the Western Ghats while tropical dry forests and scrub lands are common in the interior Deccan plateau. The southern Western Ghats have rainforests located at high altitudes called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests and the Malabar Coast moist <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> found on the coastal plains. The Western Ghats is one of the eight hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|Tropical dry {{deciduous}} <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> {{found in}} all parts of the plains. Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant. Large tracts of these forests have been cleared for cultivation. Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state. These <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> confined to areas which have low annual rainfall (50–70cm), a mean annual temperature of 25–27°C and low humidity.|$|E

5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially in rocky or exposed locations), the pine and fir tree <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> thinner, {{and the trees}} grow in a more stunted fashion; instead, shrubs and bushes, such as green manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E
5|$|Owners {{of forests}} planted after 31 December 1989 {{are able to}} opt into the scheme and receive units for forest sequestration. If these <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> removed from the land the owner must repay these units.|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E

This reserve <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> recently becoming polluted because of human activities of nearby Mettupalayam..|$|R
5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly into the environment. When the <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E
5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> examples of sustainable biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. Sustainability science {{is the study of}} sustainable development and environmental science.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{has four}} {{ecological}} provinces: Prairie Parkland, {{in the southwestern}} and western parts of the state; the Eastern Broadleaf Forest (Big Woods) in the southeast, extending in a narrowing strip to the state's northwestern part, where it transitions into Tallgrass Aspen Parkland; and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest, a transitional forest between the northern boreal forest and the broadleaf forests to the south. These northern <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> a vast wilderness of pine and spruce trees mixed with patchy stands of birch and poplar.|$|E
5|$|The forest areas {{suffer from}} strong {{demographic}} pressure and intensive agriculture. Some forests locally known as bouças are defined areas with maritime pines, oaks and eucalyptus plantations. <b>Forests</b> <b>are</b> still important in parishes {{surrounded by the}} Serra de Rates, whose flora is distinguished by the pedunculate oak or the european holly. In the 18th century, the monks of Tibães planted pines, which characterized the civil parish of Estela. In the past the Atlantic forest predominated, with trees such as oaks, ash trees, hazels, strawberry trees, holm oak, and alders.|$|E
5|$|The {{native forest}} in the Canberra region was almost wholly {{eucalypt}} species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials {{of a number of}} species including Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> also popular recreation areas.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for demining. Other safety-related areas receiving demining priority are settlements, commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas significant for fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism. The signs are regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles. Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Białystok Uplands of the Podlaskie Plain on {{the banks}} of the Biała River, Białystok ranks second in terms of {{population}} density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area, of the cities of Poland. It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from Central and Eastern Europe. This is facilitated by the fact that the nearby border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the Schengen Area. The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute Metropolitan Białystok. The city has a , characterized by warm summers and long frosty winters. <b>Forests</b> <b>are</b> an important part of Białystok's character, and occupy around 1,756 ha (4,340 acres) (17.2% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth most forested city in Poland.|$|E
