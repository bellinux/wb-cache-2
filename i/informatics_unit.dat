In this paper, we present scenarios for psychiatric behavioral monitoring systems to be placed in psychiatric wards to understand patients’ perception regarding privacy. Psychiatric behavioral monitoring refers to systems that are deemed useful in measuring clinical outcomes, but little research has been done on how these systems will impact patients’ privacy. Methods: We conducted a case study in one teaching hospital in Malaysia. We investigated the physical factors that influence patients’ perceived privacy with respect to a psychiatric monitoring system. The eight physical factors identified from the information system development privacy model, a comprehensive model for designing a privacy-sensitive information system, were adapted in this research. Scenario-based interviews were conducted with 25 patients in a psychiatric ward for 3 months. Results: Psychiatric patients were able to share how physical factors influence their perception of privacy. Results show how patients responded to each of these dimensions {{in the context of a}} psychiatric behavioral monitoring system. Conclusion: Some subfactors under physical privacy are modified to reflect the data obtained in the interviews. We were able to capture the different physical factors that influence patient privacy.

40|$|Postulate of {{constructing}} a provincial data bank {{to be used}} by organs of regional state administration imposes a much wider dimension of problems connected with computerization of the regional eoonomy than in the case of restricting it to definite eoonomic units. The article focusses its attention on tasks and functions of local eoonomic units representing one of problems to be solved by the head of local authorities. To obtain maximum effects from application of the information science in economic units it is indispensable to secure its common application at all levels of administration. This will lead in consecutive stages to creation of the provincial data bank allowing the head of state provincial administration to manage more effectively the activity of local economic units. Tho article discusses problems accompanying application of the <b>informatics</b> in economic <b>units</b> against the background {{of constructing}} a provincial data bank on the example of the Provincial Amalgamation of Municipal and Housing Eoonomy in Gdańsk. The scope and structure of employing an information system for management purposes in the above mentioned institution are dependent upon operational targets of the Amalgamation, multibranch character of economic units grouped within it, their different size as well as methods and techniques of data collection and processing. Taking into account the above determinants it is possible to list the basic spheres of activity in which information systems should be introduced and popularized, which will, in turn, pave the way for creation of the provincial data bank.

40|$|Background: Depression {{is common}} in many chronic {{physical}} health disorders but {{the nature and extent}} of physical health comorbidities in depression, particularly within large population-based samples of patients, and how these comorbidities relate to factors such as age, gender and social deprivation, is unknown. We aimed to assess {{the nature and extent of}} multiple physical health comorbidities in primary care patients with depression within a large and representative Scottish dataset. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study secondary data analysis of 314 primary care practices in Scotland (from the Primary Care Clinical <b>Informatics</b> <b>Unit</b> at the University of Aberdeen, March 31, 2007), including 143, 943 people with depression and 1, 280, 435 controls.

Depression was defined as a Read Code for depression recorded within last year and/or four or more antidepressant prescriptions (excluding low dose tricyclics) within the last year. Findings: Individuals in primary care with depression were significantly more likely than individuals without depression to have every one of the 32 comorbid physical conditions we assessed, even after adjusting for age, gender and deprivation. The depression group were also significantly more likely to have multiple levels of comorbidity, including two physical health conditions (OR 1 • 55, 95...|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in video surveillance {{has increased in}} recent years. Cameras are now installed in e. g. stores, arenas and prisons. The video data is analyzed to detect abnormal or undesirable events such as thefts, fights and escapes. At the <b>Informatics</b> <b>Unit</b> at the division of Information Systems, FOI in Linköping, algorithms are developed for automatic detection and tracking of humans in video data. This thesis deals with the target tracking problem when a 3 D camera is used. A 3 D camera creates images whose pixels represent the ranges to the scene. In recent years, new camera systems have emerged where the range images are delivered at up to video rate (30 Hz). One goal of the thesis is to determine how range data affects {{the frequency with which}} the measurement update part of the tracking algorithm must be performed. Performance of the 2 D tracker and the 3 D tracker are evaluated with both simulated data and measured data from a 3 D camera. It is concluded that the errors in the estimated image coordinates are independent of whether range data is available or not. The small angle and the relatively large distance to the target explains the good performance of the 2 D tracker. The 3 D tracker however shows superior tracking ability (much smaller tracking error) if the comparison is made in the world coordinates...|$|E
40|$|Background: The UK's NHS {{intends to}} move from the current Read code system to the international, {{detailed}} Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) to facilitate more clinically appropriate coding of conditions and associated risk factors and outcomes. Given concerns about coding behaviour of general practitioners, we sought to study the current coding patterns in allergies and identify lessons for the future migration to SNOMED-CT. Methods: Data from 2 014 551 primary care consultations in over 100 000 patients with one or more of 11 potentially allergic diseases (anaphylaxis, angioedema, asthma, conjunctivitis, drug allergies, eczema, food allergy, rhinitis, urticaria, venom allergy and other probable allergic disorders) from the Scottish Primary Care Clinical <b>Informatics</b> <b>Unit</b> Research (PCCIU-R) database were descriptively analysed and visualized to understand Read code usage patterns. Results: We identified 352 Read codes for these allergic diseases, but only 36 codes (10 %) were used in 95 % of consultations; 73 codes (21 %) were never used. Half of all usage was for Quality and Outcomes Framework codes for asthma. Despite 149 detailed codes (42 %) being available for allergic triggers, these were infrequently used. Conclusions: This analysis of Read codes use suggests that introduction of the more detailed SNOMED-CT, in isolation, will not improve the quality of allergy coding in Scottish primary care. The introduction of SNOMED-CT should be accompanied by initiatives aimed at improving coding quality, such as the definition of terms/codes, the availability of terminology browsers, a recommended list of codes and mechanisms to incentivize detailed coding of the condition and the underlying allergic trigger...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs {{are widely used}} as analgesics and the former is a {{preventative}} agent for vascular events. It is unclear whether their long-term use affects cancer risk. Data on the chemopreventative role of these drugs on the mortality in patients with upper aerodigestive tract cancer (UADT) are insufficient. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of aspirin and other NSAIDs on survival in UADT cancer patients. METHODS: An observational cohort study of patients with UADT cancer was undertaken using Primary Care Clinical <b>Informatics</b> <b>Unit</b> (PCCIU) database of electronic medical records in Scotland. Information was available on all prescriptions of aspirin and other NSAIDs before and after diagnosis. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Cox regression was used for statistical data analysis. RESULTS: There were 2392 patients diagnosed with UADT cancer between 1996 and 2010. Mean age of patients was 66 years (SD 12) and most were male (63 %). Median survival in head and neck (HNC) patients was 94 months, while median survival in oesophageal cancer patients was 10 months. For HNC improved survival was observed with aspirin prescription (ever vs never hazard ratio (HR) 0. 56 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 0. 44, 0. 71), there was no association with Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors (COX- 2) prescriptions. Improved survival was observed with other NSAIDs prescription (ever vs never HR 0. 74 95 % CI 0. 60, 0. 90). For oesophageal cancer patients, improved survival was observed with aspirin prescriptions (ever vs never HR 0. 54 95 % CI 0. 45, 0. 64), COX- 2 prescriptions (HR 0. 78 95 % CI 0. 62, 0. 98) and other NSAIDs (HR 0. 67 95 % CI 0. 56, 0. 80).

Data on the chemopreventative role of these drugs on {{the risk of the}} upper aerodigestive tract cancer (UADT) are insufficient and mostly refer to oesophageal cancer. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of aspirin and other NSAIDs on the risk of UADT cancers. Methods:A nested case-control study using the Primary Care Clinical <b>Informatics</b> <b>Unit</b> (PCCIU) database. Conditional logistics regression was used for data analysis. Results:There were 2392 cases of UADT cancer diagnosed between 1996 and 2010 and 7165 age-, gender- and medical practice-matched controls from 131 general medical practices. Mean age of cases was 66 years (s. d. 12) and most were male (63 %). Aspirin was prescribed in a quarter of cases and controls, COX- 2 inhibitors in 4 % of cases and 5 % of controls and other NSAIDs in 33 % of cases and 36 % of controls. Aspirin prescription was associated with a nonsignificant risk reduction of cancer of UADT (adjusted OR= 0. 9, 95 % CI= 0. 8, 1. 0), head and neck (HN; adjusted OR= 0. 9, 95 % CI= 0. 7, 1. 1) or the oesophagus (adjusted OR= 0. 8, 95 % CI= 0. 7, 1. 0).

The primary objective {{of this study was to}} assess the utility of unplanned medication discontinuation as a signal for possible ADRs in children and young people. Using orlistat as an exemplar, all orlistat prescriptions issued to patients up to 18 years of age together with patient characteristics, prescription duration, co-prescribed medicines and recorded clinical (Read) codes were identified from the Primary Care <b>Informatics</b> <b>Unit</b> database between 1 st Jan 2006 - 30 th Nov 2009. Binary logistic regression was used to assess association between characteristics and discontinuation. During the study period, 79 patients were prescribed orlistat (81 % female, median age 17 years). Unplanned medication discontinuation rates for orlistat were 52 % and 77 % at 1 and 3 -months. Almost 20 % of patients were co-prescribed an anti-depressant. One month unplanned medication discontinuation was significantly lower in the least deprived group (SIMD 1 - 2 compared to SIMD 9 - 10 OR 0. 09 (95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 83)) and those co-prescribed at least one other medication. At 3 months, discontinuation was higher in young people (≥ 17 yr versus, OR 3. 07 (95 % CI 1. 03 - 9. 14)). Read codes were recorded for digestive, respiratory and urinary symptoms around the time of discontinuation for 24 % of patients. Urinary retention was reported for 7. 6 % of patients. Identification of unplanned medication discontinuation using large primary care datasets may be a useful tool for pharmacovigilance signal generation and detection of potential ADRs in children and young people...|$|E
40|$|Three years {{experience}} in teaching an introductory health <b>informatics</b> <b>unit</b> and an attitude survey of first year health science students last year has highlighted {{the fact that}} some students are very proficient computers users, others have never used one. Furthermore just over 50 % of these first year students were found to have a negative attitude towards the use of computers and/or to have a fear of using them. A survey of a random selection of first year students at the Rockhampton campus was conducted during week 1 of the first term in 1999. Our aim was to establish the extent of variation in levels of knowledge about computers, competence in using computers and attitudes towards using computers amongst first year students at CQU. Of particular interest was the extent and type of differences that may exist between those students entering the health professions especially nursing and all other first year students. The survey tool adopted for this study was one which was adapted from a tool developed by the Institute of Computer Based Learning by Marlene Sinclair and Prof. John Gardner from the Queen’s University of Belfast. For our data analysis we used the same factor analysis protocols as devised by these researchers and a chi square statistic as appropriate. This study revealed significant differences on the basis of course studied and gender on all parameters studied. Both female students and the health group had the lowest mean score. Other groups had a higher proportion of female students yet scored better than the health group. It may be that Nursing students in particular have a stronger feminine orientation than the average beginning female student. This warrants further research.

Methods and results Data were obtained from the Primary Care Clinical <b>Informatics</b> <b>Unit</b> from a database of 1. 75 million people registered with 393 general practices in Scotland. Sex-specific survival modelling was undertaken using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for potential confounders. A total of 56 658 subjects were eligible for inclusion in the study. These represented a total of 147 938 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up: 2. 04 years). In men, HF (reference group; 5 -year survival: 55. 8 %) had worse mortality outcomes than prostate cancer [hazard ratio (HR) 0. 61, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 57 – 0. 65; 5 -year survival: 68. 3 %], and bladder cancer (HR 0. 88, 95 % CI 0. 81 – 0. 96; 5 -year survival: 57. 3 %), but better outcomes than lung cancer (HR 3. 86, 95 % CI 3. 65 – 4. 07; 5 -year survival: 8. 4 %) and colorectal cancer (HR 1. 23, 95 % CI 1. 16 – 1. 31; 5 -year survival: 48. 9 %). In women, HF (reference group; 5 -year survival: 49. 5 %) had worse mortality outcomes than breast cancer (HR 0. 55, 95 % CI 0. 51 – 0. 59; 5 -year survival 77. 7 %), but better outcomes than colorectal cancer (HR 1. 21, 95 % CI 1. 13 – 1. 29; 5 -year survival 51. 5 %), lung cancer (HR 3. 82, 95 % CI 3. 60 – 4. 05; 5 -year survival 10. 4 %), and ovarian cancer (HR 1. 98, 95 % CI 1. 80 – 2. 17; 5 -year survival 38. 2 %).

In men, heart failure (reference group; 5 yrs survival 37. 7 %) had worse mortality outcomes than patients with prostate cancer (HR 0. 61, 95 %CI 0. 57 - 0. 65; 5 yrs survival 49. 0 %), and bladder cancer (HR 0. 88, 95 %CI 0. 81 - 0. 96; 5 yrs survival 36. 5 %), but better than lung cancer (HR 3. 86, 95 %CI 3. 65 - 4. 07; 5 yrs survival 2. 8 %) and colorectal cancer (HR 1. 23 95 %CI 1. 16 - 1. 31; 5 yrs survival 25. 9 %). In women, patients with HF (reference group; 5 yrs survival 31. 9 %) had worse mortality outcomes than patients with breast cancer (HR 0. 55 95 %CI 0. 51 - 0. 59; 5 yrs survival 61. 0 %), but better outcomes than lung cancer (HR 3. 82, 95 %CI 3. 60 - 4. 05; 5 yrs survival 3. 6 %), ovarian cancer (HR 1. 98, 95 %CI 1. 80 - 2. 17; 5 yrs survival 19 %) and colorectal cancer (HR 1. 21, 95 %CI 1. 13 - 1. 29; 5 yrs survival 28. 4 %). Conclusions: Despite advances in management, heart failure remains as ‘malignant’ as some of the common cancers in both men and women...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy at the University of LutonThe work described in this thesis {{is based on the}} results of a clinical trial conducted by the research team at the Medical <b>Informatics</b> <b>Unit</b> of the University of Cambridge, which show that the Ballistocardiogram (BCG) has prognostic value in detecting impaired left ventricular function before it becomes clinically overt as myocardial infarction leading to sudden death. The objective of this study is to develop and demonstrate a framework for realising an on-line BCG signal classification model in a portable device that would have the potential to find pathological signs as early as possible for home health care. Two new on-line automatic BeG classification models for time domain BeG classification are proposed. Both systems are based on a two stage process: input feature extraction followed by a neural classifier. One system uses a principal component analysis neural network, and the other a discrete wavelet transform, to reduce the input dimensionality. Results of the classification, dimensionality reduction, and comparison are presented. It is indicated that the combined wavelet transform and MLP system has a more reliable performance than the combined neural networks system, in situations where the data available to determine the network parameters is limited. Moreover, the wavelet transfonn requires no prior knowledge of the statistical distribution of data samples and the computation complexity and training time are reduced. Overall, a methodology for realising an automatic BeG classification system for a portable instrument is presented. A fully paralJel neural network design for a low cost platform using field programmable gate arrays (Xilinx's XC 4000 series) is explored. This addresses the potential speed requirements in the biomedical signal processing field. It also demonstrates a flexible hardware design approach so that an instrument's parameters can be updated as data expands with time. To reduce the hardware design complexity and to increase the system performance, a hybrid learning algorithm using random optimisation and the backpropagation rule is developed to achieve an efficient weight update mechanism in low weight precision learning. The simulation results show that the hybrid learning algorithm is effective in solving the network paralysis problem and the convergence is much faster than by the standard backpropagation rule. The hidden and output layer nodes have been mapped on Xilinx FPGAs with automatic placement and routing tools. The static time analysis results suggests that the proposed network implementation could generate 2. 7 billion connections per second performance...|$|E
