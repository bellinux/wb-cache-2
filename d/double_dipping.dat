5|$|The {{behavior}} of double-dipping involves consuming chips and dip, taking {{a bite of}} the chip, and then re-dipping it into a dip. In March 2013, Tostitos, a U.S. brand of tortilla chips and dips, hired the Ketchum communications agency to perform a survey concerning <b>double</b> <b>dipping</b> that polled over 1,000 Americans. The survey found that 46% of male participants double-dip at a party, compared to 32% of females. 54% stated {{that they would not}} consume dip after seeing another person double-dip, and 22% stated that they did not care. 25% stated that they would verbally object to a person caught double-dipping.|$|E

25|$|As a councilman, one of Fulop's main {{interests}} was ethics reform. In September 2007, {{he proposed}} {{legislation that would}} have restricted use of city vehicles and property, banned officials from holding multiple elected or appointed positions in government, instituted business and income transparency requirements for elected officials and barred people from lobbying an entity in which they serve. This legislation was rejected by a 6–1–1 vote. Fulop then proposed that Jersey City voters {{have the opportunity to}} institute new ethics reform measures by voting on two referendums. The first referendum would prevent elected officials or government employees from collecting more than one taxpayer-financed salary, a practice known as <b>double</b> <b>dipping.</b> By state law, one cannot stop an individual from serving multiple government positions by popular vote, but since state law allows a municipality to hold back a paycheck and benefits if voted on by referendum, it is possible to change the pay structures at the local level to ensure that there is less incentive to collect multiple paychecks and pensions. The second referendum would make it illegal for any entity that does business with the city, such as a developer or contractor, to make a political contribution to a local candidate for a one-year period. This would prohibit those with a specific interest in controlling a singular aspect of local government from bankrolling a local elected official who may have the power to influence that specific interest.|$|E

It consists of a sachet of two sherbet powders (orange and cherry flavoured), with a lollipop for dipping. The idea for the product came from the company's desire to create a product that was distinct, unique, and interactive.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we present {{measurements}} on Cr/Au contacted long-channel (∼ 10 µm) graphene transistors on Si/SiO 2 substrate and we report the observation of hysteresis as well as <b>double</b> <b>dips</b> in the transfer characteristics. Charge trapped in the surrounding dielectric and in particular in silanol groups at the SiO 2 surface is at {{the origin of the}} hysteresis; while, the gradient of carriers along the channel caused by electron transfer from the graphene to the Au/Cr contacts and the band shift induced by the backgate voltage and the SiO 2 -trapped charge are proposed to account for the <b>double</b> <b>dip</b> feature. We show in particular that p–n junctions are spontaneously formed by charge transfer between the graphene and the electrodes and that a double Dirac point can be achieved when low-resistivity contacts are fabricated. We further clarify the role of charge stored at the SiO 2 interface {{in the formation of the}} <b>double</b> <b>dip</b> and we propose partial charge pinning at the contacts to explain the current saturation observed at high back-gate voltages. Accordingly, a phenomenological modeling of experimental data is successfully implemented. We finally show that the hysteresis, enhanced by a <b>double</b> <b>dip,</b> can conveniently be exploited to build graphene-based memory devices...|$|R

50|$|The Jack Rabbit {{was built}} shortly after Miller {{patented}} a new track design in 1921 (which all wooden coasters built since have used).

It is most well known for its <b>double</b> <b>dip</b> following the lift hill. The <b>double</b> <b>dip</b> produces strong airtime that makes the rider feel {{that they will be}} thrown from the seat, and a feeling that the train leaves the track (it rises up but the upstop wheels keep it firmly on the rails).|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} origin of an {{additional}} dip other than the charge neutrality point observed in the transfer characteristics of graphene-based field-effect transistors with a Si/SiO 2 substrate used as the back-gate. The <b>double</b> <b>dip</b> is proved to arise from charge transfer between the graphene and the metal electrodes, while charge storage at the graphene/SiO 2 interface can make it more evident. Considering a different Fermi energy from the neutrality point along the channel and partial charge pinning at the contacts, we propose a model which explains all the features observed in the gate voltage loops. We finally show that the <b>double</b> <b>dip</b> enhanced hysteresis in the transfer characteristics can be exploited to realize graphene-based memory devices...|$|R

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{attributes}} of atomised spraying is giving excellent tip coverage to components. When conformal coatings are applied to a PCB they {{have a tendency to}} slump. The first layer of a coating can give a thin edge on the corner of components. This can be countered with a second coat through <b>double</b> <b>dipping</b> or over brushing but this is a repeat process and may not be acceptable. To counter this problem the technique of atomised spraying can be used.|$|E
50|$|A {{dual mandate}} is the {{practice}} in which elected officials serve {{in more than one}} elected or other public position simultaneously. This practice is sometimes known as double jobbing in Britain (not to be confused with <b>double</b> <b>dipping</b> in the United States, i.e. being employed by and receiving a retirement pension from the same public authority at the same time). Thus, if someone who is already mayor of a town or city councillor becomes elected as MP or senator at the national or state legislature and retains both positions, this is a dual mandate.|$|E
