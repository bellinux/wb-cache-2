40|$|AbstractWe prove a {{canonical}} (unrestricted) {{version of}} Deuber's partition theorem for (m, p, c) -sets (Math. Z. 133 (1973), 109 – 123). This implies a canonical result for partition regular systems of linear equations studied by Rado (Math. Z. 36 (1933), 424 – 480). This {{is a common}} generalization of former results of Erdös and Graham (<b>Enseign.</b> Math. 28 (1980)) concerning arithmetic progressions and of Prömel and Voigt (J. Combin. Theory Ser.

We express any modular form of nebentypus of level Nℓm as an ℓ-adic modular form of level N. We extend Ribet's Theorem (2. 1) in [8] on modℓ Galois representations for odd characteristics {{to the case}} of characteristic 2. Finally, we give another method using rigid analysis...|$|E

Let Ap(P) be the {{partially ordered set}} (poset for short) of all non-trivial elementary abelian subgroups of P ordered by inclusion and let Ap(P) ⩾ 2 be the poset of all elementary abelian subgroups of P of rank at least 2. In [Serge Bouc, Jacques Thévenaz, The poset of elementary abelian subgroups of rank at least 2, Monogr. <b>Enseign.</b> Math. 40 (2008) 41 – 45], Bouc and Thévenaz proved that Ap(P) ⩾ 2 has the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres (of possibly different dimensions). The general objective {{of this paper is}} to obtain more refined information on the homotopy type of the posets Ap(P) and Ap(P) ⩾ 2. We give three different kinds of results in this direction. Firstly, we compute exactly the homotopy type of Ap(P) ⩾ 2 when P is a p-group with a cyclic derived subgroup, that is we give the number of spheres occurring in each dimension in Ap(P) ⩾ 2. Secondly, we compute a sharp upper bound on the dimension of the spheres occurring in Ap(P) ⩾ 2 and give information on the p-groups for which this bound is reached. Thirdly, we determine explicitly for which of the p-groups with a cyclic derived subgroup the poset Ap(P) is homotopically Cohen–Macaulay...|$|E
40|$|On the {{classification}} of complex Leibniz superalgebras with characteristic sequence (n − 1, 1 |m 1, [...] ., mk) and nilindex n + m. (English summary) J. Algebra Appl. 8 (2009), no. 4, 461 – 475. Lie superalgebras are a generalization of Lie algebras. The notion of Leibniz algebra was introduced in [J. -L. Loday, <b>Enseign.</b> Math. (2) 39 (1993), no. 3 - 4, 269 – 293; MR 1252069 (95 a: 19004) ], and can be generalized to Leibniz superalgebras. The elementary properties of Leibniz superalgebras were obtained in [S. A. Albeverio, S. A. Ayupov and B. A. Omirov, Comm. Algebra 33 (2005), no. 1, 159 – 172; MR 2128158 (2005 m: 17002) ]. The description of nilpotent Leibniz superalgebras of maximal nilindex is not difficult and was done in [S. A. Albeverio, S. A. Ayupov and B. A. Omirov, op. cit. ]. The description of Leibniz superalgebras with dimensions of the even and odd parts equal to n and m, respectively, and of nilindex n + m is very problematic. The Lie superalgebras case was classified in [J. R. Gómez Martin, Yu. B. Khakimdzhanov and R. M. Navarro, J. Geom. Phys. 51 (2004), no. 4, 473 – 486; MR 2085347 (2005 f: 17010) ]. Solving the problem of description of Leibniz superalgebras of nilindex n + m is very difficult; for this reason, some restrictions on the characteristic sequence should be added. In the present paper...|$|E
