5|$|An aria for soprano II and obbligato violin {{express the}} praise and adoration of God in vivid coloraturas. It {{has been argued}} that Bach might <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the Dresden taste and the {{specific}} voice of Faustina Bordoni.|$|E
5|$|Jansson (1987) {{notes that}} at the time of the inscription, {{everyone}} who read the lines would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Ragnarök and the allusion that the father found fitting as an expression of his grief.|$|E
5|$|Viewing elves {{as being}} more or less like people, and more or less outside Christian cosmology. The Icelanders who copied the Poetic Edda did not {{explicitly}} try to integrate elves into Christian thought. Likewise, the early modern Scottish people confessed to encountering elves seem not to <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> themselves as having dealings with the Devil. Nineteenth-century Icelandic folklore about elves mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community, {{that may or may}} not be Christian. It is possible that stories were sometimes told from this perspective as a political act, to subvert the dominance of the Church.|$|E

25|$|Svetlana was baptised {{into the}} Russian Orthodox Church on 20 March 1963. During her years of exile, she flirted with various religions. She {{then turned to}} the Greek Orthodox church and is also {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> becoming a nun.|$|E
25|$|The {{mention of}} the son's longing to eat with the swine in Luke 15:16 could refer to how the Pharisees viewed the sinners (and Christ, for eating with them) in Luke 15:2. The Pharisees, caught up in their ideas of ritual cleanliness, might <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> these people as filthy pigs.|$|E
60|$|It {{might have}} been well for Mr Dombey, if he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his own dignity a little less; and <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the great origin and purpose of the {{ceremony}} in which he took so formal and so stiff a part, a little more. His arrogance contrasted strangely with its history.|$|R

25|$|When {{designing}} the eastern facade facing the Logården, Tessin {{is believed to}} <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a Roman country villa, with stairs from the palace garden up to the palace gate. The model for the central part, with colossal pilasters between {{the windows of the}} two top floor and the rustic ground floor, are presumed to be Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi in Rome.|$|E
25|$|The {{illusion}} {{had been}} maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence {{of those whose}} job it was to clear away the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908. No-one would again dare {{to look at a}} Puvis de Chavannes or read Balzac. No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> entering.|$|E
25|$|In Classical Antiquity, {{the inquiry}} into the {{workings}} of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investigations known as natural philosophy. The ancient people who are considered the first scientists may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> themselves as natural philosophers, as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers).|$|E
6000|$|For {{the first}} time a {{conscientious}} doubt arose in Edward's mind as to the justice of the course he was pursuing in resolving to refuse the alternative offered by Miss Aldclyffe. Could it be selfishness as well as independence? How much he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his own heart, how little he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his father's peace of mind! ...|$|R

25|$|The song is sung by a {{young man}} to his lover, and is about his plans of growing old {{together}} with her. Although the theme is ageing, {{it was one of}} the first songs McCartney wrote, when he was 16. It was in the Beatles setlist in their early days as a song to perform when their amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off. Both George Martin and Mark Lewisohn speculated that McCartney may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the song when recording began for Sgt. Pepper in December 1966 because his father turned 64 earlier that year.|$|E
25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. I went to London {{with her in}} 1933. Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it. I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that you know. I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} science in {{classical}} antiquity encompasses both those inquiries into {{the workings of the}} universe aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and those abstract investigations known as natural philosophy. The ancient peoples who are considered the first scientists may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> themselves as natural philosophers, as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers). The encyclopedic works of Aristotle, Archimedes, Hippocrates, Galen, Ptolemy, Euclid, and others spread throughout the world. These works and the important commentaries on them were the wellspring of science.|$|E

500|$|During {{the last}} aria, [...] "" [...] (Be faithful, all pain), the trumpet plays the chorale tune [...] "" [...] as a Bach may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the stanza [...] "Weicht, ihr Trauergeister" [...] (Go away, mournful spirits). The {{form of the}} aria follows the bar form of the chorale {{instead of the usual}} [...] form.|$|E
500|$|Moon's {{style of}} {{drumming}} was considered unique by his bandmates, although they sometimes found his unconventional playing frustrating; Entwistle {{noted that he}} tended to play faster or slower according to his mood. [...] "He wouldn't play across his kit," [...] he later added. [...] "He'd play zig-zag. That's why he had two sets of tom-toms. He'd move his arms forward like a skier." [...] Daltrey said that Moon [...] "just instinctively put drum rolls in places that other people would never <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> putting them." ...|$|E
500|$|Khánh's actions left {{divisions}} {{among the}} {{officers of the}} ARVN who became dissatisfied with him. When Khánh was himself deposed in 1965, he handed over dossiers proving that the four generals were innocent; the original documents that Khánh claimed proved his accusations of neutralism were neither presented to nor found by anyone. Robert Shaplen said that [...] "the case...continued {{to be one of}} Khánh's biggest embarrassments". Nevertheless, despite what the South Vietnamese public may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him, Khánh enjoyed continuing confidence among the Americans until the latter part of 1964.|$|E

500|$|Hayden, {{while not}} the only person to <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{creating}} a park in the region, was its first and most enthusiastic advocate. He believed in [...] "setting aside the area as a pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people" [...] and warned that there were those who would come and [...] "make merchandise of these beautiful specimens". Worrying the area could face the same fate as Niagara Falls, he concluded the site should [...] "be as free as the air or Water." [...] In his report to the Committee on Public Lands, he concluded that if the bill failed to become law, [...] "the vandals who are now waiting to enter into this wonder-land, will in a single season despoil, beyond recovery, these remarkable curiosities, which have required all the cunning skill of nature thousands of years to prepare".|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{indications}} of close relations between Kent and the Franks. Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha certainly connected the two courts, {{although not as}} equals: the Franks would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Æthelberht as an under-king. There is no record that Æthelberht ever accepted a continental king as his overlord and, as a result, historians are divided on {{the true nature of}} the relationship. Evidence for an explicit Frankish overlordship of Kent comes from a letter written by Pope Gregory the Great to Theuderic, king of Orléans, and Theudebert, king of Metz. The letter concerned Augustine's mission to Kent in 597, and in it Gregory says that he believes [...] "that you wish your subjects in every respect to be converted to that faith in which you, their kings and lords, stand". It may be that this is a papal compliment, rather than a description of the relationship between the kingdoms. It also has been suggested that Liudhard, Bertha's chaplain, was intended as a representative of the Frankish church in Kent, which also could be interpreted as evidence of overlordship.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Berman of THEM Anime Reviews {{rated the}} anime {{adaptation}} of Twin Spica {{five out of}} five stars but told readers, [...] "Subtract a star if you don't like anime that have a somewhat slow pace." [...] Berman praised its artistic design and noted that the character designs reminded her of works by Studio Ghibli. She found the characters [...] "likeable" [...] and saw Marika Ukita as the most intriguing character. Despite her praises, Berman noted one weakness in the anime adaptation. She observed the ending as [...] "a rather open-ended one, and while it wasn't a bad ending, they probably should <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> something better". Similar to the manga, the anime series was seen as gender neutral. Sony Pictures Entertainment vice president Todd Miller stated that Twin Spica {{was one of the}} titles aired on Animax which appealed to both genders. The first episode of the drama series aired with a 3.4 percent domestic viewership rating. Reviewers from the Yomiuri Shimbun rated the live-action adaptation an average two out of three stars and ranked it third overall among 11 series airing in summer 2009.|$|E
