5|$|The general's {{stance on}} human rights issues has also been quite controversial. It has been {{reported}} that he was behind the Army's refusal to provide any information on the 1984 massacre at the village of Putis. Requests issued on June 2008 by prosecutor Rubén López for a detailed report on the military personnel deployed there at that time were answered the following month by the Defense Ministry stating that the Army did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>information</b> on the subject in its archives. Donayre also joined a campaign to raise funds to defend armed forces personnel accused of committing human rights abuses during the internal conflict in Peru.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 September 1942, Pius XII {{received}} a letter from Monsignor Montini (future Pope Paul VI), saying, [...] "the massacres of the Jews reach frightening proportions and forms." [...] Later that month, Myron Taylor, U.S. representative to the Vatican, warned Pius that the Vatican's [...] "moral prestige" [...] was being injured by silence on European atrocities, a warning which was echoed simultaneously by representatives from the United Kingdom, Brazil, Uruguay, Belgium, and Poland. Myron C. Taylor passed a US Government memorandum to Pius on 26 September 1942, outlining intelligence received from the Jewish Agency for Palestine which said that Jews from across the Nazi Empire were being systematically [...] "butchered". Taylor asked if the Vatican might <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>information</b> which might [...] "tend to confirm the reports", and if so, what the Pope {{might be able to do}} to influence public opinion against the [...] "barbarities". Cardinal Maglione handed Harold Tittmann a response to the letter on 10 October. The note thanked Washington for passing on the intelligence, and confirmed that reports of severe measures against the Jews had reached the Vatican from other sources, though it had not been possible to [...] "verify their accuracy". Nevertheless, [...] "every opportunity is being taken by the Holy See, however, to mitigate the suffering of these unfortunate people". In December 1942, when Tittmann asked Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione if Pius would issue a proclamation similar to the Allied declaration [...] "German Policy of Extermination of the Jewish Race", Maglione replied that the Vatican was [...] "unable to denounce publicly particular atrocities." [...] Pius XII directly explained to Tittman that he could not name the Nazis without at the same time mentioning the Bolsheviks.|$|E

Operation Conifer has cost the taxpayer approximately £900,000 and contains 17 personnel. Its activities - such as raiding the offices of satirical magazine Private Eye due to cartoons mocking Heath's sexuality in the 1970s - have been called into question. Richard Ingrams, {{the editor of the}} Eye at the time, said to the Mail on Sunday that [...] "The policemen ... wanted to know whether I <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>information</b> on Mr. Heath".
