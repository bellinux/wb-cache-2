At the station, the troopers try to decide what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> and one takes his picture. Two other deformed people enter the station, kill the troopers and take the boy.|$|E
5|$|Martha {{discovers that}} Hugo {{is part of}} a people {{smuggling}} racket and she tells him that she wants nothing more to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Martha then believes that she has witnessed Hugo's murder. She later discovers that he is alive and that he went into a witness protection programme. Some criminals come after Hugo and his family. Martha, Xavier and Gina Austin (Sonia Todd) are captured and held hostage. Hugo and Tony manage to overcome the criminals and the others manage to free themselves from drowning in a tank at Martha's farm.|$|E
5|$|Chulip {{puts the}} {{player in the}} role of a young man who has just moved to a new town and next door to the girl of his dreams. Although she wants nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> due to his family's poor {{economic}} status, he decides to write her a heartfelt love letter. When the letter is stolen, {{it is up to the}} protagonist to travel around the village and retrieve all of its pieces. The gameplay of Chulip revolves around improving the player's reputation with the citizens in order to access all parts of the town. To do this, the player must impress each member of the community and then kiss them.|$|E

5|$|Chépart {{himself was}} taken captive by the Natchez, {{who were at}} first unsure what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> but finally decided {{that he should be}} killed by a stinkard—a member of the lowest caste in the tribe's hierarchy. The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was {{employed}} by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground. Just as Governor Bienville had done with the executed Indians in 1717 and 1723, the Natchez beheaded the dead Frenchmen and brought the severed heads for the Great Sun to view.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Vash's arrival, {{the station}} begins to {{experience}} similar power failures. In the meantime, Q appears to Vash, apparently infatuated with her. Q {{was the one}} who transported Vash to the Gamma Quadrant two years earlier, but now she wants nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> much to Q's annoyance. When Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) asks Vash out for dinner, a jealous Q uses his powers to send Bashir off to sleep. Meanwhile, Quark (Armin Shimerman) arranges to auction off various items Vash has found in the Gamma Quadrant, including an unusual crystal that might fetch a high price.|$|E
5|$|The War Department {{approved}} Krueger's {{transfer to}} SWPA, {{but did not}} approve MacArthur's request for Third Army headquarters. There were only three American divisions in SWPA: the 32nd Infantry Division at Rockhampton, Queensland, the 41st Infantry Division in the Buna area in Papua, and the 1st Marine Division in Melbourne, Victoria. The 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division were scheduled to arrive in 1943, and other divisions would follow in 1944, but {{for the time being}} there were much fewer troops than an army would normally control. The War Department therefore saw no need for a full strength army headquarters. Instead, Krueger had to make <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> a skeleton staff of a new Sixth Army, which was activated in January 1943, with less than half the establishment strength of an army headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Arha's {{routine is}} {{disrupted}} by her {{discovery of a}} man (Ged, the protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by slamming the door on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt {{to open the door}} with a spell. Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tour}} of New Japan in late August and early September, he started {{competing}} again as his Prince Devitt identity, utilizing an Irish superstar gimmick. He eventually turned heel and started teaming with the Control Terrorism Unit (CTU) in an apprenticetype role. While teaming with CTU, {{he began a}} losing streak, aggravating his teammates {{to such a degree}} that they did not want anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> anymore. This led to him being given one final chance on 6 October, where he rose to the occasion and impressed his CTU teammates enough to continue his association with them. To solidify his status with the stable, Devitt teamed with CTU leader, Jushin Thunder Liger to take on Wataru Inoue and Ryusuke Taguchi. In a huge twist, Devitt was the one to make the final cover on Inoue following a stiff brainbuster. From then on he was officially recognized as a member of the CTU.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from serving}} as an official, Zhuge Zhan was also skilled in {{painting}} and calligraphy. Since the people of Shu deeply missed Zhuge Liang, who died in 234, they especially liked Zhuge Zhan for his talents because he reminded them of his father. Whenever the Shu government implemented a favourable policy, the people give credit to Zhuge Zhan even though it might have had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> As Zhuge Liang banned the position of official historian in the Shu government, {{it was hard to}} distinguish which policies Zhuge Zhan had a role in, although it was clear that Zhuge Zhan's reputation was greater than his actual accomplishments.|$|E
25|$|Johnstone's {{stance on}} {{conciliation}} probably {{led to his}} selection by North to form part of the peace commission sent to America in 1778 under Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle. Confident of success Johnstone attempted to sway influential Americans with the argument that reconciling with Britain was preferable to dependence on France. In his communications he made vague hints of rewards to those who helped secure this outcome, and was eventually accused of attempting to bribe American general Joseph Reed with 10,000 guineas. The charge was never proved, but the Continental Congress voted to have nothing more to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> and Johnstone returned home in 1778, {{before the rest of}} the commissioners.|$|E
25|$|On 27 August 1803, Durutte {{received}} {{promotion to}} general of division {{in spite of}} Napoleon Bonaparte's dislike of officers from Moreau's army. He {{became a member of}} the Légion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803 and a commander of the Légion on 9 June 1804. His former relationship with Moreau, who was exiled from France, then caused trouble. When asked to put his signature on a document agreeing with Napoleon's appointment as emperor of France, Durutte remained true to his republican beliefs and refused to sign. When his officers also offered to join him in defiance, he dissuaded them so their careers would not be ruined. After this incident, apparently no one wanted to have anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> except Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout, who gave him command of the island of Elba. He remained in this isolated post for three years.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, {{it became}} known at Pisa {{that two of the}} {{cardinals}} of the Obedience of Benedict XIII had abandoned his cause. Cardinal Ludovico Fieschi and Cardinal Antoine de Challant had been declared contumacious in the Fourth Session of the Council, and they were now negotiating to have their status regularized. At Session Sixteen, on 10 June, Cardinal Challant appeared in the Cathedral, and the question of what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> suddenly became critical. Cardinal Niccolò Brancaccio (Avignon Obedience) spoke in his favor, and he was allowed to take his seat with the other cardinals. Then, the Archbishop of Pisa read out a document containing Electoral Capitulations, signed and sealed by each of the cardinals, promising that whoever was elected pope would carry out a reform of the Church, and would not allow the Council to dissolve until that goal had been achieved.|$|E
25|$|Carlton Gary {{was born}} on September 24, 1950 in Columbus, Georgia. His father was a {{construction}} worker who wanted nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and would accept no financial responsibility for him. Gary only met his father once, when he was twelve years old. Gary's mother was extremely poor and as a result, they moved around a lot. He was malnourished {{most of the time}} and was often left with his aunt or great aunt, both maids for elderly, wealthy, white women. In elementary school, Gary suffered serious head trauma when he was knocked unconscious in a playground accident, and in his teens, he was a heavy drug user. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he was arrested multiple times for robbery, arson, and assault. During that time, he also got married to a woman named Sheila, and had two children. In 1970, he moved to Albany, New York, where he had plans to become a singer, but he continued to carry out his criminal activities.|$|E
25|$|When Fraser {{made his}} next {{visit to the}} Romanov court in 1805 expecting remuneration, to his great {{disappointment}} he discovered that the new Emperor would have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Undaunted, he repeated the trip, visiting both Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but in vain. After the Emperor Paul I's assassination in March, 1801, the new Emperor Alexander I declined to recognise Fraser's appointment. Fraser petitioned his cause for two years, finally resorting to seeking assistance from the British ambassadorial corps, and was ultimately paid 6,000 rubles by royal decree in April, 1803. The Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, an enthusiastic amateur botanist herself, supported his efforts, giving him a diamond ring and commissioning him for specimens for the Imperial Gardens of Gatchina and Pavlovsk Palace. The director of the Imperial Botanic Garden at Saint Petersburg catalogued 18 of Fraser's North American species {{in the early years}} of the 19th century, with some of the specimens surviving as of 1997 in the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.|$|E

25|$|Another pre-game storyline {{involved}} backup Steelers tight end/fullback Sean McHugh. McHugh, {{who spent}} {{the past three seasons}} with the Detroit Lions, made that team's 53-man roster {{at the end of the}} preseason, only to be released 24 hours later alongside linebacker Anthony Cannon in order for the Lions to make room for linebacker Ryan Nece and running back Marcus Thomas. The Steelers promptly signed McHugh after the team traded center Sean Mahan back to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a draft pick before the start of the season. The subsequent media attention surrounding McHugh had to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> being deemed not good enough for the Lions (a team that would finish 0–16, the NFL's first imperfect season since the expansion 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers), but good enough for a Super Bowl team such as the Steelers and being a valuable blocker for Ben Roethlisberger and Willie Parker. McHugh himself had mixed feelings about the situation, feeling bad for his former Lions teammates, but also feeling it's a little payback for the Lions for releasing him in the first place. McHugh would play in the Super Bowl as a blocker, much like his regular season role.|$|E
25|$|Johnstone {{was born}} into a gentry family in 1730, and {{embarked}} on a naval career. Early in his service there occurred several incidents which revealed both positive and negative aspects of his character. He was involved in encounters with the enemy where he was praised for his bravery, and incidents where he was censured for disobedience. He rose through the ranks to his own commands and had some success with small cruisers against enemy merchants and privateers. After the end of the Seven Years' War he had made friends with several powerful figures, and was appointed Governor of West Florida. He achieved some degree of success in the delicate operations of running a new colony, but ultimately clashed with his political masters and failed to cultivate support amongst the wider sections of colonial society. Returning to Britain he became active in politics, supporting conciliatory measures for the Americans, and the removal of government interference from the affairs of the East India Company. His stance on the former led to his appointment {{as a member of the}} Carlisle Peace Commission, but he was accused of offering bribes and the Americans would have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 17 October 1557, Wang Zhi {{arrived at}} Zhoushan Island {{with a large}} trading fleet. There he laid down his terms for surrender: he sought an {{imperial}} pardon, a naval commission, and that ports be open for trade; in return he offered to patrol the coast and persuade the raiders {{to return to the}} islands through force if necessary. Hu Zongxian now faced a dilemma: he could not let Wang Zhi go, but if he accepted Wang Zhi's surrender he might be forced to execute him, turning appeasement efforts to naught. In December, confident in his prospects and his invulnerability, Wang Zhi made landing at Hangzhou. There he was accorded respectable treatment by the authorities, who feared antagonizing his followers, while they figure out what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> During this time Hu Zongxian asked Wang Zhi to help manufacture arquebuses for the Ming army, which led to the weapon being widely used in China. Finally in February next year, Wang Zhi was sent to prison, where he was given the luxuries of novelties, books, and healthy foods. Wang Zhi believed this was a temporary arrangement and remained hopeful for a pardon until 22 January 1560, when an imperial edict handed down the death sentence and he was summarily beheaded.|$|E
