He came to a resolution of disowning his agent, denying his letter, and disavowing his friends. He insisted on continuing in the execution of his office, and supported himself by such reasons as could be furnished in such a cause. An open schism instantly divided the Council. General Clavering claimed the office to which he ought to succeed, and Mr. Francis adhered to him: Mr. Barwell stuck to Mr. Hastings. The two parties assembled separately, and everything was running fast into a confusion which suspended government, and might very probably have ended in a civil war, had not the judges of the Supreme Court, on a reference to them, settled the controversy by deciding that the resignation was an <b>invalid</b> <b>act,</b> and that Mr. Hastings was still in the legal possession of his place, which had been actually filled up in England.

They communicated their objections in remonstrances to the President, who shared them with Congress. In the following Term of the Supreme Court, United States Attorney General Edmund Randolph petitioned for a writ of mandamus commanding the Circuit Court for the District of Pennsylvania to proceed in accordance with the Act. His original petition was made ex officio, but when the Supreme Court expressed doubts about proceeding in such fashion, he changed his position, averring that he was bringing the petition on behalf of William Hayburn, a pension applicant. At that point, the Supreme Court took the matter under advisement and bound the case over until its next term.

The Civil Code as a lex generalis brought into the Czech legal order expressly provisions not only about <b>invalid</b> juridical <b>acts,</b> but also about putative juridical acts.

The crucial part of this rigorous thesis is therefore a description and analysis of defects of juridical acts in general and their specifics when terminating an employment relationship. Another equally important part is the analysis of the procedural context associated with the claiming for invalid or putative juridical acts aimed at termination of an employment relationship in the civil proceedings.

Legal actions occur {{in the sphere of}} civil law. Legislation of legal actions is included in the current Civil Code, which also provides what conditions must be satisfied to make a legal act valid and vice versa, which is an <b>invalid</b> legal <b>act,</b> either absolutely or relatively. To be valid, a legal act must be a {{manifestation of the}} will, which is directed specifically to the creation, modification or termination of a legal relationship and the law must connect such a manifestation of the will with legal consequences. This legal specification is in the Civil Code. In the current draft of the new Civil Code, however, such a definition of legal actions is missing, and are specified only the consequences of legal actions. You can expand, that the validity of any legal action depends on the expression of the will of the acting person, which must be capable of acquiring rights and duties.

5000|$|Gangesa, {{the author}} of Tattvacintāmaṇi who had {{examined}} the possibility of dialectical reasoning {{as a way to}} grasp pervasion, in the anumāna-khanda of the same text states that pervasion is pursued so long as there is doubt because there is contradiction but does not require deviation; doubt is an <b>invalid</b> cognitive <b>act</b> and fallacious reasoning is the ground for contradiction, the nature of doubt and fallacious reasoning both being conceptual is not of determinate character [...] Thus, dialectical reasoning is blocking of the opposing view and continues so long as doubt persists. Gangesa agrees that since pervasion is a universal invariant concomitance, therefore, the possibility of a counter example cannot be ruled out, and concludes that contradiction as natural opposition cannot block an infinite regress, it is the doubter’s own behaviour proving the lie to the doubt that blocks it acting as the pratibandhaka. Gangesa uses the term, pratibandhaka, to refer to a natural opposition in cognitive logic, as a preventer. Pervasion by its absence is the cause of hindrance (pratibandhaka) to inferential knowledge which in turn is the cause of pervasion. Even though both grasp their objects directly, in savikalpa its contents become objects of reflective awareness which is not the case in nirvikalpa. Contradiction occurs only when one epistemic state is blocked by a pratibandhaka.|$|R
6000|$|Some {{time after}} this, falling into ill-health, {{he was sent}} at great expense to a more {{favourable}} climate; and then I think his perplexities were thickest. When he {{thought of all the}} other young men of singular promise, upright, good, the prop of families, who must remain at home to die, and with all their possibilities be lost to life and mankind; and how he, by one more unmerited favour, was chosen out from all these others to survive; he felt as if there were no life, no labour, no devotion of soul and body, that could repay and justify these partialities. A religious lady, to whom he communicated these reflections, could see no force in them whatever. [...] "It was God's will," [...] said she. But he knew it was by God's will that Joan of Arc was burnt at Rouen, which cleared neither Bedford nor Bishop Cauchon; and again, by God's will that Christ was crucified outside Jerusalem, which excused neither the rancour of the priests nor the timidity of Pilate. He knew, moreover, that although the possibility of this favour he was now enjoying issued from his circumstances, its acceptance was the act of his own will; and he had accepted it greedily, longing for rest and sunshine. And hence this allegation of God's providence did little to relieve his scruples. I promise you he had a very troubled mind. And I would not laugh if I were you, though while he was thus making mountains out of what you think molehills, he were still (as perhaps he was) contentedly practising many other things that to you seem black as hell. Every man is his own judge and mountain-guide through life. There is an old story of a mote and a beam, apparently not true, but worthy perhaps of some consideration. I should, if I were you, give some consideration to these scruples of his, and if I were he, I should do the like by yours; for it is not unlikely that there may be something under both. In the meantime you must hear how my <b>invalid</b> <b>acted.</b> Like many <b>invalids,</b> he supposed that he would die. Now should he die, he saw no means of repaying this huge loan which, by the hands of his father, mankind had advanced him for his sickness. In that case it would be lost money. So he determined that the advance should be as small as possible; and, so long as he continued to doubt his recovery, lived in an upper room, and grudged himself all but necessaries. But so soon as he began to perceive a change for the better, he felt justified in spending more freely, to speed and brighten his return to health, and trusted in the future to lend a help to mankind, as mankind, out of its treasury, had lent a help to him.|$|R

40|$|The {{argument}} of this thesis {{is that the}} legal liability of the administration in France and England, at first sight very different, is actually very similar. In France, {{the existence of a}} separate system of administrative courts with jurisdiction in delictual actions against the administration haG led to a division between public and private law. In practice, however, the distinction is less clear than might be supposed because the substantive rules of public and private law are very similar, while in some cases the State is answerable to the civil courts. Although French law is drafted in terms of general principle in contrast to the English common law, the existing rules of liability are not in practice dissimilar. Two theoretical bases of liability are, however, relatively novel: the risk principle (which applied to the administration can be used to impose liability for all unlawful or <b>invalid</b> administrative <b>acts)</b> and the principle of Equality before Public charges (which {{can be used as a}} theoretical basis for a system of administrative compensation). On examination, the adoption of these principles into English law is seen to necessitate a change in our traditional constitutional balance of power. Nor, in any event, are they actually the basis of the French system. Neither French nor English law is, at the end of the day, coherent and all—embracing. Both need to be buttressed by statutory and extra— statutory administrative compensation schemes. These should be seen as an acceptable and efficient substitute for civil liability and their development, co—ordination and rationalisation encouraged accordingly...|$|R
