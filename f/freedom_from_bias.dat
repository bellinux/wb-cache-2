50|$|Unconscious thought theory {{runs counter}} to about the past 30 years of {{mainstream}} research on unconscious cognition (see for a review). Many of the attributes of unconscious thought according to UTT are drawn from research by George Miller and Guy Claxton on cognitive and social psychology, {{as well as from}} folk psychology; together these portray a formidable unconscious, possessing some abilities far beyond those of conscious thought. UTT is in this respect reminiscent of some classical views of the unconscious that emerged {{as far back as the}} early 20th century. Both UTT and Freudian psychoanalytic theory hold that complex operations are performed by the unconscious, but where Freud's theory suggests that the unconscious represses harmful memories to protect one's ego, UTT's version of UT performs rational operations to complete unsolved cognitive or affective tasks. Helmholtz's theory of unconscious inference also shares UTT's view that the unconscious' reasoning mediates our interpretation of the world, but UTT differs from unconscious inference by its clear assertion that unconscious thought is a time-consuming process; Helmholtz's famous use of perception as an example of unconscious inference suggests that unconscious thought, for him, operates much more quickly. Probably the most striking contrast UTT has with today's understanding of the unconscious is that between its main claim and studies on implicit perception. Researchers like Anthony Greenwald have used subliminal semantic activation tasks to evaluate unconscious thought by presenting words very quickly to prevent them from entering conscious thought. The unconscious' inability to process more than one word at a time has led these researchers to conclude that unconscious thought is unsophisticated. But UTT holds that unconscious thought is very sophisticated, enjoying benefits like <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> <b>bias</b> and the ability to integrate disparate pieces of information more efficiently than conscious thought.|$|E

40|$|Arbitration {{is one of}} the {{principal}} alternative dispute resolution forums utilized in unionized and in many nonunion organizations to achieve procedural justice.

There also is an expecta-tion that arbitration will be a rapid and inexpensive final solution to workplace conflicts. It is intended to be the ultimate form of representativeness, in that both the process and the content of the dispute are to be based on negotiation between the two parties. However, in reality, there is concern that the procedure is not always viewed as just, diminishing employee and group voice (Lind & Earley, 1992). In addition, lack of acceptance of the outcome can subsequently diminish the consistency of arbitration.

40|$|Abstract: Surveys are {{the most}} common form of data-based article {{published}} in the Journal of Dental Education. The apparent ease with which they are conducted and the seeming simplicity of reporting results mask significant issues in sample design and performing maximally useful analyses. Four concerns are discussed here. First, it is demonstrated that results are a function of who, when, and where responses are sampled, each source making independent contributions. Second, absolute sample size is shown to be the most significant factor affecting precision in surveys, and the numbers of schools, respondents, and other sources of variance can be chosen to minimize survey imprecision. Third, response rate typically has negligible effect on precision and an uncertain effect on accuracy (<b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> <b>bias).</b> A technique, sample saturation, is explained that can be used to protect, to some degree, surveys from the effects of bias. Finally, suggestions are offered for reporting survey results in a visually meaning-ful fashion, and an appeal is made that recommendations associated with surveys not be published unless they are grounded in both data and well-developed theory. This analysis references a previously published survey on competency-based dental educa-tion to illustrate methodological points in concrete terms...|$|E

Consequently, principles of natural justice must be applied.

Aim: To determine whether the extra investment is justified by greater reliability, usefulness and health gain {{by means of a}} case study in surgery. Methods: A systematic review of published data for laparoscopic versus open repair of inguinal hernia was first conducted. The review was then augmented using, where possible, the results of IPD analyses. The approaches to meta-analysis were then compared {{in terms of the number}} of trials and number of participants included, differences in statistical significance and statistical precision, and differences in results that might result in different clinical decisions. Key reasons for any differences were identified. Finally, the impact of the added value of IPD on UK NHS health policy was described. Results: The systematic review of published data was difficult and exemplified the problems of using this approach. Through the formal structure of the EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration it was possible to collect IPD for 25 out of 41 trials and supplemented aggregate data for seven trials. Overall, the meta-analyses based on IPD resulted in more conservative treatment effects with narrower CIs and more precise estimates of effectiveness, and led to fundamentally different conclusions about the effects of laparoscopic surgery on persisting pain. Conclusions: The extra investment required for the collection and re-analysis of IPD enhanced the amount of data available, improved the quality of that data and resulted in estimates of effectiveness that were more precise and generalisable. The finding of less reported persisting pain following laparoscopic repair (although methods used to assess pain were unclear for the majority of trials raising questions about validity and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> <b>bias),</b> a key determinant of long-term quality of life, led to a change of UK NHS health policy.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{demonstrate}} the tension between human security's core categories of <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want.

This is illustrated through the War on Drugs focus on protecting individuals from physical violence and human rights abuses relating to situations of conflict, as well as its use of coercion strategies, such as sanctions or non-unilateral force; all of these of which are usual to a <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear approach. An examination of how the War on Drugs has impacted upon the individuals of Bolivia reveals that despite the desired outcome of protecting individual safety and well-being, the War on Drugs has actually compromised the safety and well-being of Bolivians. In addition, in typifying <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear, the War on Drugs in Bolivia has also challenged <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want by marginalising or threatening economic, community, food and health security, and thus defying claims that <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want are complementary.
