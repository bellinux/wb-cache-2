50|$|Modern cow whips {{are made}} of <b>flat</b> nylon <b>parachute</b> cord, which, unlike those made from leather, are still {{effective}} when wet. Most cowwhips have handles that average 16 inches, and thongs that average 12 feet. A good cowwhip can produce a loud crack by a simple push of the handle. This can make it more convenient to use than a bullwhip in a thick vegetated environment with less swinging room. The Tampa Bay Whip Enthusiasts give demonstrations of the Florida Cracker Cowboy in costume at the annual Heritage Village Civil War Days festival, located in Largo, Florida every year in May.|$|R

40|$|NASA's high {{altitude}} balloon borne scientific payloads are typically suspended from a deployed <b>flat</b> circular <b>parachute.</b> At flight termination, the recovery train is pyrotechnically separated at the parachute apex and balloon nadir interface. The release of elastic energy {{stored in the}} parachute at zero initial vertical velocity in the rarefied atmosphere produces high canopy opening forces that subject the gondola to potentially damaging shock loads. Data from terminations occurring at altitudes to 40 km with payloads up to 2500 kg on parachutes up to 40 m in diameter are presented. Measured loads are markedly larger than encountered via packed parachute deployment for similar canopy loadings. Canopy inflation is significantly suppressed {{in the early stages}} and then accelerated during final blossoming. Data interpretation and behavioral phenomena are discussed along with proposed shock attenuation techniques...|$|R
40|$|Rice {{production}} in Pakistan is constraint by many factors pertaining to prevalent planting techniques. A {{research on the}} feasibility of new planting techniques (direct seeding on flat, transplanting on flat, direct seeding on ridges, transplanting on ridges and parachute planting) in transplanted and direct wet-seeded rice was undertaken at Dera Ismail Khan region of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province during 2002 and 2003. Among the planting techniques, the best performance for the yield formation and economic evaluation was noted for transplanting on flat during both years. Chinese parachute planting technology also showed very promising results {{in most of the}} parameters. Direct seeding on ridges could not excel transplanting on <b>flat</b> and <b>parachute</b> planting during both cropping seasons. The findings concluded the feasibility of parachute planting technology along with traditional rice transplanting on flat over all other planting techniques being practiced in the area...|$|R

40|$|A drop-test {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to determine the stability and drag characteristics of radially vented (duplex) parachutes. Parachutes of two different designs were tested: a large parachute with high geometric porosity and a small parachute with low geometric porosity designed for the same descent velocity with the same load. The results of the tests show that the large high-porosity duplex parachute was very stable in descent, oscillations averaging about [plus-or-minus] 3. 4 ⁰; and the average drag coefficient based on the total canopy area {{and based on the}} fabric area alone were approximately 0. 38 and 0. 55, respectively. The small, low-porosity duplex parachute was also very stable in descent, oscillations averaging about [plus-or-minus] 4. 5 ⁰; and the average drag coefficients based on the total canopy area and based on the fabric area alone were approximately 0. 62 and 0. 79, respectively. The oscillations for the cluster of three solid <b>flat</b> circular <b>parachutes,</b> tested for comparison purposes, were [plus-or-minus] 7. 1 ⁰.

40|$|Lunge feeding is {{the main}} feeding {{strategy}} employed by rorqual whales to catch in only one “gulp ” {{a large amount of}} krill and other small prey that typically swim in schools. A lunge consists in a whale accelerating and then swiftly opening its mouth to allow-in a large amount of water and prey. The lunge ends with the closing of the mouth and with the purging of the engulfed water out of the mouth through the baleen plates (a filtering process). In many ways, the filling process that expands the initially folded, highly-extensible and compliant buccal cavity blubber shares a lot of commonalities with the unsteady fluid dynamics of parachute inflation. But there are crucial differences also, including the ventral muscle action that controls the gradual (forward-) pushing of the engulfed water from deep inside the mouth. This paper describes a simple, yet powerful model of the water engulfment process and of its influence on the kinematics of a lunging whale. Numerical results will be presented and compared with the velocity data obtained from digital tags deployed on foraging Fin whales. The dynamics of inflation during lunge feeding will be compared also to that of the G- 11 <b>flat</b> circular <b>parachute.</b> Particular attention will be paid to comparisons of the cavity filling time and to the load factor (FD/W) sustained by the engulfing structure...|$|R
