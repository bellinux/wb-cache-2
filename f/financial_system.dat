The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation {{had been unable to}} levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a <b>financial</b> <b>system</b> that would promote American prosperity and national unity.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{theoretical}} approach to finance and banking that aims at {{bridging the gap}} between, on the one hand, political scientists mainly interested in institutions and policies and, on the other hand, economists interested in the structure and functioning of <b>financial</b> <b>systems.</b> For {{the past twenty years}} scholars have been trying to understand the deep changes at work in <b>financial</b> <b>systems,</b> and have been trying in particular to answer the following three core questions: (i) what are the origins of these changes? (ii) Are <b>financial</b> <b>systems</b> converging towards a single model? And (iii) what room of maneuver is left to governments? Broadly speaking, answers to these questions have fallen into two schools of thought: one which is arguing the irresistible convergence towards market-based <b>financial</b> <b>systems,</b> brought by globalization; and the other who is emphasizing the “resilience ” of national <b>financial</b> <b>systems,</b> rooted in institutional and political factors. Most neo-classical financial and banking economists, as well as some International Political Economy (IPE) scholars, argue that the trend towards market-based <b>financial</b> <b>systems</b> (in which banks would have a residual role) is irresistible 1, due to structural factors within the <b>financial</b> <b>systems</b> themselves.

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global <b>financial</b> <b>system.</b> He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, investable funds became {{increasingly}} concentrated {{in a single}} institution, the Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), creating a <b>financial</b> <b>system</b> vulnerable to rent-seeking.

This corrosion of balance sheets {{was a result of}} crony loans to the other banks and the private sector. In its rediscounting actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.|$|E

5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III.

He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, England and the Netherlands {{began to}} {{challenge}} Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private joint-stock companies to finance the voyages—the English, later British, East India Company and the Dutch East India Company, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced <b>financial</b> <b>system</b> and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global <b>financial</b> <b>system</b> in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global <b>financial</b> <b>system.</b> The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E
