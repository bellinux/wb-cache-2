40|$|The {{evolution}} of multiple stellar {{systems can be}} driven by Kozai cycles and tidal friction (KCTF), which shrink the orbit of the inner binary. There is an interesting possibility that two close binaries on a common long-period orbit experience mutually-induced KCTF.

We obtained photometric observations of CzeV 343 that completely cover the two orbital periods and we successfully model the light curves as the sum of two detached EBs. We provide confidence intervals for the model parameters and minima timings by bootstrap resampling of our data. One of the EBs shows a distinctly eccentric orbit with a total eccentricity of about 0. 18. The two orbital periods, 1. 20937 and 0. 80693 days, are within 0. 1 % of a 3 : 2 ratio.

Pulmonary vascular resistance was partitioned in arterial and venous components based on <b>double</b> exponential <b>fitting</b> analysis of the pulmonary artery pressure decay curve: after balloon occlusion in 36 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); at baseline and during the inhalation of 20 parts per million of nitric oxide (NO); in four patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; and in two patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. In the patients with PAH, at baseline, mean pulmonary artery pressure was 56 +/- 2 mmHg (mean+/-SE), with an arterial component of resistance of 63 +/- 1 %. Inhaled NO did not change the partition of resistance. The arterial component of resistance amounted on average to 42 % and 77 % in the patients with veno-occlusive disease and the patients with thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, respectively. However, the partitioning of resistance did not discriminate between these three diagnostic categories.

40|$|A {{dominant}} constituent in {{the dynamic}} chromosphere are spicules. Spicules at the limb appear as relatively small and dynamic jets that are observed to everywhere stick out. Many papers emphasize {{the important role}} spicules might play in the energy and mass balance of the chromosphere and corona. However, many aspects of spicules remain a mystery. In this Letter we shed more light on the multi-threaded nature of spicules and their torsional component. We use high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution observations from the Swedish 1 -m Solar Telescope in the Hα spectral line. The data targets the limb and we extract spectra from spicules far out from the limb to reduce the line-of-sight superposition effect. We discover that many spicules display very asymmetric spectra with some even showing multiple peaks. To quantify this asymmetry we use a <b>double</b> Gaussian <b>fitting</b> procedure and find an average velocity difference between the single Gaussian components to be between 20 - 30 km s^- 1 for a sample of 57 spicules. We observe that spicules show significant sub-structure where one spicule consists of many 'threads'. We interpret the asymmetric spectra as line-of-sight superposition of threads in one spicule and therefore have a measure for a perpendicular flow inside spicules which will be important for future numerical model to reproduce. In addition we show examples of λ-x-slices perpendicular across spicules and find spectral tilts in individual threads providing further evidence for the complex dynamical nature of spicules.

In 1946 a series of derailments was traced to the design of the leading pony truck, which was unduly sensitive to the often poor track conditions, a legacy of heavy wartime use and lack of maintenance. Modifications to the suspension cured the problem. During the 1950s cracked monoblocs became increasingly frequent, but replacement was expensive and in 1956 the decision was taken to replace the monobloc with separate cylinder castings. Seventy-one engines were thus modified: they can be identified by the presence of external steam pipes from smokebox to cylinders. Finally, around 1960 experiments were made with <b>fitting</b> <b>double</b> chimneys to two V2s.

We use ground tower measured NDVI (10 sites) and gross primary productivity (GPP, 4 sites) to evaluate the smoothed satellite-derived NDVI time-series, and elevation data to evaluate phenology parameters derived from smoothed NDVI. The results indicate that all smoothing methods can reduce noise and improve signal quality, but that no single method always performs better than others. Overall, the local filtering methods (SG and LO) can generate very accurate results if smoothing parameters are optimally calibrated. If local calibration cannot be performed, cross validation is a way to automatically determine the smoothing parameter. However, this method may in some cases generate poor fits, and when calibration is not possible the function fitting methods (AG and DL) provide the most robust description of the seasonal dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Reducing heating {{costs is}} an {{important}} concern for householders, but many conventional methods of cutting down heating costs, such as insulating lofts and cavity walls and <b>fitting</b> <b>double</b> glazing, involve considerable capital outlay. An effective way of reducing heat losses {{with a minimum of}} capital outlay is to fit reflecting metal foil behind the central heating radiators, but little has been done to measure the amount of energy saved in this way. Similarly, a foil layer can be used to reduce heat losses from beneath suspended floors, but little data are available on its effectiveness. Work is reported here on experiments carried out in an environmental chamber to measure the effect on heat losses of metal foils behind radiators and beneath suspended floors. Reductions in the overall energy consumption of the room of up to 6 % were recorded by installing foil behind a radiator, while the heat loss through the area of wall immediately behind the radiator fell to less than 30 % of the original value. The heat loss from a suspended timber floor was reduced by up to 48 % when foil was applied to its under surface. ...|$|R
