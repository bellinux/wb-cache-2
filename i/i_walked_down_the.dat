5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s {{just one of those}} moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
2500|$|Joplin {{attended}} {{her high}} school reunion on August 14, accompanied by Neuwirth, road manager John Cooke, and sister Laura, but it was reportedly an unhappy experience for her. Joplin {{held a press conference}} in Port Arthur during her reunion visit. Rolling Stone journalist Chet Flippo reported that she wore enough jewelry for a [...] "Babylonian whore". When asked by a reporter if she ever entertained at Thomas Jefferson High School when she was a student there, Joplin replied, [...] "Only when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisles." [...] Joplin denigrated Port Arthur and the classmates who had humiliated her a decade earlier.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the birth of her {{daughter}} in 1965, Joni Anderson was gigging again around Yorkville, beginning to sing more of her original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met Chuck Mitchell, an American folk-singer from Michigan. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States. In one interview, Mitchell claimed she married Chuck only 36 hours after they met, but it is unclear if they were ever married in Toronto. Sometime in late April, Mitchell left Canada for the first time, going with Chuck to the US, where the two began playing music together. Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, [...] "I made my dress and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money... <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle brandishing my daisies." ...|$|E
60|$|That night <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> {{cemetery}} with him. At {{the door}} of his vault he turned and pressed my hand.|$|R
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> harbor to the {{decommissioned}} whaler and wheel the pram up the ramp. My mind winces {{away from}} Melville-induced {{images of the}} slaughter that {{took place on the}} wide boards of this deck. I don't want anything to spoil the moment. Libby Jo and I are setting to sea, not ten miles from the Arctic Circle. My five-month-old and I are in northern Iceland, as part of a research trip for my PhD novel...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are interesting, {{because they}} have {{probably}} never been done before. <b>I</b> shall <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> church like this with my husband in about two hours, shan't I!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ye--es,' {{she replied}} slowly. 'At least, as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> path a voice cried out [...] "Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!" [...] {{but that was}} all.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{street and}} left him looking after me. At the corner I glanced around. The {{proprietor}} and the commissionnaire were talking together on the pavement.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street, {{hoping for}} a miracle. Then I saw your key under the scraper. I let myself in and waited.--Jane, how {{wonderful}} you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|A weird tremor broke over me. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> {{street and}} bought a paper. There it stared {{me in the face}} on the middle page: [...] "Tragedy at Campden Hill: Well-known Barrister Murders his Wife. Sensational Details." ...|$|R
60|$|Jumping over <b>the</b> fence, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road, but not {{in hopes}} of meeting John Stumpy. If he was {{anywhere}} near, {{the approach of the}} two boys had certainly driven him into hiding.|$|R
40|$|The gracious donor, the dean, and {{the other}} honors program {{director}} and <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> corridor of an old campus building needing repair but possessing {{a great deal of}} charm. While a science classroom building is being renovated, this hall houses temporary offices for displaced faculty. We look at the high ceilings in a room now used as a faculty break room and admire the way the morning sunlight plays on the walls. This room would make an amazing honors student lounge. Renovating the entire building would create a terrific honors dorm that could attract talented prospective students and encourage current honors students to remain at the college...|$|R
60|$|These {{introductions}} {{and explanations}} had filled up the time whilst my two Krooboys {{were making the}} dinghy fast. Then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> jetty {{with one of my}} new acquaintances upon either side, each plying me with questions, for they had seen no white man for months.|$|E
60|$|After {{the door}} had closed, and I knew that I had looked my last on Mrs. Sherwin in this world, I {{remained}} a few minutes alone in the room, until I had steadied my mind sufficiently to go out again into the streets. As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> garden-path to the gate, the servant whom I had seen on my entrance, ran after me, and eagerly entreated that I would wait one moment and speak to her.|$|E
60|$|Night {{had fallen}} {{when we made}} our first change of engine, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{platform}} for {{a breath of fresh}} air and to see what I could see. Through the windows of the private car I caught a glimpse of three men whom I recognized. Hartman was right. One of the men was General Altendorff; and the other two were Mason and Vanderbold, the brains of the inner circle of the Oligarchy's secret service.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, {{she wrote}} her first song Ek loop die Pad (<b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Road) after being urged {{to do so}} by friends. The song quickly found its {{audience}} and has remained popular ever since, even being covered by artists like Laurika Rauch. Strydom has since written most of the songs in her repertoire and discography, but she also sings songs by artists such as Koos du Plessis, Stef Bos, José Feliciano, Kris Kristofferson, Holly Cole, and George Gershwin. When writing her own songs Strydom usually composes the lyrics alone, while often collaborating with others when composing the music. Among her musical collaborators are Janine Neethling, Didi Kriel, Lize Beekman, Peter McLea, Siegfried Pretsch and Angerie van Wyk.|$|R
60|$|I {{found myself}} out of the tavern and alone in the cool May night. And as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> deserted street, my head in a whirl, a hand was laid on my shoulder. I turned, startled, to face Mr. Wharton, the planter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardly," [...] {{said the}} bishop, [...] "but let me advise {{you not to}} go very far from the shore, {{so that if you}} feel tired you can come in easily, and if you will allow me <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> shore in the {{direction}} in which you intend to row." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{on earth}} did they spring from, I wondered. Slowly <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> short pier. I saw the woman's form shaken by sobs and heard her moaning more and more distinctly, 'Oh, my man! my poor man! my poor man!' I stole on quietly. She could neither hear nor see anything. She had thrown her apron {{over her head and}} was rocking herself to and fro in her grief. But I remarked a small boat {{fastened}} {{to the end of the}} pier.|$|E
60|$|I again warmly {{repeated}} {{that it was}} a {{bad side}} of human nature (in which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I was right), and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> little path away from Biddy, and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> broad avenue slowly, casting many glances {{behind me}} at the vast, gloomy pile, around which the late evening mists were rising from the damp ground. Many lights were {{twinkling}} from the upper windows and from the east wing, where the servants' quarters were situated, but {{the lower part of}} the building lay in a deep obscurity, unilluminated, save by one faint light from Mr. Ravenor's study. There seemed something unnatural, almost ghostly, about the place, which chilled while it fascinated me.|$|E
60|$|It was on {{a summer}} morning that I rose before the sun to compose myself for the {{crowning}} of my work with this end; and my dwelling being near to <b>the</b> sea, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> rocks on the shore, in order that I might behold the sun in his majesty.|$|R
6000|$|... "You might," [...] she said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> cliffs every afternoon. I {{was just}} {{starting}} when you came. It is quite a regular pilgrimage with me. All day long we hear the sea, but except from the upper windows we have no clear view of it. This is the path." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was quite}} {{late on a}} Monday {{afternoon}} that Bill stopped at our house again. He did not call out this time. He simply drew up, and {{a man with a}} big black valise clambered <b>down</b> from <b>the</b> top of the stage. Then Bill shouted to me as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> gate, looking rather angry I suppose: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{village at}} a deuce of a pace; so quick that, if the thing had been possible, I should have {{overtaken}} ten o'clock {{that had passed}} by me two hours ago, when I was listening to Mrs. H.'s long stories over her terrible Rosolio. The truth is, at ten I had an appointment under a certain person's window, who {{was to have been}} looking at the moon at that hour, with her pretty quilled nightcap on, and her blessed hair in papers.|$|E
60|$|We {{had been}} walking briskly during this conversation, {{and a few}} more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes' request <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> bank to the right, and he to the left, but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was plainly {{outlined}} in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.|$|E
60|$|I was {{so anxious}} to begin this conquest that I could {{scarcely}} wait for the evening to come. At the noon hour, when the ice-works were deserted, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> shaft and into the ice-chamber {{to see what had}} been done since my last visit. I decided to insist that operations upon a larger scale should be immediately begun, in order that I might have plenty of money with which to carry on my contemplated campaign. Whether it was one of peace or war, I should want all the money I could get.|$|E
5000|$|I’m an actress…but I’m also {{religious}}; I can’t help it. I {{can justify}} my actress self to my religious self: but I can’t justify {{the things that}} you can’t separate from the actress, the publicity, the feeling of being considered public property even off the stage. I hate that. I don’t like when <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street, to have men looking at me and speculating about me. I hate to hear them say, [...] "That’s Tittell Brune" [...] and I feel their eyes boring into my back when I’m past. It makes me feel common and I loathe it. If I can’t disguise myself I’ve got to put up with it. But that kind of publicity revolts me. It really does, because I am religious - I’m half a nun.|$|R
5000|$|In a May 2013 {{interview}} with the Sankei Shimbun, he {{refused to comment on}} Osaka mayor Toru Hashimoto's controversial remarks on comfort women, characterizing the issue as one that should be discussed among experts and historians rather than politicians. He described the perceived nationalist shift in Japanese politics as [...] "Chinese propaganda" [...] and stated that the government needed to wage a better public relations campaign against it while focusing on the successful implementation of Abenomics. He also commented on the Japanese Constitution, stating that amendments were necessary but that there were more immediate problems to be solved: [...] "I go to the disaster zones in Tohoku every month, and the constitution has not come up even once as an issue when <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street there." ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> room; then I asked, [...] "How did Mother Anastasia come to be the Mother Superior?" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{are up to}} {{our knees}} in mud here. Literally in vehement despair, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> avenue outside the Barrière de l'Étoile here yesterday, and went {{straight}} on among the trees. I came back with top-boots of mud on. Nothing will cleanse the streets. Numbers {{of men and women}} are for ever scooping and sweeping in them, and they are always one lake of yellow mud. All my trousers go to the tailor's every day, and are ravelled out at the heels every night. Washing is awful.|$|E
60|$|I {{went out}} on the porch. A city nymph, in cool summer gown and picture hat, paused before one of my newly reared {{warnings}} and read it through with care. Profound deliberation characterized her movements. She was statuesquely tall, but with a toss of the head and a flirt of the skirt she dropped on hands and knees, crawled under the fence, and came to her feet on the inside with poppies in both her hands. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> drive and talked ethically to her, and she went away. Then I put up more signs.|$|E
60|$|Well, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> village, {{my hands}} in my {{breeches}} pockets; I had poor Mary's purse there, having removed the little things which {{she gave me the}} day before, and placed them--never mind where: but look you, in those days I had a heart, and a warm one too. I had Mary's purse ready for my aunt's donation, which never came, and with my own little stock of money besides, that Mrs. Hoggarty's card parties had lessened by a good five-and-twenty shillings, I calculated that, after paying my fare, I should get to town with a couple of seven-shilling pieces in my pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "As my {{arrangements}} are all made," [...] Guy said, [...] "and I have {{an hour to}} spare, <b>I</b> shall <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> towards <b>the</b> gate and see what comes of it." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had shot}} a deer just before our halt, and, as Taylor and Delcarte were {{preparing}} it, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> water to fill our canteens. I had just finished, and was straightening up, when something floating around a bend above me caught my eye. For a moment I {{could not believe}} the testimony of my own senses. It was a boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "The 'all {{sorts of}} things' did not amount to much, Miss Regan. I made myself as useful as I could, {{and picked up}} French; and at last when the {{privateer}} sailed away <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> shore and met our sailors when they landed. There was, I can assure you, nothing in any way heroic about the part I had to play." ...|$|R
