This requires the deployment of proactive goaf <b>inertisation</b> strategies based upon detailed understanding of goaf gas flow patterns and distribution characteristics. An integrated approach combining goaf gas monitoring, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and field trials {{has been used for}} the development of effective goaf <b>inertisation</b> strategies in underground coal mines. CFD simulations indicate that inert gas injection close to the face is ineffective even at higher flow rates in the order of 1. 0 to 2. 0 m 3 /s. Inert gas needs to be injected at 200 m to 400 m behind the face at the rate of about 0. 5 m 3 /s to achieve effective goaf <b>inertisation</b> in most cases. Proactive <b>inertisation</b> strategies developed {{during the course of the}} study were highly successful in reducing oxygen ingress into the goaf and in achieving effective goaf <b>inertisation</b> by reducing oxygen levels below 5 % at 200 m behind the face. The study also indicates that just injecting inert gas into the goaf does not ensure prevention of heating incidents in the entire length of panels or all longwall panels. A number of parameters such as panel ventilation system, goaf caving conditions, and longwall retreat rate and goaf gas drainage can make a specific <b>inertisation</b> strategy ineffective and the <b>inertisation</b> strategies need to be modified based on the specific conditions at the mine sites...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Inertisation</b> is used {{to enhance}} the safety of {{underground}} mine areas either to avoid {{the potential for a}} combustion event or to stabilize a situation after an ignition, fire or heating. The primary objective of a recently completed Australian Coal Association Research Program (ACARP) study was to review coal mine <b>inertisation</b> and in particular to focus on use of the Polish mine fire simulation software Ventgraph to gain better understanding of how various <b>inertisation</b> units interact with the complex ventilation behavior underground during a substantial fire. Critical aspects targeted for examination under the project grant included location of the unit for high priority fire positions, size of borehole or pipe range required, time required for <b>inertisation</b> output to interact with and extinguish a fire, effects of seam gases on fire behavior with <b>inertisation</b> present and main fan management. A major accomplishment of the project has been to take findings from the simulation exercises to develop <b>inertisation</b> related modifications to the Ventgraph fire simulation program in conjunction with the Polish program authors. Selected mines were “evaluated or audited”as to the ability to deliver inert gases generated from GAG units to high priority underground fire locations. A coding system has been developed and many potential underground mine fire sources cannot be successfully inertized with the GAG docked at the current specified point; this is particularly so for fires in extended areas of workings or in panels. There is a limit to the ability of the GAG jet engine to deliver exhaust down smaller dimension borehole. There is a need to examine the use of the GAG for production or proactive uses in a wider application in Australian mines responding to recovering from mine fires, spontaneous combustion heating’s, elimination of the potential explosibility of newly sealed gobs or inert mines or mine sections on closure. Some of the current uses of low flow <b>inertisation</b> facilities could be more effectively undertaken with the GAG unit. ...|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous {{combustion}} {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of fire in underground coal mines especially in thick coal seams, which may cause loss of working personnel, production, valuable reserves, and damage or loss of expensive mining equipment. The blasting gallery method in an 11 m thick seam in Indian geological conditions was considered to model prediction and control of spontaneous combustion (sponcom) in thick coal seams. To find sponcom properties of the coal, gas evolution test, sponcom propensity test, differential scanning calorimetry and crossing point temperature tests were conducted for the specified thick seam. The knowledge of goaf gas behaviour in the blasting gallery extraction method during sponcom can be useful in controlling and minimizing the effects of fire.

The focus of this paper is the utilization of a GAG 3 A jet engine system to combat either large out-of-control fires or to render an entire mine inert when access to problem areas is difficult or impossible. This system is based upon a Soviet designed agricultural jet engine which consumes aviation fuel with oxygen (O 2) from the intake air and exhausts combustion gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2 O), along with the nitrogen (N 2) from the air and small amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2). The system is designed to approach stoichiometric combustion (ideally, pure burning that scavenges all the oxygen from the intake air). Therefore, these exhaust gases are almost entirely inert gases - i. e., gases which do not contribute to, and in fact, can suppress the combustion process due to the lack of oxygen. Other methods to inert mine areas have been used in the US and internationally, but these methods usually use low flow <b>inertisation</b> equipment or methods. Use of these low-flow <b>inertisation</b> equipment and methods has been successful in proactively rendering gob areas inert and has the ability to inert the entire mine workings.

Due to changes in legislative requirements an improved method was required. A number of different methods utilising N 2 or CO 2 have been utilised at other mine sites. However, at Mandalong {{it was decided to}} use methane from the in-seam gas drainage system to purge and inertise the goaf. According to our knowledge {{this is the first time}} this method of utilising methane for goaf <b>inertisation</b> and sealing has been implemented.

This is achieved by controlling the <b>inertisation</b> process through the introduction of methane from the gas drainage system with the intent of purging the critical zone of the unsealed goaf of any oxygen. Methane from the mine’s gas drainage system and existing pipe arrangement is re-directed to the seals behind the longwall take-off face and injected into the goaf fringe under seam pressure.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{models have been}} developed based upon field data collected from a longwall mine in New South Wales, Australia to study the behaviour of goaf gas flow in both active and sealed goaf areas. A base CFD model was built to represent the goaf situations when the active longwall retreats near the finish-offline. Results from the base model were calibrated and compared against field goaf gas monitoring data. The base model was then used to carry out parametric studies to investigate a number of operational scenarios {{and their impact on}} goaf gas behaviour. CFD modelling results indicate that the overall goaf gas flow pattern changes as the operating longwall retreats towards finish-offline. In all cases, oxygen penetration into the active goaf remains high, reaching 15 per cent or higher, even at some 800 m behind the longwall face. The modelling results also indicated that {{it would be difficult for}} early detection of an active goaf heating (on the maingate side) based upon CO readings in the return airflow, as the main stream of the gaseous product will be flowing into the sealed deep goafs in adjacent longwall (LW) panels. Monitoring points (such as tube bundles and bag sampling points) should be selected at deep seated seals along the active goaf so that abnormal CO or C 2 H 6 readings can be picked up for early detection and location of potential heating spots; goaf <b>inertisation</b> can be better achieved by injecting inert gas such as nitrogen at deeper points (3 ̆e 200 m) behind the operating longwall; the injection of in-seam drainage methane into the goaf areas will only have a limited impact on goaf <b>inertisation</b> as much of the injected methane will migrate towards deep and higher parts of the goaf due to its buoyancy effect...|$|E

The unit was assembled rapidly and operated safely during surface and underground trials and no mechanical problems were encountered with the device. The GAG- 3 A is not suitable for every fIre scenario particularly if large volumes of fresh air are being drawn into the mine(where multiple units may be required), but with respect to the selection criteria developed by the Moura Implementation Process Task Group 5 criteria, the unit performed up to the specifications required. In May 1997 tests were carried out at the Cook and Laleham Collieries using a Tomlinson diesel boiler. These demonstrations indicated that a low volume generator, such as the boiler, can proactively inert a large goaf area effectively. At Cook a volume of approximately 700 000 mJ was inerted over 10 days and at Laleham an area of approximately 70 000 m 3 was inerted over 2 days.

40|$|Electrical {{apparatuses}} {{for use in}} potentially explosive gas atmospheres {{are required}} to be enclosed. There are two main requirements {{in the design of}} such enclosures. Firstly, they are required to withstand the pressure generated in an internal explosion. Secondly, any gap openings must be small enough to quench flames and to cool combustion products to prevent re-ignition of a surrounding explosive gas atmosphere. The largest gap opening that just prevents transmission of an internal explosion to a surrounding explosive gas atmosphere is called the maximum experimental safe gap (MESG). The MESG values is determined from standardised experiments. The purpose of the conducted experimental work was to investigate the influence of the gap material on the MESG value. Another aim was to find out if partial <b>inertisation</b> of the explosive gas influences the maximum experimental safe gap. The combustible gas used in the experiments was propane. The experiments were conducted in an apparatus with an interchangeable and adjustable gap opening. The gap materials tested was carbon steel, brass, aluminium and polyoxymethylene. The experiments with metal gaps show that the properties of the metals do not have a significant influence on the MESG value. However, a decrease of 0. 01 mm was achieved when a flame gap of brass was used, compared to the value obtained using a steel gap. Temperature measured above the orifice of the gap opening supports the finding. At equal gap opening, a higher temperature was measures above brass gaps than above steel gaps.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{characteristic of}} greatest interest for catalysis in zeolites is the channel system, because these catalysts may display shape selective properties if the reactions {{take place within}} the channel system. However, the external surface of zeolites is accessible to all molecules and behaves in a non-shape selective manner. Coke formation on the external surface of zeolites may prevent access to the channel system of the zeolite due to pore blocking. It would thus be of great benefit to {{study the effects of}} inertising the external acidity of zeolites, thereby enhancing the shape selective properties of these catalysts, and possibly also to reduce coke formation at the entrances to the pores. Given the industrial importance of ZSM- 5, this is a particularly good zeolite to study in this regard. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and chemical liquid deposition (CLD) methods have shown great promise in inertising the external surface acidity of zeolites and thus increasing their selectivity for various reactions. The external surface acidity can be inertised by a thin layer of silica coating the external surfaces of the zeolites. The silica layer can also narrow the pore openings uniformly, thus increasing the shape selective properties of the zeolites even more. By implication, coating ZSM- 5 in a shell of iso-structural Silicalite- 1 may provide an inert layer around the ZSM- 5 crystals, without necessarily altering the pore opening size. In this study, the following methods have been used to inertise the external surface acidity of ZSM- 5, Mordenite and Beta: (i) Chemical vapour deposition - Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was contacted with the catalyst using a vapour phase flow system and static vacuum system. The effects of deposition temperature and time were varied in order to vary the amount of TEOS deposited on the samples. The effect of the decomposition species formed during TEOS deposition on the complete <b>inertisation</b> of the external surface acidity was investigated. (ii) Chemical liquid deposition Pure tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) or tetraethoxysilane diluted in water, ethanol or n-hexane was contacted with the catalyst at ambient temperatures. The effect on the <b>inertisation</b> of the external surface acidity in the presence of diluents, similar in nature to typical decomposition products formed at certain different temperatures, was studied. (iii) Coating with Silicalite shells - Parent ZSM- 5 seed crystals were immersed into a Silicalite- 1 synthesis mixture in order to obtain an iso-structural coating. The seed crystals used for modification were (a) the assynthesized material, (b) detemplated but not ion-exchanged parent crystals (Na-form), and (c) detemplated and ion-exchanged parent crystals (NH 4 -form). The primary objective of these studies was to determine how. complete <b>inertisation</b> of the external surface acidity could be achieved. By modifying samples under different conditions as outlined above, information was obtained on the uniformity of the coating of samples modified in each of the different systems.

40|$|Underground {{fires in}} coal mines {{belong to the}} most common hazards, the {{exposure}} to which frequently requires long term and costly rescue operations. It is mainly connected with the specific character of underground excavations which have limited volume.

The most certain way of improving a safety situation in Polish coal mining indus-try is taking early prevention steps. One of the prevention methods is <b>inertisation</b> of the atmosphere in longwall goaf. These activities rely on partial or total replacement of air or combustible atmosphere by inert gas. Thanks to them the risk of spontaneous fires hazard and gas explosion decreases.

40|$|Waste {{treatments}} to induce stabilization or {{recovery of waste}} materials {{is an important part}} of modern research efforts. Microwave processing has proved to be a powerful tool to convey energy exactly where it is needed by the process, as well as to allow operation in peculiar environments, even in remote-controlled modality. The present work is a summary of three years of joint research between Modena's University and ENEA investigation regarding microwave assisted thermal treatments lead on wastes of different nature, performed at the 2. 45 GHz ISM frequency. The heat-treatments regarded the <b>inertisation</b> and vitrification of asbestos and the stabilization in a glassy matrix of a multi-oxide mixture simulating nuclear waste. Either single-mode or multi-mode applicators were used during the preliminary tests, and hybrid heating was exploited, if necessary. In some cases, additives ensuring a better microwave coupling were used to improve the process speed or the overall yield. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006...|$|E
30|$|CFD {{simulations}} {{have been}} successfully used in mining research to detect spontaneous combustion and apply <b>inertisation</b> in gob areas (Yuan and Smith 2007; Ren et al. 2005), study airflow patterns and gas concentrations in continuous miner operations or heading development (Sullivan and Heerden 1993; Hargreaves and Lowndes 2007; Wala et al. 2007; Kollipara et al. 2012; Torno et al. 2013), investigate scrubber intake designs for longwall dust control (Ren and Balusu 2008), and estimate a mine’s damage status by tracer gas and simulation after a disaster (Xu et al. 2013). Simulation of DPM dispersion in underground mines {{was carried out by}} Zheng and Tien (2008), in which DPM was considered to behave like a gas. Subsequent study showed that it gave good quantitative agreement with practical accuracy for the DPM distribution and successfully identified the DPM affected areas above the threshold limit (Zheng et al. 2011). In the present study, DPM emission was also treated as a gas to examine its diffusion inside an underground single dead end entry.|$|E
40|$|Coal mine gas, {{spontaneous}} combustion and dust encountered in underground coal mines {{have long been}} recognised as safety and health hazards to mine operators. Current solutions to these issues may involve extensive pre- and post gas drainage practice, goaf <b>inertisation</b> strategies, dust suppression with water sprays or scrubbers. However, {{the effect of these}} control measures varies significantly from site to site owing to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the flow characteristics of the hazardous gases and dust particles under various mining conditions. With the development of computer technology, numerical solutions to the governing equations of fluid flow and its related processes can be obtained approximately by means of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling technique, which has been accepted as an indispensable predictive and design tool in almost every branch of fluid dynamics and engineering fields. A comprehensive literature review of the CFD applications in understanding the gas, spontaneous heating and dust issues for underground coal mines has been carried out, indicating the necessity of further exploring the CFD technique in solving these issues faced by underground coal mines...|$|E
40|$|In 1996 {{the book}} Spontaneous Combustion in Australian Underground Coal Mines was first {{released}} (Cliff, et al., 1996). Since {{that time it}} has been reprinted several times and minor updates have been made. A major overhaul of the book was commissioned by ACARP and this paper reports {{on some of the}} changes to spontaneous combustion management that have occurred over the past eighteen years. Our knowledge of the fundamental chemical processes that control spontaneous combustion has improved materially in that time. In addition preventive control measures such as good ventilation and proactive <b>inertisation</b> coupled with computer modelling of goaf behaviour have emerged, as well as improved reactive control measures including the use of foams and gels to control airflow into active goafs. Mine environment monitoring techniques and technology have also undergone major development with sophisticated automated continuous gas monitoring systems being the norm in our mines and ultrafast ultra sensitive gas chromatographs being widely used. Pressure and air flow measurements are also used routinely to monitor and predict airflows not only in roadways but across seals and through goafs...|$|E
40|$|Issues {{connected}} with expired food products are a significant, however underestimated, problem. Currently, expired food, disposed of by manufacturing industry plans, trade and gastronomy, comprises the biggest content of waste. In retail chains such products are {{withdrawn from the}} sale and become waste, which should be managed properly. Expired food cannot be again introduced to the market or be sold on reduced price or on special offers. Possibilities to use fermentation may enable both utilization of expired food and biogas acquisition – a source of renewable energy. Therefore, fermentation plays three important roles. Firstly, it is a method of converting the energy from expired food into useful fuel, i. e. biogas which can be stored and transported. Secondly, this is a method aiming at recycling organic waste into stable soil improvers, liquid fertilizers and energy. And thirdly, it is a method of waste <b>inertisation</b> with the objective to decrease adverse influence on the environment. This article indicates possibilities to obtain biogas from three selected mixtures of expired food products...|$|E
40|$|The latest {{biomedical}} waste (BMW) management guidelines {{which have}} been introduced in 2016 are simplified and made easier {{so that they can}} be easily followed by various health agencies. The categories of BMW have been reduced from ten (in 1998) to four in the latest (2016) guidelines. Many changes have been made in these latest guidelines, {{which have been}} summarised in the article below. The segregation of hospital waste plays a very important role, so the waste has to be sorted out at the source of generation according to the category to which it belongs as given in the newer guidelines. Newer waste treatment facilities such as plasma pyrolysis, encapsulation, <b>inertisation</b> have been introduced, and we have to do away with older facilities such as incineration as toxic fumes (dioxins and furans) are produced which are harmful to both health and environment. We can even think of using these wastewater treatment plants to remove the antimicrobial resistance genes during the processing of the waste, which is being generated from the hospitals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNearly 300 years ago, {{since the}} first record of a {{colliery}} explosion in Belgium significant improvements have been achieved {{in the prevention of}} explosions in mines. However, based on the past surface TBM project safety statistics, gas explosion hazards are not unique to coal mines but also occur in TBM projects with 48 explosion fatalities recorded worldwide calling for continued diligence and improvements in explosion risk management. Success of TBM in civil engineering infrastructure in poor ground conditions resulted in consideration of its application to a coal mine in QLD. This paper provides a first time case study of TBM application in a coal mine drift development in identifying the explosion hazards and its management. The investigations were extensive with preliminary hazard identification from coal mining approach to application of various ventilation and explosion prevention controls. As in coal mine spontaneous combustion management, explosion hazard was managed by continuous nitrogen injection aimed at maintaining an explosive inert atmosphere in ahighly inaccessible TBM pressurized chamber area. The background to hazard identification and control solutions including continuous nitrogen <b>inertisation</b> provided herein would enhance explosion management in both civil and mining TBM applicationsworldwide...|$|E

This thesis {{reports on}} the {{investigation}} of a cyclic chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method eliminating unwanted surface reactions and enhancing shape selective properties by depositing inert silica onto the external surface of zeolite ZSM- 5. A CVD treatment consists out of a deposition, flushing and heating step followed by calcination in flowing air. Modifications are carried out in up to 33 cycles on {{one and the same}} sample employing tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as silica precursor at deposition temperatures ranging from 50 to 400 °C. After each CVD treatment the catalyst is tested with appropriate test reactions in order to quantify the extent of modification. The gradual <b>inertisation</b> of the external surface is followed with the catalytic cracking of 1, 3, 5 -triisopropylbenzene (1, 3, 5 -TiPB) which is too bulky to enter the micro-pore structure of ZSM- 5. The disproportination of toluene (TDP) is employed to monitor changes of the internal activity and alterations in the shape selective properties of the catalyst. The analysis of reactor effluent during the deposition, flushing and heating step of the modification cycle allows investingating the reaction pathway. The deposition reaction proceeds with the reaction of the alkoxy groups of TEOS with the terminal hydroxyls of the zeolite under the formation of ethanol...|$|E
