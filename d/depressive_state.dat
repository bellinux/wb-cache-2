500|$|At this time, Hemingway was {{constantly}} worried {{about money and}} his safety. He worried about his taxes {{and that he would}} never return to Cuba to retrieve the manuscripts he had left there in a bank vault. He became paranoid, thinking the FBI was actively monitoring his movements in Ketchum. The FBI had, in fact, opened a file on him during World War II, when he used the Pilar to patrol the waters off Cuba, and J. Edgar Hoover had an agent in Havana watch Hemingway during the 1950s. By the end of November, Mary was at her wits' end, and Saviers suggested Hemingway go to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and Hemingway may have believed he was to be treated there for hypertension. [...] The FBI knew Hemingway was at the Mayo Clinic, as an agent later documented in a letter written in January 1961. In an attempt to maintain anonymity, Hemingway was checked in at the Mayo Clinic under Saviers's name. Meyers writes that [...] "an aura of secrecy surrounds Hemingway's treatment at the Mayo" [...] but confirms he was treated with electroconvulsive therapy as many as 15 times in December 1960 and was [...] "released in ruins" [...] in January 1961. Reynolds was able to access Hemingway's records at the Mayo, which indicated that the combination of medications given to Hemingway may have created the <b>depressive</b> <b>state</b> for which he was treated.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} changes in bonding and bridging types of social capital and <b>depressive</b> <b>states</b> among middle-aged adults in Japan using a nationally representative sample. Data was collected from a nationwide, population-based survey conducted from 2005 to 2013 in nine annual waves. A total of 16, 737 middle-aged men and 17, 768 middle-aged women provided data. They reported about <b>depressive</b> <b>states,</b> measured by Kessler 6 scores, and bonding and bridging types of social capital, measured by reported participation in different social activities. Latent growth modeling was conducted to examine relations between changes in bonding and bridging types of social capital and <b>depressive</b> <b>states</b> within individuals across the nine waves. The results showed that, {{for both men and}} women, increases in bonding social capital were associated with decreases in <b>depressive</b> <b>states,</b> while changes in bridging social capital were not related to changes in <b>depressive</b> <b>states.</b> In addition, the results showed that changes in bonding social capital, but not bonding social capital at the baseline, affected changes in <b>depressive</b> <b>states.</b> Future studies should take changes in social capital as an independent variable into consideration...|$|R

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a <b>depressive</b> <b>state</b> which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} DSM- 5 {{proposed}} criteria for mixed depression {{in light of}} robust and consistent historical and scientific evidence. METHOD: An extensive historical search, a systematic review of the papers used by DSM- 5 as reference papers, and a PubMed search were performed. RESULTS: As Hippocrates, <b>depressive</b> mixed <b>states</b> {{have been described as}} conditions of intense psychic suffering, consisting of depressed mood, inner tension, restlessness, and aimless psychomotor agitation. In DSM- 5, new criteria are proposed for a mixed features specifier, as part of depression either in major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder. Those criteria require, as diagnostically specific, manic/hypomanic symptoms that are the least common kinds of symptoms that actually arise in <b>depressive</b> mixed <b>states.</b> The DSM- 5 proposal is based, almost entirely, on a speculative wish to avoid 'overlapping' manic and <b>depressive</b> symptoms. Mixed <b>states</b> are, in fact, nothing but overlapping manic and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: In this article, we review the psychopathology and research on mixed <b>depressive</b> <b>states,</b> and try to demonstrate that the DSM- 5 proposal has weak scientific basis and does not identify a large number of mixed <b>depressive</b> <b>states.</b> This may be harmful because of the different treatment required by these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have found}} that <b>depressive</b> <b>states</b> in old age that do not fulfil the {{criteria}} for major depression are clinically important <b>depressive</b> <b>states.</b> These <b>depressive</b> <b>states</b> are common in primary care patients. Therefore, studies of late-life depression from a primary care perspective are needed. A depressive rating scale, Hopkins Symptom Checklist- 25 (HSCL- 25), was used in a community survey in 1993. The prevalence of high depressive score was 10. 2 %. In a medical record review, the high score group and an age- and sex-matched low score group were compared {{in order to identify}} clinical characteristics. The high score group often had many contacts with health care, recognised mental health problems and/or prescribed psychotropic medication. However, these characteristics did not have the discriminatory power for case-finding. In a 6 -year outcome study in 1999 the risk of dying were nearly twice as high for the high score group as for the low score group. The overall outcome was poor in the high score group: 72 % were either dead, had moved to long-term accommodation or were depressed. HSCL- 25 was compared with Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and with the diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders in an interview study. HSCL- 25, with cut-off > 1. 75, was found to be a sensitive case finder for clinically important <b>depressive</b> <b>states.</b> The data from the interview study were also used for identifying the most characteristic symptoms of clinically important late-life depression.

Sleep disturbance was assessed through responses to three questions on sleep problems. Age, sex, partnership status, household equivalised income, alcohol and cigarette use, and physical function were treated as confounders in this study. Additionally, information on sleep medication was available in JAGES and was included in the statistical models.

It is recommended by certain therapy guidelines as a first-line agent for acute and maintenance therapy in bipolar depression, but there have been only some promising results of placebo-controlled trials on its acute antidepressant effects, and the recommendation in therapy guidelines has been reconsidered. On the contrary, positive results for maintenance therapy could be confirmed, and LTG is still a well-tolerated option, especially in patients with predominant depressive episodes.
