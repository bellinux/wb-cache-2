40|$|When an {{incident}} shock wave impinges on a trubulent boundary layer, the boundary layer can not very frequently endure the abrupt pressure gradient {{due to the}} shock wave and separates from a solid wall. This has been called shock-induced separation (SIS). This study describes the onset of separation caused by such shock waves that interacts with turbulent boundary layers along two-dimensional or axi-symmetric geometries. The objective is to determine criterion of separation onset occurring in such <b>flow</b> <b>geometries.</b> The {{results show that the}} SIS occurs as the strength of the interact-ing shock reaches a certain specialized value, and that the criterion is not significantly influenced by the incoming boundary layer properties and <b>flow</b> <b>geometries.</b> Thus the mechanism of the onset of shock-induced separation is interpretable through the concept of free-interaction of shock wave with turbulent boundary layer. 1...|$|R

A minimum number of data are required to draw a velocity triangle at a point on blade. Some component of velocity varies at different point on the blade due {{to changes in the}} direction of flow.

50|$|The {{momentum}} equations for the {{far field}} flow dictate that the thrust and torque will induce a secondary {{flow in the}} approaching wind. This in turn affects the <b>flow</b> <b>geometry</b> at the blade. The blade itself {{is the source of}} these thrust and torque forces. The force response of the blades is governed by the geometry of the flow, or better known as the angle of attack. Refer to the Airfoil article for more information on how airfoils create lift and drag forces at various angles of attack. This interplay between the far field momentum balances and the local blade forces requires one to solve the momentum equations and the airfoil equations simultaneously. Typically computers and numerical methods are employed to solve these models.|$|E

Video analysis of real world traffic flows that exhibit self-organized capabilities is conducted to extract characteristics of those agents. A tool is created which stabilizes the input video and extracts motion from it using the background subtraction method. I discuss the tool in detail as I created it to be user friendly and easily modifiable for other uses. The aim of the video analysis I conduct is to determine characteristics of agents in self-organized traffic flow.

50|$|A {{particle}} may diffuse to {{a surface}} in quiescent conditions, but {{this process is}} inefficient as a thick depletion layer develops, {{which leads to a}} progressive slowing down of the deposition. When particle deposition is efficient, it proceeds almost exclusively in a system under flow. In such conditions, the hydrodynamic flow will transport the particles close to the surface. Once a particle is situated close to the surface, it will attach spontaneously, when the particle-surface interactions are attractive. In this situation, one refers to favorable deposition conditions. When the interaction is repulsive at larger distances, but attractive at shorter distances, deposition will still occur but it will be slowed down. One refers to unfavorable deposition conditions here. The initial stages of the deposition process can be described with the rate equation where &Gamma; is the number density of deposited particles, t is the time, c the particle number concentration, and k the deposition rate coefficient. The rate coefficient depends on the flow velocity, <b>flow</b> <b>geometry,</b> and the interaction potential of the depositing particle with the substrate. In many situations, this potential can be approximated by a superposition of attractive van der Waals forces and repulsive electrical double layer forces and can be described by DLVO theory. When the charge of the particles is of the same sign as the substrate, deposition will be favorable at high salt levels, while it will be unfavorable at lower salt levels. When the charge of the particles is of the opposite sign as the substrate, deposition is favorable for all salt levels, and one observes a small enhancement of the deposition rate with decreasing salt level due to attractive electrostatic double layer forces. Initial stages of the deposition process are relatively similar to the early stages of particle heteroaggregation, whereby one of the particles is much larger than the other.|$|E
40|$|Most {{analytical}} {{solutions and}} computer codes for well-test analysis assume a radial <b>flow</b> <b>geometry</b> around a well even though actual flow geometries {{can be quite}} different particularly in fractured media. Accurate estimation of hydraulic parameters requires knowledge of the <b>flow</b> <b>geometry.</b> Flow dimensions, representing the combined effects of <b>flow</b> <b>geometry</b> and variations in hydraulic properties, em be interpreted from the late-time slope of the pressure derivative on a log-log plot. However, the interpreted flow dimensions could be caused by {{an infinite number of}} <b>flow</b> <b>geometry</b> and hydraulic property combinations. Identifying the correct <b>flow</b> <b>geometry</b> so that appropriate hydraulic properties can be calculated is a difficult process, requiring additional information from a variety of sources. Defining a "conservative" model for a system with nonradial flow dimensions is problematic at best.

Aircraft flow models are utilized to simulate traffic flows and determine stability.
