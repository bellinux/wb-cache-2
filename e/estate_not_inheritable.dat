50|$|His {{victories}} in the pitched battles at Turnhout (1597) and at Nieuwpoort (1600) were dependent on his innovation of cooperation between arms, with artillery playing a decisive supporting role. The victories earned him military fame and acknowledgement throughout Europe. Despite these successes, the House of Orange did not attain great respect among European royalty, as the Stadtholdership was <b>not</b> <b>inheritable.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For {{recipients}} of the order who were not already members of the nobility, receipt of the order conferred a patent of nobility. This patent was <b>not</b> <b>inheritable,</b> similar to a knighthood in the United Kingdom. When a recipient was ennobled, his surname name was changed {{by the addition of}} the title [...] "Ritter von" [...] ("Knight of"). Thus for example the later Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb was born Wilhelm Leeb.|$|R
50|$|Alexander {{had also}} {{inherited}} some of Maol Íosa's property in Caithness. In 1375 he gave these lands to Robert, the Scottish king. Several writers portray {{this as the}} transfer of an Earldom of Caithness; however, it only involved property, and Caithness remained part of the Jarldom of Orkney. Although successive Jarls of Orkney were related, they each acquired the position by being personally appointed to the role by the Norwegian king; the Jarldom was <b>not</b> <b>inheritable.</b>|$|R

The title song [...] "Rainbow... vorrei... vorrei" [...] is performed by Little Tony. Alex Cox in his book 10,000 Ways to Die refers to the film as [...] "derivative and boring", [...] "a reminder that talent as a director is <b>not</b> <b>inheritable,</b> or a family trait." ...|$|R
50|$|Private {{pension schemes}} in Germany are {{personal}} funded pensions. The funds {{are protected by}} law and cannot be seized by creditors or the state. They are also <b>not</b> <b>inheritable.</b> Payments into the funds benefit from a tax credit of €154 per year per adult and up to an additional €300 if the fund beneficiary has children. The most popular form of private pension provision is the so-called Riester-Pension. The annual cost {{to the state of}} the tax credits is €7bn.|$|R
50|$|Only 16 {{when his}} father was murdered in Delft in 1584, he soon took over as stadtholder (Stadhouder), though this title was <b>not</b> <b>inheritable.</b> The monarchs of England and France had been {{requested}} to accept sovereignty, but had refused. This had left Maurice as the only acceptable candidate for the position of Stadtholder. He became stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland in 1585, of Guelders, Overijssel and Utrecht in 1590 and of Groningen and Drenthe in 1620 (following the death of Willem Lodewijk, who had been Stadtholder there and in Friesland).|$|R
60|$|Evidence not of this {{directly}} experimental kind, {{but nevertheless}} of considerable weight, is furnished by other nervous disorders. There is proof enough that insanity admits of being induced by circumstances which, {{in one or}} other way, derange the nervous functions--excesses {{of this or that}} kind; and no one questions the accepted belief that insanity is inheritable. Is it alleged that the insanity which is inheritable is that which spontaneously arises, and that the insanity which follows some chronic perversion of functions is <b>not</b> <b>inheritable?</b> This does <b>not</b> seem a very reasonable allegation; and until some warrant for it is forthcoming, we may fairly assume that there is here a further support for belief in the transmission of functionally-produced changes.|$|R
50|$|Tanstein is {{the oldest}} of the three castles in the group. An 1127 {{document}} refers to an Anshelmus de Tannicka as the owner or governor; as a result the castle was probably built in the early 12th century. In 1189, in a deed by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, a Henry von der Than is mentioned and the castle designated as an immediate imperial fief. In the period that followed, Ulrich of Dahn and Conrad of Dahn are named as imperial ministeriales. In 1328 the castle became a fief of the bishops of Speyer. Until 1464 there were frequent changes of ownership, which suggests that the fief was still <b>not</b> <b>inheritable</b> during this phase, but was always re-enfeoffed.|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} the chemeric condition of bulls by cytogenetic analysis {{the present study}} was conducted. The whole blood culture, cell harvesting, conventional Giemsa staining and GTG banding were performed for the chromosomal studies. During cytogenetic investigation on 200 buffalo bulls, 3 young bulls exhibited sex chromosomal chimerism (XX/XY) in their blood cells. Hundred metaphase fields were screened for each bull. Cytogenetic studies on chimeric bulls indicated unusual higher ratio of XX chromosomes in 3 bulls. The fertility status of these bulls are not known as they are young and not in semen collection. As documented, the fertility of chimeric bulls is not grossly affected and the condition is <b>not</b> <b>inheritable.</b> Hence, the bulls may be used for breeding programmes if their semen quality is good...|$|R

40|$|Measures of {{fluctuating}} asymmetry, {{the random}} and <b>not</b> <b>inheritable</b> deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry, are routinely used as indices of developmental stability. The almost homonomous trunk of geophilomorph centipedes presents {{another kind of}} symmetry: the series of segments are arranged according to a translational symmetry. We found that the segmental pattern of some metric characters presents high levels of local disparity between contiguous segments, these irregularities resembling the effect of developmental noise affecting a more regular underlying pattern. We present a preliminary study of the developmental stability of geophilomorph segment differentiation, dealing with segmental patterns of metric characters {{in the trunk of}} two species. We found good correlation between the developmental stability in segmental differentiation expressed as translational asymmetry (TA) and the degree of developmental stability estimated by measures of traditional (bilateral) fluctuating asymmetry (FA) ...|$|R
40|$|Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL), {{also known}} as Haberland {{syndrome}}, is a rare syndrome with unknown etiology. The syndrome {{is characterized by a}} triad of unique cutaneous, ocular, and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. The cutaneous hallmark, nevus psiloliparus (NP), along with overlying alopecia is a constant feature. Choristoma of the eyelid is the most common ocular manifestation, while intracranial lipoma is the predominant CNS finding. Genetic counseling is required to emphasize that the disorder, although congenital, is <b>not</b> <b>inheritable.</b> We present a 21 -year-old female with cutaneous, ocular, and CNS features satisfying the diagnostic criteria for ECCL. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ECCL having a large temporal exostosis. The objective {{of this article is to}} better understand the phenotypic spectrum of this syndrome whose molecular basis is still unknown...|$|R

30|$|Land-related {{policies}} further lowered women’s {{socioeconomic status}} in Borana society and pastoralists in general. First and foremost, the colonial government perceived pastoralism as seasonal and traditional land tenure and practices associated with pastoralism {{were viewed as}} a barrier to commercialization of land. In essence, by 1940, demonstration plots were developed on the slopes of Mount Marsabit to plant maize. The local communities including the Borana were allocated farming plots but with various conditions including signing a legal contract with the District Commissioner, maintaining presences on the land. They could not transfer land, sell their agricultural products or erect any building without the written permission by the District Commissioner. Furthermore, the plots were considered Crown Land and <b>not</b> <b>inheritable.</b> This condition was particularly a blow for widows, including from the Borana community, who were vulnerable to eviction upon the death of their husbands (Marsabit District Annual Report 1946). 85 These laws reduced women’s access to productive resources such as land.|$|R
