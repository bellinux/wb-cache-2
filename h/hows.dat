25|$|All ascents end via {{the short}} walk from the {{bridleway}} at Iron Keld to the summit, but starts can be made at Skelwith Bridge, High Park, Oxen Fell, Yew Tree Tarn, Tom Gill, Tarn <b>Hows</b> or Knipe Fold.|$|E

25|$|The summit area is {{composed}} of flow banded andesite lavas, the Haystacks Member. A minor intrusion of quartz-feldspar-phyric microgranite runs along {{the crest of the}} ridge. To the west the Round <b>Hows</b> are examples of bedded breccias sandstone and tuffs.|$|E
25|$|South of Black Fell is Tarn <b>Hows,</b> {{a picturesque}} work of {{landscape}} design initiated by James Marshall in the 1860s. This {{is one of}} the most popular destinations in the Lake District, the mixture of water, rock and arboretum being finely contrived. Now owned by the National Trust, the motor traffic is so great that a one-way system had to be initiated as early as the 1960s. Tarn <b>Hows</b> is maintained by a dam at the south west corner and circumnavigated by a broad, level path, providing access to all. Few of the millions of visitors stray onto the slopes of Black Fell, or even know the name of the hill which provides the backdrop to so many photographs.|$|E

Every want was provided for; every difficulty was foreseen; every requisite was noted. The questions to be decided were numerous and involved. <b>How</b> much carrying capacity was required? <b>How</b> much rolling stock? <b>How</b> many engines? What spare parts? <b>How</b> much oil? <b>How</b> many lathes? <b>How</b> many cutters? <b>How</b> many punching and shearing machines? What arrangements of signals would be necessary? <b>How</b> many lamps? <b>How</b> many points? <b>How</b> many trolleys? What amount of coal should be ordered? <b>How</b> much water would be wanted? <b>How</b> should it be carried? To what extent would its carriage affect the hauling power and influence all previous calculations? <b>How</b> much railway plant was needed? <b>How</b> many miles of rail? <b>How</b> many thousand sleepers? Where could they be procured at such short notice? <b>How</b> many fishplates were necessary? What tools would be required? What appliances? What machinery? <b>How</b> much skilled labour was wanted? <b>How</b> much of the class of labour available? <b>How</b> were the workmen to be fed and watered? <b>How</b> much food would they want? <b>How</b> many trains a day must be run to feed them and their escort? <b>How</b> many must be run to carry plant? <b>How</b> did these requirements affect the estimate for rolling stock? The answers to all these questions, and to many others with which I will not inflict the reader, were set forth by Lieutenant Girouard in a ponderous volume several inches thick; and such was the comprehensive accuracy of the estimate that the working parties were never delayed by the want even of a piece of brass wire.|$|R
