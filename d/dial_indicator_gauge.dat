40|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{parameters}} for successful grouting {{is to ensure that}} the grout can penetrate the necessary apertures. For the most commonly used grout, cementitious grout, the available methods for determining the ability to penetrate apertures involves several measurements with different meshes or similar, which need to be evaluated. However, during the grouting process in the field there is rarely any time for evaluation and the most commonly used field method today stipulates a mesh width through which a certain volume need to pass. This implies that only an indirect measurement of the penetrability is performed. In order to perform direct and fast field measurements of the penetrability, a new, robust measuring device has been developed at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. The device is named PenetraCone and the measuring part consists of a gap that is formed between two conical cylinders. The penetrability characteristics are measured by decreasing this gap as grout flows through. The gap is measured using a <b>dial</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>gauge.</b> Initial tests with the PenetraCone show that two characteristic gaps or widths can be evaluated. The width as the grout flow goes from continuous flow to dripping is termed bfilter and when the flow stops completely it is termed bstop. The parameter bfilter is related to the commencement of clogging or filtration of the cementitious grout. This means that for apertures larger than bfilter the cement passes unrestricted but for narrower apertures filtration will commence. This filtration process will occur in apertures down to bstop, which indicates the smallest aperture that the cement can pass through and for apertures below bstop the cement will not penetrate at all. The device is easy to use and the tests show that consistent values are obtained. The accuracy seems good enough for use as a control of the penetrability of cementitious grouts in the field. For use in production, the PenetraCone should be placed on the grouting rig, after the mixer, so that direct measurements can be performed on the grout that will actually be used for grouting. By relating the measured parameters to the penetrability requirements, quick decisions regarding the quality of the grout can be made directly on the grouting rig...|$|E

40|$|Through {{the use of}} an {{acoustic}} microscope, it is possible to measure the topography of a sample (11) {{and at the same time}} its elasticity characteristics. The deflection of a <b>dial</b> <b>indicator</b> (1) is measured by the deflection of a laser beam (22). The topography is measurable by the fact that the mean deflection of the <b>dial</b> <b>indicator</b> (1) is kept constant by means of a control loop. The control loop consists of a segmented photodiode (24) which supplies a neutral signal at the output of a normalization amplifier (29) at the mean deflection of the <b>dial</b> <b>indicator.</b> Deviations from the neutral signal can be compensated via the z electrode (8) of a piezocrystal. The elasticity characteristics of the sample (11) are measurable by the fact that ultrasound can be injected into the sample (11) by means of a transmitting head (9) and the high-frequency deflection of the <b>dial</b> <b>indicator</b> (11) can be measured by means of a second detection device from a shadowing device and a high-speed photodiode (37).

40|$|The most {{important}} characteristic factor of cutting tools is cutting ability. One {{of the factors}} that influence cutting ability of cutting tools is wear resistance. At market there are many large selection of HSS tool steel with different type and merk. One of them was HSS tool steel made in Austria and Taiwan which share the same trade mark but have significant differences at price. The research aimed to compare HSS cutting tools quality made in Austria and Taiwan consider from wear, tool life and material structure aspect. This research had done by flank wear experiment to the HSS cutting tools. The specimens were BOHLER RAPID EXTRA 1200 with 3 / 8 x 4 ” on size made in Austria and Taiwan. The work piece specimen used ST 60 steel. Flank wear experiment of cutting tools had done by turning cutting tools to the work piece with four cutting speed variation like 19, 99 m/min, 25, 72 m/min, 26, 53 m/min and 30, 65 m/min that had given, then measured flank wear dimension (VB) using microscope that completed with <b>dial</b> <b>indicator</b> and pixel method. The result of this research showed that Austria HSS tool life which had the longest time at low cutting speed (Vc= 19, 99 m/min) was 100 minute (<b>dial</b> <b>indicator)</b> / 92, 5 minute (pixel), and tool life which had the shortest time at high cutting speed (Vc= 30, 65 m/min) was 25 minute (<b>dial</b> <b>indicator)</b> / 26, 5 minute (pixel). Taiwan HSS tool life which had the longest time at low cutting speed (Vc= 19, 99 m/min) was 87, 5 minute (<b>dial</b> <b>indicator)</b> / 84, 5 minute (pixel), and tool life which had the shortest time at high cutting speed (Vc= 30, 65 m/min) was 25 minute (<b>dial</b> <b>indicator)</b> / 22, 5 minute (pixel). The conclusion of this research is that HSS cutting tool made in Austria with more expensive cost, but has higher wear resistance and longer tool life than HSS cutting tool made in Taiwan. ...|$|R
