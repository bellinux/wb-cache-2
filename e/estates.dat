5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a privilege of the <b>estates,</b> yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the <b>estates.</b> He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the <b>estates</b> in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their <b>estates</b> (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E

John claimed that although de Broc had originally returned custody of the <b>estates</b> to Becket's officials, shortly before John's arrival de Broc had regained control of the <b>estates</b> and expelled Becket's officials.

Despite this, Bute retained the final authority over even quite minor issues on the <b>estates,</b> including making decisions on the buttons to be used on local school uniforms or the reuse of a broken flag pole, for example, which could result in considerable delays as letters were sent between South Wales and Scotland. As the complexity of the Glamorgan <b>estates</b> grew, more officials were appointed to help manage the docks, farms and mineral interests, but these all reported separately to Bute, putting increasing pressure on the marquess.|$|E

40|$|Since early 70 s, real <b>estate</b> {{education}} in Malaysia emphasises on real <b>estate</b> valuation to cater {{for the needs}} for Valuation Officer in Ministry of Finance.

The paper presents the current issues of real <b>estate</b> {{education in}} Malaysia including the consequences of REITs listing, managing corporate real <b>estate</b> for non-real <b>estate</b> companies {{and the perception of}} real <b>estate</b> investment with other investment means. In order to cater for the changing needs, real <b>estate</b> education should transform for a new paradigm focusing more on real <b>estate</b> investment and decisions. The direction of real <b>estate</b> education must also emphasise on real <b>estate</b> asset management, marketing, market research and decision-making. Currently, the main shortcoming of real <b>estate</b> discipline is the unstable of real <b>estate</b> data and information which affect real <b>estate</b> decision-making. However, shifting towards a new direction in real <b>estate</b> education requires collaboration from institution of higher learning.

5|$|Frederick William's {{excise tax}} (Akzise), which since 1667 {{replaced}} {{the property tax}} raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the <b>estates.</b> The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local <b>estates.</b> In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the <b>estates</b> in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges {{were not to be}} used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian <b>estates</b> to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian <b>estates</b> {{for the first time in}} 1674. Since 1704, the Prussian <b>estates</b> had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the estates' {{contributions}} {{were limited}} to six years, yet the Frederick William obliged the <b>estates</b> to continue the payments thereafter and created a dedicated office to collect the contributions. The contributions were confirmed by the <b>estates</b> in 1662, but transformed in 1666 by decree from a real estate tax to an excise tax. Since 1657, the towns had to contribute not soldiers, but monetary payments to the army, and since 1665, the <b>estates</b> were able to free themselves from contributing soldiers by additional payments. The initial army size of 8,000 men had risen to 25,000 to 30,000 men by 1688. By then, Frederick William had also accomplished his second goal, to finance the army independently of the <b>estates.</b> By 1688, these military costs amounted to considerable 1,500,000 talers or half of the state budget. Ensuring a solid financial basis for the army, undisturbed by the <b>estates,</b> was the foremost objective of Frederick William's administrative reforms.
