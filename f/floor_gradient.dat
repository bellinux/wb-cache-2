40|$|AbstractA {{procedure}} is proposed {{to follow the}} “minimum path” of a hypersurface starting anywhere in the catchment region of the corresponding minimum. The method uses a modification of the so-called “following the reduced gradient” [1]. The original method connects points where the gradient has a constant direction. In the present letter, this is replaced by the successive directions of the tangent of the searched curve. The resulting pathway is that valley <b>floor</b> <b>gradient</b> extremal which belongs to the smallest (absolute) eigenvalue of the Hessian. The new method avoids third derivatives of the objective function. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by using a polynomial test, the notorious Rosenbrock function in two, 20, and in 100 dimensions...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{procedure}} {{to follow the}} ‘‘path along the valley floor’ ’ of a hypersurface. The aim is either to find minima, or to go from a minimum to a saddle point of index one, if the saddle {{is at the top}} of the valley floor. The motivation is that of taking into account local nonconvexity of the hypersurface and possibly to determine valleys. The method uses a projector technique where the projector is built by the tangent of the valley floor line. The projector is applied to the gradient and Hessian matrix of a given function, and it is used for predictor and corrector steps in path following. The resulting path is the ‘‘valley <b>floor</b> <b>gradient</b> extremal’ ’ which corresponds to the smallest (absolute) eigenvalue of the Hessian. Convergence properties are analysed...|$|E

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to understand, within a cause-and-effect framework, the sequence-building pattern in Proterozoic time that {{witnessed}} non-uniformiteranean microbial mat growth and epeiric sea development. Marine or marginal marine successions in three Neoproterozoic formations, the Sonia Sandstone in western India, and the Sirbu Shale and Upper Bhander Sandstone in central India have been examined here for this purpose. The strikingly common feature of all three formations is vertical stacking of highstand systems tracts without intervention of any significant transgressive deposits. In one instance only, the transgressive systems tract is represented by a thin granular transgressive lag, and in all other cases the evidence of transgression is simply marked by the presence of marine flooding surfaces. The absence of transgressive strata relates to the low sea <b>floor</b> <b>gradients,</b> which facilitated rapid transgressions, combined with a generally low sediment supply. Aggradation under normal regressive highstand conditions, in spite of the low sediment supply, was promoted by the prolific growth of microbial mats, which reduced the effects of wave and current reworking by organic binding of clastic particles. © 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and construction of}} approximate channel <b>floor</b> longitudinal <b>gradients</b> from 26 radar elevation profiles at four latitudinal channel crossings show that the outflow channels of the Lunae Planum and Chryse Basin have much lower values {{than those of the}} U. S. Geological Survey's topographic map. In order to account for the movement of fluids to the north, it is proposed that ponding from local runoff occurred before channel transition along the course of Simud and Tiu Valles. The lakes eventually overflowed, drainages became integrated, and headward erosion reached interfluves, thereby forming the present channel configurations. The ponding and the flooding following it, which had sufficient head to move fluids across nearly level gradients, would have occurred during a period when the climate allowed the surface runoff of fluids and standing bodies of water...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the relative height of objects {{is an important}} cue of depth perception in pictorial displays. However, this phenomenon has never been investigated experimentally. The present {{study was designed to}} systematically test the elevation cue in various pictorial contexts. An experiment was conducted to examine the role of relative elevation of two identical 1. 43 deg* 1. 43 deg squares presented with different orientations to one another (at 45 deg and 225 deg) and at different separations from one another (1. 43 deg and 2. 86 deg) in the perception of depth. In addition, the two squares were presented at seven different heights, on the left and on the right of the monitor and within different pictorial contexts (eg a gradient on the floor only; gradients on the floor limited by a wall at a distance; gradients both on the floor and ceiling limited by a wall at a distance; and a single line of the horizon), together with a control con- dition without any background structure. As expected, the results show <b>floor</b> <b>gradient</b> effects in the perception of depth as a function of relative elevation. In addition, the wall and the ceiling gradient significantly change this effect. The depth effect is inverted, with squares in higher positions being perceived closer...|$|E
40|$|Prolongation of the landmass is the {{fundamental}} principle of Article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and reference to this principle has been useful where {{the outer edge of}} New Zealand’s continental margin is geologically and morphologically complex. The seafloor around New Zealand is characterised by ridges and plateaus that reflect the complex tectonic history of the region. Rifting and subduction processes have resulted in continental fragmentation, and in continental growth by the accretion of terranes, basin formation, and volcanic activity. Application of article 76 and of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf Guidelines to these features requires a thorough understanding of their morphology, geology and tectonic history. This paper focuses on one technical aspect of article 76 — determining the location of the foot of the continental slope by maximum change in sea <b>floor</b> <b>gradient</b> and by evidence to the contrary. Examples from the New Zealand continental margin illustrate the sort of data that might be used as evidence to the contrary, and show situations where use of this evidence is more appropriate than a foot of the continental slope position based on maximum change in gradient at its base...|$|E
40|$|Computer-generated environments {{have been}} {{established}} as valuable training media for both proximal-field object manipulation and wide-area navigation performance. This study investigates the potential of virtual environments-based computer training for near-field navigation accuracy. Results of this investigation revealed significantly greater performance accuracy in a real-world setting for subjects that were first trained in a virtual environment. In addition, three levels of rendered visual detail were compared for precision of movement within a virtual hallway: (1) uutextured polygon surfaces, (2) untextured polygon surfaces with transverse <b>floor</b> <b>gradient</b> lines placed as visual cues, and (3) fully detailed textured surfaces. Significant effects were found for visual detail in accuracy of movement production. Within the virtual environment, performance rror in the uudetailed setting was signifi-cantly higher {{as compared to the}} settings with visual cues and textures. Significant differences in real-world field performance were also found between the groups that were exposed to different levels of visual detail in computer training. Field performance was significantly superior for subjects trained with visual cues as compared to those trained in an uutextured virtual setting. Evidence suggests that for movement production accuracy both within a virtual environment and in the real world fully-detailed textured surfaces are not required in the rendered setting in order to obtain the best performance. Simple surface gradients erve as adequate visual cues for near-field navi-gation accuracy, while a lack of consistent visual cues can be detrimental to effective movement production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Real world indoor environments {{are rich}} in planar surfaces. Floor {{detection}} or ground-plane detection is a crucial requirement for a robotic navigation task. Despite frequent successes in this area, problems with detection of navigable floor with multiple planar and non-planar slopes at multiple heights still exist. For robust and safe navigation, such small variations such as floor joins, carpet deformities, raised steps and <b>floor</b> <b>gradients</b> need to be detected and robot path and kinodynamics plan must be adjusted accordingly. The authors suggest a recursive RANSAC segmentation based algorithm that estimates the dominant and sub-dominant plane models for all the navigable planes within a detected floor or a ground plane. The algorithm also divides the input point clouds intelligently into multiple regions of interest for both efficiency and accuracy enhancement. The recursive estimation approach for determining plane parameters helps to detect multiple planes within each region. Among other benefits of this approach, reduction of search space size for the estimation of plane parameters stands {{out to be the}} most striking result of this work. This region wise plane estimation approach also helps to reduce the computational load by selectively dropping less significant floor sections from estimation process. The floor estimation technique coupled with sensor response functions for two different point cloud generators further investigates into the robustness of the method when deployed on two distinct sensors i. e. RGB+D sensor and a stereo vision camera. In our experiments we segment navigable floor planes in real-time for a slowly moving sensor. The location and geometrical parameters of the floor planes are updated in a global coordinate system whenever a change their location is detected. The planes are associated to a grid map which serves as a path-planning reference to a mobile robot used in our experiments. The results of floor detection and the precision of floor anomaly detection are compared sensor-wise and with the ground truth defined by obstacle heights and configuration...|$|R

At Happy Isles, the river gradient is approximately 2%. The gradient of the Merced River at Happy Isles is steeper than in the Valley floor, and the channel of the river is cut into erosion-resistant granitic boulders and talus materials, compared to channel deposits of sands and gravel present on the Valley <b>floor.</b> The steeper <b>gradient</b> and composition of streambed materials together impede meandering patterns from developing in this area.|$|R

40|$|Land {{clearing}} for dryland agriculture {{has altered}} landscape water balance and {{is associated with}} severe valley-floor secondary dryland salinity within parts of Australia, South-East Asia, Africa, North and South America. The pervasive hydrologic process-response model is termed the “hillslope recharge-discharge model” (HRD Model), and attributes salinisation to increased hillslope recharge and rising groundwater tables resulting from reduced evapotranspiration potential following land clearing. New research suggests that internal redistribution of surface water from moderately-sloped hillslopes onto low-gradient broad valley floors, termed the “shedding-receiving model”, may be a significant additional salinisation mechanism and alternative management strategies may be required. A meso-scale surface water gauging network and four valley floor surface water-groundwater interaction sites were established in the Toolibin Lake catchment in southwestern Australia. Based on two years of data, we confirm that the shedding-receiving model holds in this landscape, operating {{in combination with the}} pervasive HRD model. There is significant rainfall runoff from moderately sloped uplands, onto low gradient valley floors and high transmission losses result from top-down preferential pathway recharge after the break of season. A new management paradigm was proposed to address the internal runoff redistribution and salt exfiltration mechanisms caused by the shedding receiving behaviour. A lowgradient, broad-based channel, approximately 25 m wide, 0. 4 m deep and running at the valley <b>floor</b> <b>gradient</b> (~ 0. 0003 – 0. 0015) was designed to carry a 1 : 3 yr flow.

A <b>gradient</b> of netrin-1 is produced from the floor plate, which allows orientation of the extending axons, aiding {{the development of the}} dorsal-ventral axis of the brain and spinal column. A variety of receptors are present on the axon surface which either repel or attract axons to the midline. When membrane DCC is stimulated by netrin-1, it promotes axon progression towards the midline.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} ice streams in Antarctica reveal a {{mechanism}} of basal motion that may apply to channels and valleys on Mars. The mechanism is sliding {{of the ice}} on deformable water-saturated till under high pore pressures. It has been suggested by Lucchitta that ice was present in outflow channels on Mars and gave them their distinctive morphology. This ice may have slid like Antarctic ice streams but on rubbly weathering products rather than till. However, to generate water under high pore pressures, elevated heatflow is needed to melt {{the base of the}} ice. Either volcanism or higher heatflow more than 2 b. y. ago could have raised the basal temperature. Regarding valley networks, higher heatflow 3 b. y. ago could have allowed sliding of ice-saturated overburden at a few hundred meters depth. If the original, pristine valleys were somewhat deeper than they are now, they could have formed by the same mechanism. Recent sounding of the seafloor in front of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica reveals large persistent patterns of longitudinal megaflutes and drumlinoid forms, which bear remarkable resemblance to longitudinal grooves and highly elongated streamlined islands found on the floors of martian outflow channels. The flutes are interpreted to have formed at the base of ice streams during the last glacial advance. Additional similarities of Antarctic ice streams with martian outflow channels are apparent. Antarctic ice streams are 30 to 80 km wide and hundreds of kilometers long. Martian outflow channels have similar dimensions. Ice stream beds are below sea level. Carr determined that most common floor elevations of martian outflow channels lie below martian datum, which may have been close to or below past martian sea levels. The Antarctic ice stream bed gradient is flat and locally may go uphill, and surface slopes are exceptionally. Martian channels also have <b>floor</b> <b>gradients</b> that are shallow or go uphill locally and have low surface gradients. The depth to the bed in ice streams is 1 to 1. 5 km. At bankful stage, the depth of the fluid in outflow channels was 1 to 2 km, according to the height of bordering scarps. The similarity between Antarctic ice streams and martian outflow channels suggests that ice may have flowed through and shaped the outflow channels, and that perhaps the mechanism of motion of Antarctic ice streams also operated in outflow channels. In addition, sliding on deformable rubble may explain the formation of small valley networks. The large Siple Coast Antarctic ice streams are thought to slide over longitudinally grooved, deforming till, where much of the movement is within the till. The till is saturated with water at high pore pressures that nearly supports all of the weight of the ice. The small differential between overburden pressure and pore pressure at the bed {{is more important than the}} volume of water, but water needs to be supplied to the till interface. For pore pressures to remain high, the ice streams have to act as a seal that blocks the flow of water through them, and the rock underneath has to be of low permeability to prevent the water from draining away...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 In this thesis, the {{interpretation}} and reduction of ocean heat flow measurements are discussed {{on the basis}} of theoretical models. The instrument effect x heat flow measurements is investigated for the case of long period measurements by studying the heat conduction along the measurement probe for both steady and unsteady state bottom temperatures. This effect is found to be unimportant. Measurement errors due to recent bottom temperature transients are studied and the possible magnitude of such errors is estimated. Moreover, effects of climatic variation on the ocean floor temperature are estimated {{on the basis of}} diffusion models. It is shown that climatic variations with periods longer than one thousand years will be unattenuated and will affect the entire ocean floor. The perturbation method is used to study the effects of an irregular topography and a variable thickness of ocean floor sediments on the heat flow. Some special examples are given to provide a comparison between the perturbation solutions and exact solutions of similar problems. The perturbation method is also applied to a buried body with different thermal conductivity from its surroundings and the reliability of the perturbation solution is examined. Heat flow anomalies due to heat transport by magma intruded into crustal layers is studied by solving the heat conduction equation. It is shown that magmatic intrusions can lead to very large surface heat flow anomalies. Finally, the possibility of deriving the ocean <b>floor</b> thermal <b>gradient</b> on the basis of on-ship measurements performed on sediment cores is investigated. The results appear positive. The temperature variations in flowing wells and the temperature variation in a cylindrical sediment core influenced by the movement of water along the axis of the core are also studied...|$|R
40|$|Geomorphological {{analyses}} of the morphology, lithostratigraphy and chronology of Holocene alluvial fills in a 2. 75 km long piedmont reach of the wandering gravel-bed River South Tyne at Lambley in Northumberland, northern England, have identified spatial and temporal patterns of late Holocene channel and floodplain development and elucidated the relationship between reach- and subreach-scale channel transformation and terrace formation. Five terraced alluvial fills have been dated to periods sometime between c. 1400 BC-AD 1100, AD 1100 - 1300, AD 1300 - 1700, AD 1700 - 1850 and from AD 1850 to the present. Palaeochannel morphology and lithofacies architecture of alluvial deposits indicate that the past 3000 years has been characterized by episodic channel and floodplain change associated with development and subsequent recovery of subreach-scale zones of instability which have been fixed in neither time nor space. Cartographic and photographic evidence spanning the past 130 years suggests channel transformation can be accomplished {{in as little as}} 50 years. The localized and episodic nature of fluvial adjustment at Lambley points to the operation of subreach-scale controls of coarse sediment transfers. These include downstream propagation of sediment waves, as well as internal controls imposed by differing valley <b>floor</b> morphology, <b>gradient</b> and boundary materials. However, the preservation of correlated terrace levels indicates that major phases of floodplain construction and entrenchment have been superimposed over locally complex patterns of sediment transfer. Reach-scale lateral and vertical channel adjustments at Lambley appear to be closely related to climatically driven changes in flood frequency and magnitude, with clusters of extreme floods being particularly important for accomplishing entrenchment and reconfiguring the pattern of localized instability zones. Confinement of flood flows by valley entrenchment, and contamination of catchment river courses by metal-rich fine sediments following recent historic mining operations, have combined to render the South Tyne at Lambley increasingly sensitive to changes in flood regimes over the past 1000 years.

40|$|Understanding environment-vegetation {{relationships}} provides important ecological insights, {{and here}} we examined such relationships for the Hamersley Ranges of North West Australia. We were particularly interested to see if such relationships {{were similar to those}} of other mountainous deserts. We used direct gradient analyses of floristic and environmental variables (constrained ordination), supplemented by identification of environmental differences between plant communities, assessment of environment-vegetation associations and partitioning of the floristic variance between environmental, climatic and spatial variables. Most communities could be differentiated from others according to environmental variables, with slope, surface stone cover, topsoil phosphorus and pH particularly good at differentiating between plant communities. There was strong association between communities and classes of landform and/or geological substrate. Gradient analysis demonstrated the primary floristic gradient was linked to a complex of several topographic, edaphic and geomorphic variables. This was interpreted as floristic change along broad topo-sequences from mountain/ridge tops to valley <b>floors</b> over which <b>gradients</b> in key environmental variables occur. Gradient analyses of other mountainous deserts have reported similar findings. A key distinction in the complex gradient identified for the Hamersley Ranges is the inclusion of topsoil phosphorus (rather than nitrogen) and time since last fire. The second most important floristic gradient was linked to soil pH and conductivity, which reflects floristic variation due to differences in geological substrate throughout the study area...|$|R

This may be mediated through soil microbes, such as ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, saprotrophic fungi and bacteria, and {{the aim of}} this study was to evaluate the relationship between soil microbes and forest floor C-to-N ratios. Soil samples from 33 Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst) forests in Denmark and southern Sweden in a forest <b>floor</b> C-to-N ratio <b>gradient</b> (ranging from 14 to 35) were analysed regarding the content of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) to estimate their soil microbial community composition and the relative biomasses of different microbial groups. The relation of EM biomass to total fungal biomass was estimated as the loss of the fungal PLFA 18 : 2 omega 6, 9 during incubation of soils and the production of EM mycelia was estimated using fungal in-growth mesh bags. The soil microbial variables were correlated to forest floor C-to-N ratio, NO (3) (-) leaching, soil pH and stand age. Fungal proportions of microbial biomass, EM to total fungi and EM mycelial production were all positively related to C-to-N ratio, while NO (3) (-) leaching was negatively related to C-to-N ratio. Both EM and saprotrophic fungi change with forest floor C-to-N ratios and appear to play a central role in N retention in forest soil. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind this process may be revealed if the role of recalcitrant fungal metabolites for N retention (and soil C sequestration) can be identified. Research along this line deserves further studies...|$|R

Microhabitat conditions chosen by terrestrial amphibians {{may represent a}} trade-off between high ambient temperatures, which maximize performance but cause high rates of water loss, and low temperatures, which, in turn, slow desiccation, but potentially hinder performance. We determined the operative temperature of common frogs (Rana temporaria) by placing 3 % agar models in different microhabitats and measuring their temperature and water loss. Temperature measurements derived from the models accurately matched the body temperature of live frogs placed in the same microhabitat. Operative temperatures were lower than ambient temperatures on a warm day, probably because of evaporative water loss, but they were similar to or even slightly higher than ambient temperatures on a cool day, possibly because of warmth from the substrate. Frogs in the field selected moist and cool habitats, and their body temperatures ranged from 15 to 21 °C. In a temperature gradient in the laboratory, captive frogs chose significantly higher temperatures (19. 4 ± 1. 7 °C) when the <b>gradient</b> <b>floor</b> was covered entirely with wet sand than when sand was wet in the cool end, but dry in the warm end (17. 6 ± 2. 5 °C). The relevance of the preferred temperature was assessed through jumping performance experiments, using frogs with different body temperatures. Jump length was lower at low body temperature (6 °C) than at higher body temperatures, and peaked at 15 °C. Our {{results suggest that the}} frogs select favourable microhabitats of intermediate temperature, which could result in reduced water loss and peak physiological and behavioural performance.
