25|$|Although Binoche {{began the}} decade on a {{professional}} high with an Academy Award nomination for Chocolat, she struggled {{at the beginning}} of the 2000s to secure roles that did not confine her to the tragic, melancholic persona developed in the 1990s. Despite the huge success of Caché, other high-profile films such as <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Country,</b> Bee Season and Breaking and Entering failed critically and commercially, Binoche seemed to be at a crossroads in her career.|$|E

500|$|In Argentine society, Messi is {{generally}} held in lesser esteem than Maradona, {{a consequence of}} not only his uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi {{is in some ways}} the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, although through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt—he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays—have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi has said: [...] "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>country</b> happy." [...] In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they haven't been given their salaries for six months. He has stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.|$|E

2500|$|She is {{best known}} for her book Country of My Skull, which chronicled the TRC. With Krog's {{reluctant}} permission, the book was later dramatised for the screen by Ann Peacock resulting in a film of the same name. Released in the United States as <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Country,</b> it stars Samuel L. Jackson and Juliette Binoche. While the film was thought to have its [...] "heart and politics in the right place" [...] it was otherwise panned by the Washington Post [...] as a [...] "formula romance", in which Binoche fails at the Afrikaans accent and Jackson's character, Langston Whitfield, lacks credibility as a Post reporter.|$|E

Since the year 2000, when we began Plan Colombia, the United States has provided more than $3 billion in vital aid. We'll continue providing aid. We've helped Colombia to strengthen its democracy, to combat drug production, to create a more transparent and effective judicial system, to increase the size and professionalism of its military and police forces, to protect human rights, and to reduce corruption.

2500|$|In a {{more serious}} vein, Binoche {{travelled}} to South Africa to make John Boorman's <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Country</b> (2004) opposite Samuel L. Jackson. Based on the book Country of My Skull by Antjie Krog, the film examines The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearings following the abolition of Apartheid in the mid-1990s. Although the film premiered at the 2004 Berlin International Film Festival, it received much criticism {{for the inclusion of}} a fictional romantic liaison and for its depiction of black South Africans. Despite the negative reception, Binoche was extremely enthusiastic about the film and her connection with Boorman. Her sister, Marion Stalens, also travelled to South Africa to shoot a documentary, La reconciliation?, which explores the TRC process and follows Binoche's progress as she acts in Boorman's film. Next, Binoche re-teamed with Michael Haneke for Caché. The film was an immediate success, winning best director for Haneke at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, while Binoche was nominated for a European Film Award for Best Actress for her role. The film {{tells the story of a}} bourgeois Parisian couple, played by Binoche and Daniel Auteuil, who begin to receive anonymous videotapes containing footage shot over long periods, surveying the outside of their home. Caché went on to feature in the number one position on the [...] "Top 10 of the 2000s" [...] list published by The Times at the end of the decade.|$|E

Her mother said that [...] "There is an old proverb <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>country</b> which means 'one should not make oneself or one's family naked before the world'... I was sick... Now, nobody can stop her ... She never listened to our advice." [...] After these comments, the U.S. ambassador, Frederick Nolting, told Diệm {{that if he did}} not denounce his sister-in-law's comment in public, the Americans would have to stop supporting him, but the president refused to do so, and assailed the monks. In an interview with David Halberstam, Madame Nhu said that it was [...] "embarrassing to see people [...] so uncultured claiming to be leaders". The American embassy told Diệm that these comments violated an agreement between the Buddhists and his regime to avoid verbal exchanges, but Diệm refused to keep his family's end of the bargain, saying that his sister-in-law was obliged to expose [...] "extremists" [...] to keep the public informed. In July, the US government rejected a request from her to travel to the United States for a public speaking tour, fearing a public relations disaster. On 3 August, she called the Buddhists [...] "seditious elements who use the most odious Communist tactics to subvert the country." ...|$|E
