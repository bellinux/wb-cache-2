5|$|Bok {{applied for}} and {{received}} UN refugee status on September 15, 1999, and {{after several months}} of waiting, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to allow Francis {{to move to the}} U.S. Bok flew from Cairo to New York City on August 13, 1999, and from there he flew to Fargo, North Dakota. His journey was sponsored by Lutheran Social Services and a United Methodist Church, both worked together to provide an apartment for Francis in Fargo and helped him find a job. Bok worked several jobs, making pallets and plastic knobs for the gearshift of cars. He <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large population of Dinka in Ames, Iowa, and moved to Ames after several months in Fargo. It was while living in Ames that he was contacted by Charles Jacobs, founder of the American Anti-Slavery Group based in Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Winton {{cancelled}} {{a trip to}} a Swiss {{holiday resort}} to go to Prague, having <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> growing refugee crisis resulting from the German occupation of Czechoslovakia from a friend. His friend was working in the British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, which was already working to help adults escape from Czechoslovakia. When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain. While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's Kindertransports, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time.|$|E
5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E

25|$|Marciana died {{of natural}} causes around 186. Septimius Severus was now in his forties and still childless. Eager to remarry, he began enquiring into the horoscopes of {{prospective}} brides. The Historia Augusta relates that he <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman in Syria who had been foretold that she would marry a king, and therefore Severus sought her as his wife.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Lydia Fairchild {{was denied}} public {{assistance}} in Washington state when DNA {{evidence showed that}} she was not related to her children. A lawyer for the prosecution <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human chimera in New England, Karen Keegan, and suggested the possibility to the defense, who were able to show that Fairchild, too, was a chimera with two sets of DNA, and that one of those sets could have been the mother of the children.|$|E

25|$|Shaffer was {{inspired}} to write Equus when he <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses {{in a small town}} near Suffolk. He set out to construct a fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime. The play's action is something of a detective story, involving the attempts of the child psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart to understand the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his own sense of purpose.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, the Boston Floating Hospital was {{established}} by a Congregational minister, the Rev. Rufus Tobey. At the time, many believed in the cleansing and therapeutic qualities of sea air to improve health, and Tobey had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hospital ship for children in New York. For the next 33 years, two successive ships were home {{to the hospital for}} children in Boston Harbor. In 1931, after the second Floating Hospital for Children ship was destroyed in a fire, the hospital was relocated to a permanent building onshore.|$|E

25|$|In 1782, {{during the}} American Revolution, Bernardo de Gálvez {{recruited}} Isleños {{from the three}} Canarian settlements of Louisiana and Galveztown to join the revolution. They participated in the three major military campaigns: (Baton Rouge, Mobile and Pensacola), which expelled the British from the Gulf Coast. In September 1814, the Isleños <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible British invasion, leading them to organize three companies of a regiment, and on December 16, 1814, they fought against the British {{in one of the}} battles of the War of 1812 (which actually was fought 1812–15). Since then, different Isleño communities have had separate histories.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{discovery}} of Petra by the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812, Charles Montagu Doughty, an English traveler, <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar site near Mada'in Saleh, a fortified Ottoman town on the Hajj road from Damascus. In order to access the site, Doughty joined the Hajj caravan, and reached {{the site of the}} ruins in 1876, recording the visit in his journal which was published as Travels in Arabia Deserta. Doughty described the Ottoman fort, where he resided for two months, and noted that Bedouin tribesmen had a permanent encampment just outside of the building.|$|E
25|$|Gasparotto and Moduco {{would not}} be the only victims of Montefalco's investigations, however, for during late 1581 he had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> widow living in Udine named Anna la Rossa. While she did not claim to be a benandante, she did claim that she could see and {{communicate}} with the spirits of the dead, and so Montefalco had her brought in for questioning on 1 January 1582. Initially denying that she had such an ability to the inquisitor, she eventually relented and told him of how she believed that she could see the dead, and how she sold their messages to members of the local community willing to pay, using the money in order to alleviate the poverty of her family. Although Montefalco intended to interrogate her again at a later date, the trial ultimately remained permanently unfinished.|$|E
60|$|She later <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old {{disgrace to}} the {{youngest}} {{daughter of the}} proud family, her predecessors in the house. The poor girl {{tried in vain to}} win forgiveness, especially from a near relative, a soldier, Sir X. Y.|$|R

25|$|What {{he did not}} {{describe}} in the book {{was that he had}} offered, if released, to take no more part in the campaign, nor give any information which might hurt the Boer cause. Just to hedge his bets, he also attempted to get himself re-classified as a military prisoner, as he had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible exchange of military prisoners. The Boers regarded him as a significant prisoner, because of his initiative in attempting to get the train moving and allowing the engine to escape, because of his reputation as a war correspondent, and because he was a minor member of the aristocracy whose father {{had been a member of}} the British government. Nonetheless, it transpired that the authorities were seriously considering the possibility of accepting his offer to withdraw from the war, which later gave rise to accusations he had broken his agreement when he resumed reporting after his escape.|$|E
25|$|On {{returning}} to Fournella, {{it was discovered}} that the defending garrison had left. Supplies were left for the army which, having driven the enemy from Addaya, then marched to Mercadal which it entered without resistance. On 9 November, a detachment of 300 British troops captured Mahón and removed a boom across the harbour which had been preventing access to Aurora and Cormorant. On the evening of 11 November, Duckworth <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small squadron of Spanish ships seen heading towards the island. He immediately left Fournella to investigate, taking with him Leviathan, Centaur, Argo, and three armed transports. On 13 November, just off Ciudadella, Duckworth caught up with the five Spanish ships which included Peterel, captured the previous day. Chase was given and Peterel was recaptured but the remainder escaped. On {{returning to}} Fournella on 16 November, Duckworth learnt that the whole island had capitulated the previous day and was under British control.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E

25|$|Buoyed by the Khutuktu’s {{support and}} by the {{impending}} collapse of the Qing dynasty, the Provisional Government of Khalkha was formed, headed by some prominent Khalkha nobles. On November 28, the government ordered all four provinces (aimag) of Khalkha to mobilize a thousand soldiers each. Almost immediately 500 men from the neighboring khoshuuns had gathered in Urga. Two days later, Sando received a letter, signed {{in the name of}} the nobles and lamas of Khalkha, stating that they had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secessionist movement in China, and that Chinese troops of the “revolutionary party” were preparing to march on Urga from Inner Mongolia. The letter went on to state that, in view of the benefit obtained by the Khalkhas from the Qing in the past, the Khutuktu had ordered the mobilization of 4000 troops to advance on Beijing to defend the Emperor. Sando was asked to provide these men with provisions and arms. He was given three hours to reply. No reply came. Abandoning this thin deception, a delegation of nobles and lamas visited the amban’s office, and informed him of their decision to declare independence and to install the Khutuktu as emperor. Sando pleaded with the delegation. He admitted that what had come to pass was the result of his own folly, and he promised to recommend full autonomy for Mongolia, but not independence. The delegation curtly replied that it had come simply to deliver a message, not to debate it. Sando was ordered to leave the country within 24 hours.|$|E

500|$|In late 1837, {{a series}} of {{internal}} disputes led {{to the collapse of}} the Kirtland Mormon community. [...] Smith was blamed for having promoted a church-sponsored bank that failed. He was also accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Building the temple had left the church deeply in debt, and Smith was hounded by creditors. Having <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large sum of money supposedly hidden in Salem, Massachusetts, Smith traveled there and received a revelation that God had [...] "much treasure in this city". After a month, however, he returned to Kirtland empty-handed.|$|E
