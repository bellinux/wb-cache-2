500|$|In February 2014, a short {{preview of}} the song was {{released}} featuring the chorus, performed by Kanye West and Big Sean. Following the track list reveal for the album, on February 7, 2014, producer DJ Mustard revealed that he co-produced [...] "Sanctified" [...] with Kanye West. The song was also produced by Mike Dean, along with being written by William Roberts, Sean Anderson, Kanye West, and Dijon McFarlane. Betty Wright lent her vocal talent to the song during a late night studio session she did {{as a favor to}} DJ Khaled in order for him to meet a deadline. She recorded the hook in fifteen minutes while sitting on a sofa [...] In the song, West raps about how he feels about people playing up his earlier works and dismiss who he is now, before saying that he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> it. Then later he says, [...] "Wipe my forehead with a handkerchief and wash my sins in the blood of Jesus, People sayin', 'Ye, we need another Yeezus." [...] This being a reference to his experimental sixth studio album.|$|E
500|$|The {{next two}} seasons {{were just as}} {{disastrous}} for the team's reputation. Several players, including Wallace, Stoudamire, and Qyntel Woods, were cited for marijuana possession. Woods pleaded guilty to first-degree animal abuse for staging dog fights in his house, some involving his pit bull named Hollywood. Hollywood and Woods' other pit bull, Sugar, were confiscated, and Woods was given eighty hours of community service. He also agreed to donate $10,000 to the Oregon Humane Society. Wallace was suspended for seven games for threatening a referee. Zach Randolph and Patterson got in a fight during practice, with Randolph sucker punching his teammate in the eye, an injury which kept Patterson from making a meaningful contribution during the playoffs. When police came to Stoudamire's house {{to respond to a}} burglar alarm, they noticed the smell of marijuana, searched the premises, and found a pound of cannabis located in a crawlspace; the search was later declared illegal and charges in the matter were dropped. Guard Bonzi Wells famously told Sports Illustrated in a 2002 interview: [...] "We’re not really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> what the hell (the fans) think about us. They really don’t matter to us. They can boo us everyday, but they’re still going to ask for our autographs if they see us on the street. That's why they’re fans, and we’re NBA players." [...] Wells was fined $50,000 by the Blazers for the statement.|$|E

You have too many fancies to be of much use to anybody. There's just another thing, {{and it has to}} be said.

It's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cost much to put a shingle-splitting plant in. We have easy water-carriage to the Inlet, where a {{schooner}} can load, and the Charters people would have to tow their raw material right along to their mill. Besides, that Inlet's a blame awkward place to get a schooner in. It's quite clear to me we could cut shingles way cheaper than they could." [...] He paused for a moment. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "if there's milling cedar near the valley, our folks will make their bid. If Charters wants those rights, he'll have to put up the money, and it's quite likely we'll take them up in spite of him if I'm satisfied with my prospecting.

5000|$|Justin {{wrote that}} in 279 BC the Carthaginians {{were worried that}} Pyrrhus might get {{involved}} in Sicily, where they had possessions in {{the west of the}} island, to help the Greek cities in eastern and southern Sicily against them. There had been reports that the Sicilian Greeks had asked him for his assistance. Justin wrote that Mago, a Carthaginian commander was sent the port of Rome with 120 ships and met the Roman senate to offer help. The senate declined the assistance. The Carthaginians, who were hoping that war with Rome would prevent Pyrrhus from <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Sicily, were <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> Pyrrhus putting the Romans in distress. A few days later Mago went to meet Pyrrhus privately, [...] "as if to be a peace-maker from the people of Carthage, but in reality to discover the king's views with regard to Sicily, to which island it was reported that he was sent for." [...] Justin placed these events before Gaius Fabricius' embassy to Pyrrhus and Cineas' trip to Rome (see above).|$|R
5000|$|As of December 2016, Annihilator {{has begun}} {{working on their}} sixteenth studio album. Waters stated, [...] "On the next one, the changes I'm gonna make… I only said two things. I've got all these people telling me, 'You've gotta {{go back to this}} album,' or that album, or that album, or that album. 'You've gotta do this,' 'You've gotta do that.' So what I do is I block it out. But I've decided that I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> catchy, {{commercial}} choruses — 'commercial,' as in you remember it, where you intentionally make that chorus {{the most important part of}} the song and you want people to remember that one every time. That kind of is the opposite of what I used to do in the earlier days. In the earlier days, I would go, 'I don't care about the chorus being the main part; I want the whole song to be cool.' So therefore the choruses were not as commercial or catchy. And they remained heavy back then; the choruses would end up being heavy. Whereas on my Suicide Society record I just did, you could have a heavy song, but then you hit the chorus and you go, 'Woah, that's pretty mainstream stuff in the choruses.' And the other thing was, since I'm such a fan of so many bands, I let myself go a little bit on the last album with being too blatantly obvious with my influences and my musical loves as a fan. So you really heard a song that had a lot of the Master of Puppets era of music from Metallica, and you really heard a Megadeth-y song on there, and you really heard in my vocals some Hetfield and Mustaine-isms. And I think that was great, as a fan, to get it out, but I think I need to do more of my own thing on the next record." ...|$|R
