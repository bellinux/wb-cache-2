40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to quantify stability during recovery from <b>forward</b> <b>loss</b> of balance in young and older adults, older single steppers (OSS) and older multiple steppers (OMS), and to identify the biomechanical factors associated with stability during balance recovery. <b>Forward</b> <b>loss</b> of balance was achieved by releasing participants from a static forward lean angle. Participants regained balance by taking one or more rapid steps. Stability was quantified using the margin of stability (MoS), which was computed as the anterio-posterior distance between the forward boundary of the base-of-support and the vertical projection of the velocity adjusted centre of mass. MoS at foot contact and at maximal knee joint flexion angle following foot contact (KJMAX) were smaller in older compared to young adults, and in OMS compared to OSS. Compared to young adults, older adults exhibited a shorter recovery step length, greater trunk flexion angles and exhibited smaller peak knee flexion angles. Trunk flexion angle at foot contact (r = - 0. 55) and step length (r = 0. 54) were significantly correlated with MoS at foot contact and together accounted for 51 % of the variance in MoS at foot contact. MoS at foot contact was significantly correlated with MoS at KJMAX (r = 0. 88) and together with peak knee flexion angle during the landing phase (r = 0. 60) and peak knee extension moment during the landing phase (r = 0. 47) accounted for 84 % of the variance in MoS at KJMAX. Overall findings suggest that stability in the first step is lower for older compared to young adults and for multiple compared to single steppers, and that spatial-temporal, kinematic and kinetic factors are associated with stability during recovery from <b>forward</b> <b>loss</b> of balance.

All participants were instructed to attempt to recover balance by taking a rapid single step. A scalable anatomical model consisting of 36 degrees-of-freedom was used to compute kinematics and joint moments from motion capture and force plate data. Forces for 94 muscle actuators were computed using static optimisation and induced acceleration analysis was used to compute individual muscle contributions to net lumbar spine joint, and stepping side hip joint and knee joint accelerations during recovery. Older adults that required multiple recovery steps used a significantly shorter and faster initial recovery step and adopted significantly more trunk flexion throughout recovery compared to the older single steppers. Older multiple steppers also produced significantly more force in the stance side hamstrings, which resulted in significantly higher hamstring induced flexion accelerations at the lumbar spine and extension accelerations at the hip. However since the net joint lumbar spine and hip accelerations remained similar between older multiple steppers and older single steppers, we suggest that the recovery strategy adopted by older multiple steppers was less efficient as well as less effective than for older single steppers.

40|$|Background. Older adults {{compared}} with young adults have reduced strength and balance recovery ability. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to investigate whether age, sex, and/or lower limb strength predicted the stepping strategy used to recover from a <b>forward</b> <b>loss</b> of balance. Methods. Ninety-five, community-dwelling, older adults, aged 65 - 90 years, participated in the study. Loss of balance was induced by releasing participants from a static forward lean. Participants performed four trials at three initial lean magnitudes and were subsequently classified as using a single- or multiple-step strategy. Isometric strength of the ankle, knee, and hip joint flexors and extensors was assessed using a dynamometer. Results. Univariate logistic regression revealed that a unit (ie, 1 % body weight [BW] נheight) decrease in ankle plantar flexion, knee extension, or hip flexion strength was associated with 1. 7 - 2. 5 times increased odds of adopting a multiple-step strategy. Women also had greater odds of requiring a multiple-step recovery strategy at the two greatest lean magnitudes. Forward stepwise logistic regression revealed that hip flexor strength in particular was influential as it was the primary predictor included in the logistic regression models at 20 % and 25 % BW lean magnitudes. Conclusions. Lower limb muscle weakness, especially of the hip flexors and knee extensors, was associated with increased odds of requiring multiple steps {{compared with}} single steps to recover from <b>forward</b> <b>loss</b> of balance across a range of initial lean magnitudes. Improved balance recovery ability might be achieved by targeting these muscle groups in falls prevention programs. No Full Tex...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the relative contribution of selected neuromuscular and biomechanical variables associated with balance recovery to the MRLM. <b>Forward</b> <b>loss</b> of balance was induced by releasing participants (n = 117 community-dwelling older adults) from a static forward lean angle. Participants were instructed to attempt to recover balance by taking a single step. A scalable anatomical model consisting of 36 degrees-of-freedom was used to compute kinematics and joint moments from motion capture and force plate data. Isometric muscle strength at the ankle, knee and hip joints was assessed using a dynamometer. A univariate analysis revealed that lower limb strength measures, step recovery kinematics, and stepping limb kinetics accounted for between 8 and 19 %, 3 and 59 %, and 3 and 61 % of the variance in MRLM respectively. When all variables were entered into a stepwise multiple regression analysis, normalised step length, peak hip extension moment, trunk angle at foot contact, and peak hip flexion power during stepping together accounted for 69 % of the variance in MRLM. These findings confirm that successful recovery from <b>forward</b> <b>loss</b> of balance is a whole body control task that requires adequate trunk control and generation of adequate lower limb moments and powers to generate a long and rapid step. Training programmes that specifically target these measures may be effective in improving balance recovery performance and thereby contribute to fall prevention amongst older adults.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the muscular contributions to the acceleration of the whole body centre of mass (COM) of older compared to younger adults that were able to recover from <b>forward</b> <b>loss</b> of balance with a single step. <b>Forward</b> <b>loss</b> of balance was achieved by releasing participants (14 older adults and 6 younger adults) from a static whole-body forward lean angle of approximately 18 degrees. 10 older adults and 6 younger adults were able to recover with a single step and included in subsequent analysis. A scalable anatomical model consisting of 36 degrees-of-freedom was used to compute kinematics and joint moments from motion capture and force plate data. Forces for 92 muscle actuators were computed using Static Optimisation and Induced Acceleration Analysis was used to compute individual muscle contributions to the three-dimensional acceleration of the whole body COM. There were no significant differences between older and younger adults in step length, step time, 3 D COM accelerations or muscle contributions to 3 D COM accelerations. The stance and stepping leg Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles were primarily responsible for the vertical acceleration experienced by the COM. The Gastrocnemius and Soleus from the stance side leg together with bilateral Hamstrings accelerated the COM forwards throughout balance recovery while the Vasti and Soleus of the stepping side leg provided the majority of braking accelerations following foot contact. The Hip Abductor muscles provided the greatest contribution to medial-lateral accelerations of the COM. Deficits in the neuromuscular control of the Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Vasti and Hip Abductors in particular could adversely influence balance recovery and may be important targets in interventions to improve balance recovery performance...|$|E
40|$|Background. Previous {{studies have}} shown that people with Parkinson disease (PD) have {{difficulty}} performing the sit-to-stand task because of mobility and stabilityrelated impairments. Despite its importance, literature on the quantification of dynamic stability control in people with PD during this task is limited. Objective. The study objective was to examine differences in dynamic stability control between people with PD and people who were healthy {{and the extent to which}} externally cued training could improve such control during the sit-to-stand task in people with PD. Design. This was a quasi-experimental controlled trial. Methods. The performance of 21 people with PD was compared with that of 12 older adults who dwelled in the community. People with PD were randomly assigned to 2 groups: a group that did not receive training and a group that received audiovisually cued training (3 times per week for 4 weeks) for speeding up performance on the sit-to-stand task. Outcome measures recorded at baseline and after 4 weeks included center-of-mass position, center-of-mass velocity, and stability against either backward or <b>forward</b> balance <b>loss</b> (backward or <b>forward</b> stability) at seat-off and movement termination. Results. Compared with people who were healthy, people with PD had greater backward stability resulting from a more anterior center-of-mass position at seat-off. This feature, combined with decreased forward stability at movement termination, increased their risk of <b>forward</b> balance <b>loss</b> at movement termination. After training, people with PD achieved greater backward stability through increased forward center-of-mass velocity at seat-off and reduced the likelihood of <b>forward</b> balance <b>loss</b> at movement termination through a posterior shift in the center-of-mass position. Limitations. The study applied stability limits derived from adults who were healthy to people with PD, and the suggested impact on the risk of balance loss and falling is based on these theoretical stability limits. Conclusions. For people with PD, postural stability against backward balance loss at task initiation was increased at the expense of possible <b>forward</b> balance <b>loss</b> at task termination. Task-specific training with preparatory audiovisual cues resulted in improved overall dynamic stability against both forward and backward balance loss. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

Although the potential barrier height at metal/semiconductor interfaces is a fundamental parameter, a more general approach consists in defining the current density from the product of an effective velocity and carrier concentration at interface.
