50|$|A Mud Agitator {{is used in}} surface mud {{systems to}} suspend solids and {{maintain}} homogeneous mixture throughout the system. A mechanical agitator is driven by an <b>explosion-proof</b> <b>motor,</b> coupled to a gear box that drives the impeller shaft. The impellers (turbines) transform mechanical power into fluid circulation or agitation. The objective is to obtain a uniform suspension of all solids.|$|E
