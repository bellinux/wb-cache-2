5000|$|Most {{parts of}} the {{filename}} can be omitted, in which case they are taken from the current default <b>file</b> <b>specification.</b> The default <b>file</b> <b>specification</b> replaces the concept of [...] "current directory" [...] in other operating systems by providing a set of defaults for node, device name and directory. All processes have a default <b>file</b> <b>specification</b> which includes disk name and directory, and most VMS file system routines accept a default <b>file</b> <b>specification</b> which can also include the file type; the TYPE command, for example, defaults to [...] ".LIS" [...] as the file type, so the command TYPE F, with no extension, attempts to open the file F.LIS.|$|E

40|$|A new {{computer}} program named CutLHCO is introduced, whose function is {{the implementation of}} generic data selection cuts on collider event <b>specification</b> <b>files</b> in the standardized. lhco format. This software is intended to fill an open market niche for a lightweight yet flexible "consumer-level" alternative to the ROOT data analysis framework. The primary envisioned application is as a filter on output produced by the PGS 4 and DELPHES detector simulations, which are themselves lightweight alternatives to the GEANT 4 based solutions favored by the large LHC experiments. All process control instructions are provided via a compact and powerful card file input syntax that efficiently facilitates the reasonable approximation of most event selection strategies and specialized discovery statistics commonly employed by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations. The structure, function, invocation and usage {{of the most recent}} CutLHCO 2. 0 program version are documented thoroughly, including a detailed deconstruction of several example card <b>file</b> <b>specifications.</b> The associated software is simultaneously being made available for free public download.

5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{model is}} that at every point in each element to be combined for transparency there is an associated color and opacity between 0 and 1. For each color channel, you might work with this model: if a channel with intensity [...] and opacity [...] overlays a channel with intensity [...] and opacity [...] {{the result will be}} a channel with intensity equal to , and opacity [...] Each channel must be multiplied by corresponding alpha value before composition (so called premultiplied alpha). The SVG <b>file</b> <b>specification</b> uses this type of blending, {{and this is one of}} the models that can be used in PDF.|$|E
5000|$|Pro Tools was {{developed}} by UC Berkeley graduates Evan Brooks, who majored in electrical engineering and computer science, and Peter Gotcher. The first incarnation of Pro Tools was introduced in 1984 under the brand name Sound Designer. At the time, the pair were creating and selling digital drum sound chips under their Digidrums label. Sound Designer was originally designed to edit sounds for the E-mu Emulator sampling keyboard, but it was rapidly ported to many other sampling keyboards, such as the Akai S900 and the Prophet 2000. Thanks to the universal <b>file</b> <b>specification</b> developed by Brooks, Sound Designer files could be transferred to and from one sampling keyboard to another keyboard made by a different manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|The ASP {{developed}} {{and maintain the}} Portable Application Description (PAD) format used to allow software authors to provide product descriptions and specifications to online sources in a standard way. The PAD <b>file</b> <b>specification</b> is currently utilized by over 40,000 software publishers and a 1000+ PAD supported software catalog websites. The PAD system is popular because web sites can pull updated data from a single file stored on the software author's site.

The latest PAD specification, v4.0 was announced on December 1, 2012 in the organization's magazine, ASPECTS.|$|E

50|$|File format {{identifiers}} is another, {{not widely}} used way to identify file formats {{according to their}} origin and their file category. It was created for the Description Explorer suite of software. It is composed of several digits of the form NNNNNNNNN-XX-YYYYYYY. The first part indicates the organisation origin/maintainer (this number represents a value in a company/standards organisation database), the 2 following digits categorize the type of file in hexadecimal. The final part is composed of the usual file extension of the file or the international standard number of the file, padded left with zeros. For example, the PNG <b>file</b> <b>specification</b> has the FFID of 000000001-31-0015948 where 31 indicates an image file, 0015948 is the standard number and 000000001 indicates the ISO Organisation.|$|E
5000|$|Physical device {{names were}} {{specified}} in the form 'dd{n}:' where 'dd' was a two-character alphabetic device name and the optional 'n' was the unit number (0-7). When the unit number is omitted, unit 0 is assumed. For example, TT: referred to the console terminal, LP: (or LP0:) referred to the parallel line printer, and DX0:, DY1:, DL4: referred to disk volumes (RX01 unit 0, RX02 unit 1, RL01 or RL02 unit 4, respectively). Logical device names consisted of 1-3 alphanumeric characters and {{were used in the}} place of a physical device name. This was accomplished using the [...] command. For example, one might issue [...] which would cause all future references to 'ABC:' to map to 'DL0:'. Reserved logical name DK: referred to the current default device. If a device was not included in a <b>file</b> <b>specification,</b> DK: was assumed. Reserved logical name SY: referred to the system device (the device from which the system had been booted).|$|E
5000|$|An OpenDocument file {{commonly}} {{consists of}} a standard ZIP archive (JAR archive) containing a number of files and directories; but OpenDocument file can also consist only of a single XML document. OpenDocument file is commonly a collection of several subdocuments within a (ZIP) package. OpenDocument file as a single XML is not widely used.According to the OpenDocument 1.0 specification, the ZIP <b>file</b> <b>specification</b> is defined in Info-ZIP Application Note 970311, 1997. The simple compression mechanism used for a package normally makes OpenDocument files significantly smaller than equivalent Microsoft [...] "" [...] or [...] "" [...] files. This smaller size is important for organizations who store {{a vast number of}} documents for long periods of time, and to those organizations who must exchange documents over low bandwidth connections. Once uncompressed, most data is contained in simple text-based XML files, so the uncompressed data contents have the typical ease of modification and processing of XML files. The standard also allows {{for the creation of a}} single XML document, which uses as the root element, for use in document processing.|$|E
