5000|$|Musgrove visited England in 1879, a {{time when}} Gilbert and Sullivan had {{commenced}} their operas. [...] At the end of 1880, Musgrove produced La fille du tambour-major at the opera house, Melbourne, which had a record run of 101 nights. This success led the young producer to join a partnership with J. C. Williamson and Arthur Garner. They formed the Willamson, Garner and Musgrove Company in July 1882 when they became <b>joint</b> <b>lessees</b> of the Theatre Royals in Melbourne and Sydney. The partnership split in March 1890 with Williamson and Garner continuing to run the Theatre Royal in Melbourne along with the Princess Theatre and Musgrove {{taking control of the}} Theatre Royal, Sydney. Musgrove managed a successful season of Paul Jones with Marion Burton and Nellie Stewart in the leading parts. At the end of 1892, Williamson and Musgrove went into partnership again for about seven years, Musgrove living much of the time in London. In 1898 he brought a complete American company to the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, to play The Belle of New York, which had an enormous success.|$|R

50|$|Through {{a process}} of {{requesting}} and reviewing proposals, the Central Utah Project Completion Act Office and the Western Area Power Administration selected the Central Utah Water Conservancy District and Heber Light & Power as <b>joint</b> potential <b>lessees</b> for power development at Jordanelle Dam. The Central Utah Project Completion Act Office and the lessees executed a lease agreement in 2005, after approval of the environmental assessment for the project. Fabrication of the turbines and generators began late in 2005 and construction of the building began in late 2006. The project {{is expected to be}} fully operationally by summer of 2008.|$|R
5000|$|A fire {{broke out}} about 8:40 o'clock on Saturday morning beneath {{the stage of the}} Winter Garden Theatre, {{resulting}} in the entire destruction of that establishment, and doing considerable damage to the Southern Hotel, formerly known as the Lafarge House. Although the Fire Department was promptly on hand, in an incredibly short space of time the flames had wrapped the entire interior of the Winter Garden in a sheet of fire, and the firemen were unable to work therein owing to the intense heat...By 9 o'clock the flames had reached their limit and the spectacle was one of peculiar grandeur and effect...At 9:15 the roof of theatre fell...The aggregate loss is roughly estimated at $250,000. Both the theatre and the hotel are owned by the Lafarge estate, as also the [...] "stock" [...] scenery and properties of the former...Messrs. EDWIN BOOTH and W. STUART also suffer severe losses. These gentlemen were the <b>joint</b> <b>lessees</b> and managers of the Winter Garden, and their extensive and valuable wardrobes, used in the recent Shakespearean revivals, as well as a large amount of new scenery and properties, were all destroyed by the flames. These articles were valued at $60,000 and uninsured...Mr. BOOTH is a heavy loser by the total destruction of his private wardrobe and many valuable presents. This wardrobe was considered to be the most extensive and valuable one in the possession of any single actor on this continent.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The United States {{fundamentally}} {{depends on}} crude {{oil and natural}} gas for energy and production of goods. Subsurface oil in the federal offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico is a critical resource for the country in this regard, providing 17 % of the nation’s crude oil production (U. S. Energy Information Department, n. d.). These reserves are detected through the use of geophysical seismic exploration vessels, which use high-powered seismic airgun acoustics to map the substrata of the ocean floor. These seismic airguns operate at very high volume, which pose a threat to the hearing and sonar capabilities of numerous protected marine mammals, as well as endangered sea turtle species, within the Gulf of Mexico. The federal government regulates offshore leases for oil and gas through the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and monitors compliance via the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). These agencies, in turn, issue a regulatory guidance document, the <b>Joint</b> Notice to <b>Lessees</b> No. 2012 -G 02 (BOEM, 2012 a), which instructs seismic operators how to proceed with production operations and implement mitigation measures in this region to minimize risk to protected species. The NTL aspires to reduce, to the greatest extent practicable, the impact of seismic surveys on species protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act by establishing a protected 500 -meter exclusion zone around the seismic airguns and applying mitigation measures relevant to selected species within that zone. However, in some instances the guidelines can both under- and over-mitigate, to the detriment of both the fauna and to the lessee energy companies. Here, I (1) review the basis for, and current state of, the NTL; (2) assess whether the current guidelines meet their goals; and (3) make recommendations for updating the NTL to align with current in-field practices, providing more clarity to seismic operators and aligning the text of the NTL with its goal of protecting marine mammals and sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico. Regulatory transparency and certainty are staples of good governance, and my recommendations seek to modernize antiquated guidelines to support these goals...|$|R
