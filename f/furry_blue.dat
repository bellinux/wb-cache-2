2500|$|The {{main event}} was another chapter in an on-again, off-again storyline between Atlantis and Último Guerrero that had {{started in the}} fall of 2011 when Atlantis left Último Guerrero's Los Guerreros del Infierno group. On this night Atlantis was {{accompanied}} by the tecnico [...] "Mascot" [...] Ke Monito, a little person wearing a <b>furry</b> <b>blue</b> monkey suite that accompanies a lot of the CMLL tecnicos to the ring. The building rivalry was immediately expressed by both competitors working a more aggressive style of match than they usually do, including repeated attempts by Último Guerrero to unmask his opponent, which in Lucha Libre is the ultimate dirty trick to use. Atlantis won the first fall of the match, causing Último Guerrero to retaliate, not just by trying to pull Atlantis' mask off, but by actually tearing it apart in places. Guerrero managed to win the second fall as he used the ropes for illegal leverage during the pin-fall, making sure to hide it from the referee. The third fall was the longest of the match and saw Atlantis retaliate by starting to tear Último Guerrero's mask apart too, using some of the same rudo tricks as his opponent. In the end Atlantis got the third and final fall, winning the match by using the ropes himself, mirroring the actions of Último Guerrero in the second fall. After the match Atlantis made a public challenge to Guerrero and his tag team partner Dragón Rojo, Jr. to defend the CMLL World Tag Team Championship against Atlantis and a partner of his choice, but Guerrero did not respond to the challenge.|$|E

The original cover—pictured here—contained a <b>furry</b> <b>blue</b> pencil case with a balloon inside, creating a somewhat labia-like effect. This was later revised to the current, slightly less blatant bunny slipper design. Some have contested this move as censorship which entirely misconstrues the tongue-in-cheek humour of the original.|$|E

Over the next decade he would appear on the roster of several teams in titles ranging from The Avengers to The Defenders to X-Factor.

5000|$|Sesame Square is a Nigerian {{version of}} Sesame Street. It is West Africa's first Sesame Street adaptation. Nigerians produce and voice the series in Standard English. The show is {{scheduled}} to have three seasons, with the first containing 26 episodes, one for each letter of the English alphabet. It is due to be screened on Nigerian Television Authority network. The set of Sesame Square resembles a traditional Nigerian village with a central mango tree. The series stars Kami, an HIV-positive Muppet (who was originally part of the South African version of Sesame Street), and Zobi, a <b>blue,</b> <b>furry</b> Muppet who is a 'Yam Monster' (the Nigerian version of the Cookie Monster in the American original). He often shouts out, [...] "me eat yam!" [...] It will also feature segments from the American original including famous characters such as Big Bird and Bert and Ernie. The characters will be revoiced, however, to give them Nigerian accents. The opening theme tune is [...] "Welcome to Sesame Square" [...] and includes the use of talking drums. These are the segments were dubbed in Global Grover, Play with Me Sesame, Elmo's World, Bert and Ernie's Great Adventures, and Sesame Street English. [...] In addition to teaching letters and numbers, the show aims to educate children about malaria prevention, promote Nigerian unity through {{the representation of the}} diverse groups that make-up the country and to help remove the stigma of being HIV-positive. It is the second foreign co-production of Sesame Street to be shown entirely in English, the first being Northern Ireland's Sesame Tree.|$|R
5000|$|Leech {{appears in}} X-Men: The Last Stand, played by Cameron Bright. Leech (named Jimmy in the film, and code named Leech on a file handed to Beast) {{is a child}} but unlike the comics has no outward {{physical}} mutations aside from his absence of hair. His power automatically cancels the mutation of any mutant within {{a few feet of}} him, including reversing physical mutations such as Hank McCoy's blue fur. When Hank reaches out to shake Jimmy's hand, his own hand loses its <b>furry</b> <b>blue</b> appearance; the mutation returns once he pulls it away. Leech plays a pivotal role in the film as the source of the [...] "cure" [...] for the mutant X-Gene, the cure being a sort of retroviral gene therapy using Leech's DNA, that permanently cancels the mutation of any mutant. Magneto plans to kill Leech, who is being kept at the facility at Alcatraz, thus destroying the mutant cure (at that point they had no way of synthesizing the cure artificially) and effectively preserving the mutant species. Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants attack the facility, which is defended by federal troops who are joined by the X-Men. During the battle, Juggernaut is sent to kill Jimmy and Kitty Pryde races to save him. Juggernaut is defeated when Kitty uses Leech's nullification power against him, taunting him into charging at them head-on and then moving them both out of his way, causing him to knock himself out against a wall. Kitty and Jimmy then escape the building through the holes that Juggernaut smashed on his way in. Later, Jimmy is seen evacuating Alcatraz Island with the help of Pryde and Bobby Drake. At the end of the film, Jimmy is seen {{as a member of the}} Xavier Institute with a full head of hair and is received by the new leader, Storm.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the opening}} match the young tecnico (Wrestlers who portray the [...] "good guy" [...] characters) team of Horus and Robin {{defeated}} the experienced rudo (Bad guy") team of Los Hombres del Camoflaje (Artillero and Super Comando) two falls to one. The second match {{of the evening}} saw two substitutions compared to the originally announced match, instead of teaming with Metálico, Hombre Bala, Jr. and Super Halcon, Jr. teamed up with Stuka, Jr. while Bobby Zavala {{was taken off the}} other team and instead Disturbio and Nosferatu teamed with Hijo del Signo. This was Nosferatu's first match back with CMLL since 2011. The two teams split the first two falls with Hombre Bala, Jr. Super Halcon, Jr. and Stuka, Jr. taking the first fall and Disturbio, Nosferatu and Hijo del Signo won the second fall. The third fall ended when Stuka, Jr. pinned Nosferatu to take the victory for his team. The July 13 Super Viernes marked the first time Goya Kong wrestled unmask after having lost her mask in the main event of the 2012 Infierno en el Ring event. Goya Kong teamed up with Estrellita and Marcela to take on the woman that unmasked Goya Kong, Princesa Blanca and her partners Princesa Sujei and Tiffany. Goya Kong gained a small measure of revenge by pinning Princesa Blanca to win the first fall, leading to Tiffany getting her team disqualified for excessive violence against Marcela in the second fall. Following the match Marcela challenged Tiffany to a Lucha de Apuesta, hair vs. hair match between the two but Tiffany declined. The tecnico team of Diamante Azul, Sagrado and Shocker were accompanied by Mascota Ke Monito (A little person wearing a <b>furry</b> <b>blue</b> ape suit) as they took on the team of Black Warrior, Dragón Rojo, Jr. and Ephesto. The Rudo team represented three different CMLL factions as Black Warrior was part of Los Invasores ("The Invaders"), Dragón Rojo, Jr. part of Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Infernal Warriors") and Ephesto represented Los Hijos del Averno ("The Sons of Hell"). Shocker proved an experienced ring leader as he led Diamante Azul and Sagrado to a two to one victory over their opponents. Following the match Black Warrior attacked Shocker, beating him down before CMLL officials could separate the two. The rivalry between Atlantis and Último Guerrero had developed long before they were selected to be the coaches for the En Busca de un Ídolo ("The search for an idol") tournament, but the tournament drew both tournament winner Titán and runner up Euforia into the storyline, at least {{for a short period of}} time. Euforia had joined Guerrero's Los Guerreros del Infierno less than a week ago as a result of the En Busca de un Ídol tournament and was eager to prove himself in this tag team match. The rivalry between the two teams led the tecnico team of Atlantis and Titán to employ rudo tactics as they intentionally unmasked their opponents during the third fall, using the distraction to pin them both and take the two to one fall victory.|$|E
40|$|This article {{begins with}} the premise that self-imagery is {{constituted}} as a shape-shifting aggregate of symbolic systems that incorporates the human body itself as one ofits representations. At intermittent points of the body's embodiment of visual cultute and tacit social experience, alternative representations accrete into varying symbolic systems, the multiple shapes a self-image may take over a lifetime. Given that social identity {{is derived from the}} interaction of various symbolic systems, how do some bodies and self-images come to be taken as that of identities incompatible with most others? In this exploration of the self-image and identity, the author reconsiders the purposes of art education in human development, especially when the self-image is given primacy over the objects we typically plan to make in the classroom. Mr. Hooper's Store I have a vivid memory of watching "Sesame Street " segments when I was little, where Susan or Bob or Gordon or Mr. Hooper would sing a variation of the categorization song that includes the lines, "One of these things is not like the other, " or "One of these groups just doesn't belong here. " This was in the early 1970 s. I was being bussed to school in a White neighborhood, caught up in the nation's movement to address the social injustice of the unequal quality of schooling in ghettoes like the one I grew up in, located in a Brooklyn neighborhood called Crown Heights. It was eerie listening to these songs, watching little White boys and girls and little Black boys and girls sitting together in Mr. Hooper's store while no one addressed the giant <b>blue</b> <b>furry</b> elephant right there in the storefront with them. Even as a youngster, I was very much aware that most Not Like the Other 13 people had long been quite comfortable with the idea that the kids sitting at Mr. Hooper's counter did not truly belong together. Even I knew that this was reason for the absence of White bodies on my narrow block in Brooklyn, and the absence of Black bodies anywhere near the wide lawns of homes in Sheepshead Bay. But this idea-the idea of different categories of bodies and of bodies that belong and do not belong-has generated many other stories worth noting...|$|R
