40|$|The typical {{method of}} vehicle {{steering}} bifurcation analysis {{is based on}} the nonlinear autonomous vehicle model deriving from the classic two degrees of freedom (2 DOF) linear vehicle model. This method usually neglects the driving effect on steering bifurcation characteristics. However, in the steering <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> combined conditions, the tyre under different driving conditions can provide different lateral force. The steering bifurcation mechanism without the driving effect is not able to fully reveal the vehicle steering <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> bifurcation characteristics. Aiming at the aforementioned problem, this paper analyzed the vehicle steering <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> bifurcation characteristics with the consideration of driving effect. Based on the 5 DOF vehicle system dynamics model with the consideration of driving effect, the 7 DOF autonomous system model was established. The vehicle steering <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> bifurcation dynamic characteristics were analyzed with different <b>driving</b> mode <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> torque. Taking the front-wheel-drive system as an example, the dynamic evolution process of steering <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> bifurcation was analyzed by phase space, system state variables, power spectral density, and Lyapunov index. The numerical recognition results of chaos were also provided. The research results show that the <b>driving</b> mode <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> torque have the obvious effect on steering <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> bifurcation characteristics...|$|R
