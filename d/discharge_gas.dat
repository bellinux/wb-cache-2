A <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> plasma is an ionized gas which is supported by an external electric field. Therefore its parameters are determined by processes in it. The properties of a <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> plasma depend on its gas component, types of external fields, their geometry and regimes of <b>gas</b> <b>discharge.</b> Fundamentals of a <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> plasma include elementary, radiative and transport processes which are included in its kinetics influence.

50|$|In the helium photoionization mode, the PDD is a universal, non-destructive, high {{sensitivity}} detector. The {{response to}} both inorganic and organic compounds is linear {{over a wide}} range. Response to fixed gases is positive (increase in standing current), with an MDQ in the low ppb range. The PDD in helium photoionization mode is an excellent replacement for flame ionization detectors in petrochemical or refinery environments, where the flame and use of hydrogen can be problematic. In addition, when the helium <b>discharge</b> <b>gas</b> is doped with a suitable noble gas, such as argon, krypton, or xenon (depending on the desired cutoff point), the PDD can function as a specific photoionization detector for selective determination of aliphatics, aromatics, amines, {{as well as other}} species.|$|E

40|$|Formation of {{bacterial}} biofilms at solid-liquid interfaces creates numerous problems in both industrial and biomedical sciences. In this study, the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms to <b>discharge</b> <b>gas</b> generated from plasma was tested.

Under optimal experimental conditions, no bacteria and biofilm re-growth from <b>discharge</b> <b>gas</b> treated biofilms was found. Further studies revealed that the anti-biofilm activity of the <b>discharge</b> <b>gas</b> occurred by two distinct mechanisms: 1) killing bacteria in biofilms by causing severe cell membrane damage, and 2) damaging the extracellular polymeric matrix in {{the architecture of the}} biofilm to release biofilm {{from the surface of the}} solid substratum.

40|$|Pt-loaded WO 3 {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} on oxidized Si substrates under various <b>discharge</b> <b>gas</b> pressures {{at room temperature}} using reactive magnetron sputtering. Structural characterizations by means of X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy show that the films composed of nano-size grains have a monoclinic structure. The films become more porous as the <b>discharge</b> <b>gas</b> pressure increases due to the decrease in film density {{and the increase in}} effective surface area. Gas sensing properties demonstrate that the films show reversible response to H 2 S with various concentrations. Under the same operating conditions the sensor response increases and the operating temperature at which the maximum response is shown decreases with <b>discharge</b> <b>gas</b> pressure. The highest response of 3512 is obtained for a Pt-loaded porous film deposited at 12 Pa upon exposure to 5 ppm H 2 S at an operating temperature of 100 degrees C. Such a high response of a Pt-loaded porous film at a low operating temperature is discussed in relation to the Schottky-barrier-limited transport as well as the chemical mechanism of Pt loading.

40|$|Ferroelectric plasma {{sources in}} vacuum {{are known as}} sources of {{ablative}} plasma, formed due to surface discharge. In this paper, observations of a <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> mode of operation of the ferroelectric plasma sources (FPS) are reported. The <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> appears at pressures between approximately 20 and approximately 80 Torr. At pressures of 1 - 20 Torr, there is a transition from vacuum surface <b>discharge</b> to the <b>gas</b> <b>discharge,</b> when both modes coexist and the surface <b>discharges</b> sustain the <b>gas</b> <b>discharge.</b> At pressures between 20 and 80 Torr, the surface discharges are suppressed, and FPS operate in pure <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> mode, {{with the formation of}} almost uniform plasma along the entire surface of the ceramics between strips.

40|$|Material probes {{have been}} {{installed}} at the inner walls along poloidal direction in LHD from the first experimental campaign. After each the campaign, the impurity deposition and the gas retention have been examined to clarify the plasma surface interaction {{and the degree of}} wall cleaning. In the 2 nd campaign, the entire wall was considerably cleaned by helium glow discharge conditionings. For the 3 rd and 4 th campaigns, graphite tiles were installed at entire divertor strike region, and then the wall condition significantly changed compared to the case of stainless steel wall. The erosion of graphite took place during the main discharges and the eroded carbon deposited on the entire wall. In particular, the deposition thickness was large at the wall far from the plasma. Since the entire wall was well carbonized, amount of retained <b>discharge</b> <b>gas</b> such as H and He became large. In particular, the helium retention was large at the position close to the anodes used for helium glow discharge cleanings.
