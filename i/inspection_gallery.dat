Its durability is determined by various factors viz. aggressivity of surrounding water, temperatures fluctuations etc. If the water happens to be soft it is injurious to the useful life of concrete. The permeated water leads to leaching of lime which ultimately causes weakening of structure. Once such phenomenon is observed in any such structures a vigilant periodic monitoring approach becomes mandatory.

Thermal cracking of the <b>inspection</b> <b>gallery</b> concrete often occurs during construction. The cracking breaks water-tightness and durability of the <b>inspection</b> <b>gallery.</b> The tensile stress development in the concrete must be estimated to predict crack occurrence in the design. In this study, the thermal behavior of the <b>inspection</b> <b>gallery</b> concrete during construction is discussed. The effects of a pipe-cooling, the restraints of the foundation rock, and the shapes of the cross section of the <b>inspection</b> <b>gallery</b> on the thermal stresses are also investigated by using finite element method. The results indicated that the maximum tensile stress developed in the cross section varies significantly with the degree of the restraint at the side surface.

40|$|The hydro {{projects}} in Himalayan region in India are constructed in head reaches of river basins. These projects envisage a concrete or masonry or rockfill {{or even an}} earthen dam. The underground <b>inspection</b> <b>galleries</b> and drainage gallery of these dams are constructed using concrete linings of different grades. Its durability is determined by various factors viz. aggressivity of surrounding water, temperatures fluctuations etc. The water in Himalayan Rivers is generally soft which is injurious to the useful life of concrete structures as it leads to leaching of lime. Leaching is a phenomenon that is caused by water migrating through the permeable concrete. The reduced alkalinity and permeated water causes corrosion of reinforcement leading to weakening of structure.

500|$|The cleared, {{underlying}} rock {{foundation of}} the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a grout curtain. Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as [...] into the rock, and any cavities encountered were {{to be filled with}} grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit [...] "uplift"—upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due {{to the beginning of the}} concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled. After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look into the situation. It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon's geology. New holes were drilled from <b>inspection</b> <b>galleries</b> inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock. It took nine years (1938–47) under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental grout curtain.|$|R

Young to investigate the causes leading to the failure of the St. Francis dam near Saugus, California. The report became the most widely distributed analysis. Along with most of the other investigators, they perceived the new leak as the key to understanding the collapse, although the commission believed that [...] "the foundation under the entire dam left very much to be desired." [...] The report stated, [...] "With such a formation, the ultimate failure of this dam was inevitable, unless water could have been kept from reaching the foundation. <b>Inspection</b> <b>galleries,</b> pressure grouting, drainage wells and deep cut-off walls are commonly used to prevent or remove percolation, but it is improbable that any or all of these devices would have been adequately effective, though they would have ameliorated the conditions and postponed the final failure." [...] They placed the cause of the failure on the western hillside. [...] "The west end," [...] the commission stated, [...] "was founded upon a reddish conglomerate which, even when dry, was of decidedly inferior strength and which, when wet, became so soft that most of it lost almost all rock characteristics." [...] The softening of the [...] "reddish conglomerate" [...] undermined the west side. [...] "The rush of water released by failure of the west end caused a heavy scour against the easterly canyon wall ... and caused the failure of that part of the structure."

40|$|Surface {{displacement}} at the dykes of La Pedrera reservoir (SE Spain) {{has been}} measured by satellite differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry. At the main dyke, a displacement of about 13 cm along the satellite {{line of sight}} has been estimated between August 1995 and May 2010, from a dataset composed by ERS- 1, ERS- 2 and Envisat-ASAR images. Two independent short-term processing tasks were also carried out with ERS- 2 /Envisat-ASAR (from June 2008 to May 2010) and TerraSAR-X (from August 2008 to June 2010) images which have shown similar spatial and temporal displacement patterns. The joint analysis of historical instrument surveys and DInSAR-derived data has allowed the identification of a long-term deformation process which is reflected at the dam's surface and is also clearly recognizable in the <b>inspection</b> <b>gallery.</b> The plausible causes of the displacements measured by DInSAR are also discussed in the paper. Finally, DInSAR data {{have been used to}} compute the long-term settlement of La Pedrera dam, showing a good agreement with external studies.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{long-term}} (> 30 years) settlement {{behavior of the}} Mornos dam {{on the basis of}} finite element analysis and vertical displacement data. It compares actually measured deformations resulting from a continuous geodetic monitoring record of the dam behavior with a numerical back analysis. Our aim is to explain the actual deformation history {{on the basis of the}} mechanical behavior of the dam. The deformation monitoring record consists of precise leveling data of a large number of control stations established along the crest and the <b>inspection</b> <b>gallery</b> of the dam, as well as settlements derived by magnetic extensometers placed inside the dam body. Overall, the available data cover the phases of construction, first filling of the reservoir and most of the operational time of the dam. The numerical modeling assumes 2 D plane-strain conditions to obtain the displacement and the stress-strain characteristics of the abutments and the dam at eleven equally-spaced cross sections. Comparative evaluation of the results of the geodetic monitoring analysis against the findings from the finite element back analysis simulating characteristic stages in the lifetime of the structure, shows a very good agreement (on average 0. 03 m) between the measured and computed displacements, which testifies to the correctness of the geotechnical parameters and loads used in the analysis.

40|$|Abstract- Seepage in {{different}} kinds of irrigation and water-retaining structures is dependent on various parameters like material and shape of structure, status like whether full or empty or partial and also their age and characteristics. Though <b>inspection</b> and drainage <b>galleries</b> in major dam structures account for this seepage, damage and distress either in the body or on the interface of the structures can make {{major changes in the}} flow and this study focuses attention on the role of crack or flaw within the body of the structure. Based on two-dimensional finite element discretisation and standard flow equation, a parametric study on location and size of flaw on the flow variations is done to assess the changes. Using a basic rectangular domain model to validate, case studies for velocity changes and flow pattern are given to highlight the role of damage and distress in such types of structures. These will form the basis for actual dam cross-sections for gravity, earthen and masonry type of materials which are quite popula...|$|R
