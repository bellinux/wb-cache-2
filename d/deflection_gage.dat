40|$|Testing was {{performed}} to determine the maximum RSRM igniter adapter-to-igniter chamber joint deflection at the crown of the inner joint primary seal. The deflection data was gathered to support igniter inner joint gasket resiliency predictions which led to launch commit criteria temperature determinations. The proximity (<b>deflection)</b> <b>gage</b> holes for the first test (Test No. 1) were incorrectly located; therefore, the test was declared a non-test. Prior to Test No. 2, test article configuration was modified with the correct proximity gage locations. Deflection data were successfully acquired during Test No. 2. However, the proximity gage deflection measurements were adversely affected by temperature increases. Deflections measured after the temperature rise at the proximity gages were considered unreliable. An analysis {{was performed}} to predict the maximum deflections based on the reliable data measured before the detectable temperature rise. Deflections to the primary seal crown location were adjusted to correspond {{to the time of}} maximum expected operating pressure (2, 159 psi) to account for proximity gage bias, and to account for maximum attach and special bolt relaxation. The maximum joint deflection for the igniter inner joint at the crown of the primary seal, accounting for all significant correction factors, was 0. 0031 in. (3. 1 mil). Since the predicted (0. 003 in.) and tested maximum deflection values were sufficiently close, the launch commit criteria was not changed {{as a result of this}} test. Data from this test should be used to determine if the igniter inner joint gasket seals are capable of maintaining sealing capability at a joint displacement of (1. 4) x (0. 0031 in.) = 0. 00434 inches. Additional testing should be performed to increase the database on igniter deflections and address launch commit criteria temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Finite element {{modelling}} {{of structures}} is nowadays a widely used calculation technique, even for design of pleasure craft built in composite materials. Design of such complex structures needs reliable and precise numericalmodels. Therefore, calibration of themodelwith experimental results is desirable. The application to hull shell of composite sandwich, having pre-preg epoxy skins and coremade of syntactic epoxy foam,was {{studied in the}} framework of a wider research programme. Large scale three point bending tests of panels of such sandwichwere carried out in theDINAV Ship Structures laboratory and were completed by traditional small scale tests. In addition to global load and <b>deflections,</b> <b>gages</b> measured the strains on the outer sides of skins and between the foamcore and the skins. In addition to the traditional gages, innovative wire sensors, conceived by theDINAV laboratory,were inserted between the core and the skins during the lamination. Experimental data were compared with finite elementmodels results, thus obtaining their calibration...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 51 - 52) Cold drawn type 316 {{stainless steel}} round tubes, and drawn tubes which were subsequently explosively formed into a hexagonal shape were tested by three experimental stress analysis techniques: <b>deflection,</b> strain <b>gage,</b> and local strain. The {{purpose of the}} tests was twofold:(1) to determine the residual stresses resulting from explosive forming, and (2) to compare the three experimental stress analysis techniques. In addition, the tensile and fatigue strength, ductility, hardness, and stress corrosion susceptibility of the as-drawn and the explosive formed stainless steel tube materials were correlated {{to determine the effect}} of explosive forming on these properties. Explosive forming was found to completely change prior residual stress patterns. The <b>deflection</b> and strain <b>gage</b> techniques of experimental stress analysis both indicated relatively low residual stress levels in the tubes, i. e., less 15 percent of ultimate strength. The local strain technique gave similar results but the operator induced data scatter w ere much greater. The mechanical strengths were increased significantly in the explosive formed tubes, as was the susceptibility to stress corrosion. Ductility and hardness both showed significant decreases after explosive forming. In view of the increased strength resulting from explosive forming, the residual stresses in the hexagonal tubes are probably inconsequential as compared to the residual stresses in the as-drawn tubes...|$|R
40|$|Flat sheet {{panels of}} {{aluminum}} alloy (all 17 S-T {{except for two}} specimens of 24 S-T) were tested under normal pressures with clamped edge supports in the structures laboratory of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. The thicknesses used ranged from 0. 010 to 0. 080 inch; the panel sizes ranged from 10 by 10 inches to 10 by 40 inches; and the pressure range was from 0 to 60 -pounds-per-square-inch <b>gage.</b> <b>Deflection</b> patterns were measured and maximum tensile strains {{in the center of}} the panel were determined by electric strain gages. The experimental data are presented by pressure-strain, pressure-maximum-deflection, and pressure-deflection curves.

40|$|This {{research}} effort furthers the Air Force’s {{study of}} reusable launch vehicles and hypersonic airfoils by conducting a hypersonic flight test using the US Air Force Academy’s FalconLAUNCH VIII sounding rocket. In this study, two experimental fin tips were designed {{and attached to}} the sounding rocket in place of two stabilizer fins in order to collect data throughout the rocket’s hypersonic flight profile. The desire to research, study, and test experimental fin tips was driven by the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Future responsive Access to Space Technologies (FAST) program and their desire to include vertical stabilizers on the wing tips of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). In this research study, finite element models of the experimental fin tips were developed and used to predict the flight data collected by the strain and temperature gages attached to the test specimen. The results of these flight prediction tests showed that the test specimen will undergo the greatest deflection and strain during the acceleration of the rocket. Maximum <b>deflection</b> and strain <b>gage</b> readings were obtained at a speed of Mach 2. 5 {{at an altitude of}} 9 k feet. Ultimately, the payload will undergo a maximum deflection of 0. 6 inches at the fin tip and a maximu...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{testing was}} {{performed}} to evaluate heritage forward skirts from the Space Shuttle program for use on the Space Launch System (SLS) program. One forward skirt is located in each solid rocket booster. Heritage forward skirts are aluminum 2219 welded structures. Loads are applied at the forward skirt thrust post and ball assembly. Testing was needed because SLS ascent loads are roughly 40 % higher than Space Shuttle loads. Testing objectives were to determine margins of safety, demonstrate reliability, and validate analytical models. Two forward skirts were structurally tested using the test configuration. The test stand applied loads to the thrust post. Four hydraulic actuators were used to apply axial load and two hydraulic actuators were used to apply radial and tangential loads. The first test {{was referred to as}} FSTA- 1 (Forward Skirt Structural Test Article) and was performed in April/May 2014. The purpose of FSTA- 1 was to verify the ultimate capability of the forward skirt subjected to ascent ultimate loads. Testing consisted of two liftoff load cases taken to 100 % limit load followed by an ascent load case taken to 110 % limit load. The forward skirt was unloaded to no load after each test case. Lastly, the forward skirt was tested to 140 % limit and then to failure using the ascent loads. The second test was referred to as FSTA- 2 and performed in July/August of 2014. The purpose of FSTA- 2 was to verify the ultimate capability of the forward skirt subjected to liftoff ultimate loads. Testing consisted of six liftoff load cases taken to 100 % limit load followed by the six liftoff cases taken to 140 % limit load. Two ascent load cases were then tested to 100 % limit load. The forward skirt was unloaded to no load after each test case. Lastly, the forward skirt was tested to 140 % limit and then to failure using the ascent loads. The forward skirts on FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 successfully carried all applied liftoff and ascent load cases. Both FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 were tested to failure by increasing the ascent loads. Failure occurred in the forward skirt thrust post radius. The forward skirts on FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 had nearly identical failure modes. FSTA- 1 failed at 1. 72 times limit load and FSTA- 2 failed at 1. 62 times limit load. This difference is primarily attributed to variation in material properties in the thrust post region. Test data were obtained from strain <b>gages,</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>gages,</b> ARAMIS digital strain measurement, acoustic emissions, and high-speed video. Strain gage data and ARAMIS strain were compared to finite element (FE) analysis predictions. Both the forward skirt and tooling were modeled. This allows the analysis to simulate the loading {{as close as possible to}} actual test configuration. FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 were instrumented with over 200 strain gages to ensure all possible failure modes could be captured. However, it turned out that three gages provided critical strain data. One was located in the post bore and two on the post radius. More gages were not specified due to space limitations and the desire to not interfere with the use of the ARAMIS system on the post radius. Measured strains were compared to analysis results for the load cycle to failure. Note that FSTA- 1 gages were lost before failure was reached. FSTA- 2 gages made it to the failure load but one of the radius gages was lost before testing began. This gage was not replaced because of the time and cost associated with disassembly of the test structure. Correlation to analysis was excellent for FSTA- 1. FSTA- 2 was not quite as good because there was more residual strain from previous load cycles. FSTA- 2 was loaded and unloaded with 12 liftoff cases and two ascent cases before taking the skirt to failure. FSTA- 1 only had two liftoff cases and one ascent case before taking the skirt to failure. The ARAMIS system was used to determine strain at the post radius by processing digital images of a speckled paint pattern. Digital cameras recorded images of the speckled paint pattern. ARAMIS strain results for FSTA- 2 just prior to failure. Note a high strain location develops near the left side. This high strain compares well to analysis prediction for both FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2. The strain at this location was also plotted versus limit load. Both FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 had excellent correlation between ARAMIS and analysis strains. Acoustic emission (AE) sensors were used to monitor for damage formation that may occur during testing (e. g., crack formation and growth or propagation). AE was very important because after disassembly of FSTA- 1, a crack was observed in the ball fitting radius. The ball fitting did not crack on FSTA- 2. AE data was used to reconstruct when the crack occurred. The AE energy versus time plot for FSTA. The energy increased considerably at 850 seconds (152 % limit load), indicating a crack could have formed at this point. The only visual evidence found that could have corresponded to this was the crack that initiated in the ball fitting. The cracks in the forward skirt aluminum structures would likely have been lower energy due to a lower modulus and all that were found after failure correlated to occurring after the initial crack in the post radius. This was verified by high-speed cameras used to record the failure...|$|R
40|$|A two-storey 3 bay x 3 bay, 1 / 12 scale, perspex {{flat slab}} model was tested under a one-bay uniformly {{distributed}} load, which was applied successively {{to the various}} bays. The load was applied using a rubber air bag. The moments induced in the model were measured by electrical resistance type strain <b>gages</b> and the <b>deflections</b> by dial <b>gages.</b> By analysis of the experimental results, and comparing them with the ACI 318 - 71 Direct Design Method, the following conclusions were obtained: The total static moment given by the ACI 318 - 71 Direct Design Method is accurate for all practical purposes. The width of the column strip specified by the ACI Code in Clause 13. 1. 2 of 0. 25 ℓ 2 but not greater than 0. 25 ℓ 1 results in too great a concentration of negative moment in the column strip. This concentration of moment in the column strip is even less justified for the positive moment where the column strip moment/unit width and the middle strip moments/unit width are of approximately equal magnitude. The effect of the concentration of positive moment in the column strip together with aforementioned restriction of {{the width of the}} column strip results in middle strip design positive moments 25 % less than those measured. The provision " 13. 3. 4. 6 " that a design moment may be adjusted by up to 10 % provided that the total static moment is not less than required should be changed by eliminating the 10 % limit. It is recommended that adjustment be applied to the negative moment only. The provisions for the effects of pattern loading " 13. 3. 6 " are insufficient. The limitation of live load to dead load ratios stated in " 13. 3. 1. 5 " results in a possibility of developing negative moments in or near mid span of interior panels...|$|R
40|$|With {{global climate}} {{problems}} receiving increasingly international political attention,most European nations {{are looking for}} sources of renewable energy. Wind turbines area promising source of renewable energy and their numbers have steadily increasedsince {{the introduction of the}} modern wind turbine in the 1970 s. The largest units todayhave a rated power of 7 MW and blades ranging up to 62. 5 m in length. Offshore windturbines have access to stronger winds with less turbulence, thereby increasing theenergy output of each unit. Offshore turbines will also have a lesser environmentalimpact than onshore turbines. It is believed that the development of offshore wind turbineswill encourage the development of even longer blades. The main spar geometry of a 100 m wind turbine blade was established in order to evaluatehow the use of carbon and glass fiber composites would affect the design. A hybridsolution using UD carbon fiber for global stiffness and ± 45 ° glass fiber plies for bucklingresistance was also developed. The ultimate loads were calculated for blades with pitchcontrol and blades experiencing failure of pitch control during the 1 -year and 50 -yearextreme gust. The DNV-OS-J 102 standard for wind turbines was used in the calculationof safety factors for both loads and material strength criteria. The distribution of ± 45 °anti-buckling plies by buckling analysis is extremely time consuming and therefore aprogram for automatic ply distribution was developed. The Matlab program interactedwith the FEM software Abaqus, defining input files and extracting results, and proved tobe highly efficient. The results from the FEM analyses were combined with a simple costmodel in order to evaluate both the weight and cost of the different spar solutions. Important weight reductions can be obtained by optimizing the performance of the composite laminate in the spar. Several sub-models of the 100 m spar were created withthe aim of optimizing the spar’s buckling performance. The angle and distribution ofboth the ± 45 ° and UD plies were systematically altered in order to increase the bucklingload. The introduction of ply homogenization and core material in the flange was alsoevaluated and yielded the largest increases of buckling load. The results from the optimizedsub-models were implemented in a 100 m spar and found to decrease theamount of ± 45 ° plies by 50 %. A 6 m scaled main spar of glass fiber composite was produced by resin infusion. Thespar was tested in a 4 -point bending test and designed to fail by buckling of the topflange. In order to control the location of the buckling failure, an artificial imperfectionwas introduced {{in the middle of the}} top flange during manufacturing. The imperfectionis representative for imperfections found during manufacturing of wind turbine spars. Inaddition to measuring force and global <b>deflection,</b> 25 strain <b>gages</b> were installed tomonitor the spar. Finally, a FEM analysis of the 6 m spar was developed and correlated with the experimentalresults. By implementing the imperfection in the compression spar and the useof non-linear analysis, the strain patterns from the test results were successfully reproduce...|$|R
40|$|Iowa Highway Research Board Project TR- 568 was {{initiated}} in January 2007 {{to investigate the}} use of steel sheet piling as an alternative foundation component for Low Volume Road (LVR) bridges. A total of 14 different sites were initially investigated in several counties as potential candidates {{for the construction of}} demonstration projects utilizing steel sheet pile abutments. Based on site conditions, three sites were selected for demonstration projects; these are located in Black Hawk, Boone, and Tama Counties. Each of the demonstration projects utilizes a different experimental abutment system. Steel sheet piling, typically used for retaining structures in the United States, has been used as bearing piles in Europe for the past 50 years and is a potential alternative for use as the primary component in LVR bridge substructures. To investigate the viability of axially-loaded sheet pile abutments, a demonstration project was constructed in Black Hawk County, Iowa. The project involved construction of a 40 ft, single-span bridge utilizing axially-loaded steel sheet piling as the primary foundation component. The site chosen for the project consisted of primarily silty clays underlain by shallow bedrock into which the sheet piling was driven. An instrumentation system (consisting of strain <b>gages,</b> <b>deflection</b> transducers, earth pressure cells, and piezometers) was installed on the bridge for obtaining live load test data as well as long term performance data. Live load testing of the bridge structure was performed on November 3, 2008 by placing two loaded trucks (approximately 24 ton each) at various locations on the bridge and recording data. Maximum axial stresses occurring in the piles were approximately 0. 5 ksi and were comparable to estimates made by analysis for a design lane-load distribution width of 10 ft. Flexural stresses, in general, were significantly less than those estimated by analysis and maximum values were approximately 0. 2 ksi. Earth pressures recorded during live load testing (with maxima of approximately 100 psf) were also significantly lower than earth pressures estimated by analysis. These results suggest the method of analysis for lateral earth pressures applied to the sheet pile wall was conservative. Long-term monitoring of the bridge from November 2008 through February 2009 was also performed; the datalogging system was damaged by flooding in March 2009 and subsequent long-term monitoring was terminated. Variations in earth pressure over time were observed with the largest variations in earth pressure occurring behind the abutment cap. The earth pressures experienced cycles that varied in magnitude from 50 psf to 1500 psf, suggesting long-term loading due to freeze/thaw cycles of the soil and the thermal deformation of the superstructure elements may be the critical factors in the design of sheet pile abutment and backfill retaining systems rather than vehicular live loads. The demonstration projects in Boone and Tama Counties were designed using a geosynthetically reinforced soil backfill with a steel sheet pile backfill retention abutment system. Each of the bridge superstructures is supported by spread footings bearing on the reinforced soil mass abutment systems. The bridge superstructure in Boone County is a 100 ft long, three span J 30 C- 87 continuous concrete slab bridge while the superstructure for Tama County utilizes two 89 ft railroad flatcars bolted together. Structural monitoring systems (including strain gages, earth pressure cells, and piezometers) were developed for load testing and long-term monitoring of these projects as well. Construction of the project in Boone County was completed in fall 2009 and live load testing was subsequently performed on November 13, 2009. Maximum flexural stresses experienced in the sheet pile elements were 0. 08 ksi and were significantly lower than estimated by analysis. Vertical and horizontal earth pressures in the backfill (with maxima of 410 psf and 50 psf, respectively) were also lower than expected, suggesting a conservative design approach. Construction of the project in Tama County was completed in August 2010 with subsequent load testing performed in October 2010. This thesis presents a summary of the existing research on steel sheet piling, documentation of the design and construction of the demonstration bridges in Black Hawk County and Boone County, as well as an analysis of the design procedures used through information collected during live load testing of the Black Hawk County and Boone County projects. Information on the design and site investigation of the Tama County project is presented in this thesis as well. Preliminary results indicate that steel sheet piling is an effective alternative for LVR substructures. Results and analysis of live load testing for the Tama County project will be presented in the final report for project TR- 568...|$|R
