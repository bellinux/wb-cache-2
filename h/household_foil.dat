5000|$|Aluminium foil (or {{aluminum}} foil), {{often referred}} to with the misnomer tin foil, is aluminium prepared in thin metal leaves with a thickness less than 0.2 mm; thinner gauges down to [...] are also commonly used. In the United States, foils are commonly gauged in thousandths of an inch or mils. Standard <b>household</b> <b>foil</b> is typically 0.016 mm thick, and heavy duty <b>household</b> <b>foil</b> is typically 0.024 mm. The foil is pliable, and can be readily bent or wrapped around objects. Thin foils are fragile and are sometimes laminated to other materials such as plastics or paper {{to make them more}} useful. Aluminium foil supplanted tin foil in the mid 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Aluminum and its alloys {{are used}} in many aspects of modern life, from soda cans and <b>household</b> <b>foil</b> to the {{automobiles}} and aircraft in which we travel. Aluminum alloy systems are characterized by good workability that enables these alloys to be economically rolled, extruded, or forged into useful shapes. Mechanical properties such as strength are altered significantly with cold working, annealing, precipitation-hardening, and/or heat-treatments. Heat-treatable aluminum alloys contain one or more soluble constituents such as copper, lithium, magnesium, silicon and zinc that individually, or with other elements, can form phases that strengthen the alloy. 	 	Microstructure development is highly dependent {{on all of the}} processing steps the alloy experiences. Ultimately, the macroscopic properties of the alloy depend strongly on the microstructure. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the microstructural changes that occur during thermal and mechanical processing is fundamental to predicting alloy properties. In particular, the microstructure becomes more homogeneous and secondary phases are dissolved during thermal treatments. Robust physical models for the kinetics of particle dissolution are necessary to predict the most efficient thermal treatment. 	 A general dissolution model for multi-component alloys has been developed using the front-tracking method to study the dissolution of precipitates in an aluminum alloy matrix. This technique is applicable to any alloy system, provided thermodynamic and diffusion data are available. Treatment of the precipitate interface is explored using two techniques: the immersed-boundary method and a new technique, termed here the sharp-interface method. The sharp-interface technique is based on a variation of the ghost fluid method and eliminates the need for corrective source terms in the characteristic equations. In addition, the sharp-interface method is shown to predict the dissolution behavior of precipitates in aluminum alloys when compared with published experimental results. The influence of inter-particle spacing is examined and shown to {{have a significant effect on}} dissolution kinetics. Finally, the impact of multiple particles of various sizes interacting in an aluminum matrix is investigated. It is shown that smaller particles dissolve faster, as expected, but influence the dissolution of larger particles through soft-impingement, even after the smaller particles have disappeared. Ph. D.

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a novel electrospray ionization (ESI) technique based on <b>household</b> aluminum <b>foil</b> (Al foil) and demonstated the desirable features and applications of this technique. Al foil can be readily cut and folded into desired configuration for effective ionization and for holding sample solution in bulk to allowing acquisition of durable ion signals. The present technique was demonstrated to be applicable in analysis {{of a wide variety}} of samples, ranging from pure chemical and biological compounds, e. g., organic compounds and proteins, to complex samples in liquid, semi-solid, and solid states, e. g., beverages, skincare cream, and herbal medicines. The inert, hydrophobic and impermeable surface of Al foil allows convenient and effective on-target extraction of solid samples and on-target sample clean-up, i. e., removal of salts and detergents from proteins and peptides, extending ESI device from usually only for sample loading and ionization to including sample processing. Moreover, Al foil is an excellent heat-conductor and highly heat-tolerant, permitting direct monitoring of thermal reactions, e. g., thermal denaturation of proteins. Overall, the present study showed that Al-foil ESI could be an economical and versatile method that allows a wide range of applications. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R
40|$|When a gas filled tube {{is exposed}} to Electromagnetic radiation, the gas {{contained}} in the tube is ionized if certain parameters exist. Such parameters are the applied electric field strength and frequency, gas type and pressure and tube shape and size. These parameters, acting together, define other parameters such as mean free path, characteristic diffusion rate, etc. If an external circuit is created by connecting the filaments of the tube with conducting wires, a pure Direct Current (D. C.) will flow in the circuit. The question to be answered in this work is how this D. C. is created and extracted. This investigation utilized an R. F. radio with an output voltage of 180 volts, peak-to-peak and a frequency of 4. 25 x 10 (2 ̆ 76) Hz {{as a source of}} energy. The gas filled tubes used were conventional fluorescent tubes of two different lengths. The two antenna leads that emanated from the radio, which would conventionally be used as the Radiator lead and the Ground Plane lead, (Designated as R. F. Electrode # 1 and R. F. Electrode # 2, respectively) coupled energy into the fluorescent tube. Conducting rings were fashioned from <b>household</b> aluminum <b>foil</b> and fastened to the antenna leads. The rings were positioned around the glass envelope of the fluorescent tube. When the radio was activated, current flowed in the external circuit. The amount of current that flowed in the external circuit was found to be a function of the relative positions of R. F. Electrode # 1 and R. F. Electrode # 2 to themselves {{as well as to the}} external circuit electrodes. By investigating the literature and by experimenting with tubes of different lengths, it was resolved that R. F. Electrode # 1 was the source of the plasma ionization. The ionization produced carrier populations of different constituents which traveled to the internal filaments of the tube at different speeds due to the difference in carrier mobilities. Because of the difference in migration speeds, mutual attraction of dissimilar constituents and repulsion of similar constituents, a sheath formed around the internal filaments of the tube. This sheath had a potential which was dependent on the relative position of the R. F. Electrode # 1 which was the source of the ionization. When an external circuit was provided, current flowed as a consequence of the population gradient at the two external circuit electrodes...|$|R
40|$|Among {{various types}} of {{electrical}} energy storage devices, supercapacitors (high power but low energy) and batteries (high energy but low power) are extensively studied. Present work aims to develop an electrode material that combines the advantages of both supercapacitors and batteries. This was realized by rational design of the microstructure of the composite material made of aligned carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) and a pseudocapacitive component which {{in this study is}} mainly polyaniline (PANI). Other affecting factors including electrolytes, configuration of the cell and so on are temporarily not included in this study. Initial study on the composite materials made of PANI and powder CNTs through chemical reactions has shown that the loading of PANI varied the π-π interaction between PANI and CNTs which could cause the change in the oxidation stability of the composite materials. Deposition of PANI on ACNTs via electrochemical polymerization shows better control over the morphology and microstructure of the composite materials than via chemical polymerization. ACNTs were successfully synthesized on Ti and Al substrates in present work. PANI was firstly electrochemically polymerized on the ACNTs/Ti templates by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV). A systematic study on the composite materials containing various loadings of PANI has shown: The specific capacitance based on PANI phase reached 1100 F/g when the PANI film is thinner than 11 nm, which is approaching the limited value that PANI can provide. After 2000 cycles of charge-discharge at 2. 0 A/g, the reduction in the discharge capacitance of the composites containing 63. 3 % and 21. 4 % of PANI was 7. 1 % and 3. 3 %, A principle of designing the optimal microstructure of the composite materials towards high specific power and specific energy and good cycling stability was developed: high loading and thin layer of PANI should be obtained at the same time. This principle was realized by depositing a 9 nm of PANI on much smaller ACNTs (9 nm in diameter) which were facilely synthesized on <b>household</b> aluminum <b>foil.</b> A highly flexible symmetric supercapacitor built from the 63. 8 % wt. PANI/ACNTs composite material on household Al current collector exhibited a high specific capacitance of 705. 8 F/g at 0. 1 A/g. A small specific capacitance decay of about 5. 3 % from 0. 1 A/g to 5. 0 A/g indicated a good rate performance. The average specific energy and average specific power were found to be 18. 9 Wh/kg and 220. 1 W/kg at 1. 0 A/g. The internal resistance of the device at 1. 0 A/g was calculated to be 1. 3 Ω, leading to the maximum specific power of 11. 3 kW/kg. 96 % of the initial capacitance was kept after 2000 cycles of charge-dishcarge at 1. 0 A/g. The high specific energy of 72. 4 Wh/kg and high specific power of 24. 9 kW/kg were obtained with an organic electrolyte, namely, lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6) at 1. 0 A/g. The coin-cell showed a reduction of ~ 5 % in the capacitance after 2000 cycles of charge-discharge from 0 to 2. 5 V at 1. 0 A/g. A smarter design on the supercapacitor device was also proposed in present work aiming to enhance the performance and reduce the cost of the device.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{sudden failure}} of metal {{structures}} under load, {{which has been}} a design problem for many years, is characterized by a crack propagation rate which approaches the speed of sound in the material. These failures, which are often known as catastrophic fractures, may be divided into two types which depend on the particular material in question. Fractures which cause a very small amount of plastic deformation associated with low energy absorption are known as brittle fractures, whereas high energy absorption during fracture, due to large amounts of plastic deformation, is associated with ductile fracture. The Griffith theory for spontaneous fracture in brittle materials states that the strain energy released during fracture must be greater than the energy needed to form the new crack surface area. This theory, which has been verified experimentally for brittle materials, is not applicable to ductile materials since the energy of plastic deformation during crack propagation must be taken into account. The revised and simplified theory for ductile materials states that the strain energy must exceed the energy needed to cause plastic deformation ahead of the crack. The steps in the fracture of ductile materials are initiation, slow crack growth, and rapid or catastrophic crack propagation, and the variable plastic deformation involved in these steps causes the process to be complex in behavior and analysis. However, an understanding of the causes of slow and rapid crack growth can be obtained by studying the effects of plastic deformation at the tip of a propagating crack. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the factors which affect the tendency for a ductile crack to propagate catastrophically. This was accomplished through the use of two types of investigations. In the first investigation an attempt was made to obtain catastrophic failure in 18 x 32 inch uniaxially stressed sheets of commercial <b>household</b> aluminum <b>foil</b> by introducing a crack {{in the center of the}} sheet in such a manner that the crack was elongated outwards in each direction. The catastrophic failure which was observed, however, was due to the addition of extra energy to the system boundaries which was not accounted for in the theory. Slow crack propagation was also observed and led to the second investigation. The plastic deformation at the crack tip was studied by visual of the was done observation using a metallograph and by actual measurement amount of deformation occurring during crack growth. This with a Tukon microhardness tester in which indentations were placed on the foil specimens, which were later given a small crack at the center, and which were mounted in a drill press vise on the tester. The crack was then propagated by turning the screw on the vise and measurements of the deformation between the indentations were made. The photographs and measurements of the plastic deformation at the crack tip showed that deformation existed throughout the entire specimen and was not localized in a given area at the crack tip as has been assured in some theories. The existance of elastic strain in the material was shown by the occurrence of elastic recovery in the strain relieved areas of the cracked material although no differentiation could be made between the area of elastic and plastic deformation. The existance of a stable configuration of iso-strain contours surrounding the tip of the crack was also shown. Calculations of the strain energy needed to satisfy the plastic deformation energy requirements showed that a crack length of about 49 inches would be needed to cause catastrophic failure. This is much larger than the specimen size used and would explain the lack of rapid crack growth in the tests run under near theoretical conditions...|$|R
