40|$|Abstract: The {{benefits}} of utilizing camless valve actuations for internal combustion engines are {{primarily due to}} their ability of significantly improving engine performance. There are mainly three kinds of camless valve actuators: electro-magnetic, electro-hydraulic, and electro-pneumatic valves. This paper focuses on controls of the <b>Electro-Pneumatic</b> <b>Valve</b> Actuators (EPVA). The model-based predictive control scheme has been developed for exhaust <b>electro-pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> actuators to overcome variable in-cylinder pressure force {{as a function of}} engine operational conditions in early publications. But high computational throughput of predictive control makes it extremely difficult for real-time implementation. This paper develops an iterative model-based predictive control scheme for lift control of an exhaust EPVA that significantly reduces computational throughput. The developed iterative control strategy was verified in simulation using an EPVA model that combines mathematical models of exhaust valve and in-cylinder pressure based upon a 5. 4 Liter 3 valve V 8 engine head.

30|$|The {{independent}} {{pressure control}} system generally consists of air supply, <b>electro-pneumatic</b> proportional <b>valve,</b> chamber and pressure sensor, for example, constant pressure system [14], pneumatic-pressure-load system [15] and pneumatic pressure signal generator [16]. Lu et al. [14] presented a constant pressure control system {{that consisted of}} frictionless cylinders, a large tank and a pneumatic proportional pressure valve. A hybrid controller combined with Bang-Bang, PD controller and fuzzy PID was proposed to minimize the pressure fluctuations in cylinders. The pneumatic-pressure-load system researched in Ref. [15], applied to intensity testing devices, was constructed by <b>electro-pneumatic</b> proportional pressure <b>valve.</b> In order {{to adapt to the}} parameter variability of the pressure load system and obtain better dynamic and static performances, a linear quadratic Gaussian self-tuning pressure regulator was proposed to realize an adaptive control of pressure in the chamber. In the pneumatic pressure signal generator [16], <b>electro-pneumatic</b> proportional directional <b>valve</b> was used to control the air-flow rates of injecting and outflowing the chamber to regulate the pressure. Because of the nonlinear characteristics, an intelligent coordinate control method, combining expert intelligent coordinator, expert controller, and fuzzy neural network controller, was designed to improve dynamic response and steady state accuracy of the generator.|$|R

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{industry has been}} in a marathon of advancement over the past decades. This is partly due to global environmental concerns about increasing amount of air pollutants such as NOx (oxides of nitrogen), CO (carbon monoxide) and particulate matters (PM) and decreasing fossil fuel resources. Recently due to stringent emission regulations such as US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and CARB (California Air Resource Board), improvement in fuel economy and reduction in the exhaust gas emissions have become the two major challenges for engine manufacturers. To fulfill the requirements of these regulations, the IC engines including gasoline and diesel engines have experienced significant modifications during the past decades. Incorporating the fully flexible valvetrains in production IC engines is one of the several ways to improve the performance of these engines. The ultimate goal of this PhD thesis is to conduct feasibility study on development of a reliable fully flexible hydraulic valvetrain for automotive engines. Camless valvetrains such as electro-hydraulic, electro-mechanical and <b>electro-pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> actuators have been developed and extensively studied by several engine component manufacturers and researchers. Unlike conventional camshaft driven systems and cam-based variable valve timing (VVT) techniques, these systems offer valve timings and lift control that are fully independent of crankshaft position and engine speed. These systems are key technical enablers for HCCI, 2 / 4 stroke-switching gasoline and air hybrid technologies, each of which is a high fuel efficiency technology. Although the flexibility of the camless valvetrains is limitless, they are generally more complex and expensive than cam-based systems and require more study on areas of reliability, fail safety, durability, repeatability and robustness. On the contrary, the cam-based variable valve timing systems are more reliable, durable, repeatable and robust but much less flexible and much more complex in design. In this research work, a new hydraulic variable valve actuation system (VVA) is proposed, designed, prototyped and tested. The proposed system consists of a two rotary spool valves each of which actuated either by a combination of engine crankshaft and a phase shifter or by a variable speed servo-motor. The proposed actuation system offers the same level of flexibility as camless valvetrains while its reliability, repeatability and robustness are comparable with cam driven systems. In this system, the engine valve opening and closing events can be advanced or retarded without any constraint as well as the final valve lift. Transition from regenerative braking or air motor mode to conventional mode in air hybrid engines can be easily realized using the proposed valvetrain. The proposed VVA system, as a stand-alone unit, is modeled, designed, prototyped and successfully tested. The mathematical model of the system is verified by the experimental data and used as a numerical test bench for evaluating the performance of the designed control systems. The system test setup is equipped with valve timing and lift controllers and it is tested to measure repeatability, flexibility and control precision of the valve actuation system. For fast and accurate engine valve lift control, a simplified dynamic model of the system (average model) is derived based on the energy and mass conservation principles. A discrete time sliding mode controller is designed based on the system average model and it is implemented and tested on the experimental setup. To improve the energy efficiency and robustness of the proposed valve actuator, the system design parameters are subjected to an optimization using the genetic algorithm method. Finally, an energy recovery system is proposed, designed and tested to reduce the hydraulic valvetrain power consumption. The presented study is {{only a small portion of}} the growing research in this area, and it is hoped that the results obtained here will lead to the realization of a more reliable, repeatable, and flexible engine valve system...|$|E

Pressurized air was applied for 36 ms across a 2. 5 cm diameter cylinder to cut a sample from a soil column and convey the sample along a delivery pipe into a container. An <b>electro-pneumatic</b> regulator <b>valve</b> was used to regulate the air pressure at 550, 690, and 830 kPa (80, 100, and 120 psi) using an analog electrical signal.

Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the effectiveness of positive high-pressure air as a cutting force for different soil conditions. The effects of air pressure level, soil moisture content, soil compaction, and soil type on the quantity of soil sample obtained were investigated. Moisture content and air pressure level were the most significant factors, while compaction was not significant (. = 0. 05) in terms of mass of soil obtained. Laboratory test results proved that pressurized air was effective in cutting and transporting a soil sample {{in a short time}} period (36 ms) for all different soils studied in this experiment. The electro-pneumatic method was also capable of obtaining a consistent amount of soil sample with a coefficient of variation of less than 20 % for any individual treatments in the experimental design.
