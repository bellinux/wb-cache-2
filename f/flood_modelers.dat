40|$|Abstract: Increasingly {{available}} and a virtually uninterrupted supply of satellite-estimated rainfall data is gradually becoming a cost-effective source of input for flood prediction under {{a variety of}} circumstances. However, most real-time and quasi-global satellite rainfall products are currently available at spatial scales ranging from 0. 25 o to 0. 50 o and hence, are considered somewhat coarse for dynamic hydrologic modeling of basin-scale flood events. This study assesses the question: what are the hydrologic implications of uncertainty of satellite rainfall data at the coarse scale? We investigated this question on the 970 km 2 Upper Cumberland river basin of Kentucky. The satellite rainfall product assessed was NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product called 3 B 41 RT that is available in pseudo real time with a latency of 6 - 10 hours. We observed that bias adjustment of satellite rainfall data can improve application in flood prediction to some extent with the trade-off of more false alarms in peak flow. However, a more rational and regime-based adjustment procedure needs to be identified before the use of satellite data can be institutionalized among <b>flood</b> <b>modelers.</b> Sensors 2007, 7 341...|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} of extreme storm-tide events {{has been extensively}} studied; however, the vari- ability within the duration of such events and implications to flood risk is less well understood. This research quantifies such variability during extreme storm-tide events (the combined elevation of the tide, surge, and their interactions) at 44 national tide gauges around the UK. Extreme storm-tide events were sampled from water level measurements taken every 15 min between 1993 and 2012. At each site, the variability in eleva- tion at each time step, relative to a given event peak, was quantified. The magnitude of this time series vari- ability was influenced both by gauge location (and hence the tidal and nontidal residual characteristics) and the time relative to high water. The potential influence of this variability on coastal inundation was assessed across all UK gauge sites, followed by a detailed case study of Portsmouth. A two-dimensional hydrody- namic model of the Portsmouth region was used to demonstrate that given a current 1 in 200 year storm- tide event, the predicted number of buildings inundated differed by more than 30 % when contrasting sim- ulations forced with {{the upper and lower}} bounds of the observed time series variability. The results indicate that variability in the time series of the storm-tide event can have considerable influence upon overflow vol- umes, hence with implications for coastal flood risk assessments. Therefore, further evaluating and repre- senting this uncertainty in future flood risk assessments is vital, while the envelopes of variability defined in this research provides a valuable tool for coastal <b>flood</b> <b>modelers...</b>|$|E
40|$|Flood plain mapping {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} important part of flood plain management. Flood plain mapping employs mapping software and hydraulic calculation packages to efficiently map <b>flood</b> plains. <b>Modelers</b> often utilize automation software to develop the complex geometries required to reduce the time to develop hydraulic models. The Utah Inundation Mapping System (UTIMS) is designed to reduce {{the time required to}} develop complex geometries for use in flood plain mapping studies. The automated geometries developed by UTIMS include: flood specific river centerlines, bank lines, flow path lines, cross sections and areal averaged n-value polygons. UTIMS thus facilitates developing automated input to US Army Corps of Engineer 2 ̆ 7 s HEC-RAS software. Results from HEC-RAS can be imported back to UTIMS for display and mapping. The user can also specify convergence criteria for water surface profile at selected locations along the river and thus run UTIMS and HEC-RAS iteratively till the convergence criterion is met. UTIMS develops a new flood specific geometry file for each iteration, enabling an accurate modeling of flood-plain. Utilizing this robust and easy to operate software within the GIS environment modelers can significantly reduce the time required to develop accurate flood plain maps. The time thus saved in developing the geometries allows modelers to spend more time doing the actual modeling and analyzing results. The time thus saved can also result in faster turn around and potential cost cutting in flood-plain modeling work. In this paper the authors describe UTIMS capabilities, compare them with other available software, and demonstrate the UTIMS flood plain automation process using a case study...|$|R
