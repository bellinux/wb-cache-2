40|$|In my dissertation, I {{experimentally}} {{examine whether}} and how the reporting model a firm uses to guide its corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures can influence managers’ capital allocation decisions. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} my research question, why this research question is important, what I predict I will find, and the main results of my experiment. In Chapter 2, I briefly review the CSR literature generally and in accounting specifically, touching particularly on what has catalyzed the recent growth in CSR disclosure, how it influences behavior, and the emerging role of CSR reporting models as well as differences among these models. Two key features that differ among available reporting models are the intended users of the disclosures (e. g., capital providers or all stakeholders) and the <b>disclosure</b> <b>location</b> (e. g., MD&A or Sustainability Report). In Chapter 3, I draw upon research in social psychology on the social contingency model to hypothesize that differences in the intended users and the <b>disclosure</b> <b>location</b> jointly influence the extent to which managers’ capital allocations are weighted toward financial versus social benefits. I also hypothesize that this influence is mediated by how accountable managers feel for financial and social performance. Chapter 4 outlines the experimental design and method I use to test my hypotheses. The results of my experiment and related statistical analyses are reported in Chapters 5 and 6, in which I find support for my predictions across two different participant populations I use as proxies for managers. Specifically, I find that participants allocate capital to social benefits across all conditions, but that their overall allocations are largely driven by financial considerations. That is, they weight financial benefits more heavily than social benefits. However, when the reporting model disconnects CSR disclosure from a more traditional financial reporting setting (i. e., when the CSR disclosures are made to all stakeholders in a Sustainability Report), participants’ weight on financial benefits is reduced. In addition, I find that these results are driven by changes in perceived accountability for both financial and social performance. I also find evidence that the influence of the CSR <b>disclosure</b> <b>location</b> is contingent on whether the disclosure audience’s preferences are perceived to uniformly favor financial benefits. Chapter 7 concludes and reiterates the important implications of my dissertation. Namely, the results of my study help inform standard setters, regulators, stakeholders, and managers about the consequences of alternative CSR reporting models and highlight the potential effects of CSR disclosure standards on stakeholder welfare.

40|$|Background: The role of {{antiretroviral}} {{drugs in}} the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV is well known. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore how nonchemoprophylactic factors, including infant feeding practices, mother’s HIV sta-tus disclosure, mode and place of delivery, infant gender, and maternal age, are related to MTCT. Methods: The study analyzed program data of DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from dried blood spot samples and selected client information from perinatally exposed infants aged 0 to 12 months. Results: A total of 8237 samples were analyzed. In all, 84 % of the mothers ever breast-fed their children. In instances where both mother and baby received intervention, the transmission rates of HIV were higher among those who are still breast-feeding after 6 to 12 months. <b>Disclosure,</b> <b>location,</b> and mode of delivery did not have an effect on the transmission rates of HIV when both mother and baby received prophylaxis. Conclusion: Nonchemoprophylaxis factors, especially breast-feeding, play a key role in perinatal transmission of HIV...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} how Australia’s metadata retention and disclosure regime addresses the retention and <b>disclosure</b> of <b>location</b> information and location identifiers by locally licensed telecommunications service providers {{and those that}} do not require a licence to operate in Australia. The article specifically looks at over the-top-content and communication services. The retention and disclosure duties are described in contrast to the powers of the law enforcement agencies to access and use location information from free online social networking services, whereas the law seeks to restrict the retention and thereby the <b>disclosure</b> of <b>location</b> information in respect of over the-top-content and communication services that are not provided by the licensed or unlicensed telecommunications service provider. The paper argues the retention limitations in respect of over the-top-content and communication services are undermined by the actions of the agencies to harvest location information and conduct big data analytics. Similarly, so does the discretion granted to the telecommunications service provider to retain location information in respect of over the-top-content and communication services, provided by a third party content service provider and then be required to disclose it, without any additional safeguards.

Different approaches have been considered to promote privacy when disclosing and sharing personal location and, mainly, three lines of research can be identified: one that takes the person’s location and blurs it [1], one that anonymizes users [3, 12, 21] making them indistinguishable and finally, one {{that takes into account}} security policies defined by the users of the system [19, 22, 23].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyze {{a class of}} <b>location</b> <b>disclosure</b> in which <b>location</b> {{information}} from individuals is generated in an auto-mated way, i. e. is observed by a ubiquitous infrastructure. Since such information is valuable for both scientific research and commercial use, location information might {{be passed on to}} third parties. Users are usu-ally aware neither of the extent of the information disclosure (e. g. by carrying a mobile phone), nor how the collected data is used and by whom. In order to assess the expected privacy risk in terms of the possible extent of exposure, we propose an adversary model and a privacy met-ric that allow an evaluation of the possible privacy loss by using mobile communication infrastructure. Furthermore, a case study on the privacy effects of using GSM infrastructure was conducted with the goal of ana-lyzing the side effects of using a mobile handset. Based on these results requirements for a privacy-aware mobile handheld device were derived. ...|$|R
40|$|Location-sharing {{services}} {{have become increasingly}} popular {{with the proliferation of}} smartphones and online social networks. People share their locations with each other to record their daily lives or satisfy their social needs. At the same time, inappropriate <b>disclosure</b> of <b>location</b> information poses threats to people's privacy. One of the reasons why people fail to protect their location privacy is the difficulty of using the current mechanisms to manually configure location-privacy settings. Since people's location-privacy preferences are context-aware, manual configuration is cumbersome. People's incapability and unwillingness to do so lead to unexpected <b>location</b> <b>disclosures</b> that violate their location privacy. In this thesis, we investigate the feasibility of using recommender systems to help people protect their location privacy. We examine the performance of location-privacy recommender systems and compare it with the state-of-the-art. We also conduct online user studies to understand people's acceptance of such recommender systems and their concerns. We revise our design of the systems according to the results of the user studies. We find that user-based collaborative filtering can accurately recommend location-privacy preferences and outperform the state-of-the-art when training data are insufficient. From users' perspective, their acceptance of location-privacy recommender systems is affected by the openness and the context of recommendations and their privacy concerns about the systems. It is feasible to use data obfuscation or decentralisation to alleviate people's concerns and meanwhile keep the systems robust against malicious data attacks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Research {{shows that}} {{location}} based routing {{can improve the}} performance and efficiency of communication in mobile ad hoc networks. From another point of view, <b>disclosure</b> of <b>location</b> information can cause a serious privacy risk, especially in environments where different groups of nodes cannot fully trust each other. In this paper, we propose a protocol through which a wireless node can achieve config-urable location privacy by distributing location information with different levels of perturbations to different groups of nodes. To achieve this goal, polynomial based personal keys are deployed for group based location information access. A modified location based routing protocol with privacy aware-ness features is introduced.

30|$|The work in [1] applies {{obfuscation}} {{techniques to}} location information based on user’s privacy preferences. In our work, {{we do not}} attempt to tamper with location data, instead we allow users and administrators to define/use policies that rule the <b>disclosure</b> of <b>location</b> information for queries and notifications. The work in [21] assumes the existence of untrusted servers from which users want to hide their exact location; this is achieved by anonymizer nodes that reduce location precision to cloak spatial areas. In Jano, location servers are trusted, nevertheless, the two works could be combined with enriched support for policies. Cooperative sensing is addressed in [9]: user nodes submit sensing tasks to accessible mobile devices of other users. To ensure privacy, all communication is anonymized.

40|$|AbstractNearby friend {{discovery}} {{is a popular}} location based service (LBS), {{which allows you to}} discover nearby like-minded people, and make friends with them. The main privacy threat of this service is that the <b>disclosure</b> of <b>locations</b> leaves opportunities for stalkers. Although location privacy preservation in LBS has recently received much attention, few works have been done on privacy-aware nearby friend discovery, where people want to discover nearby friends without exposing their private locations to arbitrary strangers. Unlike most of other LBS services, nearby friend discovery needs to consider the privacy of both of the two communicating entities, i. e., the user who is searching for nearby people, and the user who is being discovered by others. This unique property makes it a great challenge to protect users’ location privacy while providing satisfactory service quality. This paper presents the first research addressing this issue by combining the location approximation technique and the homomorphic cryptography. We show that the proposed scheme provides formal privacy guarantees for the LBS users, and still achieves satisfactory quality of the LBS...|$|R
40|$|Accompanying {{the growing}} {{interest}} in emerging location based services has been an urgent but rather ambiguous concern shared among scholars, privacy advocates {{and the general public}} that enhanced safety will {{come at the expense of}} personal privacy. Precision tracking of mobile devices has raised the spectre of unwanted and pervasive surveillance from both state and commercial interests. This juxtaposition of public safety with fears over loss of privacy raises important questions about appropriate collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in the context of mobile phone services and network-enabled devices in general. This paper will report on findings from an ongoing study that is looking at initiatives to introduce location-based services for public safety in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It will address a number of aspects of these developments by drawing on official regulatory and policy sources.

Privacy issues pertaining to <b>location</b> <b>disclosure</b> {{have been considered}} in research and relevant design guidelines are emerging, however what location information a user actually “needs to know” has received little systematic analysis to date. In this paper we present results from a questionnaire study and a diary study considering location information need.

Finally, we summarize trends that are of interest to designers of location discourse applications. ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, Location Based Services (LBS) {{become more}} and more popular. According to the {{influence}} of the social network, users usually join social groups with their friend. In some group, user may want to be notified, if the user is geographically close to any users within the social group. Proximity Detection enable us to attain the goal. However, we are required to bear the risk of <b>disclosure</b> of <b>location</b> information, while we are enjoying the LBS. This privacy threat reduces the attractiveness of this kind of services. Previously, some papers contribute ideas to deal with this problem. Nevertheless, most of them assume that there is a trusted central server within their system, which is im-practical in the real world. The problem under our study is to continuously monitor if any two mobile users in a social group are within a distance of D. Meanwhile, the exact lo-cation of a mobile user is not disclosed to any third party. This paper propose a computationally feasible solution in this problem, which only disclose the approximate location of the user to the authorized party. Untrusted third party (including centralized server) is not able to know the users’ location. ...|$|R
40|$|Context-awareness enables {{applications}} to better streamline and personalize their service {{according to the}} current situation of the user. However, the user’s information used by context-aware applications, such as the user’s current location, is inherently private and sensitive. Using this information without proper control by the user can lead to privacy risks and might harm the trust users have in the context-aware application. To address this tradeoff between the effectiveness and privacy, we present Super-Ego, a framework for at-hoc management of access to location information in ubiquitous environment. Using this framework, we model and evaluate different decision strategies for managing mobile application’s access to location context. The strategies we test are based on automatic algorithms that use knowledge about historical <b>disclosure</b> of <b>locations</b> by large number of users, with the optional delegation {{of some of the}} decisions to the user.
