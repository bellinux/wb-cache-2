40|$|With the {{increasing}} recognition of high soil erosion rates, more U. S. farmers are adopting conservation tillage practices every year. Most {{of the conservation}} tillage systems require appreciable amounts of crop residue {{in order to control}} erosion. One of the problems of these systems {{is the fact that the}} residue interferes with the application of agricultural chemicals. Some of these chemicals cannot be used without soil incorporation cannot be easily incorporated without losing some of the soil protecting surface residue;To solve these problems, the corn residue managing machine was designed, constructed and tested. The development of this machine involved an initial design and four subsequent versions. In its final form the machine essentially consisted of picking fingers, an <b>inclined</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt, and a beater;This machine picks up the residue, raises it above the soil surface to 1. 04 m above the ground surface, and finally drops it again. This allows all required practices, including planting, fertilizer application, and herbicide incorporation to be done on the soil without losing crop residue cover;Properties of residue that affect its handling were investigated. A system describing residue properties was proposed and examples of typical field data were shown;A dimensional analysis study of the residue managing machine was performed. Relationships between machine picking ability and the independent variables were determined;Field performance testing showed that a maximum of 63 percent of the residue could be collected by this residue managing machine.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{was built}} at Prairie Swine Centre Inc. (PSCI) to study air quality in swine barns {{and its effect}} on pigs and people. The first focus of that research program was to design and test a manure handling system to control the air contamination from the excreta. The goal was to get close to zero air contamination from manure with these systems, in order to measure the contamination from other sources, and to also have a range of contamination levels for future health and productivity testing. Two manure handling systems were designed and tested: a washing gutter system with pressurized heated wash water periodically directed across the dunging area, and a washed <b>inclined</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt used directly as a dunging area. Ammonia emissions were used as a measure of the air contamination originating from the excreta in two experimental chambers. Ammonia originates only from the manure and is released quickly from any manure (especially urine) in contact with the air. Both systems were tested with 30 kg pigs at running time intervals of 30, 60 and 120 minutes. Trials lasted one week, with three trials completed at each frequency. The average ammonia emissions from the washing gutter and the conveyor belt systems were 48. 7 mg day- 1 kgpig- 1 and 57. 0 mg day- 1 kgpig- 1, respectively. Even though these emissions were 38 % and 47 % lower than previous observations from grower-finisher rooms with a pit plug design in the same swine building, both systems failed to give the desired “close-to-zero” contamination. This means another system will have to be found to totally eliminate air contamination from manure in the chambers when testing for the origin of the individual contaminants. There were no differences at a statistically significant level (P> 0. 05) between the ammonia emissions from the two manure handling systems or the three frequencies tested. However, the washing gutter system was simpler and easier to run, and is recommended for future studies dealing with the effects of different ranges of air quality on pigs and people...|$|E

40|$|Belt {{conveyors}} play {{an important}} role in continuous dry bulk material transport, especially at the mining industry. Speed control is expected to reduce the energy consumption of belt conveyors. Transient operation is the operation of increasing or decreasing conveyor speed for speed control. According to literature review, current research rarely takes the conveyor dynamics in transient operation into account. However, in belt conveyor speed control, the conveyor dynamic behaviors are significantly important since the poor dynamics might result in risks. In this paper, the potential risks in transient operation will be analyzed. An existing finite element model will be applied to build a conveyor model, and simulations will be carried out to analyze the conveyor dynamics. In order to realize the soft speed regulation, Harrison’s sinusoid acceleration profile will be applied, and Lodewijks estimator will be built to approximate the required acceleration time.

5000|$|The sugar {{storage shed}} was {{constructed}} in 1923. An electrical conveyor system was installed in the shed to move sugar bags to and from ships' holds and railway wagons, and was fully operational by 1926. The system consisted of an <b>inclined</b> covered <b>conveyor</b> extending from railway tracks {{on the west side}} of the shed up to the shed's roofline. This conveyor provided the linkage with the wharf railway system. A complicated set of conveyors and chutes was built into the roof of the sugar shed, and this system was used to stack bagged sugar at a rate of up to 80 tons per hour. A second conveyor extended between the roof of the sugar shed eastwards to the roof of number 4 wharf shed. This conveyor joined another in a T-configuration on the eastern side of the wharf shed's roof. The overhead conveyors from White's Shed to number 3 wharf were reconstructed in 1946, while maintenance and repairs to both [...] "shore and floating plant" [...] were made in 1947. The 27-year-old facility was apparently modernised during the overhaul. Two travelling gantry cranes moved up and down the number 4 wharf's edge, loading and unloading the sugar bags into ship's holds via a set of conveyors mounted on the gantry cranes and connected to the T-conveyor.|$|R
40|$|Belt {{conveyors}} can {{be partially}} loaded {{due to the}} variation of bulk material flow loaded onto the conveyor. Speed control attempts to reduce the belt conveyor energy consumption and to enable the green operations of belt conveyors. Current research of speed control rarely takes the conveyor dynamics into account so that speed control lacks applicability. Based on our previous research, this paper will provide an improved three-step method to determine the minimum speed adjustment time. This method can be summarized as Estimation-Calculation-Optimization and ECO in short. The ECO method takes both the potential risks and the conveyor dynamics into account. It is expected to keep belt conveyors in good dynamic behaviors in transient operations. After discussing the ECO method, this research takes a long <b>inclined</b> belt <b>conveyor</b> of an import dry bulk terminal as case study. Based on the suggested acceleration time, a speed controller is built and computational simulations are carried out to evaluate the energy savings and the conveyor dynamics. Experimental results prove that {{the application of the}} ECO method ensures the healthy dynamic performance of belt conveyors under speed control in transient operations. Annually, the average electricity consumption of the single conveyor can be reduced by over 10 % with around 90 tons reduction of emission. The direct economic benefit can reach up to more than € 10, 000 in terms of the electricity utilization per year. Accepted Author ManuscriptTransport Engineering and Logistic...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{problem of}} reducing energy consumption and dioxide {{emissions in the}} stage of construction and operation of mine belt conveyors is connected with their broad use in the industry. However, this notion is related to a reduction of electric energy consumption for conveyor drive and for production of conveyor components and assemblies (belts, rollers, load-bearing structure etc.). An essential role is played by an increased life of belt conveyors assemblies and components, principally belts. A reduced electric energy consumption results in a decreased CO 2 emissions, e. g. hard coal – fired power station issues 0. 28 kg CO 2 per production of 1 kWh, in to answer production of 1 t steel accounts for 3. 2 t CO 2 emissions.

40|$|Accurate coffee sorting is a {{response}} to pressures for product quality and to a growing market for specialty coffees. One of the major challenges in this regard is to prepare the raw coffee fruits for sorting in one-by-one electronic machines. In this paper, we present a mechanical device developed to separate clusters and impurities from the main process. The mechanical device consists of two <b>inclined</b> belt <b>conveyors</b> with upward motion, working in series. This arrangement conveys upwards any elements with more than three contact points on the belt’s flat surface, while quasi-spherical elements (fruits) roll down on the belts. The experimental set up was designed to allow each belt’s inclination and speed to vary, in order to run a 3 x 3 factorial treatment design (Three inclinations: 10 º, 14 º and 18 º and three speeds: 0. 17, 0. 20 and 0. 24 m s- 1). The belt transport surface material was PVC. The best performance was obtained at the speed of 0. 20 m s- 1 and between 10 º and 14 º of inclination. After these findings, three treatments were conducted at a working speed of 0. 20 m s- 1 and three inclinations between 10 º and 14 º, finding the best performance at 11 º. In these conditions the mean efficacy of separation was 98. 8 %, varying within a range between 97. 5 % and 100 %.
