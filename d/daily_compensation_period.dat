30|$|One {{could expect}} that the total WTA effect is lower if no <b>compensation</b> <b>period</b> is agreed. This is {{observed}} in comparison with a one-year <b>compensation</b> <b>period</b> and also but less in comparison with a longer <b>compensation</b> <b>period.</b> Therefore, the coefficient of the interaction WTA*noFCP is surprising. However, no fixed <b>compensation</b> <b>period</b> also includes cases of no restriction. Then, in practice, the horizon can be very long.|$|R
30|$|We {{limit the}} {{following}} interpretation to the FE results. First, {{only one of}} the interaction variables is found to have significant effects on the wage per employee. All WTA coefficients stay positive, as in Table  3, lines 1 and 2. The interaction variable reduces the pure WTA influences. In all specifications of the log(PROD) function the sum of the WTA coefficient and the coefficient of the interaction variable is larger than the WTA coefficient in Table  3. Short <b>compensation</b> <b>periods</b> have stronger effects than longer ones. In other words, the total WTA effects on productivity decrease with the length of <b>compensation</b> <b>periods.</b> From a first view, this does not seem plausible because longer <b>compensation</b> <b>periods</b> mean more flexibility. Then, it is only later necessary to balance positive credits because the <b>compensation</b> <b>period</b> has ended even though employees and the employer may prefer longer working time with the result of higher productivity. However, as the <b>compensation</b> <b>period</b> lengthens, the incentives to work harder decrease. In some sense, the time preference is effective. The earlier longer working hours are compensated by leisure, the more employees try to work well with a high intensity.|$|R
30|$|Finally, we {{investigate}} whether WTA effects differ between subgroups. On the one hand, we split firms into groups with {{high and low}} sales variability, as well as firms with a high share and a low share of skilled workers. On the other hand, based on the maximal agreed compensation duration of time credits and time debits, the effects are compared. We distinguish between the following <b>compensation</b> periods: <b>compensation</b> <b>period</b> up to one year, longer than one year, no fixed <b>compensation</b> <b>period.</b> The hypotheses are the following: (i) the stronger the fluctuations of the product demand, the more a firm benefits from WTA; (ii) the lower the share of skilled workers, the more negative profit effects can be expected; and (iii) the longer the <b>compensation</b> <b>period,</b> the more likely is it that actual working time matches the actual demand for labor.|$|R

The theoretical part discusses history of life insurance, its settings, parameters of potential clients and the procedure of signing contracts. The methodological part defines the hypotheses, the examined insurance product, used {{data and the}} method used to analyze them. The practical part explores statistical dependence between the parameters of Allianz's clients who signed life insurance contracts and the amounts of insurance they attributed to particular insured events. Six such parameters are examined which are derived from the details the clients provided age, sex, BMI, smoking, job type and disposable income adjusted for debt repayments.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{familiarize}} {{the reader with}} the topic of life insurance, especially insurance taken out for more people. Its focus is empirical rather as combining the use of several actuarial and statistical methods through three statistical software and applications created in MS Excel using VBA. First, thesis is focused to multiple life insurance with intention to show reader the diversity of this interesting but rarely offered product in business world, especially through the application created {{for the purpose of}} this work. Sense of mentioned application lies in the fact it is able to calculate amount of the net premium for a user-selected type of insurance. Based on this outcome insurer can determine the net price corresponding to the chosen risk coverage (regardless of the amount of the costs associated with this type of insurance and required profitability). Age of insured person isn't usually part of calculation of premium for accident insurance. One of the aims of this study is to assess whether this parameter actually has or doesn't have any effect on the price of insurance. With help of SPSS and RStudio software relationship between age of insured person and amount of indemnification from <b>daily</b> <b>compensation</b> insurance has been researched. Based on the test of variable independence were detected dependencies of these variables where all of which used measure of association suggests a weak dependence amount of indemnification on the age of the insured. It surely worth insurer should consider different insurance rates for various ages of insured person. Following by examination whether the rate used to calculate premiums in case of hospitalization extra insurance corresponds to the actual risk coverage. It has been calculated the rate could be lower than currently used due to the loss experience of insurance for the past 9 years and the assumption of certain expenses and desired profit. It would be cheaper for insurance group contracts than it is today, when the insurer has done so. It could also attract new clientele. The last stated goal in this thesis is to create prognosis of the amount of indemnity paid for injuries covered by additional <b>daily</b> <b>compensation</b> insurance. Using the software EViews is analyzed this trend in the past 32 months first. Based on its outcome there is a future level forecast created for the next four years. These resulting values indicate the insurance indemnity for group contract will grow. Therefore, based on this analysis insurer should to conclude in the contract it would be appropriate to increase the premium of the insurance coverage. With these practical tasks the reader can get idea not only of problems solved in the scope of multiple life insurance and group insurance but also to become familiar with some statistical software used for analyzes carried out not only in the insurance industry.

First, we discuss the impact of WTA on productivity not only during the Great Recession but also {{over a period of}} six years, including the recession period.

Second, we supplement the investigation of WTA effects on further important business indicators, especially with respect to the wages per employee, investments and profits. This provides us with insights about the question of whether WTA have positive effects on firm performance. Third, we investigate whether interaction effects of WTA with other influencing factors can be uncovered. Among others, we can indirectly show whether our results are in accordance with the two mentioned hypotheses. Fourth, a subgroup analysis is carried out. We show that the effects differ between establishments with a high share and a low share of skilled workers, between companies with strong and only weak sales fluctuations. Moreover, we present the effects of WTA under different agreements on the <b>compensation</b> <b>period</b> of time credits and debits within WTA regimes.

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the influence of betahistine dihydrochloride on vestibular compensation. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in Meniere's disease patients who underwent a curative unilateral vestibular neurotomy (UVN). The effects of betahistine treatment were investigated on a broad spectrum of vestibular-induced changes resulting from vestibular loss: body sway, head orientation, ocular cyclotorsion, spontaneous nystagmus, verticality perception, and self-evaluation of the postural stability. The time course of the recovery was compared in 16 patients who received either a placebo or betahistine (24 mg b. i. d.) from 3 days up to 3 months after UVN. Patients were examined before (day - 1) and after UVN (days 7, 30, and 90). Results indicate that betahistine reduces the time to recovery by 1 month or more depending on the tested functions. Betahistine was effective as soon as 4 days after treatment administration, and the effect remained during the whole <b>compensation</b> <b>period</b> (up to 3 months). The observed clinical effects may be attributed to an action of betahistine in rebalancing the neuronal activity between contralateral vestibular nuclei...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to measure, as a model of wasting in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), longitudinal body-composition changes in macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). METHODS: Twelve juvenile macaques were inoculated with SIVmac 239. Immunologic, virologic, somatometric, and dual-energy x-ray-absorptiometry measurements were performed prospectively every 4 weeks for 72 weeks and were compared to measurements taken from 8 uninfected control macaques. RESULTS: During the first 4 weeks, body-fat percentage decreased in the SIV-infected macaques while lean-tissue percentage increased; during weeks 4 - 72, these macaques lost a greater percentage of total fat tissue but had more subcutaneous-fat deposition than did the uninfected control macaques. Just prior to death, the SIV-infected macaques that died (n= 7) had a greater loss in body-mass index, abdominal fat, fat tissue, and lean tissue, compared with that in SIV-infected macaques that survived (n= 5). CONCLUSIONS: Body-composition changes in SIV-infected juvenile macaques exhibit 3 phases: during acute infection, loss of body weight from fat tissue; a <b>compensation</b> <b>period</b> during which macaques grow, but at a reduced rate; and a terminal phase, during which tissue is lost from all body compartments.

40|$|The Swedish {{welfare state}} has a social {{security}} system that covers many forms of income losses and gives a high compensation. Compensation is given for loss of income due to sick leave, parental leave, disability, work injury, unemployment and retirement at old age. But there are also complementing compensation systems. The most important ones are those decided by collective agreements between unions and employer associations. They are sometimes organized as an insurance, in other cases as an agreement that the employer should pay the compensation. There are also other forms of complements than those based on collective agreements, for example complementing unemployment insurances for members of unions. Even if the complements are organized in different ways, they add to the social insurances in {{more or less the}} same way.

Estimates of risk aversion based on the physical skewness and kurtosis of {{interest rate}} changes suggest that (minus) the volatility risk premium can almost directly be read as risk aversion, as its proportionality with such risk aversion measure is about 0. 8.

Ei. bicyclis usually grows in shallow water down to 8 - 10 m in the subiittoral zone. Ec. cava, on the other hand, occupies deeper water of 4 - 25 m or more. Allometric relationships between stipe length or diameter and weight of stipe, blade, and total frond were examined to obtain useful analytic characters for measuring the population structure. The regeneration of both marine forests were studied with the methods of permanent quadrat and mapping for 6 years. The regeneration process and turnover time were revealed as compared with those of terrestrial climax forests. The three phases of gap, building and mature were distinguished by reference to the structural and dynamic features of the population in the regeneration process. The turnover time was 5 - 6 years for the Ei. bicyclis population and 3 years for the Ec. cava population. The analysis of distributional patterns and production structures of Ei. bicyclis and Ec. cava populations suggested that there was significant intraspecific competition for getting light between the canopy fronds and recruits involving the same age groups. Young fronds of these species were growing under considerably low light conditions on the population floor. Critical light conditions for young Ei. bicyclis and. Ec. cava were examined on the population floor. The <b>daily</b> <b>compensation</b> light for young Ei. bicyclis and Ec. cava was calculated with mathematical models based on photosynthesis-light equations and natural light conditions. The estimated <b>daily</b> light <b>compensation</b> point did not conflict with the observed critical light under in situ light conditions. It was clear that young Ec. cava fronds can grow under lower in situ light intensity in deeper water than young Ei. bicyclis fronds. The demography was studied mainly for the Ec. cava population. The Weibull frequency distribution was used to analyze the factors regulating mortality from the survivor curve. The average life span of Ec. cava was 16. 5 months, and the maximum life span was 5 years, as indicated in life table. 褐藻類コンプ科に属するアラメおよびカジメは本邦暖海域に分布し， 1 - 3 mの高さになる大形海藻である。一般に アラメは潮間帯直下から水深 10 m付近まで，カジメは水深 4 m付近から 25 mもしくはそれ以探にまで分布する。 本研究は，群落の構造やその変動を解析することにより，アラメおよびカジメの種の特性を生態学的な見地から解明することを目的としたものである。 両種の群落構造を解析するための基準形質を得るため, 多くの個体について茎長，茎径，年齢, 乾重量等を測定し，各形質聞の相対生長関係を検討した。その結果，相関係数，測定の難易度を考慮して茎長を基準形質として採用した。 群落の更新課程を把握するため，アラメおよぴカジメ群落内に永久コドラートを設置し，個体の発生，死亡状況および茎長の伸長状況等を 6 年間にわたり連続的に測定した。カジメ群落では 3 年周期で成体群と幼体群の交代が行われるのに対し，アラメ群落では成体群が 5 － 6 年以上にわたって林冠を形成し続ける。また，分布様式の解析から，小形群の消長は，大形群の密度によって強く支配されることも明かとなった。 群落内の光環境と立体構造を明らかにするため，層別刈取り法により生産構造を求め，解析の基準資料とした。両種とも群落床部の光環境は林冠を形成する大形群の密度に強く支配され，大形個体の少ない群落では，床部の相対光強度は比鮫的高く，多数の小形個体が生育する。また，アラメ群落はカジメ群落に比べ葉重量が 3 － 4 倍多く，光は群落上層で急激に吸収され，小形群の出現や生長が著しく制御される。 光条件がアラメおよびカジメの分布や生長に及ぼす直接的な影響を明らかにするため，両種の幼体について生育場所の光環境，光合成特性，日射の日変化等を測定し，日補償点を推定するためのモデル式を作り，両種幼体の光環境からみた生育限界を解析した。推愛された日補償光強度を海面に対する相対光強度で表すと，アラメ幼体では 1. 1 ％, カジメ幼体では 0 ． 6 ％であった。これらの値は幼体の生育する群落床部の相対光分布の実測値とよく一致した。 カジメ群落について生存曲線や生命表を作成し，若齢時の死亡要因を検討した結果, 幼体の生長に伴う個体群密度の増加が原因となる種内競争が主な死亡要因と考えられ，また，アラメは奔命が 7 － 8 年と，カジメの 5 年に比べ明かに長く，長期にわたり大形個体が優占する群落せ形成し続けることが明かとなった。 以上の結果から，カジメはアラメに比べより弱光に適応しており，両種の光に対する適応の特性や寿命の相が， 両種群落の構造やその更新課程の違いに反映しているものと結論される...|$|R

Here we investigated how different growth trajectories affected subsequent locomotor performance, and how such effects {{were influenced by}} the perceived time until the key life-history event of reproduction. Using juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus, we show that {{a brief period of}} manipulated temperature in early life (independent of food supply) caused effects on skeletal growth trajectory not only during the manipulation itself, but also during a subsequent compensatory phase. The outcome of these changes was that fish in all treatment groups reached the same average size by sexual maturity, despite having different growth patterns. However, their growth trajectory had impacts on both pre-breeding swimming endurance and its decline {{over the course of the}} breeding season, such that swimming ability was negatively correlated with skeletal growth rate during the <b>compensation</b> <b>period.</b> We also show for the first time that negative compensation' (i. e. a decelerating growth trajectory) led to an improved swimming performance compared with steadily growing controls. Replicate experiments and photoperiod manipulations, moreover, revealed that the effects of growth rate on subsequent swimming performance were greater when the perceived time until the breeding season was shorter. These results show that the costs of accelerated or decelerated growth can last well beyond the time over which growth rates differ, and are affected by the time available until an approaching life history event such as reproduction, possibly because of the time available to repair the damag...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{feature of}} circadian clocks is temperature <b>compensation</b> of <b>period.</b> The free-running period of ritsu (timrit) (a novel allele of timeless [tim]) mutants is drastically lengthened in a temperature-dependent manner. PER and TIM protein levels become lower in timrit mutants as temperature becomes higher. This mutation reduces per mRNA but not tim mRNA abundance. PER constitutively {{driven by the}} rhodopsin 1 promoter is lowered in rit mutants, indicating that timrit mainly affects the per feedback loop at a posttranscriptional level. An excess of per+ gene dosage can ameliorate all rit phenotypes, including the weak nuclear localization of PER, suggesting that timrit affects circadian rhythms by reducing PER abundance and its subsequent transportation into nuclei as temperature increases...|$|R
