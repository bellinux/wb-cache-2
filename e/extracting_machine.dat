40|$|Many {{applications}} of Technology Enhanced Learning {{are based on}} strong assumptions: Knowledge needs to be standardized, structured {{and most of all}} externalized into learning material that preferably is annotated with meta-data for efficient re-use. A vast body of valuable knowledge does not meet these assumptions, including informal knowledge such as experience and intuition that is key to many complex activities. We notice that knowledge, even if not standardized, structured and externalized, can still be observed through its application. We refer to this observable knowledge as PRACTICED KNOWLEDGE. We propose a novel approach to Technology Enhanced Learning named MACHINE TEACHING to convey this knowledge: Machine Learning techniques are used to <b>extract</b> <b>machine</b> models of Practiced Knowledge from observational data. These models are then applied in the learner’s context for his support. We identify two important subclasses of machine teaching, General and Detailed Feedback Machine Teaching.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{nondestructive}} machine fault detection, based on evaluation of acoustic machine signatures, is presented. Various mechanical defects of rotary machines can {{be reflected in}} altered acoustic signatures. Such phenomena can be often perceived by skilled human operators who can also explain the type of defect merely based on slightly changed acoustic signature. The proposed method is based on psychoacoustic modeling of human auditory perception. For the purpose of machine fault detection, the gammatone filterbank is applied in preprocessing of acoustic signals. Filtered signals are then rectified, and features are calculated as mean values of rectified signals. A set of features represents an <b>extracted</b> <b>machine</b> signature. In order to evaluate the current <b>machine</b> state, <b>extracted</b> features are compared to the database of normal machine states. If values of the extracted features exceed statistically determined upper and lower margins, a possible machine fault is indicated. The proposed approach is illustrated by a case study, where the quality of commercially produced compressors is predicted. Compressor states are estimated based on acoustic emission during operation, and features are extracted by psychoacoustic filtering as described above. Results show that major faults, that occur in a production, can be reliably detected...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the feasibility of utilizing the multi-scale analysis and support vector machine (SVM) classification scheme to diagnose the bearing faults in rotating machinery. For complicated signals, the characteristics of dynamic systems may not be apparently observed in a scale, particularly for the fault-related features of rotating machinery. In this research, the multi-scale analysis is employed to extract the possible fault-related features in different scales, such as the multi-scale entropy (MSE), multi-scale permutation entropy (MPE), multi-scale root-mean-square (MSRMS) and multi-band spectrum entropy (MBSE). Some of the features are then selected as the inputs of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier through the Fisher score (FS) as well as the Mahalanobis distance (MD) evaluations. The vibration signals of bearing test data at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) are utilized as the illustrated examples. The analysis results demonstrate that an accurate bearing defect diagnosis can be achieved by using the <b>extracted</b> <b>machine</b> features in different scales. It can be also noted that the diagnostic results of bearing faults can be further enhanced through the feature selection procedures of FS and MD evaluations...|$|R

30|$|One hundred kilo Newton servo {{controlled}} {{universal testing machine}} (Make: FIE–BLUESTAR, India, Model: UNITEK 94100) was employed to evaluate the transverse tensile properties of the FSW and UWFSW joints. The tensile specimens were <b>extracted,</b> <b>machined</b> and tested as per the ASTM E 8 M guidelines. Before testing, the samples were flattened to ensure the equal cross-sectional area along the entire gauge length of the specimen. The tensile properties such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation were evaluated. The {{cross section of the}} tensile tested samples were polished and etched to reveal the entire fracture path using optical microscope. The tensile fracture path was identified by the macro-structural analysis. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to characterize the fracture surfaces. Hydraulic-controlled Vickers microhardness tester (Make: Shimadzu and model: HMV- 2 T) was used to measure the microhardness along the cross section of the weld joint. The indentations were made under the load of 4.9  N for a dwell time of 15  s. The single hardness profile was obtained along the mid-thickness region with the indentation of 1  mm spacing. The correlation between the entire fracture path and the LHDR cannot be agreed from the single hardness profile. Hence, the hardness distribution maps were obtained by indenting along five test lines which are 1  mm spacing along the thickness direction. In each test lines, 25 indentations were made and a total of 125 indentations were made to obtain the hardness distribution map.|$|R
