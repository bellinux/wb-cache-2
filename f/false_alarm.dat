5|$|During the War of 1812, {{during the}} summer of 1812 or 1813, Alder was elected captain of a company of 70 men formed in Plain City. With Frederick Loyd as his lieutenant, Alder's company was ordered by the Governor to march about twenty miles north and build a {{blockhouse}} at Mill Creek, about three miles north of Marysville, Ohio, to protect the Darby settlements. The company built and garrisoned the blockhouse for a few weeks, but when a <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> was sounded regarding Indians attacking the settlements, the men returned to their homes.

5|$|German {{ground forces}} {{crossed the border}} at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Reichsleiter Joseph Goebbels, {{announced}} the declaration of war at 06:00. Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> when they reported the approach of an air raid {{from the direction of}} Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based Fliegerführer Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air.

5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up into the trees.

5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this note {{is to reduce the}} <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> in multivariate statistical process control (MSPC). The issue of <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> is inherent within MSPC {{as a result of the}} definition of control limits. It has been observed that under normal operating conditions, the occurrence of “out-of-control ” data, i. e. <b>false</b> <b>alarms,</b> conforms to a Bernoulli distribution. Therefore this issue can be formally addressed by developing a Binomial distribution for the number of “out-of-control ” data points within a given time window, and a second-level control limit can be established to reduce the <b>false</b> <b>alarms.</b> This statistical approach is further extended to consider the combination of multiple control charts. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through its application to the monitoring of a benchmark simulated chemical process, and it is observed to effectively reduce the <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> whilst retaining the capability of detecting process faults...|$|R
40|$|<b>False</b> <b>alarms</b> {{occur when}} animals flee {{abruptly}} upon detection {{of a threat}} that subsequently proved harmless. <b>False</b> <b>alarms</b> are common in many species of birds and mammals and account for a surprisingly high proportion of all <b>alarms.</b> <b>False</b> <b>alarms</b> {{are expected to be}} more frequent in larger groups, where the odds of misclassifying threats are higher, and under environmental conditions where detection of threats is compromised, such as low light levels. In addition, <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> should be less frequent when the energetic cost of fleeing increases. I examined these hypotheses in roosting flocks of staging semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) over 2 years. <b>False</b> <b>alarms</b> increased with group size but the effect of group size was confounded by the fact that more attacks by falcons (Falco spp.) were directed at larger roosts. <b>False</b> <b>alarms</b> were more frequent at low light levels and later during staging. As individuals double their body mass during staging, the energetic cost of fleeing must greatly increase thus contributing to decreased responsiveness. A simple reduction in responsiveness caused by repeated exposures to harmless signals would also produce a temporal decrease in responsiveness but this hypothesis cannot account for the effect of group size and light level. Study of the determinants of <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> provides an opportunity to examine adjustments in behavior in relation to changes in perceived predation risk.

30|$|Importantly, both {{increased}} vWMC {{and higher}} accuracy {{in the high}} prevalence search performance predicted fewer <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> in the low prevalence search task, and the remaining predictor variables were not significant predictors of <b>false</b> <b>alarms.</b> This finding that the predictors associated with better low prevalence target detection were also associated with fewer <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> suggests that these factors predict an increase in sensitivity, rather than only {{a shift in the}} decision criterion for responding “target present”.|$|R
5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, Monarch {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. Following the outbreak of World War I in August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. On 8 August, Monarch was conducting gunnery practice south-east of Fair Isle when she was unsuccessfully attacked by a submarine-fired torpedo. This was probably a <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> as the area was too far to the west of the German U-boats' patrol zones to be likely. , however, has been suggested as a candidate for the attack, although the boat was sunk the following day with the loss of all hands and the truth will never be known.|$|E
5|$|Black drongos {{become active}} very early {{at dawn and}} roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They {{sometimes}} fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields that are being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common mynas, cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas. It is said that they imitate {{the call of the}} Shikra so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> calls, has been noted in the fork-tailed drongo. There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, or maybe even bats. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as Erythrina and Bombax may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed late in the evening or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.|$|E
5|$|Nicole's {{biological}} parents were the teenage Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) and Natalie Franklin (Adrienne Pickering), {{but she was}} raised by her maternal grandparents and considered her mother, Natalie, as an older sister. She did not meet her father until her early teenage years. Nicole arrives in Summer Bay in a flashy car. She initially makes herself unpopular with her bitchy care-free nature. She tries to sleep with Aden but he rebuffs her. She makes a bet with Aden that she can sleep with Geoff Campbell (Lincoln Lewis) within two weeks, but Geoff and Belle publicly humiliate her when they find out. Nicole starts dating Roman's old SAS friend Mark's brother Elliot Gillen, despite Roman's disapproval. After breaking up with Elliot, he takes her diving where he tries to kill her, Geoff and later Roman. Geoff tries to save Nicole, but Elliot leaves the pair stranded at sea. They wash up on a remote island and Geoff and Nicole grow close to each other. Geoff, who has strong religious views, sleeps with Nicole as they cannot fight temptation. When rescued Geoff proposes to Nicole out of guilt, she turns him down. She later has a pregnancy scare but is happy to discover it was a <b>false</b> <b>alarm.</b> Nicole later decides she and Geoff should return to the island to repair their relationship.

40|$|Abstract. Failure {{location}} in transparent optical networks {{is difficult because}} of corrupted alarms and {{the large amount of}} alarms that a failure can trigger.

In this work, we show that for a network with binary alarms (alarms are either present or not), there is an asymmetry between <b>false</b> and missing <b>alarms.</b> We prove that <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> can be corrected in polynomial time but the correction of missing alarms is NP-hard.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} tufted capuchin monkeys use terrestrial predator alarm {{calls in a}} functionally deceptive manner to distract conspecifics when feeding on contestable resources, although {{the success of this}} tactic is limited because listeners frequently ignore these calls when given in such situations. While this decreased response rate is suggestive of a counterstrategy to deception by receivers, the proximate factors underpinning the behavior are unclear. The current study aims to test if the decreased response rate to alarm calls in competitive contexts is better explained by the perception of subtle acoustic differences between predator-elicited and deceptive <b>false</b> <b>alarms,</b> or by receivers varying their responses based on {{the context in which the}} signal is received. This was tested by first examining the acoustic structure of predator-elicited and deceptive <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> for any potentially perceptible acoustic differences, and second by comparing the responses of capuchins to playbacks of each of predator-elicited and <b>false</b> <b>alarms,</b> played back in noncompetitive contexts. The results indicate that deceptive <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> and predator-elicited alarms show, at best, minimal acoustic differences based on the structural features measured. Likewise, playbacks of deceptive <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> elicited antipredator reactions at the same rate as did predator-elicited alarms, although there was a nonsignificant tendency for <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> to be more likely to elicit escape reactions.

25|$|Constant <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> rate, {{a form of}} {{automatic}} gain control (AGC), is a method that relies on clutter returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest.

In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver.
