As Randolph hears more of their life in Winnebago, he [...] "began to realize...the difficulties {{in the way of}} 'cultivating' Cope. Cope was a field already occupied, a niche already filled."(251) Joe asks what the girls, Mrs. Phillips, and even Randolph see in Cope, replies:(256) Don't ask me why they care....Why does anybody care? And for what? For the thing that is just out of reach. He's cool; he's selfish; he's indifferent. Yet, somehow, frost and fire <b>join</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> and make the circle complete.[...].It's all like children straining upward for an icicle, and presently slipping, with cracked pates, on the ice below. Randolph suggests Joe has found Cope appealing in some way as well, Joe objects harshly. Randolph prefers not to answer than to argue in his defense. Randolph, as a favor to Cope, helps Arthur find a job in a university office.|$|E
40|$|Mouse kidney {{cells have}} been {{transformed}} by linear BK virus (BKV) DNA with cohesive ends. These BKV genomes can circularize and subsequently replicate or physically <b>join</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> yielding oligomeric viral DNA molecules. Blot hybridization analysis of transformed cells showed the presence of BKV DNA both in free circular forms and integrated into cellular DNA in a tandem head-to-tail array of full-length viral genomes. Formation of oligomers either by replication via previous circularization or by end to end joining is hindered after elimination of cohesive termini by digestion with the single-strand-specific nuclease S 1. After treatment of linear BKV DNA with nuclease S 1 only integrations of single viral genomes were observed in transformed cells; tandem insertions and free viral DNA were absent. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} formation of tandems of free viral DNA is a necessary prerequisite for tandem integration of viral genomes...|$|E

40|$|Uropathogenic Escherichia coli produce heteropolymeric surface fibers called P pili, which {{present an}} adhesin at their tip that {{specifically}} recognizes globoside receptors on the host uroepithelium. The initial attachment step {{is thought to}} be essential for pathogenesis. P pili are composite fibers consisting of a thin tip fibrillum <b>joined</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> a rigid helical rod. Here we show that the ordered assembly of these structures requires the activity of two proteins that are minor components of the tip fibrillum, PapF and PapK. PapF is required for the correct presentation of the adhesin at the distal end of the tip fibrillum. PapK regulates the length of the tip fibrillum and joins it to the pilus rod. We propose that these subunits function as adaptors, by providing complementary surfaces to different substructures of the pilus and promoting their proper associations. In addition, the conversion of chaperone-subunit complexes into pili depends on PapF and PapK since a papF- papK- double mutation abolishes piliation. We suggest that in addition to the adaptor functions of PapF and PapK, they are also required to initiate the formation of tip fibrillae and pilus rods...|$|R

Xylem tissue is organized in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are <b>joined</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity.

40|$|New {{buckling}} interaction {{results are}} presented for skew plates and prismatic assemblies of plates, which illustrate the influence of continuity over supports {{for a range of}} aspect-ratio and loading combinations. The work follows from initial comparisons (York and Williams, 1995) with those in the literature for isolated plates and stiffened benchmark panels, consisting of prismatic assemblies of plates. The analysis method, which is an enhancement to the existing computer program VICONOPT, is based on an ‘exact’ analytical solution using Classical Plate Theory. This accounts for an infinitely long prismatic plate assembly supported at regular intervals over supports with general skew angle, alpha, forming a series of skew plates or plate assemblies <b>joined</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end.</b> This modelling can be described as exhibiting uni-axial continuity.

A large space outside these flue walls but inside the boiler casing was used as an air duct from the air inlet, a crude rectangular slot beneath the smokebox door, which had the effect of both pre-heating the combustion air and also cooling the outer casing to prevent overheating. Longitudinal superheater tubes were placed between the steam generating tubes. The third area forwards contained superheater headers, the regulators and the smokebox.

We {{have investigated the}} morphology of lamellar polystyrene-polymethylmetha-crylate diblock copolymers in the ultrathin-lm limit, spin-cast and annealed on silicon nitride substrates.

40|$|The method {{developed}} for the total synthesis of a given DNA containing biologically specific sequences consists of the following. The DNA in the double-stranded form is carefully divided into short single-stranded segments with suitable overlaps in the complementary strands. All the segments are chemically synthesized starting with protected nucleosides and mono-nucleotides. The 5 ′-OH ends of the appropriate oligonucleotides are then phosphorylated {{with the use of}} [γ- 32 P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. A few to several neighboring oligonucleotides are then allowed to form bihelical complexes in aqueous solution, and the latter are <b>joined</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> by polynucleotide ligase <b>to</b> form covalently linked duplexes.

40|$|Recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{have placed}} {{the root of}} flowering plants near Amborella trichopoda, a woody plant restricted to cloud forest habitats in New Caledonia. A distinctive feature of A. trichopoda is its reported lack of xylem vessels. Here we present observations of pit membrane structure and end wall morphology for primary and secondary tracheary cells of A. trichopoda as well as field measurements of stem hydraulic properties of A. trichopoda compared with five cloud forest species from New Caledonia. Observations of stem radial sections revealed that the primary wall material in the protoxylem and metaxylem elements was intact. No large porosities (such as {{those that have been}} observed in the pit membranes of Nymphaeales) were observed. However, a few elliptical pits of tracheary cells in the secondary xylem appeared to lack pit membranes. These observations are consistent with our measurements of functional conduit length, which indicate that the longest open conduits are equal to the length of two secondary xylem elements <b>joined</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end.</b> Thus, the xylem of A. trichopoda appears to be functionally vesselless, with the caveat that connections between individual vascular elements may occasionally be open (i. e., lacking in at least one pit membrane).

This report describes the design and construction of the shock tunnel and discusses its hypersonic simulation capabilities.

The driven gas is air, usually at room temperature and pressure. Successful evacuation of the test section to 5 microns of mercury has been achieved. The shock tunnel {{has been designed to}} produce air at minimum stagnation temperature and pressure of 4200 °R and 2300 psi respectively and 0 maximum stagnation temperature and pressure of 14300 °R and 20, 000 psi respectively 1 at the nozzle entrance.
