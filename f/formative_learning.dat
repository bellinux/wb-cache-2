40|$|The study {{examined}} two aspects, namely {{the quality of}} peer feedback in asynchronous discussion forum when such peer feedback {{is used as a}} <b>formative</b> <b>learning</b> tool, i. e. not for assigning grades; and students’ perceptions about the process of peer feedback. Twenty four students enrolled in higher education were involved. They were assigned two tasks. In the first task, they contributed lessons learnt about the course on the learning management system, Moodle, via the asynchronous discussion forum. Thereafter they read the comments posted by their colleagues and critiqued them. In the final task that was given {{at the end of the}} course, students wrote reflections about peer feedback process. Thus all data collected were in the form of posts. Using NVivo, the posts generated in the first task were used to examine the quality of peer feedback, while the posts generated from students’ reflection about peer feedback were used to examine students’ perceptions about peer feedback. Results indicate that peer feedback is a useful tool for <b>formative</b> <b>learning</b> as well as assessment purposes. Future research could involve a larger sample, a diverse population, and a range of other courses. </span...|$|E

40|$|Educators and {{researchers}} have long {{recognized the importance}} of <b>formative</b> feedback for <b>learning.</b> <b>Formative</b> feedback helps learners understand where they are in a learning process, what the goal is, and how to reach that goal. While experimental and observational research has illuminated many aspects of feedback, modern interactive learning environments provide new tools to understand feedback and its relation to various learning outcomes. Specifically, as learners use tutoring systems, educational games, simulations, and other interactive learning environments, these systems store extensive data that record the learner’s usage traces. The data can be modeled, mined and analyzed to address questions including when is feedback effective, what kinds of feedback are effective, and whether there are individual differences in seeking and using feedback. Such an empirical approach can be valuable on its own, and it may be especially powerful when combined with theory, experimentation or design-based research. The findings create an opportunity to improve feedback in educational technologies and to advance the learning sciences...|$|R

40|$|The {{requirement}} for commencing higher education students to apply principles of attribution {{in their early}} academic writing frequently creates frustration both for students and academic teaching staff. Teachers often provide information on the necessity of attribution, and considerable detail on the mechanics of how to reference, and express frustration at the failure of some students to demonstrate this in their writing. In turn, many students appear overwhelmed and confused by the expectations placed on them as early academic writers. This paper explores these expectations and questions current assessment practices, advocating {{a longer period of}} <b>formative</b> <b>learning</b> before students are required to competently and accurately apply attribution principles and referencing conventions in their writing. Using the threshold concept framework (Meyer & Land, 2005), it suggests viewing attribution as a ‘conceptual gateway’ through which students must pass in becoming academic writers, and explores some implications of this for teaching, learning and assessment. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the ways by which student {{learning}} improvement and the self-regulation of learning are possible through the use of quality formative assessment in the teaching of a university course. In recent years, researchers in educational assessment are showing an increased interest to the improvement of learning resulting from the use of formative assessment. Formative assessment is generally recognised as an improvement oriented assessment. It is believed to result in instructional effectiveness. Quality formative assessment includes formative feedback, self-assessment and peer assessment. Previous studies show the contribution of each of these quality <b>formative</b> assessments to <b>learning</b> improvement. However, less attention has been given to studying the combined effect of quality <b>formative</b> assessments on <b>learning</b> improvement. On the other hand, the predominant use of summative assessment remains a challenge to the improvement in instruction. Thus, the question was to determine the extent to which the use of quality <b>formative</b> assessment improves <b>learning.</b> The literature review in this study show an over reliance upon summative assessment in the context of higher education classrooms. There is also recognition in that <b>formative</b> assessment improves <b>learning</b> and enhances self-regulation. This study followed a mixed-methods research design of the type partially mixed sequential and applied a quasi-experimental intervention, where the educators used quality formative assessment on lessons with the students in the intervention group. The quasiexperimentation was implemented with 378 (214 male and 164 female) first year students of three universities enrolled for “General Psychology” course and six educators who were teaching the course. The students in this study were taken from intact classes, because this is possible in quasi experimental research. Data for the quantitative part of the study were generated using a structured questionnaire and achievement tests. Interviews with the educators, focus group discussions with the students, and classroom observations were used to generate data for the qualitative phase of study. The pretestposttest scores as well as the students’ perceptions on self-regulating learning were compared between the intervention (N = 191) and the comparison (N = 187) groups. The quantitative analysis used different inferential statistics, which proved the presence of statistically significant variations between the intervention and comparison groups for the outcome measures (posttest achievement and perception about self-regulating learning). Although the qualitative study showed the presence of positive perceptions towards quality formative assessment, the practice was found to be inconsistent. Perhaps, this may be because of the predominantly summative assessment tradition and the reluctance to use quality formative assessment. Finally, recommendations were made to promote the use of quality formative assessment aiming at the improvement and the self-regulation on learning. Curriculum and Instructional StudiesD. Ed.

40|$|Key words. Surveying education, student learning, {{dissertation}} research, feedback studies, <b>formative</b> <b>learning.</b> SUMMARY According to George and Cowan (1999) student {{feedback is}} essential to enable lecturers to understand whether attempts to improve learning and educational experience lead to improvement. Current UK practice uses end of module questionnaires to feedback levels of satisfaction (Cowan, 2002). There are inherent weaknesses, namely that it seldom leads to a change for that particular cohort of students, secondly it relies on uncorroborated opinion, and may derive from superficial feedback from a minority of students with the remainder suffering from questionnaire fatigue. Finally the data may not be especially relevant to a particular module, a particular weakness (Heywood, 2000). Using principles identified by Angelo and Cross (1993), this research adopted a methodology to formatively evaluate student perceptions and levels of satisfaction with the dissertation module. Using a cohort of Building Surveying students at Sheffield Hallam University, in England, views on course materials, the use of Blackboard software, the workshops and th...|$|E

40|$|Although several Australian Schools of Education have {{embedded}} {{types of}} work-integrated learning (WIL) in their courses {{for a number}} of years (Patrick et al. 2008), more recent issues around employability, insufficient interaction between university and industry, and need for engagement and blending of academic learning with workplace experience (Goulter, 2007) has lead to a growth in WIL or industry-based learning. This paper presents the process a team of lecturers undertook to connect and assess university and professional experiences within the Graduate Diploma of Education. Guided by the Innovative Research Universities WIL principles (2008) of policy, pedagogy and curriculum issues, and partnerships; Billett's (2009) notion of criticality in WIL; and Zeichner's (2010) hybrid spaces, we created innovative assessment, and embedded the e-portfolio as an authentic learning and assessment task to capture WIL and evidence of trans <b>formative</b> <b>learning</b> in the university and professional experience assessment.

40|$|Formative {{assessment}} is about strengthening {{student learning and}} can dramatically improve student achievement when it guides changes in day-to-day classroom practice. Any attempt to understand formative assessment must therefore be grounded in a notion of learning, which this paper approaches from a constructivist/experiential perspective.
