Savinio founded the musical movement Sincerismo (Sincerism) this same year. Sincerismo largely abandoned polyphony and harmony in favor of dissonance and rhythm as its primary musical characteristics. That year also saw the publication of [...] (The Songs of Half-Death), a dramatic poem including original illustrations and a piano suite accompaniment, both also created by Savinio. [...] was written primarily in French, but also included passages written in Italian. The poem consisted of a single act, containing four loosely linked scenes. Les Chants de la mi-mort dealt largely with the concept of sleep (interpretatively referred to as [...] "The Half Death") and was filled with odd, mechanical toy-like characters.

Furthermore, optimal placement <b>of</b> <b>dummy</b> symbols {{to minimize}} the associated PAPR of an OFDM symbol depends on various factors such as, the information loaded in the active subcarriers, power distribution to the dummy symbols and the phase information <b>of</b> these <b>dummies.</b> This calls for online update of the placement <b>of</b> these <b>dummy</b> symbols for each transmitted OFDM symbol which increases the complexity especially for a system with large number of guard subcarriers.

Nevertheless, {{as far as we know}} from the literature, studies do not consider the limits of the sensors in term of motion speed, position of the sensor on the robot, etc. In this work, we propose to provide a corpus dedicated to low level RGB-D algorithms benchmarking. Originality of our approach is the use <b>of</b> <b>dummies</b> in order to play static users in the environment.

30|$|TR {{technique}} {{is one of}} the promising approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems[5, 23 – 25], where the transmitter mitigates the PAPR problem by sending dummy symbols (i.e., symbols not conveying information) in some reserved subcarriers[26]. The advantages of TR-based schemes {{is that there is no}} specific PAPR reduction information that needs to be communicated to the receiver. However, one problem with TR techniques lies on the computationally efficient determination <b>of</b> <b>dummy</b> symbols that effectively minimizes the PAPR[23]. The amount of PAPR reduction depends on some factors such as location <b>of</b> the <b>dummy</b> symbols, number <b>of</b> <b>dummy</b> symbols, and allowed power on these dummy symbols.|$|R

In a series of field tests with four artificially triggered avalanches, we compared the effect of additional safety equipment. We measured burial depth and visibility <b>of</b> <b>dummies</b> equipped with two different brands of avalanche airbags (ABS and Snowpulse), the avalanche ball and <b>of</b> <b>dummies</b> with no additional equipment. The burial depth <b>of</b> <b>dummies</b> equipped with an airbag was significantly lower compared to dummies which carried an avalanche ball or no additional equipment. Moreover, based on a qualitative validation the airbag systems were rated better than dummies without airbag. Both brands of airbags and the avalanche ball were visible in all cases {{on the surface of}} the avalanche deposits – partly due to the avalanche size and the path topography. Acceleration measurements at the head <b>of</b> the <b>dummies</b> suggest that the risk of injury may be reduced with an appropriate form of the airbag...|$|R
