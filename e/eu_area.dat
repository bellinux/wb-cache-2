Still, Swedish unskilled employees are well paid while well educated Swedish employees are low-paid compared with those in competitor countries in Western Europe and the US. The average increases in real wages in recent years have been high by historical standards, in large part due to unforeseen price stability. Even so, nominal wages in recent years have been slightly above those in competitor countries. Thus, while private-sector wages rose by an average annual rate of 3.75% from 1998 to 2000 in Sweden, the comparable increase for the <b>EU</b> <b>area</b> was 1.75%.

In turn, this blurs the distinction between actual money (i.e. hard cash) and ideal money, or between real and ideal prices.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the main features}} of a model developed for forecasting economic developments, energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions in the <b>EU</b> <b>area</b> and Finland {{as well as for}} simulating the economic impacts of EU climate policy. Climate policy analysis necessitates a model of the whole <b>EU</b> <b>area,</b> because CO 2 emissions of the <b>EU</b> <b>area</b> emission trading sector determine the demand and price of emission allowances. The main conclusion from model simulations is that output and employment losses induced by EU climate policy in 2008 - 2012 will be more severe in a small open energy intensive economy like Finland than {{in the rest of the}} <b>EU</b> <b>area.</b> The negative impacts of EU climate policy on export competitiveness, exports and output volume in Finland will be strongest in the energy intensive industrial sec-tors which belong to the EU emission trading sector. greenhouse gas emissions, economic impacts of emission reduction...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{environment}} protection gained much more significance {{in designing the}} economic policies in the European Union (EU) countries. There are many economic and policy differences between the European countries, despite of the harmonization process inside the <b>EU</b> <b>area.</b> The path of implementation of the environmental tax reforms in the EU countries differs greatly {{from one country to}} another and the effects of such taxation in the economic and environmental areas are manifold. The authors of this paper have agreed to undertake the task of testing the double dividend hypothesis of the environmental taxation in Romania (an energy-intensive country) versus the <b>EU</b> <b>area</b> as a whole, using Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) techniques and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimations. Our findings show that this hypothesis is validated neither in Romania (in the economic growth area) nor in the <b>EU</b> <b>area</b> as a whole (in the unemployment area). Therefore, Romania cannot increase the level of the environmental tax for supporting economic growth, but it can grant environmental subsidies for decreasing the emissions and supporting the economic growth. This could be achieved by expanding the tax labor base and by collecting higher budgetary revenues to sustain such environmental subsidies. As far as the <b>EU</b> <b>area</b> is concerned, it is a necessary measure to continue the descending trend for the labor taxation to achieve the goal of improving the employment rate...|$|E

40|$|Research Objective The {{objective}} of the research {{is to find out}} how well <b>EU</b> <b>area</b> listed firms comply with the requirements of goodwill impairment testing mandated by the IFRS 3 and IAS 36 standards. More specifically, the hypothesized relationship between recorded goodwill impairment losses and future operational cash flows is being examined. An attempt is made to study how recorded goodwill impairment losses are linked to underlying economics. Sample Data and Research Methods Sample data consists of financial and earnings data for <b>EU</b> <b>area</b> listed companies during years 2006 - 2008. Sample data is gathered from Thomson One Banker Worldscope and Datastream databases. The utilized research methods are descriptive analysis and regression analysis. Results The results of the estimated regression model show that recorded goodwill impairment losses are not fully associated with underlying economics. Weak evidence was found suggesting that <b>EU</b> <b>area</b> firms might be managing fair value estimates when conducting goodwill impairment testing. Possible explanations for the missing association between recorded goodwill impairment losses and underlying economics are untimely recording of goodwill impairment losses, challenges in impairment testing due to global financial crisis and earnings management. Following possible motives are identified for managing fair value estimates when conducting goodwill impairment testing: income smoothing, big bath –theory, signaling effect, meeting the covenant requirements, utilizing tax shield and unrealized expected synergy benefits...|$|E
