40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} the {{community}} health promotion project is to collaborate with community partners to promote human immunodeficiency virus (<b>HIV)</b> awareness <b>and</b> screening among high-risk populations. Background. HIV infection is prevalent among high-risk populations including intravenous drug users, commercial sex workers and {{men who have sex}} with men. Routine HIV screenings can lead to early detection of <b>HIV</b> infection <b>and</b> prevent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and promote health. However, the overall rate of HIV screening is still low among high-risk populations. Barriers to screening include fear and stigma associated with requesting/seeking <b>HIV</b> screening <b>and</b> lack of patient and public education about HIV. Project Description. From August to December 2015, senior nursing students in a baccalaureate program collaborated with several community organizations to plan <b>and</b> implement an <b>HIV</b> awareness <b>and</b> screening promotion project among high-risk populations. Students designed <b>and</b> distributed <b>HIV</b> educational materials including flyers, posters, and surveys in downtown of a northwest city, at a local behavioral health center, and on campus of a state university. Students also conducted <b>HIV</b> screening <b>and</b> education at the local behavioral health center and on the state university campus. Outcomes. Students screened and educated 97 individuals in the community. Through the community health promotion project, students promoted <b>HIV</b> awareness <b>and</b> screening among high risk populations. Conclusions. Collaboration with community partners is an effective way to promote <b>HIV</b> prevention <b>and</b> screening. Future <b>HIV</b> prevention <b>and</b> screening should involve community partners with emphasis on <b>HIV</b> education <b>and</b> prevention...|$|R

40|$|This {{monograph}} (No. 06) {{reports on}} the systematic review of harm reduction.

There is substantial evidentiary support for NSP – as an efficacious, effective and cost-effective intervention. There is also good evidentiary support for outreach. The other harm reduction interventions (supervised injecting facilities, non-injecting routes of administration, overdose prevention, and brief interventions) do not currently have a sufficiently large body of research knowledge to draw strong conclusions.

40|$|The global HIV {{epidemic}} is fuelling an extraordinary increase in tuberculosis (TB) cases, {{and in the}} number of patients co-infected with both diseases.

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, <b>HIV,</b> <b>and</b> other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E

He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E
