5|$|Generally, Banai's {{birth is}} not {{discussed}} in the folk songs. Few regard her as an avatar of the apsara (celestial nymph) Rambha, while others consider her {{as one of the}} seven daughters of Indra, the king of the gods. She is found by a Dhangar in a golden box in the forest, hidden in a termite mound or a pit. Her Dhangar father (sometimes named Yamu) is the chief of shepherds, who owns nine lakh sheep and goats, nine lakh lambs and numerous barren ones. Yamu is said to have prayed for a child and finds Banai in a box. A virgin ewe is said to have fed Banai her milk, as Yamu does not have a wife and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to feed the infant. In another miracle, a three-storeyed house appears at the place of Yamu's tent for the young Banai to reside, {{while the rest of the}} Dhangars live in tents. She grows up as a rich shepherdess and becomes the overseer of twelve Dhangar vadas (pastoral settlements or camps, inhabited by different Dhangar clans). She cares for her sheep, grazes them and learns how to breed them.|$|E

25|$|In chapter 1 of his work, Evans proposes for {{the first}} time a {{transitional}} Copper Age between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. He adduces evidence from far-flung places such as China and the Americas to show that the smelting of copper universally preceded alloying with tin to make bronze. He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to classify this fourth age. On the one hand he distinguishes it from the Bronze Age. On the other hand, he includes it:In thus speaking of a bronze-using period I by no means wish to exclude the possible use of copper unalloyed with tin.|$|E

25|$|Going back to Nalebuff (1987), the Monty Hall {{problem is}} also much {{studied in the}} {{literature}} on game theory and decision theory, and also some popular solutions correspond to this point of view. Vos Savant asks for a decision, not a chance. And the chance aspects of how the car is hidden and how an unchosen door is opened are unknown. From this point of view, one has to remember that the player has two opportunities to make choices: first of all, which door to choose initially; and secondly, whether or not to switch. Since he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the car is hidden nor how the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running the quiz show, including the host.|$|E
25|$|Griffin is the surname of the story's protagonist. His {{name is not}} {{mentioned}} until about halfway through the book. Consumed with his greed for power and fame, he is the model of science without humanity. A gifted young student, he becomes interested in the science of refraction. During his experiments, he accidentally discovers chemicals (combined with an unspecified kind of radiation) that would make living tissue invisible. Obsessed with his discovery, he tries the experiment on himself and becomes invisible. However, he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to reverse the process, and he slowly discovers that the advantages of being invisible do not outweigh the disadvantages and the problems he faces. Thus begins his downfall as he takes the road to crime for his survival, revealing in the process his lack of conscience, inhumanity and complete selfishness. He progresses from obsession to fanaticism, to insanity, and finally to his fateful end.|$|E
25|$|The Storybrooke {{residents}} are welcomed {{with open arms}} in Camelot, and King Arthur and Queen Guinevere announce that they will throw a ball for their guests. In the meantime, they find that Merlin has been imprisoned in a tree, and {{the only person who}} can free him, according to Merlin's prophecy, is the Savior. However, the Storybrooke transplants worry that Emma will become darker if she uses her magic, so Regina lies to King Arthur and says that she is the true Savior. Regina and Emma search Merlin's tower for clues, but come up empty and are running out of time as the evening's ball is approaching. Prior the dance, Percival visits Regina and woos her with a necklace to wear and she puts it on, but later decides that she cannot go to the ball, claiming that she needs to continue her research to free Merlin.

25|$|Charlotte Corday {{arrives in}} Paris at dawn. In a square she meets Camille, her {{childhood}} friend, now a deputy to the National Convention. He is disappointed, defeated, and fears for his life. Amongst {{the crowd is}} Gaston, who tells Charlotte {{that he is the}} bodyguard and faithful friend of Marat. Their conversation is interrupted by a commotion which arises around a bakery. In play, a group of children act out the events of the Revolution. The square slowly empties out, except for a child who is left behind by his playmates, tied up as a victim. Charlotte releases and comforts him, thereby building up courage herself, then she buys a long-bladed knife and a shawl from a pedlar. Marat arrives surrounded by an adulating crowd which, at the same time, notices his fatigue and ill-health. Charlotte attracts his attention for a moment, then he continues on to the hall of the Convention. She <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> {{to take advantage of the}} situation to kill him. Marat, received by the deputies with a mixture of hostility and respect, addresses the assembly.|$|E
25|$|Freyr himself {{interrupts}} at this point, {{and says}} that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until Ragnarök. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort Gerðr with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at Ragnarök. Byggvir (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says {{that if he had}} as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, {{and says that}} Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy.
