5|$|Amis drew upon {{a holiday}} {{he had taken}} in the Greek islands to create a {{realistic}} Greek setting and characters. He emphasised political intrigue in the plot more than Fleming had <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canonical Bond novels, also adding revenge to Bond's motivations by including M's kidnapping. Despite keeping a format and structure similar to Fleming's Bond novels, Colonel Sun was given mixed reviews.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{lesson from the}} Tunisia Campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had {{to be treated as}} soon as possible and not evacuated from the combat zone. This was not <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early stages of the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa, with the result that treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty. As the campaign wore on, the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} opening was planned for 19 July 1919 {{but it was}} delayed until Saturday, 26 July 1919 so that Scouts could participate in the Official Peace Festival commemorating the end of World War I. Invitations were changed by hand to save money. Significant remodeling and construction was <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s. Because of limited finances, few improvements were made during the Great Depression of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> natural history mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-vitalist experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.|$|E

The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bahá'u'lláh's writings, where he states that work <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank {{equal to that of}} prayer and worship in the sight of God.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lee died in January 1981, after filming {{had started}} on For Your Eyes Only, {{but before he}} could film his scenes as M, the head of MI6, as he had <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} eleven films of the series. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner take over the role as acting head of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence.|$|E
5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, {{and at the}} high school and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E

5|$|Cars {{would be}} the final film worked on by Joe Ranft {{who died in a}} car {{accident}} a year before the film's release, aged 45. The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after Corpse Bride (that showed the roles he had <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other films directed by John Lasseter during the credits). This is also the last (non-documentary) movie for Paul Newman before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008. It {{turned out to be the}} highest-grossing film of his career.|$|E
5|$|First-order axiomatizations of Peano {{arithmetic}} have {{an important}} limitation, however. In second-order logic, {{it is possible to}} define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.|$|E

For a location, they did not find {{anything}} suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing made it look like all shooting was <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same area.|$|E
