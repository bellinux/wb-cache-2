40|$|This is {{a master}} thesis project {{conducted}} for Scania CV AB in collaboration with Swerea Kimab. The purpose is to examine how oils and coatings on the surface aﬀect the adhesion of adhesives. Earlier work done by Scania indicate {{that the amount of}} oil applied may {{have an impact on the}} adhesion. Substrates tested are <b>hot</b> <b>dipped</b> <b>galvanised</b> <b>steel,</b> electro <b>galvanised.</b> AlSi and ZnMg. Oils used are Anticorit RP 3802 that is an anti-corrosive oil and Renoform 3802 that is a drawing oil. The two adhesives used are Betamate 1496 f and SikaPower 498. The performance of adhesive bonds is strongly dependent on the surface it adheres to and any contam-inates such as oil present on the surface. These factors may greatly decrease the performance of the bond. There are adhesives that have been designed to tolerate a speciﬁc amount of oil on the surfaces and should develop a satisfactory bond with oil present. This project has ﬁrstly developed a routine for easy application of oil with the result of a known amount of oil and a uniform oil distribution on the surface of the coated sample. Secondly lap-shear tests have been performed for various amounts and types of oil in combination with four diﬀerent coatings and two adhesives. For the evaluation of failure mode a program using k-mean factoring was written to provide an objective method to characterise the bond. Lap-shear tests show that there does not seem to be any apparent diﬀerence in bond strength for various amounts of oil and for the two diﬀerent adhesives except for one combination.

40|$|Corrosion {{in ground}} support {{elements}} remains an important area for industry focus, given the immediate concern for mine safety and operational efficiencies, {{as well as}} the hidden cost of longer term rehabilitation work. This paper discusses emerging ‘next generation’ technology within the field of corrosion protection, providing new solutions for specific application areas of ground support product design. Traditionally, anti-corrosion strategies have predominantly focussed upon <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> <b>Galvanising</b> as a common industry solution. However, now complimenting this traditional solution, the more recent technology of Thermal Diffusion Galvanising is gaining interest within the Australian market, providing commercially viable solutions for a number of specific application areas that <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> <b>Galvanising</b> cannot address. Thermal Diffusion Galvanising is an alternative zinc based technology, which offers equivalent cathodic protection to that of <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> <b>Galvanising.</b> Thermal Diffusion Galvanising has a comparatively deeper metallurgical bond to the steel substrate through various zinc-iron alloy layers, offering both increased adhesion and greater surface hardness. Beyond the capabilities of <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> <b>Galvanising,</b> Thermal Diffusion Galvanising has specific applications of interest in high tensile steel grades, coating thickness consistency for threadforms, excellent torque / tension performance and greater flexibility with deformation. Thermal Diffusion Galvanising also continues to provide spark reduction properties on friction contact.

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{investigation}} into the effect of alloying additions (Mn, Cu, Sb and Zr) on microstructure and corrosion of Zn alloys and <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> coatings was undertaken. The first part of this thesis focuses on the effect of alloying additions on the corrosion of Zn alloys. The result shows that Mn is the most beneficial addition, which can significantly improve the resistance of Zn. The effect of Cu depends on its concentration. A high level of Cu addition has a deleterious effect on the corrosion resistance as the Cu-rich particles are catalytic cathodic sites for oxygen reduction. Additions of Zr and Sb were found to have minor effect on the corrosion behaviour of Zn alloys. The effect of these additions on the microstructure of <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> coatings was investigated in the second part. Both Zr and Mn can inhibit the layer growth of active steels with high Si content. Thus, Mn and Zr might be an alternative addition to Ni which can control the excessive reaction of the active steels. Addition of 0. 8 wt % Cu significantly increases the coating thickness of the <b>galvanised</b> <b>steel</b> containing 0. 02 wt % Si. The growth kinetics of the alloy layers follows a linear law. The final part of this thesis focuses on the effect of these additions on the atmospheric corrosion resistance and electrochemistry of <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> coatings. Among the alloying additions investigated in this study, Mn is the most beneficial addition to the Zn bath and can significantly improve the resistance of the <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> coating to atmospheric corrosion. The effect of other additions on corrosion resistance is minor. The beneficial effect of Mn addition is mainly due to the formation of a Mn-rich oxide layer on the top surface during the galvanising process, which can greatly inhibit the cathodic reactivity of the <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> coating. Coupled with the relatively low cost and ease of alloying of this element, these various factors suggest that Mn might have broader applications in general galvanising.

A wide range of Nb levels have been successfully strip cast by the CASTRIP ® process. Niobium was found to retard austenite grain refinement and substantially enhanced hardenability, which produced significant microstructural hardening and higher strength hot band.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on a zinc coating produced {{on the surface of}} ductile iron grade EN-GJS- 500 - 7 to determine the eutectic grain effect. For this purpose, castings with a wall thickness of 5 to 30 mm were made and the resulting structure was examined. To obtain a homogeneous metal matrix, samples were subjected to a ferritising annealing treatment. To enlarge the reaction surface, the top layer was removed from casting by machining. Then <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanising</b> treatment was performed at 450 °C to capture the kinetics of growth of the zinc coating (in the period from 60 to 600 seconds).

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{determine}} a suitable method for applying zinc based corrosion protection to steel fabricated in a remote area. The various methods for applying the zinc have been researched to determine their requirements and their relative advantages and limitations. The application methods identified were: *Hot-dip Galvanising *Electro-Galvanising *Metal Spray *Sherardizing *Organic Zinc Rich Primers *Inorganic Zinc Rich Primers The methods were researched to find the following information: *Application Process *Required Inspections *Known Advantages and Disadvantages *Health, Safety, and Environmental Factors *Required Infrastructure The results of the research {{were used to determine}} which of the coatings could be performed by the business. A criteria matrix was developed and used to determine this. Zinc thermal spray and both organic and inorganic zinc rich primers were deemed the most viable. The corrosion and abrasion resistance of these coatings were tested and compared with the performance of <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanising</b> due to it being an industry standard. The results highlighted zinc thermal spray as the highest performer with greatest corrosion resistance and superior abrasion resistance over the painted coatings. The costs of the coatings were also compared with the cost of having an external supplier performing <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanising.</b> It was found that the cost of transport made this uneconomical as expected. The cost of zinc thermal spray again proved to be the highest performer being 25 % less to apply than the painted zinc rich coatings. The net present value for acquiring the infrastructure to perform zinc thermal spray was calculated and proved that the project is worth pursuing. This has provided assurance that the application of zinc thermal spray would not only provide the customer with a cost effective alternative to <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanising,</b> but also that it will provide a positive investment for the business. ...|$|R

In the remote village areas of high mountains {{such as the}} Himalayas and the Andes the introduction of cement and steel reinforcement bars for reinforced concrete constructions is very costly and often not affordable for the local villagers. Galvanised Wire Reinforcement (GWR) is an earthquake reinforcement for thick, nonengineered dressed and semi-dressed stone walls, adobe, soil block and rammed earth building constructions. In remote mountain areas masonry with cement mortar is only marginally done due to {{the high cost of}} cement, sand and aggregates. The 2. 3 mm and cross-welded or knotted GWR provides lengthwise and crosswise reinforcement within the wall thickness and vertically along the borders of all openings such as doors windows and wall endings. The special advantage of the <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> <b>Galvanised</b> Wire {{is that it does not}} require a high concentration of cement in the concrete or cement mortar to prevent corrosion of the wires. Villagers can apply the reinforcement throughout the wall construction applying only low-cement mixtures, thus keeping the construction cost low. L-shaped and U-shaped cement blocks provide hollow space for the vertical reinforcement consisting of folded up GWR strips, facilitating construction and providing an aesthetic architectural design. The cement blocks can be cast on site with a simple operated mould and hand compacting, also allowing low cost production techniques. The GWR strips or ladders can equally be used in adobe wall constructions either made with blocks or rammed earth. In addition it is an adequate reinforcement for solid cement block walls.

40|$|The use {{of steel}} in marine environments has been {{invaluable}} {{to the construction}} industry, steel structures in marine environments are subject to severe corrosive effects compared to urban areas. All coatings rely on a physical bond to the substrate. As with any physical bond this can be compromised with sufficient impact, {{in the context of}} marine environment a very real example is when boats and vehicles dock alongside. Such impact can chip off the coating and corrosion will rapidly propagate. Corrosion effectively destroys the structural integrity of a structure if allowed to spread, with rust taking up approximately 6 times to volume of steel with none of the structural integrity. <b>Hot</b> <b>dipped</b> <b>galvanising</b> (HDG) is the process of submersing a steel substrate in a molten zinc bath, once dried the zinc is anodic to the steel and will corrode sacrificially to the steel. HDG will form a passive layer of oxide to prevent further exposure to the atmosphere. Such a coating has proven very beneficial in the past however does come with a higher initial cost. This is associated with the high costs involved in maintaining a molten zinc bath (requiring temperatures of 450 °C sometimes 24 / 7) as well as ongoing maintenance of the zinc itself as levels deplete from usage/contamination. Painting systems are more versatile when it comes to application as no molten baths are needed. However, it is critical to ensure the coating is applied to recommended specifications, this will certainly govern the performance of the coating system, in the case of fundamental structural element a premature service life can result in millions in repair; further highlighting the importance of correct preparation and application. Any chosen coating system is rarely chosen on performance alone, in all projects the entire timeline must be considered. HDG is a very suitable coating system when maintenance is to be avoided due to access issues etc. However, it may not prove practical for projects with smaller life cycles, these factors and more shall be considered in the project scope.

This work reports the rupture of a galvanized U-bolt steel stirrup of a 60 kV overhead electric transport line of a Eolic Park in the North of Portugal. This component is subject to a complex load system and variable attack angles. Thus, the component is subjected to fatigue, wear, static crush and corrosion. The fractured stirrup was manufactured from a hot rolled C 1 - S 235 JRC steel rod with Ø 14. 5 mm. The final component was <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanised</b> and centrifuged according standard ISO 1461. Fracture surface and multiple cross section microscopy and chemical analysis of the fractured stirrup {{as well as of}} new unused stirrups was carried out to identify the rupture mechanisms responsible for the collapse of the structure. Residual resistance of the broken stirrup was evaluated via dedicated designed tensile testing. The original steel has a wide number of big inclusions, same over 400 m long, developed parallel to the axis of the rod. These inclusions intercept the surface of the rod, inducing surface indentations and cracking of the galvanised coating. Also a considerable number of pronounced notches are observed at the steel surface, at the steel/zinc coating interface. The fracture surface displays two symmetrical glossy burnish areas, characteristic of the fatigue processes, separated by a central ductile central zone. In the fractured component several cracks due to inclusions are observed intercepting the fracture surface. Zinc and Oxygen were identified of all over the fatigue grown crack surface indicating that hydrolysis of the coating took place with continuous wet transport to the cracked surface with precipitation and oxidation. The analysis carried out allows concluding that the failure of the component took place by fatigue. Fracture was initiated at the 1 st/ 2 nd thread of the component, close to the screw joint. The variable load acted perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry of the component. Corrosion took place simultaneously with fatigue crack propagation speeding the failure process. The inclusions present in the steel, mainly those that intercept the component surface, as well as the surface notches due to hot rolling, enhanced the disclosure of the fatigue process leading to premature failure of the component...|$|R
