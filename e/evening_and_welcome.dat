He said that [...] "The most general and prevalent association with television viewing is {{a heightened sense}} of living in a 'mean world' of violence and danger.

They may accept <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>welcome</b> repression if it promises to relieve their insecurities. That is the deeper problem of violence-laden television." ...|$|R

50|$|Sunrunners are the {{impartial}} mediators of the Continent and {{the quickest}} form of communication. They {{communicate with each}} other all over the world, keeping families in contact, Princes and Lords aware of political happenings, and performing ceremonies - such as Namings, Choosings, or Burnings - as needed. Sunrunners are forbidden to participate in battle lest it is to save their own lives, to take sides in a debate, and most importantly they are forbidden to use their gifts to kill. Faradhi oaths also include a vow of silence to ensure the trust of Sunrunner messengers.

Hence, structured methods for benefits management (BM) are being developed. However, hardly any studies have investigated how such approaches are used and experienced. This study addresses this practice-research gap by reporting {{a study of}} a project involving 30 Norwegian government agencies using a common BM approach. A questionnaire was answered by project managers. Results show that that some 80 % of the managers considered their early quantifications of expected benefits to be realistic. Further, the managers found the approach useful. They felt projects became more focused, and expect to continue working with a BM approach.
