5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe they could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> to help him {{when he had been}} a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E
25|$|After Cyclops was incarcerated, and Steve {{accepted}} the Avengers should <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> to help mutants, {{and allowed the}} world to hate them, he started planning a new sub-team of Avengers {{in the hopes of}} unifying mutant and humankind alike. He chose Havok to lead his team and become the new face to represent mutants as Professor X and Cyclops once were.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{say that}} the Saudi {{government}} should <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> to prevent such tragedies. The Saudi government insists that any such mass gatherings are inherently dangerous and difficult to handle, {{and that they have}} taken a number of steps to prevent the problems. The fatalities in the largest tragedy in September 2015 are alleged to have been downplayed by the Saudis by as many as 1,700.|$|E

25|$|In {{this cycle}} the DSCC was more {{successful}} at fundraising. As of June 30, 2008, {{data from the}} Federal Election Commission showed the NRSC with $24.6 million on hand, {{as compared with the}} DSCC's $43 million. The NRSC chair, Senator John Ensign, took the unusual step of chastising the Republican Senators who, like him, are not facing re-election, and who he thought should <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> to help raise money for their colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the war, Sweden {{began to}} play a role in {{humanitarian}} efforts and many refugees, among them many Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were saved partly because of the Swedish involvement in rescue missions at the internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the Nordic countries and the Baltic states. Nevertheless, internal and external critics have argued that Sweden could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> to resist the Nazi war effort, even if risking occupation although doing so would likely have resulted in even greater number of casualties and prevented many humanitarian efforts.|$|E
25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E

25|$|According to Lewis, this {{reduction}} {{resulted in}} Arabs who wanted slaves having {{to look elsewhere}} to avoid the restrictions in the Qur'an, meaning an increase of importing of slaves from non-Muslim lands, primarily from Africa. These slaves suffered a high death toll. Patrick Manning states that Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in Arabian Peninsula {{and to a lesser}} degree for the whole area of the whole Umayyad Caliphate where slavery had existed since the most ancient times. He however notes that {{with the passage of time}} and the extension of Islam, Islam by recognizing and codifying slavery seems to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.|$|E
25|$|He also {{experienced}} personal problems with former ally Itamar Franco, his predecessor {{and later became}} Governor of Minas Gerais, a fierce opponent of his administrative reforms that saw the state lose its capacity to contract debt and forced a reduction of local government spending. Cardoso was also criticized for amending the constitution to his own benefit, allowing him to stay eight years in office. His popularity in his first four years, gained {{with the success of}} Plano Real, decreased during his last four years as the currency crisis was followed by lower economic growth and employment rates, greater public debt, growing political dissent and, finally, an energy crisis caused by an unexpected draught and low levels of investment in appropriate infrastructure. He publicly admitted that he could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> for public security and for the creation of new jobs, but defended his policies in areas such as health and education.|$|E
25|$|Furman {{may have}} been the most {{successful}} coach in the history of chess, although some would give that title to Mark Dvoretsky. Chess culture has traditionally and typically credited the player for chess success, with the coach recognized in a much lesser fashion, or not at all. Chess coaches were not commonly seen for top players until the post-World War II period, when competition became much stiffer. They were first developed in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries; {{it is no coincidence that}} top players from these nations have dominated chess for the past sixty years. Furman, with a very significant role in Karpov's development from his late teens, building upon earlier roles with World Champion Botvinnik and world-class players such as Bronstein, Korchnoi, and Geller, may <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> than any other coach, from the early 1950s until the late 1970s, to help ensure Soviet dominance.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, {{while working}} in New York City, Fanti started the {{psychotherapy}} of a diplomat who was representing his country {{in a series of}} international conferences. His treatment was a man of success with a brilliant career but anguished to the extreme of considering his life senseless. Fanti and his patient completed nine sessions of 45 minutes. Suddenly the diplomat was transferred to another country due to professional requirements and he therefore interrupted his treatment. A few months later, Fanti received a thankful letter from his client for all the work done with him but announcing he had committed suicide. This tragic event disturbed Fanti profoundly. He reflected about the clinical aspects of his client's case, trying to understand what he should have done differently so as to avoid his client committing suicide. He had a sense that if during those 15 days the psychoanalysis had lasted they could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> frequent and longer sessions, his client {{would have been able to}} discharge enough anxiety as to permit him to pull through temporally. At a later stage he could have continued a psychoanalysis to seek a definitive equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|The {{supporters}} of Caesar argued that Caesar deserved {{an extension of}} his command so that the fruit of his success would not be lost. There was a debate on this. Pompey showed goodwill towards Caesar. He claimed that he had letters from Caesar {{in which he said}} he wanted to be relieved of his command, but he said that he thought that he should be allowed to stand for the consulship in absentia. Cato opposed this and said that if Caesar wanted this he had to lay down his arms and become a private citizen. Pompey did not contest Cato's view. This gave rise to suspicions about his real feelings towards Caesar. Plutarch wrote that Pompey also asked Caesar for the troops he had lent him back, using the Parthian war as a pretext. Although Caesar knew why Pompey asked this he sent the troops back home with generous gifts. Appian wrote that Caesar gave these soldiers a donation and also sent one of his legions to Rome. Pompey was drifting toward the optimates and away from Caesar. According to Plutarch the rift between Pompey and Cato became accentuated when Pompey fell seriously ill in Naples in 50 BC. When he recovered the people of Naples offered thanksgiving sacrifices. This celebration spread throughout Italy. He was feted in towns he travelled to on his way back to Rome. Plutarch wrote that this was said ‘to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> than anything else to bring about the subsequent civil war’. It made Pompey arrogant, incautious and contemptuous of Caesar’s power. The following year the two men were fighting each other in the Great Roman Civil War.|$|E

500|$|Disraeli's {{government}} also {{introduced a new}} Factory Act meant to protect workers, the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875, which allowed peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts. As {{a result of these}} social reforms the Liberal-Labour MP Alexander Macdonald told his constituents in 1879, [...] "The Conservative party <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty." ...|$|E

[...] Lincoln once wrote a letter to Root, saying, [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> than a hundred generals and a thousand orators". Other songs {{played an important role in}} convincing northern whites that African Americans were willing to fight and wanted freedom, for instance Henry Clay Work's 1883 [...] "Babylon Is Fallen" [...] and Charles Halpine's [...] "Sambo's Right to Be Kilt".|$|E
500|$|Some {{historians have}} thought that the gap could have been closed earlier; Wilmot wrote that despite having British {{divisions}} in reserve, Montgomery did not reinforce Guy Simonds and that the Canadian drive on Trun and Chambois was not [...] "vigorous and venturesome" [...] as the situation demanded. Hastings wrote that Montgomery, having witnessed {{what he called a}} poor Canadian performance during Totalize, should have brought up veteran British divisions to take the lead. D'Este and Blumenson wrote that Montgomery and Harry Crerar might <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> to impart momentum to the British and Canadians. Patton's post-battle claim that the Americans could have prevented the German escape, had Bradley not ordered him to stop at Argentan, was [...] "absurd over-simplification".|$|E
500|$|Also that day, expert medical witness Michal Pogoši {{took the}} stand.

[...] Nosek was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue, where the initial diagnosis took place. Since this hospital did not have a specialized neurology department, Nosek was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis. There, Nosek underwent two operations, first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone.|$|E
