500|$|The film's {{producers}} {{launched a}} nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors {{who came to}} audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, [...] "It was a disastrous talent hunt. We discovered that people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection." [...] When Suri saw some pictures of Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, [...] "Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. We found her to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles." [...] When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said [...] "People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> I wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and I saw them as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 1, Bayern {{started at}} odds of 6.1/1 for the 31st {{running of the}} Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita Park. His opponents {{included}} the undefeated gelding Shared Belief, California Chrome, and Tonalist in a field which appeared dominated by three-year-olds. Exiting the gate, Bayern veered sharply to the left, badly hampering Shared Belief and Moreno before taking the early lead. He was tracked throughout the race by the British-trained Toast of New York with California Chrome close behind and maintained his advantage into the straight. In a closely contested three-way finish, Bayern prevailed by a nose from Toast of New York and a neck from third-place California Chrome. Next to finish were Shared Belief, Tonalist, and Candy Boy, meaning that the first six places were filled by three-year-olds. The racecourse stewards conducted an inquiry into the interference caused by Bayern at the start but allowed the result to stand. After the race, Garcia said, [...] "It's an amazing feeling, a dream come true... We let him run, and if anything happens, you make adjustments. In this race, he broke really good and I took advantage. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that I didn't do anything. In racing, these things happen." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{found myself}} {{now to be}} the very centre of the awful conflict. While not stating that the whole {{bombardment}} was directed at me personally, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that it was." ...|$|R

6000|$|In {{a moment}} the girl had withdrawn, {{and the old man}} stood within the door. 'What! You're hammer and tongs, already, you two?' he said, coolly {{stroking}} his face. 'I thought you would be. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ha!' he said, 'I thought so. That {{was before}} I knew you, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> I couldn't be mistaken. He is light and active, I suppose. But those were slight {{advantages}} compared with yours. Luck, luck! These hang-dog outcasts have it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Weel, I did {{not pass}} quite close to them, as I ran up here for my horse on hearin' the news," [...] replied Duncan; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> saw her sittin' beside Louise." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'For my part,' said Dolly, in a {{thoughtful}} manner, 'I half believe Mr Chester {{is something like}} Miggs in that respect. For all his politeness and pleasant speaking, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> he <b>was</b> making game of us, more than once.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went out}} in a 'uff at last. But not before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> I 'ad to lift that {{treasure}} by myself. The only thing that kep' me up was thinking 'ow I'd {{take it out of}} 'im when I 'ad the cash." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{may as well}} {{mention it}} at last," [...] Nick went on. [...] "I had to say {{something}} to him in the lobby there when we met--something <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> he couldn't like. I let him have it full in the face--it seemed to me better and wiser. I let him know that Juliet's married." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> {{we would}} get that three hundred {{thousand}} dollars. Lee Rundle's was to be only one-third, because I was paying all the expenses. With that two hundred thousand dollars I knew I could find May Martha Mangum if she was on earth. And with it I could flutter the butterflies in old man Mangum's dovecot, too. If I could find that treasure! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{that you}} {{certainly}} did, for you {{spent the whole}} morning in Edgar's Buildings--it was the day your father's consent came--and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that you and John {{were alone in the}} parlour some time before you left the house." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{may be all}} fancy, Tom," [...] Peter said, [...] "but I can't help {{thinking}} that we are followed. There are three follows who have passed us twice, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> they <b>are</b> particularly noticing us. Keep your hand on your pistol." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know I shall; and I'm not disappointed, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> I couldn't {{go to the}} {{old school}} again, when I heard the doctor say I must be very careful for a long time. I thought he meant months; but if it must be years, I can bear it, for I've been happy this last one though I was sick," [...] said Jill, glad {{to show that it}} had not been wasted time by being cheerful and patient now.|$|E
60|$|I {{was greatly}} delighted {{with my own}} {{progress}} {{in the study of}} the Leaplow institutions. In the first place, I soon discovered that the principal thing was to reverse the political knowledge I had acquired in Leaphigh, as one would turn a tub upside-down, when he wished to draw from its stores at a fresh end, and then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> of being within at least the spirit of the Leaplow law. Everything seemed simple, for all was dependent on the common prop, at the base of the great social beam.|$|E
60|$|It did {{not seem}} to me that I was lost, yet lost I was. The peaks were not in sight. The canyon widened down the slope, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that it opened out flat into the great pine forest of Penetier. The only thing that bothered me was the loss of my mustang and outfit; I could not {{reconcile}} myself to that. So I wandered about with a strange, full sense of freedom such as I had never before known. What was {{to be the end of}} my adventure I could not guess, and I wasted no time worrying over it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{you would}} rather that I {{did not tell}} about your {{struggle}} with the leopard.

60|$|So far yesterday, the {{citation}} being wrung from me by remembrance of many reviews. I have now received all FALESA, and my admiration for that tale rises; <b>I</b> believe it <b>is</b> {{in some ways}} my best work; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure,</b> at least, <b>I</b> have never done anything better than Wiltshire.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} you didn't, father; {{it would only}} make me nervous. I shan't go into the {{shrubbery}} {{and give them a}} chance of getting first shot. I shall hide up somewhere and listen. It is a still night, and if there <b>is</b> anyone moving <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> to hear him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a bank examiner," [...] said Longley, [...] "nosing {{around our}} place to-day, and he bucked a sight about that note of yours. You know I know it's all right, {{but the thing}} /is/ against the banking laws. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> you'd have paid it off before the bank was {{examined}} again, but the son-of-a-gun slipped in on us, Tom. Now, I'm short of cash myself just now, or I'd let you {{have the money to}} take it up with. I've got till twelve o'clock to-morrow, and then I've got to show the cash in place of that note or--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘But {{here they}} are at last,’ said Trotty, setting out the tea-things, ‘all correct! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> it was tea, and a rasher. So it is. Meg, my pet, if you’ll just make the tea, while your unworthy father toasts the bacon, we shall be ready, immediate. It’s a curious circumstance,’ said Trotty, {{proceeding}} in his cookery, {{with the assistance of}} the toasting-fork, ‘curious, but well known to my friends, that I never care, myself, for rashers, nor for tea. I like to see other people enjoy ’em,’ said Trotty, speaking very loud, to impress the fact upon his guest, ‘but to me, as food, they’re disagreeable.’ ...|$|E
60|$|My {{approach}} {{seemed to}} discompose them not a little. Milly stepped back at once {{into the doorway}} and disappeared; her companion, without waiting to make any adieu, turned round and walked swiftly away. As he crossed the street {{to make use of}} the only exit from it--a narrow passage leading through a court--I had a better view of him. He kept his back to me as much as possible and seemed to be using every endeavour to escape recognition. But although I could not be quite certain, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that it was Leonard de Cartienne--de Cartienne, who never missed an opportunity of sneering at Milly's innocent blue eyes and baby face.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall go {{over and}} see Mr. Shrewsbury tonight. <b>I</b> have not <b>been</b> over for some time and, as it is not his night for a class, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> not to find anyone there. I told him, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there last, that I would take over a few tools and fix up those shelves for him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{they want}} to, Jacob; but I don't suppose they search the {{steerage}} baggage much; {{they will probably}} ask you who you are, and where you are going, and you must tell them that you are my servant, and that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at the Metropolitan Hotel. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> to <b>be</b> {{here to see you}} through.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that Loo {{must have}} related this {{occurrence}} to her father, {{who came in}} shortly afterward; for he looked queerly at the doctor. But he said nothing; and, in ten minutes, was quite as affable as ever. As for Loo, there was not the slightest change in her; and the doctor, of course, for ever afterwards held his peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "But that Marilla {{girl was}} {{a benefit to}} the eye. And {{she was the most}} elegant kind of a housekeeper. I was the nearest neighbour, and I used to ride over to the Double-Elm {{anywhere}} from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a sample of new sheep-dip just as a frivolous excuse to see Marilla. Marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> I was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her over to the Lomito. Only she was so everlastingly permeated with filial sentiments toward old Cal that I never could get her to talk about serious matters.|$|E
60|$|As for Mr. Shuan, {{the drink}} or his crime, or the two together, had {{certainly}} troubled his mind. I cannot say I ever {{saw him in}} his proper wits. He never grew used to my being there, stared at me continually (sometimes, I could have thought, with terror), and more than once drew back from my hand when I was serving him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> from the first {{that he had no}} clear mind of what he had done, and on my second day in the round-house I had the proof of it. We were alone, and he had been staring at me a long time, when all at once, up he got, as pale as death, and came close up to me, to my great terror. But I had no cause to be afraid of him.|$|E
6000|$|As romancer to the {{children}} I had a hard time, even from the beginning. If they brought me a picture, in a magazine, and required me to build a story to it, they would cover {{the rest of the}} page with their pudgy hands to keep me from stealing an idea from it. The stories had to come hot from the bat, always. They had to be absolutely original and fresh. Sometimes {{the children}} furnished me simply a character or two, or a dozen, and required me to start out at once on that slim basis and deliver those characters up to a vigorous and entertaining life of crime. If they heard of a new trade, or an unfamiliar animal, or anything like that, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> {{to have to deal with}} those things in the next romance. Once Clara required me to build a sudden tale out of a plumber and a [...] "bawgunstrictor," [...] and I had to do it. She didn't know what a boa-constrictor was, until he developed in the tale--then she was better satisfied with it than ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> on {{the right}} track at last," [...] said the man. [...] "And since you have told me so much I will return your confidences by stating that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a Secret Service officer. We had an idea that the Germans might try {{something}} of that sort in this vicinity, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> now that we are {{on the right}} track." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, father," [...] Ned said, {{answering}} the look; [...] "there is a brig in sight, which <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure,</b> the Good Venture.

6000|$|... "There {{have been}} {{one or two people}} in, in the last few days, asking {{questions}} which I don't understand," [...] she told him. [...] "One of them, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>was</b> a detective. He didn't get much change out of me," [...] she added, in a self-satisfied tone, [...] "but there's someone got their knife into us. You remember the trouble down in the Marylebone Road, when you----" ...|$|R
