40|$|Automation {{has entered}} nearly {{every aspect of}} our lives, but it often remains hard to understand. Why is this? Automation is often brittle, {{requiring}} constant human oversight to assure it operates as intended. This oversight has become <b>harder</b> as <b>automation</b> has become more complicated. To resolve this problem, Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) has been proposed. HAT looks to make automation act as more of a teammate, by having it communicate with human operators in a more human, goal-directed, manner which provides transparency into the reasoning behind automated recommendations and actions. This, in turn, permits more trust in the automation when it is appropriate, and less when it is not, allowing a more targeted supervision of automated functions. This paper proposes a framework for HAT, incorporating two key tenets: bi-directional communication, and operator directed authority. We have successfully applied these tenets to integrating the autonomous constrained flight planner (an aide for planning diverts) into a dispatch station. We propose the development of general design patterns that may allow these results to be generalized to domains such as photography and automotive navigation. While these domains are very different, we find application of our HAT tenets provides a number of opportunities for improving interaction between human operators and automation...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Construction is {{following}} the general industry trend towards the introduction of <b>hard</b> and soft <b>automation</b> for many aspects of materials identification and tracking. Recent developments in RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) tagging provide the hardware solution and cyber-agents {{are part of the}} software scheme employed. The agents – programs that can make autonomous decisions and take necessary action when required – are totally dependent upon sensors (rather than human intervention) to provide real-time information on parameters such as location, condition and timing: RFID tags are seen as an appropriate sensor type for providing this kind of information. The potential of RFID tagging technology in the construction and management of facilities is assessed in terms of value chains, a number of applications for improving efficiency are reviewed, and others are proposed. Although there is little evidence presently of RFID adoption in the wider construction sector, the paper concludes that a breakthrough will result from applications that emphasise the management of the building or facility, in particular energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} automation, {{robotics}} and communications technology has established {{the need for}} the development of a communications infrastructure capable of supporting future underground <b>hard</b> rock mine <b>automation</b> systems. A series of underground experiments were undertaken at Copper Cliff North Mine to evaluate the design criteria and performance of several communications infrastructures.

This was achieved with a communications system consisting of a broadband bus linked to leaky feeder coaxial cables by means of distributed antenna translators. The success of the trials permitted a strategy for mine automation to be devised. The economic benefits of mine automation were estimated by means of economic models developed for the mine. Projected benefits, evaluated in terms of mining cost reduction, throughput time and quality improvement, were concluded to be significant.

However, experience in aviation gives us some cause for concern for the ‘drive-by-wire’ car (Stanton & Marsden, 1996). Problems of workload and situation awareness have been attributed as the root cause of some aircraft accidents (Beaty, 1995). These problems may be approached in two different ways, depending on the level of automation used. These two philosophies are exemplified by the positions of the two major aircraft manufacturers.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a robotic cell to perform assembly and handling operations on cloth. - A flexible automation approach was adopted, in which the robot was required to control the cloth panel during both handling and sewing operations, without the aid of <b>hard</b> <b>automation</b> attachments which might limit the flexibility of the system. The cell consisted of an adaptively controlled robot, a hierarchy of controllers, a conventional sewing machine, a two-fingered fabric steering end-effector, and several sensor systems. A technique was developed for producing a seam parallel to an edge of arbitrary contour, in which two cameras, a cloth tension sensor and the sewing machine's shaft encoder provided the sensory input. Two sensory servo control systems were required, one control system generated the robot's trajectory to maintain a small constant cloth tension, and the other directed the robot to manipulate the cloth panel to maintain a constant seam width. The design of the cloth tension control was based on the measured frequency response of the open loop system. The seam width control was designed using simulation studies, which accounted for the control transfer function, and nonlinearities such as camera pixel resolution, time delays and robot motion limitations. Several robotic handling techniques were developed, so that a cloth panel placed arbitrarily on the sewing table could be set up for an edge seaming operation, and the cloth could be rotated about the needle. The system's flexibility was demonstrated in the assembly of an irregularly shaped cloth panel, in which three adjacent sides were sewn up. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: With the {{pressing}} need for increased productivity {{and delivery of}} end products of uniform quality, industry is turning {{more and more to}} computer-based automation. At the present time, most of industrial automated manufacturing is carried out by specialpurpose machines, designed to perform specific functions in a manufacturing process. The inflexibility and generally high cost of these machines often referred to as <b>hard</b> <b>automation</b> systems, have led to a broad-based interest in the use of robots capable of performing a variety of manufacturing functions in a more flexible working environment and at lower production costs. A robot is a reprogrammable general-purpose manipulator with external sensors that can perform various assembly tasks. A robot may possess intelligence, which is normally due to computer algorithms associated with its controls and sensing systems. Industrial robots are general-purpose, computer-controlled manipulators consisting of several rigid links connected in series by revolute or prismatic joints. Most of today’s industrial robots, though controlled by mini and microcomputers are basically simple positional machines. They execute a given task by playing back a prerecorded or preprogrammed sequence of motion that has been previously guided or taught by the hand-held control teach box. Moreover, these robots are equipped with little or no external sensors for obtaining the information vital to its working environment. As a result robots are used mainly for relatively simple, repetitive tasks. More research effort has been directed in sensory feedback systems, which has resulted in improving the overall performance of the manipulator system. An example of a sensory feedback system would be: a vision Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) system. This can be utilized to manipulate the robot position dependant on the surrounding robot environment (various object profile sizes). This vision system can only be used within the robot movement envelop...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNotwithstanding laser {{scanning}} {{technology is a}} mature technology used in widening application fields, a variety of barriers hinds its integration in robotized production lines. To face well know problems, as high-costs and not customizable solutions among others, the authors have developed a new family of {{laser scanning}} devices based on off the shelves and low cost hardware components and on a modular design that allow the customization of the device according to the specific application requirements. High accuracy is guaranteed through a computationally efficient non-parametric calibration procedure. Keeping limited the overall cost of the solution provided while increasing in general the sensing capabilities of an Industrial Robot (IR) {{and in particular the}} autonomous recognition of position, orientation and furthermore shape and geometrical features of objects within the robotic workspace, can boost the penetration of IRs in typical traditional industrial sectors where SMEs productive scenario is mainly characterized by manual fabrication processes, high product variability, small batches and little capital investments. High added value footwear industry is a paradigmatic example where <b>hard</b> <b>automation</b> is limited from one side by high variability of products and huge request of autonomous adaptation to cope with different loosely structured fabrication processes and from the other side by a low propensity towards high capital investment that make difficult the penetration of industrial robots. Within the framework of the European Project ROBOFOOT (EU-FP 7 -SMP), authors have conceived and developed a new family of low cost modular and reconfigurable laser scanners and successfully applied in the footwear fabrication scenario. Various operations should be improved by actual measure of the shoe being manufactured, and among the others, the identification of the relative positioning between the last (the plastic element on top of which is built the shoe) and the gripping device is extremely critical because it is still performed manually. Positioning errors in this phase are critical since all robot part-programs depend on the correct alignment of the last with the robot end-effector. To face this problem, a procedure, based on the Iterative Closest Points (ICP) optimization method, has been developed and integrated on board of the laser scanning device that directly communicates with the robot controller to adapt and autonomously correct the part-program to align the tool nominal path with the actual shoe being manufactured. Efficacy of the proposed methods has been proved by measuring the interaction forces between the tool and the last handled by a robot during different technological operations (roughing, polishing etc) typical of the shoe fabrication cycle...|$|E
