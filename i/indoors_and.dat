5|$|Chambers {{returned}} to competition in June 2006, and won gold with his teammates in the 4×100m at the 2006 European Championships. He tried other sports, including a spell with the Hamburg Sea Devils of the NFL Europa league and a rugby league trial with Castleford.

5|$|Several {{versions}} of the stage were used during the tour. The first two legs of 1992 were <b>indoors</b> <b>and</b> used {{the smallest of the}} sets, which included fourVidiwalls (Philips-branded giant television screens); sixpainted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36television monitors; and a B-stage, a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp. A seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as a DJ booth and a mirror ball.|$|E
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling <b>indoors</b> <b>and</b> assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
50|$|Nordwig {{won five}} European titles: three {{outdoors}} (1966, 1969 and 1971) <b>and</b> two <b>indoors</b> (1971 <b>and</b> 1972). Domestically {{he won the}} East German title outdoors in 1965-72 <b>and</b> <b>indoors</b> in 1964-66, <b>and</b> 1969-72. During his career he set two world records. The first occasion was on 17 June 1970 in Berlin, Germany when he cleared 5.45 m. The second was on 3 September 1970 in Turin, Italy, when he broke his own world record with a jump of 5.46 m. In 1972 he became East German Sportsman of the Year and retired from competitions.|$|R

5|$|Federer {{finished}} {{the year in}} strong form, winning indoor titles at the Stockholm Open, Swiss <b>Indoors,</b> <b>and</b> the ATP World Tour Finals in London, which brought his tally to 66 career titles. Federer won the year-end championships in London by beating rival Rafael Nadal for his fifth title at the event. He showed much of his old form, beating all contenders except Nadal in straight sets. It remains the only tournament in his career where Federer defeated all fellow members of the Big Four. Since Wimbledon 2010, Federer had a win-loss record of 34–4. Federer {{finished in the top}} two for the eighth consecutive season.|$|E
5|$|Seed is {{gathered}} from natural forest and plantations, most collectors being {{descendants of the}} original settlers. Seed is then germinated in soil-less media and sealed from the atmosphere to prevent contamination. After testing they are picked, washed (bare-rooted), sanitised and certified then packed and sealed into insulated containers for export. They grow both <b>indoors</b> <b>and</b> out and are popular for hotels and motels worldwide. Nursery profits are returned to enhance the island ecosystem. The nursery plans to expand the business to include the curly palm and other native plants of special interest.|$|E

5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as plywood boards to allocate people through the security check. In late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new terminal building, as the old terminal was deemed both too small and out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million terminal started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored <b>indoors</b> <b>and</b> included a new helicopter terminal. Thon Hotel Torghatten opened in October 2009 and an airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010, making Brønnøysund the first regional airport in Norway to have one.|$|E
5|$|Detective Gordon Eaves (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) {{is sent to}} the Bay. Hugo, who {{is hiding}} at Martha's farm, overhears him and {{recognises}} him as the cop that he and the others paid off when he was involved in the people smuggling racket. Martha makes this aware to Angelo who agrees to go to Martha's farm with Eaves. On the way, Eaves threatens Angelo to go along with his plans. Eaves shoots Hugo and then flees the scene. Hugo is rushed <b>indoors</b> <b>and</b> Martha phones local doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews). Eaves is caught by Angelo, Tony and Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). Angelo then arrests both Hugo and Martha. As Angelo is driving them to the police station, he suddenly stops and lets them out. He tells Hugo to punch him {{to make it look like}} he and Martha had overpowered him and escaped. Martha thanks Angelo for letting them leave together. Hugo and Martha use Angelo's police car to escape and they flee the Bay, leaving behind their family and friends.|$|E
5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live <b>indoors,</b> <b>and</b> due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E

5|$|Ray's {{last three}} films, made after his {{recovery}} and with medical strictures in place, were shot mostly <b>indoors,</b> <b>and</b> have a distinctive style. They have more dialogue than his earlier films {{and are often}} regarded as inferior to his earlier body of work. The first, Ganashatru (An Enemy of the People) is an adaptation of the famous Ibsen play, and considered the weakest of the three. Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree). In it, an old man, who has lived a life of honesty, comes to learn of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill. Ray's last film, Agantuk (The Stranger), is lighter in mood but not in theme. When a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. This provokes far-ranging questions in the film about civilisation.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team represented the University of Michigan in the 1896 Western Conference football season. They played their home games at Regents Field in Ann Arbor, Michigan and {{competed in the}} newly established Western Conference, later {{to be known as}} the Big Ten Conference. The team, with William Ward as head coach, started the season with nine consecutive wins in which the Wolverines outscored their opponents by a combined score of 256 to 4. In the final game of the season, played on Thanksgiving Day at the Chicago Coliseum, the team lost a close game to Amos Alonzo Stagg's University of Chicago team by a score of 7–6. The 1896 MichiganChicago game was the first college football game played <b>indoors,</b> <b>and</b> the last portion of the game was also played under electric lights. Henry M. Senter was the team captain.|$|E
5|$|DNK {{carried out}} tests {{with the system}} in 2010 for firefighters using {{self-contained}} breathing apparatus in structure fires, and found the system to be sufficient. Similar test were carried out by Oslo Fire Department later that year, and {{they found that the}} radio system was insufficient for their needs. Oslo Fire Department concluded that the DNK tests were only successful because of the use of additional directional gateway/repeater-radio equipment. Because of this firefighters in Oslo continued to use the old ultra-high frequency radios during indoor fires. Both the Norwegian Police Security Service's bodyguard service and the service for protection of the royal family have opted to not use the new radio system, citing poor coverage <b>indoors</b> <b>and</b> while lying on the ground, even in downtown Oslo. The services have stated that this does not allow for interoperability with other agencies, which is a drawback in case of major incidents. Also the joint rescue coordination centers, the Norwegian Air Ambulance and the 330 Squadron which operates Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters have opted out of using the system because of poor coverage. During the 2011 Norway attacks at Utøya, located in northern Buskerud, police officers from surrounding police districts were not able to communicate with local police because the area did not have coverage for the TETRA system.|$|E

5|$|Vietnamese {{fishermen}} in the South China Sea received 24hours of warning from the National Hydrometerological Forecast Center before Chanchu approached the area, {{less time than}} other agencies in the region. At one point, Chanchu was forecast to become a strong typhoon and make landfall near Hong Kong. In response to the threat, officials at the Hong Kong Observatory, {{as well as in}} Macau, issued a standby signal to inform the public of the approaching typhoon. The HKO issued a warning signal number 3 on May17. In the territory, 60flights were canceled with another 14 delayed, beaches were closed, and ferry service was disrupted. Ahead of the storm, about 1million people evacuated from coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces to government warehouses, schools, tents, or the houses of relatives. In the former province, 62,000fishermen were ordered to return to port, while four flights were canceled at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Residents were advised to remain <b>indoors,</b> <b>and</b> workers reinforced billboards in anticipation of the strong winds. Rail and boat transport was stopped between Guangdong and Hainan across the Qiongzhou Strait due to the typhoon. Schools were closed in Guangdong during the storm's passage, although they remained open in Fujian. In Shanghai, the speed limit of Donghai Bridge was halved because of strong winds.|$|E
