30|$|A key {{approach}} in labour economics {{is the task}} approach that Autor et al. ([2003]) developed to explain the link between job requirements, the demand for workers with different qualifications, and changes in technology. This theoretical approach differentiates between three qualification groups (high, middle, low) and two task types (routine and non-routine). The task approach sees higher-qualified skilled staff being relieved of routine tasks through technological changes, particularly the computerisation of certain tasks. Consequently, the demand for university graduates rises. However, skilled workers in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>qualification</b> segment often perform routine tasks. Thus, skilled workers could be replaced by computerisation, {{and the demand for}} skilled workers on the intermediate level would fall. The task approach also assumes a high share of non-routine tasks for unskilled workers, meaning that computerisation here (e.g., cleaning and truck driving) is not (yet) possible. Consequently, unskilled workers cannot be replaced {{in the same way as}} skilled workers. These labour market effects, summarised under the headline of polarisation, would reduce the demand for vocationally qualified skilled workers from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>qualification</b> segment but increase the demand for university graduates and unskilled workers. According to this approach, there would consequently be less incentive to train skilled workers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract German {{migration}} within Europe {{has so far}} {{received little}} attention from researchers. This {{is especially true of}} migrants with <b>intermediate</b> <b>qualifications</b> (vocational training, technical school, master craftsman’s certificate). The present contribution is devoted to this phenomenon and examines the reasons why people belonging to this particular group migrate. To do this we pick up on central theoretical arguments in migration research, on the basis of which we examine the relevance of economic and social factors for Germans who migrate within Europe. It emerges that, empirically, for Germans with <b>intermediate</b> <b>qualifications,</b> economic factors are crucial. In particular, unemployment, low or falling wages, as well as poor working conditions in Germany constitute important push factors, while job offers, higher wages and better working conditions in the destination countries constitute the main pull factors. In comparison, social networks are less important factors in migration, since only in a few cases did the interviewees have solid contacts abroad. The empirical results of the study are based on the analysis of available population statistics and 40 problem-centred, biographical interview...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} Temporary Help Agencies on occupational mobility by performing an empirical comparison of the job-to-job upgrading chances of agency and regular (non-agency) workers in Spain. We estimate a switching regression model to allow for self-selection into agency work due to, for instance, more motivated workers being more likely to search for jobs through a Temporary Help Agency. We find evidence in favour {{of the existence of}} self-selection in all qualification groups considered. Concerning mobility, we find that agency workers in <b>intermediate</b> <b>qualification</b> levels are less likely to experience demotions than regular workers.

40|$|There {{currently}} {{exists a}} major effort within the United States Navy's Information Professional (IP) Community to overhaul and improve the qualification process for its officers. The overall effort has included the addition of technical refresher courses, re-examination of the Continuing Education Units (CEU) system, and {{the improvement of the}} Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Qualification programs. This thesis specifically addresses the <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Qualification</b> (IQ) and the lack of Information Operations (IO) concepts therein. While some portions of the IQ that address highly technical areas exist, there is little to no mention of the importance of and concepts contained within IO, as defined by Joint Doctrine. The IP Community has a unique opportunity to train its officers in the concepts, competencies, and supporting activities of IO. This will ensure that the IP Community continues to be the Navy's leaders in the area of information dominance.

30|$|Analyses {{of whether}} {{companies}} choose {{to engage in}} IVET – irrespective {{of the number of}} apprentices involved – result in clear correlations, both in Germany and Switzerland, between underlying company data, such as employment demand in relevant qualification areas, the existence of employee representative bodies, in-company continuing vocational education and training CVET, and, not least, company size or industrial sector (Muehlemann et al., [2007]; Schweri and Müller [2007]; Walden, [2007 a]). A factor of particular importance is whether the company employs already-trained and suitably qualified skilled workers from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>qualification</b> segment and whether this choice results in a certain preference for IVET. Among the more influential framework conditions are institutional structures such as workforce representative bodies. Recent studies on this topic have found that companies with works councils report higher net investments in IVET, and these companies’ longer-term apprentice retention rates are higher (Kriechel et al., [2012]), with both indicators pushing for companies to increase training participation. Bellmann et al. ([2010]) analysed the correlation between in-company IVET and CVET and found that both main company qualification segments are predominantly complementary, with no apparent evidence of substitutive relations. Regarding company size, existing studies demonstrate that far larger proportions of large firms than smaller firms act as `training companies’, i.e., IVET providers. A similar finding applies to economic sectors, i.e., training participation in the service sector is traditionally lower than in manufacturing (Walden, [2007 b])b.|$|E

30|$|While {{the growth}} of {{graduates}} can account for the shift of employment from middling to top occupations, it cannot explain the entire polarisation process. In particular, the employment growth in bottom occupations has occurred {{in spite of the}} increase in education. Immigrants account for a substantial fraction of net growth in these occupations (mostly in the 2000 s), but the most significant change offsetting the downward pressure arising from the increase in education is, by far, the reallocation of native workers with <b>intermediate</b> <b>qualifications</b> from middling occupations into service occupations. Wage growth for these occupations was robust over the past 30  years and the highest across all occupational groups in the 2000 s (Salvatori 2015).|$|R
30|$|We {{regard the}} {{particular}} {{constitution of the}} vocational education and training system in Germany {{as the reason for}} the very low level of success of female adolescents with lower secondary school-leaving certificates upon transition. Dual or company-based education and training provides female adolescents with a lower secondary school-leaving certificate in a very restricted vocational spectrum. Female adolescents are barely represented in the industrial and technical occupations, where lower secondary school leavers have an opportunity because female adolescents rarely have occupational interests in this area. By contrast, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>qualification</b> is often demanded as an access requirement in the commercial and service occupations, which are strongly favoured by female adolescents. School-based education and training, which has more female pupils, also offers fewer opportunities for lower secondary school leavers as many of these training courses also require an intermediate training qualification. In this respect, the structural characteristics of the German vocational education and training system specifically place female lower secondary school leavers in a difficult situation. The causes of the difficult situation faced by young females are therefore based on a very marked gender-specific career choice and restrictive occupational provision for this group. It is our view that the disadvantage faced by this group of people indicates a clear need for action in vocational education and training policy. Changes would appear to be appropriate in both dual and school-based education and training. Within dual education and training, the range of occupations should be extended, especially with regard to the particular requirements and interests of female adolescents with a lower secondary school-leaving certificate. Similarly, courses should increasingly be created in school-based education and training for which an intermediate school-leaving certificate is not an essential requirement. New occupations and courses should reflect the career interests of young women with lower secondary school certificates. Therefore, occupations should be created mainly in service, social and nursing fields. In addition, measures should be taken to counter very narrow career choices and to move towards a situation in which both young males and young females perceive the whole of the occupational spectrum to offer an adequate choice.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{construct}} and standardize an Indigenous Intelligence Test (IIT) to measure general intelligence ‘g’ and a screening tool for youth intending to apply in Armed Forces, Public Service Commission and similar organizations where English carries a status of official language. The items of IIT were developed with the help of material obtained from own culture and were constructed in simple English language. The IIT comprises of six sub-scales: Vocabulary, Arithmetic, Analogy, Information, Comprehension, and Similarity. The test was planned to measure various aspects of intelligence verbal ability, to understand concepts, general reasoning factor, element of discovery, acquired knowledge, social intelligence, eduction of relations and correlates. The usefulness of the items was judged through item analysis by administering the test to a sample of 200 subjects with minimum <b>Intermediate</b> <b>qualification.</b> Items were evaluated by considering two main aspects; discrimination power and difficulty level. Items with discriminatory power less than. 30 and level of difficulty below. 30 and above. 70 were discarded. The final draft of the test comprised of 71 items Vocabulary and Arithmetic sub-scales consists of 12 items each, Analogy 14, Information 11, Comprehension 12 and Similarity 10. In the main study the test was administered to 1669 students both male and female, belonging to various Government Colleges & universities of four provinces of the country including AJK and FATA. Candidates both from urban and rural areas were included in the study. Two methods were used to establish reliability of the test i. e., KR 20 and Split-half methods. The estimated indices of reliability were,. 79 and. 69 respectively. To determine validity of indigenous intelligence test different validity criteria were used including urban/rural differences, province wise differences, correlation of the total test and sub-scales (construct validity) and marks in last qualified examination to determine concurrent validity Significant differences in the mean scores of the male and female candidates on vocabulary, arithmetic, analogy and information were found whereas non significant difference was observed on comprehension and similarity subscales. Significant mean differences on vocabulary, arithmetic, analogy and information and non significant difference on comprehension and similarity were also found. Inter-correlation among the subscales and IIT were calculated to determine construct validity of the test. The concurrent validity was determined by correlating scores on IIT with the college marks obtained by each student in the last annual examination. Both indices established the evidence of high validity of the test. Significant differences in urban/rural mean scores on vocabulary, analogy, information, comprehension subscales and IIT were observed. Significant differences were also observed in Province wise mean scores on vocabulary, arithmetic, analogy, information and comprehension subscales. Whereas, non significant mean scores were found on similarity subscale. Income group wise comparison revealed that higher the income groups better the performance. Percentile norms were developed for IIT and subscales while administering the test on a sample of 1669 subjects representative of Pakistani youth.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of qualifications in the German construction workforce and draws comparisons with the situation in the British construction industry. The German system of general education and vocational training is outlined. Data {{from a variety of sources}} are used to describe both the stocks and the flows of qualifications in the German construction workforce. Particular attention is paid to vocational qualifications, such as apprenticeships and the Meister qualification. Key findings are that the majority of German construction workers are qualified up to apprenticeship level, and that most of these employees have achieved a general schooling certificate from at least a lower secondary school prior to their vocational training. These factors are taken as signs of strength of the German construction workforce.

The sectors within the higher education systems were compared regarding the entry routes, the course duration, <b>intermediate</b> <b>qualifications,</b> legislative regimes, quality assurance, etc. The analysis pointed out that the countries could be divided in four groups, ranging from higher education systems with extremely clear dividing lines to systems where boundaries have become relatively vague...|$|R

Analyses of the effects of the recession on the returns to graduate education may yet reveal a further widening of the gaps between graduates who are successful and those who are less successful in the labour market.
