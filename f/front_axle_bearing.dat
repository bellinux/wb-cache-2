All of these Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs.

40|$|AbstractRailway {{wheelsets}} {{consist of}} three main components; the wheel, <b>axle</b> and <b>axle</b> <b>bearing.</b> Faults can develop {{on any of}} the aforementioned components, but the most common are related to wheel and <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> damages. The continuous increase in train operating speeds means that failure of an <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> can lead to very serious derailments, potentially causing human casualties, severe disruption in the operation of the network, damage to the tracks, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the general public. The rail industry has focused on the improvement of maintenance and online condition monitoring of rolling stock to reduce the probability of failure as much as possible. This paper discusses the results of onboard acoustic emission measurements carried out on freight wagons with artificially damaged <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> in Long Marston, UK. Acoustic emission signal envelope analysis has been applied as a means of effective tool to detect and evaluate the damage in the bearings considered in this study. From the results obtained it is safe to conclude that acoustic emission signal envelope analysis has the capability of detecting and evaluating faulty <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> along with their characteristic defect frequencies in the real-world conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue failure {{has become}} a major concern in the {{automobile}} and aircraft industry, heavy machinery etc. Failures by fatigue are especially dangerous because they are unpredictable; giving no prior notification of the imminent failure they occur suddenly. <b>Front</b> <b>axle</b> of tractor {{is one of the major}} and very important components that undergo severe load conditions and it fails unexpectedly causes unrecoverable losses. The objective of this study is to analyze the existing design of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> of the tractor for service load conditions and redesign to its functional requirements and to increase its life expectations. Finite element simulation is carried out for the existing <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> using ANSYS. The critical location of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has to be identified and redesigned to ensure the safety. The existing geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified to the optimum size which suits for functional requirements with increased life and minimum cost. In this analysis, the geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified and a new design is proposed. The life expectancy of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> was predicted for the dynamic load using ANSYS fatigue design module...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. After {{preliminary}} design of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is finished, {{finite element analysis}} module of CATIA {{is used to calculate}} the distribution of stress field and displacement field of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> in the working conditions of vertical static loading, emergency braking as well as side slipping of bus, and then the conclusion will be reached to provide theory basis for <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> design of the whole project. Preface Most of city buses are two or three steps, the height of its floor is 600 mm～ 700 mm, for this kinds of buses, the common <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can meet the challenge. With the development of urban transportation and the growth in the living standard, two or three steps buses have inconvenient problem for particular group and waste times to get up and down the bus. A city needs one step buses {{to meet the needs of}} all kinds of people. To achieve this requirement, the bus floor height should be lower. The bus floor height is about 360 mm～ 400 mm. To lower floor height means the space under the axle is to be decreased, as shown in fig. 1. To resolve this problem, the key is to design large fall low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and full-scale finite element analysis of the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> The paper analyzes the load conditions of vertical static of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle,</b> emergenc...|$|R
