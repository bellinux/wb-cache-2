The key {{fact is that the}} formalism splits <b>the</b> degrees <b>of</b> freedom in a large causal diamond into particles and excitations on the horizon. The latter form a large heat bath for the particles, and different Hamiltonians, describing a one parameter family of accelerated trajectories, have different couplings to the bath. We argue that for a large but finite causal diamond the Hamiltonian describing a geodesic observer has a residual coupling to the bath and that <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bath is finite over the long time interval in the diamond. We find general <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hamiltonian, which <b>guarantee</b> that <b>the</b> horizon degrees <b>of</b> freedom will decouple in <b>the</b> limit <b>of</b> large diamonds, leaving over a unitary evolution operator for particles, with an asymptotically conserved energy. That operator converges to the S-matrix in the infinite diamond limit. The S-matrix thus arises from integrating out <b>the</b> horizon degrees <b>of</b> freedom, in a manner reminiscent of, but distinct from, Matrix Theory.

Faculty of Law of Sebelas Maret University. This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} <b>the</b> procedure <b>of</b> giving bank <b>the</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{carried out by the}} Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia as well as the legal action carried out by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia when the insured violates <b>the</b> <b>guarantee</b> bank agreement. This writing belongs to an empirical law research that is descriptive in nature. The data type employed was primary and secondary data. The secondary data source included primary, secondary and tertiary data. Techniques of collecting data used were interview and library study. Technique of analyzing data used was an interactive model of analysis, in which the data collected would be then analyzed using 3 (three) stages: data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing. Considering <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> research and discussion, it can be concluded that firstly, <b>the</b> Procedure <b>of</b> giving bank <b>guarantee</b> in <b>the</b> Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia can be divided into 2 (two) types: bank guarantee giving with full cover collateral and bank guarantee giving with non-full cover collateral.

After all, there are better conditions in municipalities with extended scope, which are able, also due to the larger budgets within its administrative area, to ensure better crisis preparedness of municipality to an exceptional or crisis situation and its subsequent solutions associated with minimizing damages and eliminate <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> an exceptional or crisis situation. <b>The</b> main objective <b>of</b> this thesis is to characterize the crisis management system in the Czech Republic. With <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> legislation and professional literature the theoretical part is focused on <b>the</b> explanation <b>of</b> basic terms, such as crisis management, a system of integrated rescue system, emergency and crisis planning, characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exceptional and crisis situation or crisis management authorities. Furthermore, the thesis is focused on <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> crisis management at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> municipalities with extended scope, which describes both the scope and the various municipal bodies. It addresses <b>the</b> individual procedures <b>of</b> primarily smaller local government units in <b>the</b> prevention <b>of</b> municipality preparation for exceptional situations, participation of municipality on rescue and relief works and operations implemented in connection with the population protection. At last, the theoretical part contains the financial security operations related to <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> exceptional or crisis situations and to the rescue and relief work implementation. To meet <b>the</b> objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis were established two research questions that address both <b>the</b> preparedness <b>of</b> humanitarian worker, as well as <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> drafting a proposal for a methodological procedure in dealing with crisis situation...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a new {{approach}} to estimation problems under <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> bounded uncertain parameters and statistical noise has been presented. The objective is to use the uncertainty model which appears as the most appropriate for every kind of uncertainty. This leads to the need to consider uncertain stochastic systems and to study how <b>the</b> two types <b>of</b> uncertainty combine : statistical noise is modeled as the centered gaussian variable and the unknown but bounded parameters are approximated by intervals. This results in an estimation problem that demands <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> mixed filters and a set-theoretic strategy. The attention is drawn on set inversion problems and constraint satisfaction problems. The former is <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> a method for solving interval equations, and the latter can significantly improve <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> interval based arithmetic and algorithms. An important contribution of this work consists in proposing an interval matrix inversion method which couples the algorithm SIVIA with <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a list of constraint propagation problems. The system model is formalized as an uncertain stochastic system. Starting with the interval Kalman filtering algorithm proposed in [Chen 1997] and that we name the IKF, an improved interval Kalman filtering algorithm (iIKF) is proposed. This algorithm is based on interval conditional expectation for interval linear systems. The iIKF has the same structure as the conventional Kalman filter while achieving <b>guaranteed</b> statistical optimality. <b>The</b> recursive computational scheme is developed in the set-membership context. Our improvements achieve guaranteed interval inversion whereas the original version IKF [Chen 1997] uses an instance (<b>the</b> upper bound) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interval matrix to avoid the possible singularity problems. This point of view leads to a sub-optimal solution that does not preserve guaranteed results, some solutions being lost. On the contrary, in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> unknown-but-bounded parameters and measurement statistical errors, our estimation approach in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iIKF provides <b>guaranteed</b> estimates, while maintaining a computational burden comparable to that of classic statistical approaches. Several constraint based techniques have also been implemented to limit the overestimation effect due to interval propagation within the interval Kalman filter recursive structure. The results have shown that the iIKF out puts bounded estimates that enclose all the solutions consistent with bounded errors and achieves good overestimation control. iIKF is used to propose a fault detection algorithm which makes use of a Semi-Closed Loop strategy which does not correct the state estimate with the measure as soon as a fault is detected. Two methods for generating fault indicators are proposed : they use the a priori state estimate and a threshold based on the a posteriori and a priori covariance matrix, respectively, and check the consistency against the measured output. Through different examples, <b>the</b> advantages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iIKF with respect to previous versions are exhibited and <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iIKF based Semi-Closed Loop fault detection algorithm is clearly demonstrated...|$|R
