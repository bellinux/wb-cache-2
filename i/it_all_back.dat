5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>back</b> to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E

25|$|On August 20, 1962, Dylan {{signed a}} {{contract}} which made Grossman his manager. Grossman also extended hospitality to Dylan {{at his home in}} Woodstock in upstate New York. Dylan liked the area so much he purchased a house there in 1965. The cover of Dylan's album Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home was photographed at Grossman's home in Woodstock. The woman in the cover photo with Dylan, in the red trouser suit, was Grossman's wife, Sally.

25|$|The {{expanded}} 30th anniversary {{edition of}} the 1965 official book, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation, was notable for its exclusion {{of most of the}} evidence against the map's authenticity, concentrating instead on vindications by George Painter, and Thomas Cahill with colleague Bruce Kusko (in which they claimed specifically that they had not analyzed the loose particles they took from the map {{at the time of their}} PIXE research), but it did reprint a remarkable essay written in 1989 by the original book dealer Laurence Witten. He stated that, when the McCrone investigation concluded the map to be a forgery in 1974, he was asked by Yale to reveal its provenance as a matter of urgency, and to discuss the possible return of Mr Mellon's money. He replied that he had no idea where the map came from, beyond Ferrajoli (who was convicted of theft shortly after the sale, and died shortly after release from prison). On the subject of the money, he said he could not pay <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>back</b> because he had paid agreed shares of his profit to Ferrajoli and to another dealer who had introduced him. For his part, Mellon did not ask for the return of any money. The essay also revealed that Witten had, on Ferrajoli's recommendation, met with Irving Davis after buying the map volume in 1957.|$|E
500|$|Dylan wrote [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] in {{the summer}} of 1964. Although he was {{prepared}} to take his time developing the song, as he did with [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", he finished it in time for inclusion on the Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home album, which was recorded in January 1965. Dylan first performed [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] live on October 10, 1964 at Philadelphia Town Hall. The version included on Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home was recorded on January 15, 1965, the same day that the other three songs on side 2 of the album ("Mr. Tambourine Man", [...] "Gates of Eden" [...] and [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue") were recorded, with Tom Wilson producing.|$|E

500|$|When Dylan {{made his}} move from {{acoustic}} folk and blues music {{to a rock}} backing, the mix became more complex.

500|$|The Bringing <b>it</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home {{version of}} [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was {{included}} on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits in 1967 and several later Dylan compilation albums, including Biograph, Masterpieces, and The Essential Bob Dylan.

500|$|The second side of Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home {{contained}} four long {{songs on}} which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] {{became one of}} his best known songs when the Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in the US and UK [...] [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] and [...] "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] were two of Dylan's most important compositions.|$|E
500|$|Twelve {{years after}} its release, Dylan said: [...] "The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on {{individual}} bands in the Blonde on Blonde album. It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up." [...] For critics, the double album {{was seen as the}} last installment in Dylan's trilogy of mid-1960s rock albums. As Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "The three albums of this period—Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home and Highway 61 Revisited both released in 1965, and Blonde on Blonde from 1966—used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn't approached before." [...] Mike Marqusee has described Dylan's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as [...] "a body of work that remains unique in popular music." [...] For Patrick Humphries, [...] "Dylan's body of work during the 14-months period... stands unequalled in rock's 30-year history. In substance, style, ambition and achievement, no one has even come close to matching Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was long}} {{thought that the}} four songs that make up side 2 of Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home were {{recorded}} in one long take.

500|$|Blonde on Blonde {{completed}} the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde {{as one of}} the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called [...] "a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial". It w{{as one of the}} first double albums in rock music.|$|E
500|$|The {{resulting}} album, Highway 61 Revisited, {{has been}} described as [...] "Dylan's first purely 'rock' album", a realization of his wish to leave his old music format behind and move on from his all-acoustic first four albums and half-acoustic, half-electric fifth album, Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home. Documentary director D. A. Pennebaker, who filmed Dylan on his acoustic UK tour in May 1965, has said: [...] "I didn't know {{that he was going to}} leave acoustic. I did know that he was getting a little dragged by it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{version of}} the song on the album is sparsely {{arranged}} with Dylan accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica, with William E. Lee playing bass guitar. Author Clinton Heylin states that the song is another of Dylan's [...] "'go out in the real world' songs, like [...] "To Ramona", though less conciliatory – the tone is crueler and more demanding." [...] As well as being the final track on Bringing <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Back</b> Home, [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] was also the final song to be recorded for the album.|$|E
