5|$|The {{fire spread}} {{quickly in the}} high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people {{abandoned}} attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for firemen and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but only reached St Paul's Cathedral before he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods {{were still on the}} move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which soon had to be moved further afield.|$|E
25|$|The Kayak Experience: After {{the second}} visitor {{death in the}} park's history in 1982 {{occurred}} at this ride, it was closed permanently. It was an imitation whitewater course that used submerged electric fans to agitate the water above. Frequently the kayaks got stuck or tipped over, and people <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of them to remedy the situation.|$|E
25|$|It transpired from Coast Guard radio logs {{that the}} ship's captain, Kim Gap Bong, had been {{repeatedly}} {{warned of the}} danger of trying to enter the harbor. The captain, however, was insistent that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the storm. Blue Magpies chief officer, Kang Tae Jung, later explained that their situation had been desperate. The ship had spent nine hours on a violent sea, and was in serious danger of capsizing.|$|E

50|$|Going Mobile is the series' {{first game}} for mobile phones. Ratchet and Clank are trapped inside the McGuFFin and they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> {{and draw}} the canoes overland, I suppose. Three hours will be lost, {{and in the}} very hottest of the day, too." ...|$|R
500|$|In a {{television}} interview, {{one of the}} NTSB investigators suggested that [...] "the captain was faced with quite a problem. If {{he wanted to be}} deiced a third time, he would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the line [...] and taxi {{all the way back to}} the parking area and meet up with a deicing truck again. That would have put him very, very late and it may have even caused the cancellation of the flight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Valerie Grove, who {{conceded that}} Metro-land was [...] "a kinder word than 'suburbia'" [...] and {{referred}} to the less spoilt areas beyond Rickmansworth as [...] "Outer Metro-land", maintained that [...] "suburbia had no visible history. Anyone with any spirit ... <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of Metro-land to make their mark".|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the Continental League {{became the}} OHA Senior A Hockey League. [...] The Huskies stayed for two seasons as the league filled with {{teams from the}} Continental League's more Toronto-based rival. [...] In 1982, the Huskies left the league in favour of a more local {{competitive}} base and more affordable players. [...] President of the Huskies, Steve Morris, claimed that the paying of players under the table was the biggest problem and why they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{will they}} come through this way? Faith, av' they do, they'll have as hard work <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in, as they'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> by and by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What,' he said, 'dress up {{that little}} wretch to {{represent}} me? Why, I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the country! My reputation will be ruined for ever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's nice to {{hear you}} say so," [...] she sighed. [...] "Well, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> here. This is where I live, up on the fourth floor." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Philips Record company's {{studio was}} slated as [...] "an {{extremely}} dead studio", {{it felt as}} though it had turned the treble down: [...] "There was no [...] and it was like singing in a padded cell. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of there". Springfield would end up in the ladies' toilets for its superior acoustics. Another example of refusal to use the studio is [...] "I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten" [...] – recorded {{at the end of a}} corridor.|$|E
2500|$|Marking Emotion as a {{transitional}} piece, Jepsen's intent to cultivate her sound was commended. In writing for Vulture, Lindsay Zolads contemplates Jepsen's career after the album: [...] "Maybe bona fide stardom {{was just something}} banal and predictable Jepsen <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the way early, freeing her up for a future of bolder aesthetic choices, unexpected left turns, and a joyful freedom from the pop game’s stuffy rules." [...] James Rettig of Stereogum writes, [...] "It feels like an autonomous artistic breakthrough for Jepsen, {{the start of a}} new chapter of her career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cohn {{expressed}} his frustration in a 1957 interview with Time magazine: [...] "Hayworth {{might be worth}} ten million dollars today easily! She owned 25% of the profits with her own company and had hit after hit {{and she had to}} get married and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the business and took a suspension because she fell in love again! In five years, at two pictures a year, at 25%! Think of what she could have made! But she didn't make pictures! She took two or three suspensions! She got mixed up with different characters! Unpredictable!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marry her! No, indeed. I am not mad. I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the scrape as best I can--always supposing {{my view of}} {{the lady}} is correct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A bear! I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here!" [...] he ejaculated, and {{snatching}} up his {{fish and}} {{line and the}} axe he started on {{a run for the}} shelter.|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't pay to {{know more}} than the boss," [...] he said; and {{then he looked at}} Weston. [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> What are you going to do?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Kirby {{joined the}} Lincoln Newspaper Syndicate in 1936, working there on {{newspaper}} comic strips and on single-panel advice cartoons such as Your Health Comes First!!! (under the pseudonym Jack Curtiss). He remained until late 1939, {{when he began}} working for the movie animation company Fleischer Studios as an inbetweener (an artist who fills in the action between major-movement frames) on Popeye cartoons. [...] "I went from Lincoln to Fleischer," [...] he recalled. [...] "From Fleischer I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> in a hurry because I couldn't take that kind of thing," [...] describing it as [...] "a factory in a sense, like my father's factory. They were manufacturing pictures." ...|$|E
2500|$|The trio of Calder, Simon and Lange {{decided in}} 1974 that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of South Africa. [...] "We were {{politically}} very much {{opposed to the}} old apartheid regime" [...] says Simon. [...] They pooled together what little money they had and moved to London. [...] Having landed {{right in the middle}} of the British punk rock movement, they felt their experience would not be best utilized in marketing and promotion in such a different context. [...] Instead, they opted to create a publishing company and Zomba Corporation was officially registered in Switzerland in 1975, operating out of Calder's bedroom space in London. [...] The name [...] "Zomba" [...] referred to the capital of African country Malawi (Lilongwe superseded Zomba as Malawi's capital in 1974).|$|E
2500|$|My {{studio is}} crammed with equipment, but I ended up feeling I was being {{overcome}} by it all—it {{was just too}} much. I {{used to go to}} bed every night thinking 'Tomorrow, I'm going to write the tune. Tomorrow {{is going to be the}} day', but nothing ever happened. Eventually Neil McLellan pointed out that we'd been in the studio for four months without having anything to show for it. [...] Nat [...] was doing her own record so we weren't spending a lot of time together , but [...] there were always dogs to stroke and videos to watch and gardens to walk 'round, so I didn't ever feel like I was at work—I was too laid-back. [...] Neil [...] said we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> get back to London. I knew I physically couldn't sit in my room any more, and for the first time in my life I listened to someone else and realised I actually needed help. It wasn't [...] that I needed help with the writing, just that I needed help finding the right headspace to get into the right frame of mind. I wanted to write a good album— one I was happy with—but to do that I knew I'd have to jerk myself out of [...] situation I was in and start again.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove, {{that is a}} scheme!" [...] exclaimed the rascally parent. [...] "Langless, {{will you}} do it? Of course, we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of sight until the proper moment arrives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> {{what are}} we to do?" [...] {{questioned}} Randy, soberly. [...] "I don't believe we can get work, unless we go into the woods as mere choppers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jim's right," [...] sighed the Wizard. [...] "There's {{going to}} be trouble, and my sword isn't stout enough to cut up those wooden bodies--so I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> my revolvers." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently John Barrow <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of {{the wagon}} to fix {{something}} on the harness. While {{he was doing this}} Dick leaned over to his two brothers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Complicated {{series of}} {{gestures}} and passes with the hands. That's {{how he had}} come in and that's how he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> again. Lord! what a business I had!" ...|$|E
60|$|The bundle was sewn together, and {{the doctor}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> his instrument-case, and cut the {{stitches}} with his medical scissors. It contained two things--a book and a sealed paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had a big}} quarrel {{after that}} raid, Ward," [...] {{explained}} the parent. [...] "And now those greasers have no use for us. We'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> and in a hurry, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bridge {{shook his}} head ruefully. [...] "We'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of this in a hurry now," [...] he said. [...] "That little {{defective}} will have the whole neighborhood on us in an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> Oliver," [...] it said. [...] "Clear {{out in your}} sloop {{with the}} folks you have with you and we'll let you go. You're mighty lucky in getting the option." ...|$|R
60|$|Wampus <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and crank the engines, {{which he}} calmly {{proceeded}} to do. The {{man who had}} called himself Algernon Tobey perceived his intention and urged his pony {{to the front of}} the car.|$|E
6000|$|... "More of them around!" [...] {{said the}} sailor grimly. [...] "There's trouble coming {{to them if}} they mean to corral us. Jake's at the side window, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of Mobile {{because he was too}} handy with his gun. Not often had to pull mine, but I can shoot some." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{all very}} well for common people. But the point was, Kemp, that I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of that house in a {{disguise}} without his seeing me. I couldn't think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet." ...|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Why, certainly! You must {{account for}} the request in some way. It'll appeal to his sympathy, and put him into a good-humor if he happens <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of bed <b>to</b> oblige you." ...|$|R
5000|$|But {{despite his}} close {{association}} with Ray, Sen has consciously avoided Ray's style of filmmaking. [...] "Ray is a fixation of Indian Filmmakers. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of his influence and make movies which are different", he says.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't help it," [...] was the reply. [...] "The {{insurance}} patrol has {{charge of}} the goods. You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the way. Lively, there!" [...] added the officer, as a hook and ladder truck came dashing up the street.|$|R
