5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the red-giant branch the Sun has {{approximately}} 120 {{million years}} of active life left, but much happens. First, the core, full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash, {{where it is}} estimated that 6% of the core, itself 40% of the Sun's mass, will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process. The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red clump or <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch,</b> but a star of the Sun's mass does not evolve blueward along the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch.</b> Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core.|$|E
5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as we know it.|$|E

5|$|The {{distances}} to star clusters {{can be estimated}} by using a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram or colour–colour diagram to calibrate the absolute magnitudes of the stars, for example fitting the main sequence or identifying features such as a <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch,</b> and hence their distance from Earth. It is also necessary to know the amount of interstellar extinction to the cluster and this can be difficult in regions such as the Carina Nebula. A distance of 7,330light-years (2,250parsecs) has been determined from the calibration of O-type star luminosities in Trumpler 16. After determining an abnormal reddening correction to the extinction, the distance to both Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 has been measured at 9,500±1000light-years (2,900±300parsecs).|$|E
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} fuel {{at the core}} of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it evolved into a red giant. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> star. That is, it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen. When helium was exhausted in the core a helium-burning shell formed in addition to {{the hydrogen}}-burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the asymptotic giant branch, or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.) If the star had sufficient mass, in time carbon fusion could begin in the core, producing oxygen, neon and magnesium.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} red giants are {{stars on the}} red-giant branch (RGB) that are still fusing {{hydrogen}} into helium in a shell surrounding an inert helium core. Other red giants are the red-clump stars in the cool half of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch,</b> fusing helium into carbon in their cores via the triple-alpha process; and the asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) stars with a helium burning shell outside a degenerate carbon–oxygen core, and a hydrogen burning shell just beyond that.|$|E

It is brown or pale blue in colour and appears similar to Acropora hoeksemai. Radial corallites have nariform or oval openings and generally do not {{come in contact with}} each other.|$|R
25|$|In the helium cores {{of stars}} in the 0.8 to 2.0 solar mass range, which are largely {{supported}} by electron degeneracy pressure, helium fusion will ignite on a timescale of days in a helium flash. In the nondegenerate cores of more massive stars, the ignition of helium fusion occurs relatively slowly with no flash. The nuclear power released during the helium flash is very large, {{on the order of}} 108 times the luminosity of the Sun for a few days and 1011 times the luminosity of the Sun (roughly the luminosity of the Milky Way Galaxy) for a few seconds. However, the energy is consumed by the thermal expansion of the initially degenerate core and thus cannot be seen from outside the star. Due to the expansion of the core, the hydrogen fusion in the overlying layers slows and total energy generation decreases. The star contracts, although not {{all the way to the}} main sequence, and it migrates to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, gradually shrinking in radius and increasing its surface temperature.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{star has}} evolved {{sufficiently}} {{to become a}} red giant, its circumstellar habitable zone will change dramatically from its main-sequence size. For example, the Sun is expected to engulf the previously-habitable Earth as a red giant. However, once a red giant star reaches the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch,</b> it achieves a new equilibrium and can sustain a new circumstellar habitable zone, which {{in the case of}} the Sun would range from 7 to 22 AU. At such stage, Saturn's moon Titan would likely be habitable in Earth's temperature sense. Given that this new equilibrium lasts for about 1 Gyr, and because life on Earth emerged by 0.7 Gyr from the formation of the Solar System at latest, life could conceivably develop on planetary mass objects in the habitable zone of red giants. However, around such a helium-burning star, important life processes like photosynthesis could only happen around planets where the atmosphere has been artificially seeded with carbon dioxide, as by the time a solar-mass star becomes a red giant, planetary-mass bodies would have already absorbed much of their free carbon dioxide.|$|E

500|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} breeds in well-grown, extensive {{areas of}} woodland, often coniferous or mixed, preferring forest with a structure neither too dense nor too open, {{to allow a}} choice of flight paths. The nest can {{be located in the}} fork of a tree, often near the trunk and where two or three branches begin, on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> in the lower canopy, or near the top of a tall shrub. If available, conifers are preferred. A new nest is built every year, generally close to the nest of the previous year, and sometimes using an old wood pigeon (A. n. melaschistos frequently uses the old nests of jungle crows) nest as a base; the male does most of the work. The structure, made of loose twigs up to [...] long, has an average diameter of [...] When the eggs are laid, a lining of fine twigs or bark chippings is added.|$|E
500|$|The {{species is}} {{apparently}} monogamous, having long-term relationships. Nests are built distanced from other nests. Although occasionally two nests are {{within a few}} meters, colonies do not occur. Males display during the breeding season, while seated on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch,</b> with fluttering wings helt low while calling loudly. Mating starts during the sixth day of nest building. The male chases away other birds from the nest, possibly to forestall the deposition of eggs by other couples or cuckoos. Eggs usually are produced between October and March, corresponding to the late dry season and raining season. Nest building may occur as early as August and does not always signal imminent breeding attempts. Nests are conspicuous, usually in the open and away from surrounding vegetation, attached from an often defoliated limb, bamboo stem or vine, hanging above a clearing or a stream at a height of [...] The nest is attached to its hold by a [...] long rope. It is shaped like a retort, having an oval nesting chamber [...] high and [...] in diameter and a vertical entrance hose is attached high up a side and {{is at least as}} long as the nest is high. It is a firm construction made from strips of grass, sedge, and palm fronds, with a thin lining of palm fibres {{at the bottom of the}} nesting chamber. The male constructs the structure of the nest while the female brings lining material. The total time used to construct the nest is approximately twelve days. A clutch consists of one to four (most often three) oval, smooth, somewhat shiny, variably pale blue-green eggs of about 20½mm (0.8in) long and [...] in diameter. The eggs are incubated only by the female for fifteen days before hatching. The male lacks brood patches. Both parents feed the chicks and remove fecal sacs.|$|E
2500|$|Core helium flash stars evolve {{to the red}} end of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> but do not {{migrate to}} higher {{temperatures}} before they gain a degenerate carbon-oxygen core and start helium shell burning. [...] These stars are often observed as a red clump of stars in the colour-magnitude diagram of a cluster, hotter and less luminous than the red giants. Higher-mass stars with larger helium cores move along the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> to higher temperatures, some becoming unstable pulsating stars in the yellow instability strip (RR Lyrae variables), whereas some become even hotter and can form a blue tail or blue hook to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch.</b> The morphology of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> depends on parameters such as metallicity, age, and helium content, but the exact details are still being modelled.|$|E

2500|$|Mid-sized {{stars are}} red giants during two {{different}} phases of their post-main-sequence evolution: red-giant-branch stars, whose inert cores {{are made of}} helium, and asymptotic-giant-branch stars, whose inert cores are made of carbon. [...] Asymptotic-giant-branch stars have helium-burning shells inside the hydrogen-burning shells, whereas red-giant-branch stars have hydrogen-burning shells only. [...] Between these two phases, stars spend a period on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> with a helium-fusing core. [...] Many of these helium-fusing stars cluster towards the cool end of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> as K-type giants and {{are referred to as}} red clump giants.|$|E
2500|$|Red giants are {{stars that}} have {{exhausted}} {{the supply of}} hydrogen in their cores and have begun thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell surrounding the core. They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger {{than that of the}} Sun. However, their outer envelope is lower in temperature, giving them a reddish-orange hue. Despite the lower energy density of their envelope, red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun because of their great size. Red-giant-branch stars have luminosities up to nearly three thousand times that of the Sun (...) , spectral types of K or M, have surface temperatures of 3,000–4,000 K, and radii up to about 200 times the Sun (...) [...] Stars on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> are hotter, with only a small range of luminosities around [...] Asymptotic-giant-branch stars range from similar luminosities as the brighter stars of the red giant branch, up to several times more luminous {{at the end of the}} thermal pulsing phase.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evolutionary}} path {{the star}} takes {{as it moves}} along the red-giant branch, that ends finally with the complete collapse of the core, depends on {{the mass of the}} star. For the Sun and stars of less than about [...] the core will become dense enough that electron degeneracy pressure will prevent it from collapsing further. Once the core is degenerate, it will continue to heat until it reaches a temperature of roughly 108K, hot enough to begin fusing helium to carbon via the triple-alpha process. Once the degenerate core reaches this temperature, the entire core will begin helium fusion nearly simultaneously in a so-called helium flash. In more-massive stars, the collapsing core will reach 108K before it is dense enough to be degenerate, so helium fusion will begin much more smoothly, and produce no helium flash. The core helium fusing phase of a star's life is called the <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch</b> in metal-poor stars, so named because these stars lie on a nearly horizontal line in the H–R diagram of many star clusters. Metal-rich helium-fusing stars instead lie on the so-called red clump in the H–R diagram.|$|E

2500|$|Sittellas forage on {{horizontal}} {{branches and}} {{the trunks of}} trees. Their foraging techniques {{has been described as}} hopping rapidly along the length of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>branch,</b> pausing briefly to peer for prey, occasionally hanging underneath the branch but usually on top of it. Most of the time is spent on branches rather than on the trunks. Birds on the trunks may travel upwards or downwards. Within the forest sittellas usually forage in the canopy. There are sexual differences in foraging, with males and females choosing to forage in slightly different microhabitats within the tree. Prey items are usually gleaned directly from the bark, although in a few instances sittellas will sally from the branch in order to snatch aerial prey. Having obtained prey sittellas will use their feet to hold it while they eat it, in a similar manner to parrots, and will also use their feet in order to hold back strips of bark in order to pry underneath it. [...] There have even been isolated reports of tool use in some populations of sittellas. Sticks were used to pry boring beetle larvae out of cavities, in a similar fashion to that of tool using woodpecker finches of the Galapagos.|$|E
