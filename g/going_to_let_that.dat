25|$|In 1996, Ungdomshuset was {{ravaged by}} fire {{destroying}} {{much of the}} interior. The city council used this opportunity {{as an excuse for}} closing down the house claiming that the building were no longer fit for human use. But the users were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> happen. They started renovating the house themselves and after six months the house was reopened for the public. The city counsel protested about this but after the city building inspectors had inspected the house they found the house in an even better state of repair than before the fire. The city counsel then had to withdraw their protest.|$|E
500|$|Barker was {{released}} from a local emergency room after three hours of treatment and observation for a concussion and an eye that had swollen shut. The emergency physician's record shows that he also had injuries to his face, ears, and hand. He [...] attended his school's class ring ceremony and dance that evening. He later testified, [...] "I waited 11years to go to it. I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> get in my way." [...] He left the dance early due to pain. During the trial, Barker testified that his face was badly swollen after the attack and that he suffered a loss of vision in one eye for three weeks. He {{said that he had}} suffered recurring headaches and forgetfulness since the attack.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do. I was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> happen with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Russell {{waved his}} {{objections}} aside. [...] "I can get round her," [...] he said, with cheery confidence. [...] "I ain’t kept ferrets {{all these years}} for nothing. I’m not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> all <b>that</b> money slip through my fingers {{for want of a}} little trying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little girl," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are very}} good to me, and I think you understand. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me feel <b>that</b> I have found a friend on my first evening in London?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} good. But {{if you think}} I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you use <b>that</b> you're very much mistaken. No, Brice! Don't you touch papa. He wouldn't like it; he wouldn't {{understand}} it. Why, what a perfect cormorant you are!" ...|$|R
500|$|While Disney {{executives}} {{had discussed}} closing Feature Animation as redundant, Catmull and Lasseter refused and instead resolved {{to try to}} turn things around at the studio. Lasseter said [...] "we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> [...] happen on our watch. We were determined to save the legacy of Walt Disney's amazing studio and bring it back up to the creative level it had to be. Saving this heritage was squarely on our shoulders." [...] Lasseter and Catmull set about rebuilding the morale of the Feature Animation staff, and rehired a number of its 1980s [...] "new guard" [...] generation of star animators who had left the studio, including Ron Clements, John Musker, Eric Goldberg, Mark Henn, Andreas Deja, Bruce W. Smith, and Chris Buck. To maintain the separation of Feature Animation and Pixar despite their now common ownership and management, Catmull and Lasseter [...] "drew a hard line" [...] that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and {{would not be allowed to}} borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other. Catmull said that he and Lasseter [...] "make sure the studios are quite distinct from each other. We don’t want them to merge; that would definitely be the wrong approach. Each should have its own personality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pink {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} approximately 30 to 35 songs for Funhouse. [...] "It's like {{getting rid of}} your children: 'I like that one too, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> one die,'" [...] she said of choosing the album's tracks. [...] "The good thing now is that different countries want extra songs and B-sides, so there's always {{a home for the}} other kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heaney {{planned on}} the 2002 Salt Lake Games being her final tournament. She ended her {{international}} career with an Olympic gold medal after Canada defeated the United States 3–2 in the final. The final was controversial as the American referee called 13 {{of the final}} 16 penalties in the game against Canada. Heaney described {{the feeling of the}} Canadian players following the game: [...] "We got an unbelievable number of penalties. We never had any idea that could happen. [...] tried to give them the game, and we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> happen." [...] In addition to celebrations in Canada, Heaney was recognized as a sporting hero in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|ESPN's Mike Breen, {{who called}} the Finals for ABC, added: [...] "It's {{just another example of}} how he's just not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them lose. <b>That</b> was the thought as well after he blocked the shot: This guy is just not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> this team lose tonight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] I cried, [...] "you surely don't think I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you do <b>that!</b> Keep safely {{out of the}} way {{while you}} tell him! Not much. I'm coming back with you now, and we'll break the bad news together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good gracious!" [...] said Miss Garland. [...] "Whatever {{could have}} put such an idea as that into your head? Of course, aunt isn't always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> uncle see <b>that</b> she agrees with him. Still, as if anybody could help--" [...] she murmured to herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I'm {{sure they}} won't. And now's the time, George. You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> fellow Brisket {{run off with}} Maryanne from before your eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{mother was}} alarmed {{when she saw}} the dog. 'Surely you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> brute loose about the house!' she exclaimed. 'He'll kill somebody. I can see it in his face.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I have. You didn't suppose I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> fellow get {{the better}} of me. Why should I be turned out because he had made an ass of himself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it's different. He is very handsome, in {{a certain}} way." [...] The {{daughter}} said nothing, and the mother added: [...] "I wonder if {{he was trying to}} conceal that he had come second-cabin, and was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> us know <b>that</b> he crossed with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had some}} trouble {{just before you}} came on board. Mr. Van Blott wanted some things done one way and I wanted them another. He thinks he can run things, but I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him {{understand}} <b>that</b> I am master here. I tell you this, because I {{want you to understand}} how matters are going." ...|$|R
60|$|I must say, madam, {{that at that}} minute I was {{a little}} humble-minded, for I don't mind confessing {{to you that the}} idea of one American woman {{plunging}} into a conflict that had frightened off three English women, and coming out victorious, had a good deal to do with my trying to drive away those hogs; and now that I had come out of the little end of the horn, just as the young women had, I felt pretty small, but I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them see <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Charlie shot a {{quick look}} at his mother, who exclaimed, as if in spite of herself, [...] "Now, Alec, are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> girl squander a fine fortune on all sorts of {{charitable}} nonsense and wild schemes for the prevention of pauperism and crime?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Glegg," [...] said Mrs. G., in a fatal tone, [...] "if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> {{man and his}} dog in on my carpet, {{before my}} very face, be so good as to let me know. A wife's got a right to ask that, I hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Clarence, I am {{simply not}} going to let you go in. You are sick enough as it is, and if you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> awful old man spend the whole evening here, and drain the life out of you! I will see him, and tell him"-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, [...] "The {{movie is}} not plot-driven, {{for which we}} must be thankful, because to force their {{feelings}} into a plot would {{be a form of}} cruelty. The whole point is that these lives have no plot. The characters and their situation are on stage and waiting for something to happen, but Josh Sternfeld, the writer-director, isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them off <b>that</b> easily. If this movie ended in hugs, it would be an abomination [...] [...] [...] Sternfeld [...] [...] [...] knows he will have more effect on us if he denies us closure." ...|$|R
50|$|Two retired sailors, Wally and Skipper, are old workmates {{and best}} friends for 40 years now living {{at an old}} folks’ home in Norway. One day, Wally finds Skipper dead and he wants a burial at sea, the old-fashioned way, as he promised him. Wally isn’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the fact <b>that</b> he doesn’t have a boat, any money or, for that matter, a body, stop him from keeping his word; and so he takes his friends May, George and Nina on a bold mission to send the coffin {{to the bottom of}} the North Sea. However, Ms. Reimark, the {{administrator}} of the local retirement community where Wally lives, has other plans for him and the deceased.|$|R
5000|$|John Ross {{mentioned}} to JR that Sue Ellen {{is putting the}} moves on his little brother Gary. Jealousy getting the better of him, JR sends Sue Ellen a handful of letters that they had sent to each other while they were dating. Sue Ellen believes that JR is up to his old tricks {{and that he is}} simply just trying to manipulate her. Defiant, Sue Ellen tells John Ross that she is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him do <b>that</b> <b>to</b> her. Among the old correspondences, is a new hand written letter by JR to Sue Ellen. There is no addresses on the envelop, it's simply says [...] "Sue Ellen" [...] in JR's hand writing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I remember," [...] {{said the}} landlord. [...] "Just {{the end of}} the season, when two vixens had litters in the wood! You don't suppose Bean was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> old butcher, Tony, find a fox in Dillsborough at that time." [...] Bean was his lordship's head {{gamekeeper}} {{in that part of the}} country. [...] "How many foxes had we found there during the season?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I didn't have to look,' was Lyte's answer. 'I {{knew they}} were two clubs all the time. They just had to be two clubs. Do you think I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> big Dutchman beat me? It was {{impossible}} that he should beat me. It is not my way to be beaten. I just have to win. Why, I'd {{have been the most}} surprised man in this world if they hadn't been all clubs.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|He saw {{the flush}} in Nasmyth's face, and his gaze grew insistent. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> content you, {{now you can}} hear the river. You'll hear it more and more plainly {{frothing}} in the black cañon where the big trees come down. You have lived with the exiles, and the wilderness has got its grip on you. What's more, I guess when it does that it never quite lets go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, so do we. And there's {{about as}} much {{prospect}} of his marrying her. Rufus, it's pretty hard! She's just {{in the mood to}} be taken with him, but she won't let herself, because she knows it's of no use. That Miss Rasmith has been telling her how much he is run after, and I could see that that settled it for Ellen as plainly as if she said so. More plainly, for there's enough of the girl in her to make her say one thing when she means another. She was just saying she was sick of him, and never wanted to speak to him again, when he came up and asked her to walk, and she went with him instantly. I knew what she meant. She wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him suppose <b>that</b> anything Miss Rasmith had said was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change her." ...|$|R
6000|$|People {{looked back}} at these tomboys when they had got by; and some shabby young fellows {{exchanged}} saucy speeches with them. When Lemuel {{got up and walked}} away in reproving dignity, one of the hoydens bounced into his place, and they both sent a cry of derision after him. But Lemuel would not give them the satisfaction of <b>letting</b> them know <b>that</b> he heard them, {{and at the same time}} he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them suppose <b>that</b> they had driven him away. He went very slowly down to the street where a great many horse-cars were passing to and fro, and waited for one marked [...] "Fitchburg, Lowell, and Eastern Depots." [...] He was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take it; but he meant to follow it on its way to those stations, in the neighbourhood of which was the hotel where he had left his travelling-bag. He had told them that he might take a room there, or he might not; now since he had this half-dollar extra he thought that he would stay for the night; it probably would not be any cheaper at the other hotels.|$|R
5000|$|Clark-Cole {{makes it}} known that she hasn’t always been {{at such a}} joyous place in her life by testifying about a very trying {{time in her life}} when she once {{contemplated}} suicide. She recounts, “At that time my mother was not with me to help me get through that rough time. We were always dependent on our mom because she was always there… I didn’t understand why it was happening to me…It was very devastating. And it caused me to go into a state of depression…I just couldn’t take it anymore and I got into my car and I began to drive to the river. I was about to drive my car off the bridge. And while I was right there…the enemy was speaking to me, so I had a war going on. I began to drive and accelerate up to 80 miles per hour. God spoke to me just as plain as day and said, ‘Dorinda, are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> everything <b>that</b> has been invested in you go down the drain?’ And when I heard God’s voice, I began to take my foot off the accelerator and the car started coasting right to the bridge. And the Lord whispered to me and said, ‘Peace be unto you.’ And that’s when I grabbed the steering wheel and I said, Lord I thank you. I began to weep and cry. So {{if it had not been}} for God keeping me right then I would have been doomed and consumed. I want it to reach those who are strung out on drugs. I want them to be able to hand it over to other drug abusers and say listen to it and have it bless their lives.” ...|$|R

Are ye <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who's that been dropping an anchor overboard-- we don't budge an inch--we're becalmed. Halloo, here's grass growing in the boat's bottom--and by the Lord, the mast there's budding. This won't do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{where did}} he get it? And who made it? And don't {{you know that your}} brother Tom had his share of it, and wasted it all? Did it not all come from the Balls? And yet you think so little of that, that you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>that</b> woman rob you of it--rob you and my grandchildren; for that, I tell you, {{is the way in which}} the world will look at it. Perhaps you don't know it, but all that {{property}} was as good as given to John at one time. Who was it first took you by the hand when you were left all alone in Arundel Street? Oh, Margaret, don't go and be such an ungrateful, foolish creature!" ...|$|E

And if they don't like her they've got to put up with her. I shall talk to the both of them." [...] A wave of motherliness towards the entire Phillips family passed over her. It {{included}} Hilda. She caught the child to her and gave her a hug. [...] "You go back to school," [...] she said, [...] "and get on as fast as you can, so that you'll be able to be useful to him." ...|$|E
5000|$|At Watkins Glen, Allmendinger {{took the}} lead with less than 30 laps to go after a {{side-by-side}} battle with former teammate Marcos Ambrose and kept the lead until the checkered flag, earning his first Sprint Cup Series win after 213 Sprint Cup starts, leading 30 laps in the process. [...] "My gosh, I can't believe we won a NASCAR Sprint Cup race. This whole 47 team... all the sponsors, my first Cup victory. I love these guys. I just wanted it so bad for them. For this team. They worked so hard. I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Marcos take <b>that</b> from me. I hope the fans loved that race and at home. Because it was fun in the race car." [...] Ambrose commented on Allmendinger's win: [...] "First of all, congratulations to A. J. and the 47 team. They deserved that win. I left nothing on the table. I tried to rattle his cage and couldn't shake him. We raced fair and square to the end there. It was a tough couple laps but it was fair. We were both giving it to each other pretty hard. No harm, no foul. We just came up a little short." [...] Before the race, Allmendinger had announced that Kimberly-Clark Corporation (consisting of Scott, Viva, Kleenex, Cottonelle and Huggies brands) extended its sponsorship agreement with the team through 2017.|$|R
6000|$|He left {{me at this}} hint, though really I {{was half}} afraid he might stay and offer to lend me a hand at my toilet, in the {{expression}} of his national character. I found him with Mrs. Makely, when I went down, and she began, with a parenthetical tribute to {{the beauty of the}} mountains in the morning light: [...] "Don't be surprised to see me up at this unnatural hour. I don't know whether it was the excitement of our talk last night, or what it was, but my sulphonal wouldn't act, though I took fifteen grains, and I was up with the lark, or should have been, if there had been any lark outside of literature to be up with. However, this air is so glorious that I don't mind losing a night's sleep now and then. I believe that with a little practice one could get along without any sleep at all here; at least, I could. I'm sorry to say poor Mr. Makely can't, apparently. He's making up for his share of my vigils, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> breakfast without him. Do you know, I've done a very bold thing: I've got the head-waiter to give you places at our table; I know you'll hate it, Mr. Twelvemough, because you naturally want to keep Mr. Homos to yourself, and I don't blame you at all; but I'm simply not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you, and <b>that's</b> all there is about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{snapshot}} tendency {{was promoted}} by John Szarkowski, who {{was head of}} the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art from 1962 to 1991, and it became especially fashionable from the late 1970s until the mid-1980s. Notable practitioners include Garry Winogrand, Nan Goldin, Wolfgang Tillmans, Martin Parr, William Eggleston, and Terry Richardson. In contrast with photographers like W. Eugene Smith and Gordon Parks, these photographers aimed [...] "not to reform life, but to know it." [...] Frank has said [...] "I was tired of romanticism, [...] [...] [...] [...] I wanted to present what I saw, pure and simple." [...] Szarkowski brought to prominence the work of Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand in his influential exhibition “New Documents” at the Museum of Modern Art in 1967, in which he identified a new trend in photography: pictures that seemed to have a casual, snapshot-like look and had subject matter that seemed strikingly ordinary. Winogrand has said [...] "When I'm photographing, I see life, [...] [...] [...] [...] That's what I deal with. I don't have pictures in my head… I don't worry about how the picture is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> look. I <b>let</b> <b>that</b> take care of itself… It's not about making a nice picture.
