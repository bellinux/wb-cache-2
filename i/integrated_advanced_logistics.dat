Our purpose is not to make an exhaustive description of the French situation, but to give an understandable view of the current state of those systems. The paper first defines what we call “logistics” in France and in which way it is integrated in firms management (chapter 1). It also points out some geographic, economic and regulation characteristics of French situation that have significant impacts on the development of <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> (chapter 2). It briefly presents the most relevant <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> organisations in manufacturing, distribution, and logistics supply. It points out the so-called “driving forces” which lead French firms to develop such systems (chapter 3). The paper then focuses on <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> characteristics observed in France, and presents the main information and communication systems that are at their basis (chapter 4). As a conclusion, it presents the main difficulties that firms still have to overcome to develop <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> and its further developments...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{management}} of DOE`s transportation operations requires better data than are currently available, a more integrated management structure for making transportation decisions, and decision support tools to provide needed analysis capabilities. This paper describes {{a vision of}} an <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> management system for DOE, and the rationale for developing improved modeling and simulation capability {{as an integral part}} of that system. The authors illustrate useful types of models through four examples, addressing issues of transportation package allocation, fleet sizing, routing/scheduling, and emergency responder location.

40|$|The study aims to {{investigate}} the <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> supply chain for food management using green logistics. To protect the food logistics environment and prevent the environmental pollution, {{it is crucial to}} establish powerful modern supply chains to support the food management in transportation. The construction speed of the food companies is very fast; however, the food supply lags behind the food companies. As a result, the environmental pollution caused in the food logistics becomes severe. To improve this situation, a new logistics supply chain for food management using the environmental logistics theory is proposed in this study. The design and analysis of the proposed food supply chain system has been introduced. By the use of <b>advanced</b> environmental <b>logistics</b> theory, the food supply can be operated in an effective and green manner. Hence, the proposed new logistics supply chain can reduce the environmental pollution of the food logistics and improve the food market environment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Advanced</b> <b>Logistics</b> Services (ALSs) {{have emerged}} as an {{indispensable}} element in Global Value Chains (GVCs). By adapting to shipper demand, logistics services providers facilitate the expansion of world trade. Firms focus on cost-cutting measures, including outsourcing of logistics activities. This often means outsourcing some of their logistics activities to so-called Third- and Fourth-Party Logistics (3 PL or 4 PL) providers. This paper focuses {{on the role of}} ALS in connection to GVCs or Global Production Networks (GPNs). The term 'Logistics Value Chain' (LVC) is used to illustrate the complex market structure and division of work that has emerged between various service providers in the market for ALS. Recent development in East Asia, and also in other developing economies, is similar to what happened in western Europe over the past 20 years. Logistics Service Providers (LSPs) can take advantage of these experiences, well-functioning LVCs rely on two components: (1) committed and effective transport and Customs authorities and related policy-making; and (2) competitive logistics services. These two are essential for local producers – typically Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) – to connect to GPNs. The absence of effective logistics markets is a serious obstacle for firms wishing to internationalise, which often leads to sustained poverty. <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> services; ALSs; global value chains; GVCs; third-party logistics; fourth-party logistics; 3 PL; 4 PL; warehousing; transport; freight forwarding; developing countries; global production networks; GPNs; logistics value chain; LVC; logistics service providers; small and medium-sized enterprises; SMEs. ...|$|R
