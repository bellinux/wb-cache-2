60|$|Thus, my lord, I have {{at length}} {{disengaged}} myself from those antiquities of Greece, and have proved, I hope, {{from the best}} critics, that the Roman satire was not borrowed from thence, but of their own manufacture.

60|$|I {{mention this}} story also {{as the best}} method I can advise any person to take in such a case, {{especially}} if he be one that makes conscience of his duty, and would be directed {{what to do in}} it, namely, that he should keep his eye upon the particular providences which occur at that time, and look upon them complexly, as they regard one another, and as all together regard the question before him: and then, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> safely take them for intimations from Heaven of what is his unquestioned duty to do in such a case; I mean as to going away from or staying in the place where we dwell, when visited with an infectious distemper.|$|E

6000|$|The {{election}} {{was of course}} pointed to by rejoicing conservatives as a proof the more of that reaction which the ministerial and radical press was audacious enough to laugh at. This borough, says the local journalist, was led away by the bubble reform, to support those who by specious and showy qualification had dazzled their eyes; delusion had vanished, shadows satisfied no longer, Newark was restored to its high place in the esteem of the friends of order and good government. Of course the intimates of the days of his youth were delighted. We want such a man as Gladstone, wrote Hallam to Gaskell (October 1, 1832); 'in some things {{he is likely to}} be obstinate and prejudiced; but he has a fine fund of high chivalrous tory sentiment, and a tongue, moreover, to let it loose with. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> do a great deal.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Exeter Coll., Nov. 2, 1847.--This {{morning in}} company with Sir R. [...] Inglis, {{and under the}} {{protection}} or chaperonage of the dean, I have [...] made the formal circuit of visits to all the heads of houses and [...] all the common-rooms. It has gone off very well. There was but one [...] reception by a head (Corpus) that was not decidedly kind, and [...] that was only a little cold. Marsham (Merton), who is a frank, warm [...] man, keenly opposed, said very fairly, to Inglis, 'I congratulate [...] you warmly'; and then to me, 'And I would be very glad to do the [...] same to you, Mr. Gladstone, if I could think you {{would do the same}} [...] as Sir R. Inglis.' I like a man for this. They say the dean should [...] have asked me to dine to-day, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be, and perhaps [...] wisely, afraid of recognising me in any very marked way, for fear [...] of endangering the old Christ Church right to one seat which it is [...] his peculiar duty to guard.|$|E
60|$|And here {{we come to}} the division: {{not only}} do I believe that {{literature}} should give joy, but I see a universe, I suppose, eternally different from yours; a solemn, a terrible, but a very joyous and noble universe, where suffering is not at least wantonly inflicted, though it falls with dispassionate partiality, but where it may be and generally is nobly borne; where, above all (this I believe; probably you don't: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may,</b> with cancer), ANY BRAVE MAN MAY MAKE out a life which shall be happy for himself, and, by so being, beneficent to those about him. And if he fails, why should I hear him weeping? I mean if I fail, why should I weep? Why should YOU hear ME? Then to me morals, the conscience, the affections, and the passions are, I will own frankly and sweepingly, so infinitely more important than the other parts of life, that I conceive men rather triflers who become immersed in the latter; and I will always think the man who keeps his lip stiff, and makes 'a happy fireside clime,' and carries a pleasant face about to friends and neighbours, infinitely greater (in the abstract) than an atrabilious Shakespeare or a backbiting Kant or Darwin. No offence to any of these gentlemen, two of whom probably (one for certain) came up to my standard.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{that is not}} likely," [...] replied Jack; [...] "for I {{climbed a}} high tree and saw the savages recrossing the plain alone. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it {{probable}} <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have lost his way, and is afraid to climb trees or to fire off his gun to signal us, {{for fear of being}} heard or seen by the niggers.

6000|$|... "He {{may be in}} Buckingham Palace; <b>he</b> <b>may</b> {{be sitting}} astride the cross of St Paul's; <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be in jail (which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> most likely); <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be in the Great Wheel; <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be in my pantry; <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be in your store cupboard; but {{out of all the}} innumerable points of space, there is only one where he has just been {{systematically}} looked for and where we know that he is not to be found--and that, if I understand you rightly, is where you want us to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|The old soldier mused {{for a long}} time--looked up to the ceiling, {{then down}} again upon the floor--then shook his head--and at length said, [...] "There is {{something}} in all this, which, by my honour, I do not understand. The Countess Isabelle of Croye!--an interview with a lady of her birth, blood, and possessions!--and thou a raw Scottish lad, so certain of carrying thy point with her? Thou art either strangely confident, my young friend, or else you have used your time well upon the journey. But, by the cross of Saint Andrew, I will move Crevecoeur in thy behalf; and, as he truly fears that Duke Charles may be provoked against the King to the extremity of falling foul, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it likely <b>he</b> <b>may</b> grant thy request, though, by my honour, it is a comical one!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am quite}} content with that {{paragraph}} {{for the purpose}} of any controversy about what is called German atrocity. If men I know had not told me they had themselves seen the bayoneting of a baby; if the most respectable refugees did not bring with them stories of burning cottages--yes, and of burning cottagers as well; if doctors did not report what they do report of the condition of girls in the hospitals; if there were no facts; if there were no photographs, that one phrase I have quoted would be quite sufficient to satisfy me that the Prussians are tyrants; tyrants in a peculiar and almost insane sense which makes them pre-eminent among the evil princes of the earth. The first and most striking feature is a stupidity that rises into a sort of ghastly innocence. The protection of workmen! Some workmen, perhaps, might have a fancy for being protected from shrapnel; some might be glad to put up an umbrella that would ward off things dropping from the gentle Zeppelin in heaven upon the place beneath. Some of these discontented proletarians have taken the same view as Vandervelde their leader, and are now energetically engaged in protecting themselves along the line of the Yser; I am glad to say not altogether without success. It is probable that nearly all of the Belgian workers would, on the whole, prefer to be protected against bombs, sabres, burning cities, starvation, torture, and the treason of wicked kings. In short, it is probable--it is at least possible, impious as is the idea--that they would prefer to be protected against Germans and all they represent. But if a Belgian workman is told that he is not to be protected against Germans, but actually to be protected by Germans, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be excused for staring. His first impulse, I imagine, will be to ask, [...] "Against whom? Are there any worse people to come along?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We may see at {{once that}} this man has been very handsome; {{but it is a}} {{peculiar}} sort of beauty. How delicate and graceful all the lines in his face are!--he is a gentleman of God's own making, and not of the tailor's making. He is such a gentleman as I have seen among working men and nine- shilling-a-week labourers, often and often; his nobleness is in his heart--it is God's gift, therefore it shows in his noble looking face. No matter whether he were poor or rich; all the rags in the world, all the finery in the world, could not have made him look like a snob or a swell. He was a thoughtful man, too; no one with such a forehead could have been a trifler: a kindly man, too, and honest--one that may have played merrily enough with his grandchildren, and put his hand in his purse for many a widow and orphan. Look what a bright, clear, straightforward, gentle look he has, almost a smile; but he has gone through too many sad hours to smile much: {{he is a man of}} many sorrows, like all true and noble rulers; and, like a high mountain-side, his face bears the furrows of many storms. He has had a stern life of it, with the cares of a great nation on his shoulders. He has seen that in this world there is no rest for those who live like true men: you may see it by the wrinkles in his brow, and the sharp-cut furrows in his cheeks, and those firm-set, determined lips. His eyes almost show the marks of many noble tears,--tears such as good men shed over their nation's sins; but that, too, is past now. He has found out his path, and he will keep it; and he has no misgiving now about what God would have him do, or about the reward which God has laid up for the brave and just; and that is what makes his forehead so clear and bright, while his very teeth are clenched with calm determination. And by the look of those high cheek bones, and that large square jaw, he is a strong-willed man enough, and not one to be easily turned aside from his purpose by any man alive, or by any woman either, or by his own passions and tempers. One fault of character, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> perhaps have had much trouble with--I mean bitterness and contemptuousness. His lips are very thin; he may have sneered many a time, when he was younger, at the follies of the world which that great, lofty, thoughtful brain and clear eye of his told him were follies; but he seems to have got past that too. Such is the man's character: a noble, simple, commanding old man, who has conquered many hard things, and, hardest of all, has conquered himself, and now is waiting calm for his everlasting rest. God send us all the same.|$|E

However, Carter {{discovered}} four games into the season that he had torn cartilage in his left knee attributed to his body compensating for his 2007 PCL injury. Although unable to practice most of the year, he continued {{to play with the}} injury. Carter had nine catches for 96 yards and two touchdowns to help UC Davis win the Great West title in a 28-20 victory against North Dakota. For the season, Carter recorded 85 receptions—the second highest total in school history—for 889 yards and four touchdowns. He was named the 2009 Great West Offensive Player of the Year. Carter finished his career as the Aggies career reception leader (213).

6000|$|Early in February Captain Marrable went to Dunripple to {{stay with}} his uncle, Sir Gregory, and there he still was when the middle of March had come. News of his doings reached the ladies at Loring, but it reached them through hands which were not held to be worthy of a perfect belief,--at any rate, on Mary Lowther's part. Dunripple Park is in Warwickshire, and lies {{in the middle of}} a good hunting country. Now, {{according}} to Parson John, from whom these tidings came, Walter Marrable was hunting three days a week; and, as Sir Gregory himself did not keep hunters, Walter must have hired his horses,--so said Parson John, deploring that a nephew so poor in purse should have allowed himself to be led into such heavy expense. [...] "He brought home a little ready money with him," [...] said the parson; [...] "and <b>I</b> suppose <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have his fling as long as that lasts." [...] No doubt Parson John, in saying this, was desirous of proving to Mary that Walter Marrable was not dying of love, and was, upon the whole, leading a jolly life, in spite of the little misfortune that had happened to him. But Mary understood all this quite as well as did Parson John himself; and simply declined to believe the hunting three days a week. She said not a word about it, however, either to him or to her aunt. If Walter could amuse himself, so much the better; but she was quite sure that, at such a period of his life as this, he would not spend his money recklessly. The truth lay between Parson John's stories and poor Mary's belief. Walter Marrable was hunting,--perhaps twice a week, hiring a horse occasionally, but generally mounted by his uncle, Sir Gregory. He hunted; but did so after a lugubrious fashion, as became a man with a broken heart, who was laden with many sorrows, and had just been separated from his lady love for ever and ever. But still, when there came anything good, in the way of a run, and when our Captain could get near to hounds, he enjoyed the fun, and forgot his troubles for a while. Is a man to know no joy because he has an ache at his heart? ...|$|R
