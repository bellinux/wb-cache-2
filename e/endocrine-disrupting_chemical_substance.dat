40|$|The European Commission has {{presented}} a draft on how <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> (“endocrine disruptors”, ED) {{contained in the}} active ingredients of pesticides and biocides can be identified using harmonised scientific criteria. The definition of these criteria is a binding foundation for the regulation of ED in order to warrant {{a high level of}} consumers protection. The draft considers suggestions on hazard identification of ED which scientists developed in April in the course of an international conference organised by BfR and held in Berlin. According to these suggestions, a comprehensive scientific analysis with regard to the definition of the WHO must be carried out when identifying such substances, and the insights must be weighted based on their conclusiveness, (weight-of evidence approach). The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has recommended for many years that for ED the principle of “one substance – one assessment” must apply. The institute is of the opinion that the assessment criteria which the European Commission has recommended for pesticides and biocides should be applicable to all naturally occurring and synthetically produced substances that {{have a negative effect on}} the body’s hormone system. BfR recommends that harmonised technical guidelines are developed in order to enable transparent and safe identification of <b>chemical</b> <b>substances.</b> In order to ensure a high level of protection, a given ED should be identified on the basis of the weight-of evidence approach which, among other things, takes into account the quality, reliability, reproducibility and conclusiveness of the scientific evidence. BfR welcomes that, in addition to the mentioned criteria, the communication of the European Commission also lists a series of measures and their funding in order to support research and international cooperation, as well as the development of testing methods...|$|R

Male reproductive system development and function may be susceptible to the effects of such environmental toxicants. Bisphenol A, phthalates and alkylphenols are important components of multiple consumer products as well as industrial processes and are thus ubiquitously present in the environment. After exposure to these substances, numerous adverse effects on male reproductive system have been demonstrated in animal studies. Thus, developmental genital anomalies as well as lower semen quality have been observed.

40|$|<b>Endocrine-Disrupting</b> <b>Chemicals</b> (EDCs) are <b>substances</b> that {{interfere}} with hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, or action resulting in a deviation from normal homeostatic control or reproduction. EDCs represent a broad class of molecules in our environment, food, and consumer products such as plasticizers, polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorinated pesticides, and many other chemicals. Most of the products that contain these EDCs are requisitely used in everyday life; however the results of several animal models and human clinical research, as well as data from epidemiological studies reveal that EDCs are a significant concern to public health. The mechanisms of EDCs involve divergent pathways including (but not limited to) estrogenic and anti-androgenic pathways, which are highly conserved in wildlife and humans.

30|$|<b>Endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> (EDCs) are <b>substances</b> {{that mimic}} natural hormones in the {{endocrine}} system causing {{adverse effects on}} humans and wildlife [1, 2]. EDCs {{are considered to be}} exogenous agents that interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, and elimination of natural hormones in the body responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis, reproduction, development, and behavior. Exposure to EDCs could have a substantial effect on the body, disrupting bodily functions and processes. Bisphenol A (BPA), an EDC, is a cause of considerable social and scientific concern. It is heavily used as a monomer in the synthesis of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics [3] and {{is considered to be a}} significant pollutant since its weak estrogen-like effect is harmful to organisms [3 – 5]. Various diseases (including carcinogenesis) may result from exposure to BPA. In recent years, BPA has been detected in industrial wastewater, groundwater, surface water, and drinking water [6 – 9].|$|R
40|$|Phthalates, a {{class of}} {{chemicals}} used as plasticizers, are economically important due to several industrial applications. Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is {{the most commonly used}} phthalate plasticizer, and it {{has been described as a}} potent antiandrogen in males. We performed an extensive dose-response study following developmental exposure to DEHP and evaluated the effects on female reproductive development. Two wide ranges of doses that included dose levels relevant for human exposure as well as high doses typically used in toxicological studies were tested. Female Wistar rats were treated daily with DEHP and peanut oil (vehicle control) by gavage from gestation day 6 to lactation day 22. The low doses were 0. 015, 0. 045, 0. 135, 0. 405, and 1. 215 mg DEHP/kg body weight (bw) /day, and the high doses were 5, 15, 45, 135, and 405 mg DEHP/kg bw/day. At the dose levels tested, no signs of maternal toxicity were observed. A significant delay in the age at vaginal opening (approximately 2 days) at 15 mg DEHP/kg bw/day and above, as well as a trend for a delay in the age at first estrus at 135 and 405 mg DEHP/kg bw/day (approximately 2 days), was observed. Liver enlargement (characteristic of phthalate exposure in rats) was limited to the 135 and 405 -mg DEHP/kg bw/day doses. Anogenital distance and nipple development were unaffected. Based on the results of delayed pubertal onset, the no observed adverse effect level for female reproductive development may be set at 5 mg DEHP/kg bw/day. Key Words: DEHP; female; dose-response; development; endocrine disruptors. Considerable concern has been growing over the adverse effects that may result from exposure to <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> that have the potential to modify the normal endocrine function in wildlife and humans, the so-called <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> (EDCs).

40|$|Onset and {{development}} of puberty is regulated by the neuroendocrine system. Population-based studies worldwide have observed secular trends towards earlier puberty development. These changes are apparently caused by environmental factors such as improved socio-economic status, improved health care and nutrition. However, they may also partly result from <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> in the environment. Epidemiological studies have investigated the relationship between pubertal development and exposure to <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> (polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated biphenyls, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane, phthalate esters, furans and the pesticide endosulfan). Associations with both perinatal and postnatal exposure have been reported. Studies in experimental animals support some of these findings and point to differential endocrine regulatory mechanisms linked to pubertal development acting in the perinatal and the pre-pubertal period. Pubertal development is naturally associated with growth and body composition. There is increasing evidence for a link between prenatal development and pubertal onset. In girls born small for gestational age (SGA), pubertal onset and age at menarche often are advanced, especially {{if there has been}} an extensive catch-up growth during the first months of life. In utero growth retardation may have multiple causes including exposure to xenobiotic substances as was suggested for some <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals.</b> An abnormal perinatal environment of children born SGA may alter the endocrine status and the sensitivity of the receptors for endocrine and metabolic signalling that may have effects on maturation of brain and gonads.

40|$|International audienceMany {{wildlife}} {{species may}} {{be exposed to}} biologically active concentrations of <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals.</b> There is strong evidence obtained from laboratory studies showing the potential of several environmental chemicals to cause endocrine disruption at environmentally realistic exposure levels. In wildlife populations, associations have been reported between reproductive and developmental effects and <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals.</b> In the aquatic environment, effects have been observed in mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and mollusks from Europe, North America, and other areas. The observed abnormalities vary from subtle changes to permanent alterations, including disturbed sex differentiation with feminized or masculinized sex organs, changed sexual behavior, and altered immune function. For most reported effects in wildlife, however, the evidence for a causal link with endocrine disruption is weak or nonexisting. Crucial in establishing causal evidence for chemical-induced wildlife effects appeared semifield or laboratory studies using the wildlife species of concern. Impaired reproduction and development causally linked to <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> are well documented {{in a number of}} species and have resulted in local or regional population changes. These include: Masculinization (imposex) in female marine snails by tributyltin, a biocide used in antifouling paints, is probably the dearest case of endocrine disruption caused by an environmental chemical. The dogwhelk is particularly sensitive, and imposer has resulted in decline or extinction of local populations worldwide, including coastal areas all over Europe and the open North Sea. DDE-induced egg-shell thinning in birds has caused severe population declines in a number of raptor species in Europe and North America. <b>Endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> have adversely affected a variety of fish species. In the vicinity of certain sources (e. g., effluents of water treatment plants) and in the most contaminated areas is this exposure causally linked with the effects on reproductive organs that could have implications for fish populations. However, there is also a more widespread occurrence of endocrine disruption in fish in the U. K., where estrogenic effects have been demonstrated in freshwater systems, in estuaries, and in coastal areas. In mammals, the best evidence comes from the field studies on Baltic gray and ringed seals, and from the Dutch semifield studies on harbor seals, where both reproduction and immune functions have been impaired by PCBs in the food chain. Reproduction effects resulted in population declines, whereas impaired immune function has likely contributed to the mass mortalities due to morbillivirus infections. Distorted sex organ development and function in alligators has been related to a major pesticide spill Into a lake in Florida, U. S. A. The observed estrogenic/antiandrogenic effects in this reptile have been causally linked in experimental studies with alligator eggs to the DDT complex.
