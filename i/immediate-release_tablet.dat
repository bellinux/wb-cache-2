The critical formulation/process factors were the type and concentration of microcrystalline cellulose, the ratio of lactose to microcrystalline cellulose, the concentration of croscarmellose, and the compression force. A two-step approach was implemented. First an optimization study was performed to determine the type of microcrystalline cellulose and its ratio to lactose.

40|$|In this study, we {{determined}} the pH and buffer capacity of human gastrointestinal (GI) fluids (aspirated from the stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, and mid/distal jejunum) {{as a function}} of time, from 37 healthy subjects after oral administration of an 800 mg <b>immediate-release</b> <b>tablet</b> of ibuprofen (reference listed drug; RLD) under typical prescribed bioequivalence (BE) study protocol conditions in both fasted and fed states (simulated by ingestion of a liquid meal). Simultaneously, motility was continuously monitored using water-perfused manometry. The time to appearance of phase III contractions (i. e., housekeeper wave) was monitored following administration of the ibuprofen tablet. Our results clearly demonstrated the dynamic change in pH {{as a function of}} time and, most significantly, the extremely low buffer capacity along the GI tract. The buffer capacity on average was 2. 26 μmol/mL/ΔpH in fasted state (range: 0. 26 and 6. 32 μmol/mL/ΔpH) and 2. 66 μmol/mL/ΔpH in fed state (range: 0. 78 and 5. 98 μmol/mL/ΔpH) throughout the entire upper GI tract (stomach, duodenum, and proximal and mid/distal jejunum). The implication of this very low buffer capacity of the human GI tract is profound for the oral delivery of both acidic and basic active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). An in vivo predictive dissolution method would require not only a bicarbonate buffer but also, more significantly, a low buffer capacity of dissolution media to reflect in vivo dissolution conditions. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: A novel, <b>immediate-release</b> <b>tablet</b> {{formulation}} of ibu-profen (IBU) sodium dihydrate, Advil Film Coated Tablets (IBUNa), {{has been developed}} that is absorbed faster than standard IBU tablets. The objective {{of the current study}} was to compare the efficacy and onset of analgesia of this new formulation with standard IBU tablets after a single dose. Materials and Methods: Patients (N= 316) with at least moderate baseline postsurgical dental pain were randomized to 400 mg IBUNa, Advil (IBUAdv), Motrin (IBUMot), or placebo. Primary endpoints were time-weighted sum of pain relief (PR) and pain intensity differences over 8 hours (SPRID 0 - 8) and time to onset of meaningful pain relief (TMPR) measured by the double-stopwatch method. Results: SPRID 0 - 8 was significantly greater for IBUNa and the other active treatments versus placebo (P< 0. 001). IBUNa had a significantly earlier TMPR versus placebo, pooled IBUAdv/IBUMot, and IBUMot (P< 0. 001 for all), and a marginally faster TMPR (P= 0. 075) versus IBUAdv. Results for secondary endpoints were similar. Adverse events were comparable across treatment groups, with gastrointestinal disorders being most frequently reported. Most adverse events were mild or moderate. Discussion: This novel {{formulation of}} IBUNa provided superior overall PR compared with placebo and more rapid onset of anal-gesic effect compared with standard IBU tablets.

A single 2. 0 -g dose of azithromycin microspheres achieved significantly higher exposures in serum and WBC during the first 24 h after the start of dosing than a 3 -day regimen: an approximately threefold higher area under the curve from time zero to 24 h postdose (AUC 0 - 24) and an approximately twofold higher mean peak concentration on day 1.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to design and {{evaluate}} extended-release formulations of a model drug, nicorandil, in order to achieve the desired steady-state plasma concentration of drug in vivo. Simulation was employed to estimate optimum dissolution and absorption rate of nicorandil. The dissolution test was employed using pH 1. 2, 4. 0, 6. 8 buffer solution, or water, to measure the in vitro release behaviors of nicorandil formulations. A single dose (15  mg) of each formulation was orally administered to four beagle dogs under fasted conditions, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The in vitro/in vivo relationship of the extended-release formulation was confirmed using in vitro dissolution profiles and plasma concentrations of drug in beagle dogs. Nicorandil was released completely within 30  min from the <b>immediate-release</b> <b>tablets</b> and released for 24  h from the extended-release tablets. The nicorandil plasma concentration could be modified by adjusting the drug release rate from the extended-release formulation. The release rate of nicorandil was the rate-limiting step in the overall absorption of drug from the extended-release formulations. These results highlight the potential of a nicorandil extended-release formulation in the treatment of angina pectoris...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{available}} literature regarding {{attention deficit}} hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults. METHODS: An electronic literature search of peer-reviewed English language articles using MEDLINE (without time limits) was undertaken. RESULTS: Symptoms of ADHD in adults exert a substantial negative impact on daily life, including work, social life and relationships. Co-morbidities are common, further impairing quality of life. Diagnosis of adult ADHD can be difficult, as current criteria require evidence of symptom onset before the age of 7 years and impact on activities typically undertaken by children. Drug therapy is the first-line treatment for adult ADHD, particularly stimulant medication. However, methylphenidate (MPH) <b>immediate-release</b> <b>tablets</b> require three or more times daily dosing, which can impact on compliance, while demonstrating a loss of symptomatic benefit later in the day. Extended-release preparations of MPH, mixed amphetamine salts and dexamphetamine can provide symptom control for 6 - 12 h and the non-stimulant atomoxetine has demonstrated benefit in reducing ADHD symptoms. These therapies are generally well tolerated, but may be associated with adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, which need to be further assessed in controlled clinical trials. Psychological therapy may be beneficial in adults who continue to experience clinically significant symptoms while receiving pharmacotherapy. CONCLUSION: Further research in all areas of adult ADHD is urgently needed...|$|R

40|$|Background: A very simple, sensitive, and {{accurate}} {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) method with ultraviolet detector was developed and applied to determine ciprofloxacin in human plasma following administration of a gastroretentive formulation developed in our laboratory. Materials and Methods: HPLC analysis was performed on a C 18 μ-Bondapack column (250 mm × 3. 9 mm) using acetonitrile: potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution 0. 1 M (20 : 80, v/v, pH 3) at a flow rate of 1. 5 ml/min and eluate was monitored at 276 nm. After addition of phenacetin as internal standard, plasma samples were treated with 0. 1 M phosphate buffer (pH: 7) and followed by extraction with dichloromethane. The method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, limit of quantitation (LOQ), robustness, stability, and applied in bioavailability studies of our developed gastroretentive formulation in healthy volunteers. Results: The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range 0. 025 – 4 μg/ml with the detection limit of 15 ng/ml. Accuracy % were within 93 – 115 and the coefficient of variance % ranged from 0. 20 to 12. 8. The very low LOQ (25 ng/ml) allowed avoiding fluorometric detection which is more expensive and is not available in all laboratories.

These studies investigated the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties of a new, recently US Food and Drug Administration–approved, extended-release, 20 -mg once-daily formulation. MethodsWe performed 2 separate 2 -period, 2 -sequence crossover studies in 36 healthy adults: a study comparing the IR formulation to the extended-release formulation under fasting conditions and a study comparing the extended-release formulation under fed and fasted conditions. FindingsCompared with lorcaserin IR, the Tmax after a single dose of lorcaserin extended-release was greater (median, 12 vs 3 hours), and the Cmax was 26 % lower (38. 8 vs 52. 3 ng/mL).

Assay of active ingredient and in-vitro dissolution evaluation were conducted using USP Apparatus 2 satisfying the general conditions for film tablets as stipulated in official books. Tablets and dissolution samples were analyzed using a modification of the validated High performance liquid chromatographic method developed by Stanisz and Lukas. All the three brands met the standards for the physical qualities of a satisfactory tablet, and all had percentage purities within the 90 to 110 % range. Only brands AT and CT had released ≥ 75 % of label claim of atorvastatin calcium within 45 min, as specified in the B. P for conventional tablets. Thus, brand BT which had barely released 70 % of its label claim at 60 min failed dissolution test. We concluded {{that out of the}} 3 brands of <b>immediate-release</b> atorvastatin calcium <b>tablets</b> available in the market {{at the time of the}} study, only 2 passed all the pharmacopoeia tests for satisfactory quality. Thus, only these can be interchanged in clinical practice...|$|R

These limitations necessitate frequent administration of acyclovir, {{up to five}} times daily, leading to poor patient compliance, which in turn leads {{to a reduction in}} therapeutic efficacy and development of resistance. Methods: A gastroretentive sustained-release (GR) formulation of acyclovir, based on a combination of swelling and mucoadhesive mechanisms, has been developed. Composition has been optimized after evaluation of different polymers, carbomer, polyethylene oxide, and sodium alginate alone and/or in combination. GR formulations were characterized for in-process quality-control tests, drug release and release rate kinetics, similarity factor analysis, swelling index, and matrix erosion. Results: A formulation containing a combination of carbomer and polyethylene oxide had the highest similarity of drug release compared with a target drug-release profile obtained by pharmacokinetic simulations. The measurement of mucoadhesive strength, carried out with a texture analyzer, showed that the mucoadhesive strength of the GR formulation was significantly higher than that of the <b>immediate-release</b> (IR) <b>tablet.</b> The optimized GR formulation was found to be retained in {{the upper part of the}} gastrointestinal tract for 480 minutes; the IR tablet was retained for only 90 minutes as measured using a gastrointestinal retention study in albino rabbits. The GR formulation was also found to maintain more sustained plasma concentrations than the IR tablet. Mean residence time of the GR formulation was 7 hours versus 3. 3 hours for the IR formulation. The relative bioavailability of the GR formulation was 261 % of the IR formulation. Conclusion: The GR formulation of acyclovir, based on swelling and mucoadhesive mechanisms, has prolonged retention in the upper gastrointestinal tract, sustained in vitro drug release, prolonged in vivo absorption, and better bioavailability than the IR formulation. Such a formulation would improve patient compliance and increase the efficacy of therapy.

40|$|Vildagliptin (VG), a drug {{used for}} {{treatment}} of type 2 diabetes, is soluble in water and currently marketed as an instantaneous release tablet that is administered twice daily. VG is not available as an extended release dosage form. The aim of this project therefore, was to design an extended release oral drug delivery for VG that can be administered once daily by producing solid lipid microparticles using the Spray Congealing technique (SC). The SC is an environmentally friendly microparticles (MP) preparation process that can be utilized to produce MP without using any solvent. Drug with or without Carbomer® was dispersed in the melted lipid carriers and atomized through the two fluid nozzle of the Buchi® spray congealer leading to form MP loaded with VG. The produced VG loaded MP were characterized for their morphological features, yield, content and thermal properties. VG/MP were then pressed into tablets and their in vitro and in vivo release studies were investigated. Determination of VG in samples was done using validated High Pressure Liquid Chromatography HPLC-UV and Liquid Chromatography Mass Detector LC/MS methods of analysis for in vitro and in vivo studies respectively. VG microparticles were spherical in shape with a yield of 76 %. The drug content in the microparticles {{was found to be}} 98. 8 %. The in vitro dissolution studies showed that VG was released from the tableted particles in an extended-release fashion for up to 24 hours when compared to the <b>immediate-release</b> VG marketed <b>tablets.</b> Moreover, no changes in the release profile were observed upon the storage of the formula for 6 months at 4 oC. The in vivo pharmacokinetics studies using mixed breed dogs reported a Cmax, Tmax, T 1 / 2 and mean residence time of 118 ng/ml, 3. 4 h, 5. 27 h and 9. 8 h respectively for the tested formulation prepared by SC with a significant difference when compared to those of the reference immediate-release marketed drug (147 ng/ml, 1 h, 2. 16 h and 2. 8 h respectively). The mean area under the curve (AUC) values for the test and the reference were not significantly different as indication of comparable bioavailability. The IVIVC studies resulted in level A correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0. 965. On the other hand, the multiple level C correlation showed a linear correlation for different pharmacokinetic parameters with the dissolution parameters. In conclusion, SC technology was successfully utilized for designing a once daily extended release drug delivery system of VG...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: When {{phenytoin}} is {{prescribed for}} administration via nasogastric tube, <b>immediate-release</b> OR) phenytoin <b>tablets</b> are crushed before use and extended-release (ER) phenytoin capsules are opened {{and only the}} granules are used. However, it is unknown whether the same dose of these 2 different formulations {{will result in the}} same steady-state serum phenytoin concentration. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether ER phenytoin capsules can be used interchangeably with IR phenytoin tablets for prophylaxis of posttraumatic seizures. Methods: Inpatients at the neurosurgical ward at Prasat Neurological Institute, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 2004 and October 2005 were enrolled in the study. All patients were initially prescribed IR phenytoin tablets 300 mg/d as a maintenance dose for prophylaxis of posttraumatic seizures. The serum phenytoin concentration was measured after ≥ 5 days of treatment with IR phenytoin tablets 300 mg/d (two 50 -mg tablets every 8 hours) that had been crushed before being administered concomitantly with a blenderized diet through the nasogastric tube. Without a washout period, the dosage form was changed to ER phenytoin capsules (three 100 -mg capsules QD). The capsules were opened and the contents were administered concomitantly with the blenderized diet through the nasogastric tube for ≥ 5 days. The serum phenytoin concentration was again determined. The patients were closely monitored for seizures and adverse events (AEs). Results: Thirty-three patients enrolled in the study and 17 (10 women, 7 men; mean [SD] age, 62. 94 [15. 94] years [range, 18 - 89 years]) completed the study. The mean (SD) serum phenytoin concentrations after administration of phenytoin tablets and capsules were 6. 03 (5. 92) μg/mL and 3. 80 (2. 71) μg/mL, respectively (P = 0. 019). The mean serum phenytoin concentrations, adjusted for low serum albumin concentrations after administration of tablets and capsules, were calculated and reported to be 10. 33 (11. 60) μg/mL and 6. 28 (4. 76) μg/mL, respectively (P = 0. 035). The maximum phenytoin metabolic rate (Vmax) (assuming the substrate concentration at which the rate of metabolism is one half Vmax = 4 mg/L) after the administration of phenytoin tablets and capsules was 8. 37 (2. 42) mg/kg · d- 1 and 10. 38 (6. 48) mg/kg · d- 1, respectively. These values were not significantly different. All patients were seizure-free and no AEs were observed. Conclusion: The steady-state serum phenytoin concentration was significantly lower with ER phenytoin capsules 300 mg/d than IR phenytoin tablets 300 mg/d administered via nasogastric feeding tube concomitantly administered with a blenderized diet in these neurosurgical patients.
