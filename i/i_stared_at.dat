25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her. It was {{the most}} amazing moment in any life....|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him and {{repeated}} the word. He beamed pleasantly upon me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> stockishly <b>at</b> the girl, {{who passed}} with an {{indifferent}} face.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> him, not {{at first}} quite {{understanding}} what he meant.|$|R
5000|$|Krizz Kaliko copied {{lyrics of}} the song {{for the first few}} lines of his song [...] "Anxiety," [...] off his debut album Vitiligo by saying, [...] "When Im alone in my room, {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> the wall/And {{in the back of my}} mind, I hear my conscious call/Telling me I need a gun." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him, {{thinking}} that the Administrator's champagne had got into his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him doubtfully, for {{at times}} a pleasantry {{came out of}} his bitterness.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him in amazement. And no wonder. The {{young man}} was Duncan Woodward.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> askance <b>at</b> him, {{in utter}} silence. Then I smiled half tolerantly. [...] "But father, {{yesterday}} {{they were all}} here. Yesterday was..." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> unwonderingly <b>at</b> {{these things}} for a time, and then there rose upon my consciousness, {{intermingling}} with these, the bristling golden green heads of growing barley.|$|R
6000|$|When all my {{days are}} ending [...] And I have no song to sing, [...] I think I {{shall not be}} too old [...] To <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> everything; [...] As <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> once <b>at</b> a nursery door [...] Or a tall tree and a swing.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him in {{speechless}} amazement. The words, for an instant, absolutely petrified me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her and inquired her name, because I did {{not know}} what else to say.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him in {{speechless}} consternation, and for {{a moment}} I seemed forlorn of sense and understanding.|$|E
40|$|Suppose, as <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> a {{glass in}} front of me, I say or think: There’s water in the glass. The thought has the content that there is water in the glass; {{and it will be}} true if there is indeed water in the glass. According to external-world skepticism, even if my thought is true, I do not know that there is water in the glass, because my way of telling that this is the case does not allo...|$|R
60|$|Sherlock Holmes {{rubbed his}} hands with delight, and <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> with astonishment <b>at</b> our client.|$|R
60|$|The cup {{of coffee}} was arrested half-way to my lips as <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> in amazement <b>at</b> the man's serious face.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her. Last night! It {{seemed a}} long while ago--so very {{unimportant}} what I might have said.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him, speechless. We Woosters are {{as quick}} as lightning, and I saw at once that {{something}} had happened.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> it. Was it his? It {{was like}} it, certainly. Yet that k? and those s's? I almost wondered.|$|E
60|$|You start, my friends! You stare! Think, then, how <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> {{and started}} <b>at</b> this sudden ending of our talk.|$|R
5000|$|I do love it. The {{deadlines}} are {{the only}} thing I don’t love about it... Dick Moores {{used to say that}} if he didn’t have the strip, he’d be dead. The bad thing is, he did have the strip, and he did die... Once in a while, Mark Cohen will write a poem or give me an idea for a Sunday page, but I do the rest of it. <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> a blank sheet of paper and come up with it. (Cohen died in 1999. Scancarelli remembered him with a 2009 Sunday page tribute.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Several reviewers {{commented on}} its value as {{art and the}} extent to which it {{generated}} discussion and reflection. For fellow art game designer Jason Rohrer, [...] "The game, and my experience discussing it, have reminded me of experiences at galleries of modern art---for each piece, <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> it, scratch my head a bit, and try to mine the piece for meaning of some kind. I'm also reminded of watching a David Lynch movie with friends---we'd spend the rest of the evening discussing what the movie might mean." ...|$|R
60|$|He held up {{his huge}} paws, and as <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the battered, malformed {{knuckles}} I understood {{the nature of his}} work.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her in bewilderment. In {{contrast}} to the agitation I felt rising within me, she was extraordinarily calm, unbelievably so.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her, for move I could not. Then remembering my crazy {{talk with}} Kari, uttered one word, only one. It was--Quilla.|$|E
60|$|At {{the bottom}} of the {{staircase}} <b>I</b> stood and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the worn steps, and Ayesha, turning, saw me.|$|R
60|$|A {{horror of}} the spirit came over me, and, as if rapt away from myself, <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> sheer up <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not offer}} me his hand. <b>I</b> could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> him, for <b>I</b> had {{expected}} anything but this.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him. It {{was strange}} to hear Bickley, the scoffer at miracles, {{suggesting}} that this greatest of all miracles might be possible.|$|E
60|$|Clearly he had {{not heard}} a word of the anecdote. And this annoyed me, because the anecdote was really good. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> {{a little}} <b>at</b> this annunciation, and observed, that the hand seemed too modern for the date he {{assigned}} to the manuscript.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{could only}} <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.|$|R
60|$|She retired {{into the}} back part of her shop beyond the muslined door and {{returned}} with a tumbler of water. I shook my head. My sight pulsed with my heartbeats. As if congealed into a drop of poison, <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the blind.|$|R
