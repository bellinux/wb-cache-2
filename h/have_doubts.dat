Massey to provide 60 {{percent of the}} acquisition capital, and provided a major contribution himself, with smaller contributions from franchise holder Pete Harman and company officials Lee Cummings and Harlan Adams. Sanders then began to <b>have</b> <b>doubts</b> about selling the company, as some {{members of his family}} were against it. The group acquired the company in 1964 for US$2 million (around US$15 million in 2013). The contract included a lifetime salary for Sanders and the agreement that he would be the company's quality controller and trademark.|$|E
5|$|When Henson {{began work}} on Sam and Friends, he asked fellow University of Maryland sophomore Jane Nebel to assist him. The show was a {{financial}} success, but after graduating from college, Henson began to <b>have</b> <b>doubts</b> about going into a career performing with puppets. He spent several months in Europe, where he was inspired by European puppet performers, who looked on their work as an art form. Upon Henson's return to the United States, he and Jane began dating. They were married in 1959 and had five children, Lisa (b. 1960), Cheryl (b. 1961), Brian (b. 1963), John (b. 1965, d. 2014), and Heather (b. 1970).|$|E
5|$|Daphne's grandfather, Harry {{gives her}} the lease to the local coffee shop and she gives up {{her career as a}} stripper. She renames the {{business}} 'Daphne's' and despite an initial struggle, the coffee shop soon begins making a profit. Daphne gets back together with Shane and they become engaged, but she starts to <b>have</b> <b>doubts</b> about whether she is moving on too quickly.

5|$|To the Milanese, Sforza's victory {{now seemed}} certain, {{but he found}} his Venetian allies {{beginning}} to <b>have</b> <b>doubts</b> about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza {{would be far more}} dangerous and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident the war was over and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege.|$|E

He is horrified {{to discover that the}} Government has made a trade deal with Kaufmann and Intel for the rights to a new enzyme that Andromeda has developed that heals injured cells. By this stage, Dawnay is also beginning to <b>have</b> <b>doubts</b> about Andromeda – she agrees to aid Fleming by entering a program into the computer to convince it Andromeda is dead. The program is quickly discovered and reversed by Andromeda. However, the computer soon exacts its revenge – it corrupts the formula for the enzyme, making Dawnay and her assistants sick.|$|E

The next day, Gibson becomes {{the subject of}} a medical negligence writ. Concerned that her boss, Meg Morrison (Louise Siversen), and her nemesis, nurse Chloe Davis (Jacinta Stapleton) are teaming up against her, Liz seeks Happy's assistance. Even though both Amanda and Liz herself <b>have</b> <b>doubts</b> about her competence, Happy stands by her. However, when Jamie and Layla discover just how understaffed and incompetently run Prospect Valley Hospital is, they realise that someone might be making Liz a scapegoat to cover up greater crimes.

On a visit to the United States in May 1946, Groves advised Portal not to build a reactor.

500|$|Beagles {{are used}} as sniffer dogs for termite {{detection}} in Australia, and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection. Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in pet therapy, visiting the sick and elderly in hospital.

500|$|Several musicians wrote {{songs about}} Biko, {{including}} Tom Paxton, Peter Hammill, Steel Pulse, and Tappa Zukie British musician Peter Gabriel, who heard of Biko's death through the BBC's {{coverage of the}} event, was moved by the story and began researching his life, based on which he wrote a song about the killing. This coincided with Gabriel becoming interested in African musical styles, which influenced his third solo album Peter Gabriel (1980), also known as Melt, on which [...] "Biko" [...] was ultimately included. Gabriel was also influenced to write the song through his association with politically inclined new-wave musician Tom Robinson; Robinson {{is said to have}} encouraged Gabriel to release the piece when Gabriel began to <b>have</b> <b>doubts.</b> Though there were other political songs on the album, [...] "Biko" [...] was the only piece that was explicitly a protest song.|$|E

Moreover, an individual supposed to have been 'clear' has undergone a relapse into conduct which suggests an incipient psychosis." [...] He also deplored the Foundation's omission of any serious scientific research. Dianetics lost public credibility in August 1950 when a presentation by Hubbard before an audience of 6,000 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles failed disastrously. He introduced a Clear named Sonya Bianca and told the audience {{that as a result of}} undergoing Dianetic therapy she now possessed perfect recall.

[...] With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting {{the same role}} over an extended period, it became {{impossible for him to}} separate Ziggy Stardust—and, later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, [...] "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did <b>have</b> <b>doubts</b> about my sanity." [...] His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage [...] "retirement" [...] at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.|$|E

She turns down his offer at a second chance at love, prompting him to storm onto the stage and denounce her over the microphone. Leslie apologizes to her mother for bringing Frank. She is later upset with Justin, but has trouble pinpointing the reasons for her dissatisfaction. Ron (Nick Offerman) explains that Justin is a [...] "tourist," [...] meaning that he takes [...] "vacations in people's lives" [...] and only cares about telling interesting stories to impress other people, which makes him selfish. Two older women then recognize Ron as jazz saxophonist Duke Silver, but he denies it.
