5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. March, in her turn, {{tried to}} take from it the {{personal}} tone which the talk was always assuming. [...] "Have you been to the fall exhibition?" [...] she asked Christine; and the girl drew <b>herself</b> up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstraction she seemed sunk in.|$|R
60|$|Helen busied <b>herself</b> getting well <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infuriated mustang. Roy {{dragged him}} to a cedar near by.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She rose, and, {{stretching}} <b>herself</b> far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window, searched <b>the</b> inexorable expanse <b>of</b> sea.

According to the Chicago Tribune, she withdrew her name from consideration [...] "due to obligations to her family, for whom she was still overseeing billions in assets, and the financial crisis, which was putting some of those assets at risk". As {{a result of her}} public support for President Obama, Pritzker found herself the target of labor groups for Hayatt Hotels' practices. The president of Unite Here cited her connection to Obama as a reason why the group expected her to use better labor practices as the group staged demonstrations against Pritzker.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{no longer}} serving as Prime Minister, Cameron {{originally}} {{stated that he}} would continue inside Parliament, on the Conservative backbenches. On 12 September, however, {{he announced that he}} was resigning his seat with immediate effect. He was succeeded as MP for Witney by fellow Conservative Robert Courts. The Washington Post described him as having [...] "sped away without glancing back" [...] once Theresa May had [...] "vaulted <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane-strength political wreckage of Britain's vote to leave the European Union." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hewitt {{was known}} as a {{reliable}} Blairite within the cabinet and voted loyally with the government in Parliament. However, she notably once broke ranks on the BBC's Question Time, expressing her concern about government plans to introduce ID cards. She ruled <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party, declaring her support for Harriet Harman, who was the successful candidate. [...] On 27 June 2007 it was announced that Hewitt would not be Health Secretary in Gordon Brown's new cabinet, an announcement which had been widely expected.|$|E
2500|$|On July 19, 1992, a Mafia bomb killed Borsellino, {{less than}} two months after his {{colleague}} Giovanni Falcone had been killed. Italy was in shock.

[...] A week later Rita locked herself into the apartment and wrote a note, which said: [...] "I am devastated by the killing of Judge Borsellino. Now there's no one to protect me, I'm scared and I can't take it any more." [...] Then she threw <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window.|$|E

25|$|In her {{examination}} of myth, she appears {{as one who}} does not accept any special privileges for women. Ironically, feminist philosophers have had to extract de Beauvoir <b>herself</b> from <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> Jean-Paul Sartre to fully appreciate her. While more philosopher and novelist than activist, she did sign one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mouvement de Lib√©ration des Femmes manifestos.|$|R
6000|$|She found <b>herself</b> handed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, with {{somewhat}} curtailed good nights, although nine o'clock, {{her usual}} signal, {{had not yet}} struck.

Mas'r like music!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must see}} {{somebody}} very superior {{to any one}} I have seen yet, to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting <b>herself,)</b> is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question: and I {{do not wish to}} see any such person. I would rather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh certainly; by all means. It will {{be quite}} proper." [...] And {{gathering}} up a bundle of the unfortunate stockings she took <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{have that}} priceless {{opportunity}} to-night," [...] retorted Miss Virginia, as she flung <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. [...] "Pa {{has made me}} invite him to my party." ...|$|E
60|$|At this retort {{the cowboy}} dropped {{his head and}} did not see Bo flaunt <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. But he heard the door close, and then slowly came toward Helen.|$|E

60|$|Why should Lady Castlewood put <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way {{to welcome}} the young stranger? Because he was friendless? Only a simpleton could ever imagine such a reason as that. People of fashion, like her ladyship, are {{friendly}} {{to those who have}} plenty of friends. A poor lad, alone, from a distant country, with only very moderate means, and those not as yet in his own power, with uncouth manners very likely, and coarse provincial habits; was a great lady called upon to put <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way for such a youth? Allons donc! He was quite as well at the alehouse as at the castle.|$|E
