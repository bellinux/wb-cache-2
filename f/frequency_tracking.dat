50|$|Project Lifesaver International is a {{non-profit}} 501 (c) (3) corporation founded in October 1998, by Chief Gene Saunders, {{regarded as the}} Father of, and subject-matter expert on electronic tracking of persons at risk, and 2011 Presidential Citizens Medal nominee, in association with, the Chesapeake, Virginia Sheriff's Office. The organization was formed to develop a program for locating missing persons with dementia, Epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, autism, Down syndrome and other related illnesses. The program involves attaching a radio transmitter device to the wrist or ankle of persons at-risk of wandering. The battery operated radio transmitter is attached with a wristband and emits an inaudible pulse once per second, in the FCC allocated and licensed 216 MHz frequency range, that can {{be picked up by}} a receiver operated by public safety officers.

50|$|Since {{the carrier}} {{frequency}} received can vary due to Doppler shift, the points where received PRN sequences begin may {{not differ from}} O by an exact integral number of milliseconds. Because of this, carrier <b>frequency</b> <b>tracking</b> along with PRN code tracking are used to determine when the received satellite's PRN code begins. Unlike the earlier computation of offset in which trials of all 1,023 offsets could potentially be required, the tracking to maintain lock usually requires shifting of half a pulse width or less. To perform this tracking, the receiver observes two quantities, phase error and received frequency offset. The correlation of the received PRN code {{with respect to the}} receiver generated PRN code is computed to determine if the bits of the two signals are misaligned. Comparisons of the received PRN code with receiver generated PRN code shifted half a pulse width early and half a pulse width late are used to estimate adjustment required. The amount of adjustment required for maximum correlation is used in estimating phase error. Received frequency offset from the frequency generated by the receiver provides an estimate of phase rate error. The command for the frequency generator and any further PRN code shifting required are computed {{as a function of the}} phase error and the phase rate error in accordance with the control law used. The Doppler velocity is computed as a function of the frequency offset from the carrier nominal frequency. The Doppler velocity is the velocity component along the line of sight of the receiver relative to the satellite.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the singing voice, {{researchers}} have traditionally relied upon lab-based experiments and/or simplified models. Neither of these methods can reasonably be expected to always {{capture the essence of}} true performances in environmentally valid settings. Unfortunately, true performances are generally much more difficult to work with because they lack precisely the controls that lab setups and artificial models afford. In particular, true performances are generally polyphonic, making it much more difficult to analyze individual voices than if the voices can be studied in isolation. This thesis approaches the problem of polyphony head on, using a time-aligned electronic score to guide estimation of the vocal line characteristics. First, the exact fundamental <b>frequency</b> <b>track</b> for the voice is estimated using the score notes as guides. Next, the harmonic strengths are estimated using the fundamental frequency information. Third, estimates in notes are automatically validated or discarded based on characteristics of the <b>frequency</b> <b>tracks.</b> Lastly, good harmonic estimates are smoothed across time in order to improve the harmonic strength estimates. These final harmonic estimates, along with the fundamental <b>frequency</b> <b>track</b> estimates, parameterize the essential characteristics of what we hear singers' voices. To explore the potential power of this parameterization, the algorithms are applied to a real data consisting of five sopranos singing six arias. Vowel modification and evidence for the singer's formant are explored...|$|R

Findings. The paper presents the developed mathematical model, describing dependence of the input impedance of the coded and audio-frequency track circuits on the train coordinate at various values of ballast isolation resistances and for all <b>frequencies</b> used in <b>track</b> circuits. The relative error determination of train coordinate by input impedance caused by variation of the ballast isolation resistance for the coded track circuits was investigated. The values of relative error determination of train coordinate can achieve up to 40 - 50 % and these facts do not allow using this method directly for coded track circuits.
