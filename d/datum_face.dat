50|$|According to IS : 6987—1973, {{these are}} divided into three types, 1, 2 and 3 havingworking faces between 5—20, 21—40 and 41—72. The top and {{supporting}} surface are lightlylapped and legibly marked. In order to enable {{the result of the}} calibration to be recorded andsubsequently applied in the case of polygon, the face of the polygon isidentified. Each face is identified by engraving on the top surface, thenominal angles with the face and a <b>datum</b> <b>face.</b> The faces may beidentified with series of number from 1 upwards if nominal angle is nota whole number of degrees. Around 4 holes (plain for type 1 and threadedfor types 2 and 3) are provided for clamping purposes. The dimension ofpolygon between the top and supporting surfaces is 75,150 and 300 mmfor types 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The top and supporting surfaces aremade flat and parallel to accuracies of 0.0025,0.005 and 0.007 mm, 0.0035,0.005 and 0.04 mmfor types 1, 2 and 3 respectively and departure from flatness is permissible only in concavedirection. All faces are made square to the bottom supporting surface to an accuracy of 2.5 \xmover the thickness of the polygon. The error in angle between any working surface and thedatum face and between any two adjacent working faces shall not be more than 10 seconds ofarc.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Computer aided process {{planning}} is the bridge between CAD and CAM. Setup planning {{is the major}} key to transform design concept into manufacturing domain, which is mainly experience based activity in modern manufacturing industry. Setup planning is a complicated non-linear task constrained by many factors such as tool approach direction, geometric feature relationship, fixturing constraint, tolerance requirement and manufacturing practice. Setup planning identifies which features must be machined in each setup and determines locating datum for each setup. This paper focuses {{on the development of}} a formalized procedure for automatic generation of feasible setups. For preventing of tolerance stack-up tried to use <b>datum</b> <b>face</b> as reference plane in fixture design. So, this paper presents a new method for setup planning with accurate respect to datum faces in design and machining. For the proposed work the authors have introduced two concepts namely, “inferiority face ” and “control face”. A rule-based procedure in several steps is used for solving the problem. The system is developed in Visual Basic on a Solid Works platform. Trial runs with industrial parts indicate that the system is applicable for industrial use...|$|E
40|$|For {{machined}} parts, {{setup time}} is {{a major component of}} the total time required to create a machined part. If the setup time can be reduced, this will not only decrease the machining time, but will also ensure better machining accuracy, require fewer work- holding devices and increase machine usage time. To achieve any improvement in setup time, first we need to estimate the setup time accurately. In this paper we propose a methodology to estimate the setup time for machining prismatic parts in a three axis vertical machining center. We consider three major factors in estimating the number of setups, namely [...] -the precedence constraints among machining operations, the feasibility of work holding using vise clamping, and the availability of <b>datum</b> <b>faces</b> for locating the workpiece...|$|R
40|$|Turbine blades {{account for}} the {{major part of the}} cost of the aero-gas turbine engine. Many {{thousands}} of blades are used in each engine. All are made of sophisticated materials machined to very fine limits. A high technology industry manufacturing turbine blades has grown up in the last 30 years. A relatively new technique of blade manufacture has been developed during the past 15 years. This is blade encapsulation and is used in conjunction with precision forging and precision casting of blades. Encapsulation involves casting a block of low melting point alloy around the precision formed blade, such that the aerofoil is in the correct position relative to the three <b>datum</b> <b>faces</b> of the encapsulation block. The blade is then machined with resultant higher production rates, less scrap and the use of a lower grade of labour. Automation is possible with a blade production line using encapsulating techniques. A survey of current blade encapsulation practices was undertaken on a worldwide basis and the results indicate widely differing methods. Research has been undertaken into three commonly used encapsulating materials. The effects of varying the parameters of the encapsulating process on the physical properties of the encapsulation material were investigated. The parameters were die temperature, alloy pouring temperature and elapsed time after casting. The physical properties under test were hardness, dimensional stability and the blade holding capability. The results of the experiments were statistically analysed using factorial analysis. This is a powerful technique which enabled the significance of the main effects and the interaction between the main effects to be established. There were nine 3 x 3 factorial experiments in the research programme. Not all the experiments gave definite results. The blade holding force tests gave inconclusive results. The research programme enabled firm conclusions to be drawn regarding encapsulating materials and effects of changing the parameters of the process. It is intended that these conclusions will assist blade manufacturers in optimizing their blade encapsulating process...|$|R
