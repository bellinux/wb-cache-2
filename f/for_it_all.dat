5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Council in Ludlow Castle gave it a new lease of life, during {{a period in which}} many similar fortifications were falling into decay. By the 1530s, the castle needed considerable renovation; Lee began work in 1534, borrowing money to do so, but Sir Thomas Engleford complained the following year that the castle was still unfit for habitation. Lee repaired the castle roofs, probably using lead from the Carmelite friary in the town, and using the fines imposed and the goods confiscated by the court. He later claimed that the work on the castle would have cost around £500, had the Crown had to pay <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> directly. The porter's lodge and prison were built in the outer bailey around 1552. The woods around the castle were gradually cut down during the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|But in January 1958 he resigned, {{along with}} the Chancellor of the Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft and his Treasury {{colleague}} Nigel Birch, in protest at government plans for increased expenditure; he was a staunch advocate of disinflation, or, in modern terms, a monetarist, and a believer in market forces. Powell was {{also a member of}} the Mont Pelerin Society. The by-product of this expenditure was the printing of extra money to pay <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> which Powell believed to be the cause of inflation, and in effect a form of taxation, as the holders of money find their money is worth less. Inflation rose to 2.5%, a high figure for the era, especially in peacetime.|$|E
500|$|The episode's premise {{was based}} on an extinct type of beetle, which caused trouble for guest actor Kirk Acevedo, as he had a fear of bugs. Pinkner commented in an {{interview}} that Acevedo [...] "has a primal fear of bugs and had to act with a bunch of live bugs and fake bugs, all of which equally terrified him. And we didn't know. But he was game and heroic despite. He conquered his fears, which was awesome". Upon discovering her character Fauxlivia would be pregnant, Wyman described Anna Torv's reaction, [...] "She was up <b>for</b> <b>it!</b> <b>All</b> our cast has such a terrific attitude. They get as excited as we do. They really embrace the ideas. She's had a lot of challenges and she's met them with such aplomb. She's really terrific. She was happy!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Practice Date" [...] {{marked a}} turning point for the {{character}} Jerry. Prior to the episode, Jerry had appeared in every episode, but his personality had not yet been developed. Schur said the Parks and Recreation staff liked Jim O'Heir, so they cast him in the show and [...] "figured we'd work it out later". After the scene when Mark inadvertently reveals Jerry was adopted, the writers built upon that joke and established Jerry as the co-worker the rest of the department picks on. Schur said after [...] "Practice Date", [...] "We realized that's who he is: He's the guy who wants to put his head down and get his pension, but is asking <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the time. In the next three scripts, it was like throwing chum into the water. Every script after that had 15 slams on Jerry. [...] "Practice Date" [...] marked the first of several appearances by Jay Jackson as Pawnee news reporter Perd Hapley. The character was only originally intended for one appearance, but Schur said the staff enjoyed his performance so much that they made him a recurring character.|$|E

Phil Givens considered Gardiner the [...] "catalyst <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> the transition that transformed Metro {{into one of the}} great cities of the world." [...] Allan Lamport praised him for his ability to put in long hours on the job. Paul Godfrey considered Gardiner his idol, admiring his ability to [...] "solve political problems and bring people together". Bill Davis praised Gardiner for his [...] "remarkable contributions and selfless service." [...] Art Eggleton said that [...] "a towering giant" [...] was lost from the political scene. Gardiner is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.|$|E
2500|$|In casting Good Morning, Miss Bliss, Peter Engel {{knew the}} success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students. Engel {{particularly}} envisioned one character, Zack Morris, who [...] "would be that incorrigible kid who could lie to your face, letting you know very well that he's lying, and make you love him <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the same." [...] Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but {{he turned out to be}} one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.|$|E

2500|$|The {{machine was}} about a century ahead of its time. However, the project was slowed by various {{problems}} including disputes with the chief machinist building parts <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> the parts for his machine {{had to be made}} by hand—this was a major problem for a machine with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron's daughter, translated and added notes to the [...] "Sketch of the Analytical Engine" [...] by Luigi Federico Menabrea. This appears to be the first published description of programming, so Ada Lovelace is widely regarded as the first computer programmer.|$|E

With that win, Sagan secured the Points classification jersey, as there were no other changes in the classifications.
