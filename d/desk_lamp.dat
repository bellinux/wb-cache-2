2500|$|In Office at Night (1940), another [...] "couple" [...] painting, Hopper {{creates a}} {{psychological}} puzzle. The painting shows a man focusing {{on his work}} papers, while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file. Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures, perhaps to heighten the eroticism and the tension. Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman's appeal or that he {{is working hard to}} ignore her. Another interesting aspect of the painting is how Hopper employs three light sources, from a <b>desk</b> <b>lamp,</b> through a window and indirect light from above. Hopper went on to make several [...] "office" [...] pictures, but none with a sensual undercurrent.|$|E
2500|$|Key West was as {{far west}} as PC-1264 ever sailed. The day after her arrival, President Truman {{announced}} that an atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan. With her orders canceled, PC-1264 waited at Key West for three weeks. Eventually, the Bureau of Naval Personnel issued plans for demobilization. Lieutenant Purdon requested {{to be released from}} active duty and recommended that Lieutenant (jg) Ernest Hardmann, his executive officer, be given command. On 5 September, orders arrived for the PC-1264 to proceed to Norfolk, where Lieutenant Purdon would turn over command to Lt. Hardmann. The PC-1264 arrived at Norfolk on 10 September, and the change of command ceremony took place on 17 September. Before this ceremony, members of the crews already were being released from active duty or transferred to other stations. Also, the crew presented Lieutenant Purdon with a <b>desk</b> <b>lamp</b> with the inscription [...] "USS PC 1264 We Will Never Fail." [...] Afterwards, the ship stayed at Norfolk for six more weeks, then moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, just up the Elizabeth River.|$|E

50|$|A {{gooseneck}} lamp {{is a type}} {{of light}} fixture in which a lamp or lightbulb is attached to a flexible, adjustable shaft to allow the user to position the light source without moving the fixture or item to be illuminated. Gooseneck lamps are often used to position a light for reading, or in industry, to provide spot illumination for machining operations. These lamps can come in any color. Gooseneck lamps may be free standing floor <b>lamps,</b> <b>desk</b> <b>lamps,</b> or have magnetic bases in industrial applications.|$|R

50|$|Poul Henningsen, a self-taught {{inventor}} {{and true}} Functionalist, {{was an important}} participant in the Danish Modern school, not for furniture but for lighting design. His attempt to prevent the blinding glare from the electric lamp bulb succeeded in 1926 with a three-shade lamp, known as the PH lamp. The curvature of the shades allowed his hanging lamp to illuminate both {{the table and the}} rest of the room. He went on to design many similar lamps, some with frosted glass, including <b>desk</b> <b>lamps,</b> chandeliers and wall-mounted fixtures. Though he died in 1967, many of his designs have remained popular to this day.|$|R

25|$|The {{simplest}} ballast for {{alternating current}} (AC) use is an inductor placed in series, consisting of a winding on a laminated magnetic core. The inductance of this winding limits the flow of AC current. This type is still used, for example, in 120 volt operated <b>desk</b> <b>lamps</b> using relatively short lamps. Ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency. Where the AC voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps, the ballast is often a step-up autotransformer with substantial leakage inductance (so as to limit the current flow). Either form of inductive ballast may also include a capacitor for power factor correction.|$|R

The treatment is extended to allow for the weight of the components of the mechanism itself. The originator of these devices was George Carwardine, whose patents over the period 1931 - 35 show the evolution of his ideas on this subject.
