To Fishburne, Cheever was a [...] "smart", [...] "competent" [...] physician who often epitomized a [...] "voice of reason". Once he conferred with W.

Fishburne stated, [...] "The personal stuff that I have as Ellis Cheever was telling my fiancée, soon-to-be wife, Sanaa Lathan, {{to get out of}} town, to leave, to pack up, to not talk.

Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering Thomas and Martha Wayne; in the comic book, Joe Chill is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton's idea to have the Joker murder Wayne's parents. [...] "The Writer's Strike was going on, and Tim had the other writers <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave.

He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him. Wenger's strategy is aided by data; for instance, the decision to sign Flamini in 2004 came about as {{he was looking at}} statistics to find an understudy to Vieira. To examine the mental state of a young footballer, he uses psychometric tests conducted by psychologist Jacques Crevoisier once every two years. Wenger prides himself on nurturing talent, saying in an interview: [...] "I believe {{one of the best things}} about managing people is that we can influence lives in a positive way.

500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway.

I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away.

He said, [...] "My term was up. I was offered $1.5million to do Star Trek VI and I said 'Thanks, I don't want to <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> want to do the Academy.'" [...] Actor Walter Koenig approached Mancuso with a new script outline codenamed [...] "In Flanders Fields"; in it, the Romulans join the Federation and go to war with the Klingons. The Enterprise crew, except Spock, are forced to retire for not meeting fitness tests. When Spock and his new crew are captured by a monstrous worm-like race of aliens (which Koenig described as [...] "things that the monsters in Aliens evolved from"), the old crew must rescue them. In the end, all of the characters except McCoy and Spock die.|$|E

Several days after the album's release, Trent Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends and business partners with Iovine – called Manson a [...] "dopey clown", and said that [...] "He is a malicious guy and will step on anybodies face to succeed and cross any line of decency." [...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way.

[...] He likened his {{emotions}} on those occasions to [...] "a big blackness", {{and found that}} performing the song helped him to purge them from his mind on some occasions. Several scenes in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum depict Bono with his arm in a sling, {{a result of his}} falling and dislocating his shoulder during a performance of [...] "Exit" [...] on 20 September 1987 in Washington. The concert was being filmed for the movie, and the Edge stated that [...] "the show was not going well". Bono fell while running across the stage [...] "in an attempt to try [...] get something going". Recalling the incident, Bono said [...] " [...] had taken me to some ugly place... but it was rage that caused it. That was when I realized rage is an expensive thing for your general well-being."

[...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said three or four months ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> believe we will be up there with them soon."

500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I {{think it would be a}} lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't quite take that step."

[...] Gallo was also alluding to a quote of Phil Mickelson after the 2006 U.S. Open, in which he came to the 72nd hole with a one-shot lead over Geoff Ogilvy, but double-bogeyed the hole to hand the title to Ogilvy: [...] "I still am in shock <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> just can't believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> am such an idiot." ...|$|R

I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

Their investigation leads the detectives to discover Angela had several strange boyfriends and worked at an S fashion store and a phone sex hotline. The two detectives visit the Eastern Shores Marketing Phone Sex operation where they speak with the manager, Ed. [...] Ed tells them about a boyfriend of Angela's named Chris Novoselic (Dan Garrett) who used {{to spend time with}} her at an S club called 'The Eve of Destruction' on Fayette Street. [...] Pembleton and Bayliss go to the Eve of Destruction to question Novoselic. [...] During questioning, Bayliss gets angry and loses his cool with Novoselic slamming the leather-clad, multi-pierced freak against the wall telling him that if he doesn't start giving them some answers, he is gonna slap some cuffs on him, take him downtown and knock him around' whereby Novoselic responds by telling Bayliss, 'If you <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> might have to kiss you!'. [...] Pembleton calms Bayliss and they leave. [...] While driving, Bayliss claims to be disgusted by the sexual taboos, but Pembleton insists everybody has a darker side and that until Bayliss recognizes his own, his virtues can never truly be tested. Pembleton and Bayliss return to the S fashion store and ask about leather belts with bead patterns matching the marks on Angela's neck. Store owner Tanya (Adrienne Shelly) tells them Angela's neighbor Jeremy (Scott Nielson) has a jacket with a matching belt. After an interrogation, Jeremy confesses to choking and accidentally killing Angela with the belt during quirky and violent (but consensual) sex. As a thank you for solving the case, Tanya brings Bayliss a leather jacket as gift, which he reluctantly accepts. That night, Bayliss visits Baltimore's red light district wearing the jacket, as a way to test himself as Pembleton suggested. He is approached by a prostitute but rejects her, thus passing the test.|$|E
