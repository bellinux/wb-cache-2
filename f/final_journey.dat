5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of her seventh and <b>final</b> <b>journey</b> for American Export, Siboney was handed over on 28May 1941 to the U.S.Army for transport duty. After a hasty outfitting, the redesignated USAT Siboney was put to work transporting troops. Based in New York, she made trips {{up and down the}} Atlantic and into the Caribbean, and, by the end of 1941, had called at Bermuda, San Juan, Trinidad, St. John's, Charleston, Newport News, Cristóbal, Jamaica, and Panama.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October 1941, the {{battalion}} entrained at Oakbank {{and began the}} journey north. They detrained at Alice Springs, where they camped overnight before continuing the journey by road in a 44-vehicle convoy, which took them further north to Larrimah. There they once again entrained for the <b>final</b> <b>journey</b> to Winnellie, which they reached on 19 October, after overnighting in Katherine.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a major {{coaching}} route, {{there were}} several obstacles along it, including the bridge over the Tyburn. A turnpike trust {{was established in the}} 1730s to improve upkeep of the road. It became notorious as the route taken by prisoners on their <b>final</b> <b>journey</b> from Newgate Prison to the gallows at Tyburn near Marble Arch. Spectators drunkenly jeered at prisoners as they carted along the road, and could buy rope used in the executions from the hangman in taverns. By about 1729, the road had become known as Oxford Street.|$|E
40|$|<b>Final</b> <b>Journeys</b> 1 & 2 was {{an ambitious}} {{programme}} {{launched by the}} Hospice Friendly Hospitals (HFH) team of the Irish Hospice Foundation (IHF) {{in partnership with the}} Health Service Executive (HSE). Its educational aim was to enable healthcare staff and volunteers to become more confident, competent and comfortable in addressing end-of-life issues with patients, their families and fellow members of staff. It involved a massive logistical exercise that saw participation by 623 healthcare personnel at 49 sessions, involving up to 201 volunteer facilitators between September 2010 and May 2011.

50|$|Yass was {{a battleground}} between {{the town and}} the Sydney to Melbourne railway; because of the {{topography}} the New South Wales Government Railways wanted to bypass the town by a few kilometres. Naturally, the people of the town wished the railway to pass closer or through it. In 1892 a light railway or tram was built to connect Yass Junction on the main line and Yass Town. The last trains operated on the line on 29 October 1988 when steam locomotives 1210 and 3112 operated three <b>final</b> <b>journeys</b> on the line.|$|R
5|$|The Llanbadarn tithes {{were not}} easy to collect: both the {{fishermen}} and the farmers of north Cardiganshire strongly resented the payments {{they had to make}} in goods, while the goods themselves (fish, corn, farm stock etc.) were {{not easy to}} collect and had to be sold for the money to pass to the Chichesters. It was easy for agents and collectors to line their own pockets, and {{to take advantage of the}} now-widowed Catherine by withholding their accounts. In 1727, she travelled to Cardiganshire by herself to claim her legal rights and stayed over winter. She then had to do so again in 1730: all her efforts were met with blank refusals and lies. During her long periods of forced residence she witnessed the beaching of ninety porpoises at Aberystwyth which were slaughtered by the local people. Her <b>final</b> <b>journey</b> to Wales in 1734 proved fatal, and she died in the county: a slate memorial to her is still to be seen above the vestry door in Llanbadarn church.|$|E

30|$|In {{recent years}} {{intermodal}} transport has received an increased attention due to problems of road congestion, environmental concerns and traffic safety. A growing {{recognition of the}} strategic importance of speed and agility in the supply chain is forcing firms to reconsider traditional logistic services. As a consequence, research and policy interest in intermodal freight transportation problems is growing. Macharis and Bontekoning [18] define intermodal transport as the combination {{of at least two}} modes of transport in a single transport chain, without a change of container for the goods, with most of the route travelled by rail, inland waterway or ocean-going vessel and with the shortest possible initial and <b>final</b> <b>journeys</b> by road. Intermodal transport may include various types of transport modes. In this paper we concentrate on the combination rail/road and waterways/road using containers as loading units.|$|R

500|$|On 1 September 1915, nine men {{in teams}} of three began {{the task of}} hauling {{approximately}} [...] of stores from the Cape Evans base on to the Barrier—the scientist Alexander Stevens remained at base camp, alone. This operation was the first stage {{in the process of}} laying down depots at intervals of one-degree latitude (60 nautical miles/110km/69 statute miles), down to Mount Hope [...] {{at the foot of the}} Beardmore Glacier. A large forward base was then established at the Bluff depot, just north of 79°, from which the <b>final</b> <b>journeys</b> to Mount Hope would be launched early in 1916. During these early stages, Mackintosh clashed repeatedly with Joyce over methods. In a showdown on 28 November, confronted with incontrovertible evidence of the greater effectiveness of Joyce's methods over his own, Mackintosh was forced to back down and accept a revised plan drafted by Joyce and Richards. Joyce's private comment was [...] "I never in my experience came across such an idiot in charge of men." ...|$|R

25|$|Journey to Jerusalem: After {{the death}} of the Baptist, about half way through the gospels (approximately Matthew 17 and Mark 9) two key events take place that change the nature of the {{narrative}} by beginning the gradual revelation of his identity to his disciples: his proclamation as Christ by Peter and his transfiguration. After these events, {{a good portion of the}} gospel narratives deal with Jesus' <b>final</b> <b>journey</b> to Jerusalem through Perea and Judea. As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem through Perea he returns to the area where he was baptized.|$|E
25|$|In the gospels, the {{ministry}} of Jesus starts with his Baptism by John the Baptist, when he is about thirty years old. Jesus then begins preaching in Galilee and gathers disciples. After the proclamation of Jesus as Christ, three of the disciples witness his Transfiguration. After the death of John the Baptist and the Transfiguration, Jesus starts his <b>final</b> <b>journey</b> to Jerusalem, having predicted his own death there. Jesus makes a triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and once there friction with the Pharisees increases {{and one of his}} disciples agrees to betray him for thirty pieces of silver.|$|E
25|$|Later in this period, {{at about}} the middle {{of each of the}} three Synoptic Gospels, two related episodes mark {{a turning point in the}} {{ministry}} of Jesus: the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration of Jesus. These episodes begin in Caesarea Philippi, just north of the Sea of Galilee, at the beginning of the <b>final</b> <b>journey</b> to Jerusalem which ends in the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus. These episodes mark the beginnings of the gradual disclosure of the identity of Jesus as the Messiah to his disciples; and his prediction of his own suffering and death.|$|E
