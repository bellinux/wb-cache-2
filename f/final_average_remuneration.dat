40|$|The {{issue of}} the basic teachers' {{remuneration}} is still very far from a reasonable solution. Data published by the INEP (based on the 2006 PNAD) show, first of all, an extreme disparity in the country: the highest <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> {{was found in the}} Federal District, with R$ 3. 371, 00, considerably above all other states. The second highest <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> was paid in the state of Rio de Janeiro and the third one in Sergipe; both were a little above 60 % in comparison with the salary paid in the Federal District. The smallest <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> was found in Pernambuco: only 24 % of the salary paid in the Federal District. It seems we are not talking of the same country, so great is the disparity. Secondly, there is no major correspondence between higher remuneration and better school performance, partially because there is no automatic correlation, partially because higher remuneration does not result from the acknowledgment of the students' school performance, but in general from the political struggle waged by the teachers' unions. Perhaps this explains the fact that Sergipe, a state from the Northeast, has the third highest <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> in the country. Even so, the article supports the idea that it is fundamental to improve the living conditions of teachers, especially because of their social dignity, of which they are also noteworthy constructors. Therefore, the recent proposal of 40 working hours per week and a basic salary of R$ 950, 00 seems to be very unsatisfactory, as it cannot regulate teachers' work time preferably in eight hours daily. It is very important to achieve, over time, a more visible correlation between the improvement of the teachers' remuneration and the improvement of students' learning...|$|R

40|$|From {{funding to}} teacher quality, inequities exist between school districts. This paper {{adds to the}} {{literature}} on inequities by examining the impact of pension plan formulas on pension benefits. Using data from the salary schedules of 464 Missouri school districts, this paper analyzes how various <b>final</b> <b>average</b> salary calculations would impact the benefits of teachers in different districts. All of the schools in this analysis belong to Missouri’s Public Employee Retirement System, which is a defined-benefit pension plan. A teacher’s benefit in this plan is based on her years of experience and her <b>final</b> <b>average</b> salary. The system uses a three-year <b>final</b> <b>average</b> salary calculation. This captures salaries when they are most inequitable, {{at the end of}} the schedule.
