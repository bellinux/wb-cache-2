Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the approach of}} <b>GRADE</b> <b>to</b> rating <b>quality</b> of evidence. GRADE specifies four categories-high, moderate, low, and very low-that are applied to a body of evidence, not to individual studies. In {{the context of a}} systematic review, quality reflects our confidence that the estimates of the effect are correct. In the context of recommendations, quality reflects our confidence that the effect estimates are adequate to support a particular recommendation. Randomized trials begin as high-quality evidence, observational studies as low quality. "Quality" as used in GRADE means more than risk of bias and so may also be compromised by imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of study results, and publication bias. In addition, several factors can increase our confidence in an estimate of effect. GRADE provides a systematic approach for considering and reporting each of these factors. GRADE separates the process of assessing quality of evidence from the process of making recommendations. Judgments about the strength of a recommendation depend on more than just the quality of evidence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Testing using n-detection test sets, {{in which}} a fault is {{detected}} by n (n> 1) input patterns, is being increasingly advocated to increase defect coverage. However, the data volume for an n-detection test set is often too large, resulting in high testing time and tester memory requirements. Test set selection is necessary {{to ensure that the}} most effective patterns are chosen from large test sets in a high-volume production testing environment. Test selection is also useful in a timeconstrained wafer-sort environment. We use a probabilistic fault model and the theory of output deviations for test set selection—the metric of output deviation is used to rank candidate test patterns without resorting <b>to</b> fault <b>grading.</b> <b>To</b> demonstrate the <b>quality</b> of the selected patterns, we present experimental results for resistive bridging faults and nonfeedback zero-resistance bridging faults in the ISCAS benchmark circuits.
