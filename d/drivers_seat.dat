25|$|During the 2006 British Motor Show in London, Aston Martin Racing {{revealed}} a near stock {{version of the}} V8 Vantage that would compete in the Nürburgring 24 Hours endurance race. The car, {{now known as the}} V8 Vantage N24, was driven by Aston Martin CEO Dr. Ulrich Bez, development engineer Chris Porrit, development driver Wolfgang Schuhbauer and German journalist Horst Graf von Saurma-Jeltsch in the 24‑hour race. The car finished 4th in class and 24th overall, before being driven home on public roads after the race. While essentially much like the existing coupé, the N24 had a front splitter and extended door sills for aerodynamic efficiency, a full roll cage, a racing fuel tank, and other modifications necessary to make the car race worthy. Other modifications include the removal of most of the interior, including all seats, replaced by a lone Recaro <b>drivers</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn ergonomically {{designed}} <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> {{is crucial in}} ensuring quality, comfort and safe driving. The increase in road accidents every year is mostly linked to drivers’ fatigue. Therefore, posture comfort is an important aspect in <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> design. The {{aim of this study}} is to design a <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> which is suitable for Malaysians. There are three main objectives in this study; firstly, to investigates the comfort level and safety system of the existing <b>driver's</b> <b>seat,</b> secondly, to identify and determine parameters which may affect comfort and the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> safety system, and lastly, to develop and design an ergonomic <b>driver's</b> <b>seat.</b> Anthropometric data of drivers should be used during the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> design stage. Critical dimensions of the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> and anthropometric data must be taken into consideration in order to optimize the comfort level and safety of the seat. Previous studies showed that the evaluation of <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> discomfort should include both objective and subjective evaluations. The seat discomfort will negatively affect the driver's performance. All information pertaining to the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> design was obtained through research on the related subjects. In the data collection phase, the objective evaluation method was used in determining the seat's dimension while subjective evaluation was used to gather information on the drivers’ experience. Anthropometric data from 1405 male and female subjects were collected and stored in a database. Meanwhile, subjective evaluation on <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> discomfort was conducted on 100 male and female respondents. The SPSS software was used to analyse the data. Every parameter that affects the safety and comfort of the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> were then used to design a new <b>driver's</b> <b>seat.</b> The parameters that were taken into account are backrest height, cushion width, cushion length and adjustability. These parameters were then matched with the Malaysian drivers’ anthropometric data. Finally, the dimensions of the new <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> were determined: 520 mm cushion width; 380 mm cushion length, 480 mm backrest width, 407. 5 mm backrest height and 180 mm adjustability...|$|R

2500|$|Investigations {{concluded}} the trams {{were not in}} line with UK safety standards (in fact they would suffer more damage than a UK car {{in the event of}} accident) due to their height and width. Additionally other problems were found including the <b>drivers</b> <b>seat</b> being {{on the opposite side of}} the road (UK roads drive from the left), Conversion to remove ticket sales (Tickets are sold from the stops before boarding). LRT system requirements dictate the separation of the driver from direct passenger contact for road safety reasons. As the driver was next to the door (in order to receive fares), this wasn't possible.|$|E
2500|$|Some notable {{changes to}} the design of the Mk III for the Mk III C were {{concentrated}} on the cockpit and nose areas. [...] While the Mk III had a roll hoop which ran the full width of the cockpit, the Mk III C was designed to share the roll hoop design of the Northstar LMP. [...] This standard hoop was positioned immediately behind the <b>drivers</b> <b>seat</b> and integrated the intakes for the engine, although an option roll hoop extension was offered as it was required for the Rolex Sports Car Series. [...] The front of the cockpit was also redesigned, as an aerodynamic windshield was added immediately in front of the driver.|$|E

2500|$|On the September 22 {{episode of}} Raw, Shane McMahon was hospitalized {{after the events}} in his match against Kane at Unforgiven. Shane sent a [...] "message" [...] to Kane, {{but before he could}} finish, Kane {{appeared}} in Shane's hospital room and attacked him. The attack led to Shane bleeding from his forehead and Kane telling him to [...] "Get Well Soon!". Two weeks later, Shane interfered in a match between Kane and Rosey, which angered Kane. After the match, Kane ran around rampant backstage looking for Shane. Kane walked by a Semi-Truck and saw Shane, who taunted Kane and jumped into a limousine. Kane broke the limousine's window and got in through the sunroof. Shane proceeded to get out from the <b>drivers</b> <b>seat</b> and rigged the limousine to crash directly into another truck. After the crash, workers attend to the limousine with a bloody Kane inside. The following week on Raw, Shane challenged Kane, who was in the hospital recovering from the car crash from the week before, to a match at Survivor Series. As the challenge was made, Kane sprang up and attacked a doctor and a nurse who were attending to him. On the October 27 episode of Raw, Shane challenged Kane to an Ambulance match, which Kane accepted. At Survivor Series, Kane defeated Shane after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on him and then throwing Shane into the ambulance.|$|E
2500|$|The C4 {{represented}} a clean {{break from the}} previous generation of Corvette with a completely new chassis and modern, sleeker styling. Since emissions regulations were still changing and electronic engine management was in its infancy, horsepower was, compared to earlier generations, low. Therefore, the primary design emphasis, {{at least for the}} launch, was on handling and braking, with all-independent suspension with light-weight suspension and wheels, and all new brakes with aluminum calipers. The front suspension saw the C3's coil springs replaced by a transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring, which was only 1/3 of the weight of the coil springs while also introducing an anti-roll bar-like effect on the front. The price of this no-holds-barred emphasis on handling was ride comfort, especially with the Z51 performance and handling package. The C4 did not use separate body-on-frame construction like its predecessors. [...] Instead, it used what GM termed a [...] "uniframe", which consisted of a traditional perimeter frame, with the door posts, windshield frame, halo, and the rear portion of the floor pan integrated into one welded assembly. [...] This was not a [...] unibody assembly, as none of the exterior body panels were structural members. [...] Due to a styling decision to use a targa top instead of T-tops, there was no structural member tying the windshield frame to the halo as on the C3. [...] This required extremely tall side rails on the frame to maintain chassis rigidity, and as a result, the door sills were quite deep, with entry and exit likened by contemporary auto journals to a [...] "fall in and climb out" [...] experience. [...] The targa top bolted into place, becoming a structural component, rather than simply latching on like T-tops. [...] Despite the tall frame rails, the C4 was prone to rattles and squeaks, especially with the targa top removed. [...] The emergency brake, located between the door sill and the <b>drivers</b> <b>seat,</b> was moved lower and toward the rear of the car in 1988 for easier entry and exit.|$|E
