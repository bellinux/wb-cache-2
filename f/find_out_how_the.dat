500|$|One of CERA's {{objectives}} in approving the implosion was to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> soil behaved, as Radio Network House {{was built on}} one of the worst soils in Christchurch. Seismograph readings showed ground velocity of 12mm/s, which is comparable to a large truck slowly driving across the demolition site. With any residual concerns about the performance of poor soils during building implosions removed, it will be much easier for other building owners to obtain consent from CERA. Further implosions are likely, with a representative from Controlled Demolition, Inc. describing the Christchurch market as a [...] "target-rich environment". So far, only the Christchurch Central Police Station has since also been demolished by implosion in early 2015; this happened in May 2015.|$|E
500|$|Editor N.C. Christopher Couch {{considered}} the book's physical format to be Eisner's major {{contribution to the}} graphic novel form—few in comic book publishing had experience in bookmaking, whereas Eisner gained intimate familiarity with the process during his time at American Visuals. [...] The book succeeded in getting into bookstores, though initial sales amounted to a few thousand copies in its first year; stores had difficulty finding an appropriate section in which to shelve it. [...] It was put {{on display at the}} Brentano's bookstore in Manhattan, and reportedly sold well. [...] Eisner visited the store to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> book was faring after being taking down from display. [...] The manager told him it had been placed in the religious section, and then in humor, but customers had raised concerns that the book did not belong in those sections.

500|$|Collecting up {{a number}} of his men, he headed for the town of Sallenelles, where he hoped to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> 9th Parachute Battalion had fared assaulting the Merville Battery. En route, however, he and his party were strafed by low-flying German {{aircraft}}, forcing the paratroopers to dive for cover; when the aircraft had departed Hill stood up again, finding that he had been wounded in the buttocks and the officer next to him had been killed. Most of the other men had either been killed or wounded during the attack, leaving only himself and the commander of his headquarters defence platoon; once first aid had been administered to the wounded, Hill continued on and finally managed reach Ranville, where the headquarters of the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major-General Gale, had been set up. After being informed by Gale that his brigade had successfully completed its objectives, Hill had his wound tended to, and then travelled to his own headquarters; there he found Lieutenant Colonel Pearson in temporary command, who informed him that many the brigade's staff had been killed during the drop.
