5000|$|The {{distinction}} among private, {{public and}} positional goods brings different rules for deriving total demand. In a <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>view,</b> [...] total demand {{of a private}} good is the horizontal sum of individual demands. For a public good, instead, total demand is the Samuelsonian vertical summation of individual demands. Finally, for positional goods, the optimal level of consumption does not coincide, {{as it does in}} the case of private goods, with the intersection of any individual marginal rate of substitution curve with the marginal cost curve since an externality emerges for the consumption of other. Thus, we should first calculate the total marginal rate of substitution and, consequently, findthe intersection with the marginal cost curve. As in the case of public goods, the total marginal rate of substitution is calculated by the summation of individual marginal rates of substitution. But in the case of positional goods, one marginal rate of substitution is subtracted since there is negative consumption. Therefore, the total marginal rate of substitution is {{the difference between the two}} individual marginal rates of substitution.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{software}} development process, software engineers produce numerous documents, ranging from initial specification documents to documents associated with implementation. Some of these documents are diagrammatic in nature, such as traditional design documents. Others are textual such as program source code. Textual software engineering documents, particularly source code, contain relational structures which are most naturally presented diagrammatically. This paper investigates the types of diagrams that are commonly used by software engineers throughout the life of software. To establish the requirements of such diagrams in a generic manner, a set of review criteria was created.

Its application to other components of software engineering environments (SEE) has additional benefits but also presents new challenges.

In this article, there is clear understanding of ischemic cascade followed by the mechanism of all damaging factors like energy failure, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, cell death modes: necrosis, apoptosis along with histological changes.

40|$|Abstract. The paper motivates and {{describes}} a model oriented ap-proach for consistent specification of interface suites in UML. An inter-face suite is a coherent collection of interfaces defining interactions that transcend component boundaries. The specification of interface suites contains <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>views</b> and documentation, {{but it is}} extended with templates for structured specifications deriving from the ISpec approach. To guarantee that the specification views, documentation and templates are consistent, a specification model has been constructed. The model contains both structural and behavioural information, represented {{in the form of}} sequences of carefully designed tuples. The model provides the underlying structure for the tool supporting the design process. The tool directs the designer to specify all elements of the model in a consistent way. The specification is collected both by customized specification tem-plates and by diagrams. The documentation and the diagram elements- both derived from the template information- are automatically gener-ated. This prevents errors and provides specification consistency...|$|R
40|$|DNA of the polyoma virus {{exists in}} a closed {{circular}} form. At present it is generally acknowledged that this form is typical of bacterial DNA and of cytoplasmic DNA in animals. Furthermore, giant DNA molecules in higher organisms form loop structures held together by protein fasteners in which each loop is largely analogous to closed circular DNA. The distinctive feature of closed circular molecules is that its topological state cannot be altered by any conformational rearrangement short of breaking DNA strands. This topological constraint {{is the basis for}} the characteristic properties of closed circular DNA which have fascinated biologists, physicists and mathematicians for the past 40 years. In this chapter we concentrate our attention on physical properties of circular DNA which understanding is necessary for the successful analysis of the biological effects connected with this form of the molecule. 1 DNA SUPERCOILING Basic Concepts Closed circular DNA and linking number Two forms of circular DNA molecules are extracted from the cell; they were designated as form I and form II. The more compact form I was found to turn into form II after a singlestranded break was introduced into one chain of the double helix. Subsequent studies performed by Vinograd et al. (1965) linked the compactness of form I, in which both DNA strands are intact, to supercoiling. Form I came to be called the closed circular form. In this form each of the two strands that make up the DNA molecule is closed in on itself. A <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>view</b> of closed circular DNA is presented in Fig. 1...|$|E
40|$|A 1, 000 Mev {{synchrotron}} {{is under}} construction. The magnet {{will be a}} ring magnet containing about 900 tons of steel. The plates are of 1. 2 inch steel with a 0. 1 percent carbon content. A diagram of the cross section of this magnet is given in Figure 1. The design of the vacuum chmnber presents some difficulties since the space behind the gap is not large enough to permit {{easy access to the}} windings and to the vacuum space behind the gap. The field strength at the gap is 15, 000 gauss with a 1 sec. rise time. A d. c. generator of 1, 000 v and 10, 000 amps and a flywheel will be used to energize the magnet and store the energy. Plans for the vacuum system are not complete, but probably a porcelain system will be used. This will reduce the gap quite considerably. It is planned to inject at 3, 000 volts. The energy added to be about 200 ev per revolution. The frequency range is 250 kc/sec to 10 mc/sec; the power required is 10 Kw. A <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>view</b> of the electrical arrangement of the r. f. system is given. The variable inductance is a coil tipped at variable pitch into a pool of mercury. The energy is supplied by four 3 J 160 E tubes. The frequency must be accurate to 0. 1 percent at the time of injection and after that 1 percent is sufficient. This is to be accomplished by means of a peeking coil in the field. The injection period is 100 microseconds. It is planned to use a 0. 5 Mev d. c. Philips set to supply the injection voltage...|$|E
