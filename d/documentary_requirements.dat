5000|$|First, {{accidental}} Americans {{born in the}} United States {{may encounter}} difficulties when attempting to enter the U.S. on a non-U.S. passport, as U.S. law (...) requires all U.S. citizens to use U.S. passports when entering the country. An airline employee or U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who notes the U.S. place of birth in the passport might refuse to allow the person to board a flight, or demand that the person pay a fee {{to apply for a}} waiver of the passport requirement. Famously, London mayor Boris Johnson was denied boarding on a flight which transited the U.S. in 2006, after which he first claimed that he wanted to renounce his U.S. citizenship, but instead applied for a U.S. passport some years later. In the past, Canadians were unlikely to encounter such difficulties, because passports were not required to cross the Canada-United States border, but {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative tightened <b>documentary</b> <b>requirements</b> for entering the United States by land or by sea, and so Canadians crossing the into the United States had to show proof of Canadian citizenship; if they used a Canadian passport as such proof, it would indicate their place of birth.|$|E

The question is asked; is sufficient attention given to smes in the drafting of ftas or is the trade policy directed to "the big end of town?" This paper highlights the difficulties of enterprises in navigating through the multitude of trade agreements. One of the issues is that the documentation accessing ftas is not uniform.

In point of fact, we may without difficulty differentiate three types of writings: [l] writing that is not shaped by <b>documentary</b> <b>requirements,</b> (2] writing that is not shaped by the <b>documentary</b> <b>requirements</b> of the compilations we now have, and also [3] writing that is entirely formed within {{the rules of the}} documents that now present that writing.

A composition that is included in such a document but pursues its own program, idiosyncratic by the criterion of the document that contains it, but conforming to the protocol of some other document, was written with that other document in mind. An example would be, for example, a composition in Leviticus Rabbah that clearly follows the program and plan of Genesis Rabbah, or in Sifra that clearly follows those of the Mishnah. There are, in addition, extensive compositions and composites that find a natural place in no document we now have, e. g., collections of sayings attributed to, and stories about, named authorities, though we have no documents made up of collections of such materials formulated around individual sage's name or around sages as a group.

Consequently, a L/C is desirable in high value and/or high risk transactions. The guarantee is conditional upon the seller complying 100 % with the <b>documentary</b> <b>requirements</b> of the L/C, an issue of particular concern to exporters, as the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) estimates worldwide documentary discrepancy rates of 70 %. L/C transactions are governed by ICC rules, and whilst these provide an international standardised process, the differing interpretations of what constitutes documentary compliance create difficulties for sellers in particular. The new rules, UCP 600, supposedly have simpler and clearer wording, to reduce ambiguity and differences in interpretation, and hopefully reduce documentary discrepancy rates and the associated financial risks. This article examines the major changes introduced by the UCP 600 and comments on their likely impact on future L/C business. Whilst acknowledging some improvements were introduced in the UCP 600, the article concludes that a number of issues have been ignored to the detriment of traders. export finance; international banking regulations; international trade finance; letters of credit; UCP 600; financial risks. ...|$|E
40|$|Nigerian women, through history, {{actively}} {{participate in}} the social, economic and political development of their societies. This is particularly true of women in southern Nigeria, especially Yoruba women. Women traders working in the informal sector are often subject to harassment and extortion at the border. These constraints undermine their economic activities. Women are more readily denied access to key trader networks than men. Time-consuming trade procedures and <b>documentary</b> <b>requirements</b> impinge more heavily on women, given the time they need for their household duties. And women working to produce exportable goods and services are typically less able than men to get the inputs and materials that would raise their productivity {{and allow them to}} compete better in overseas markets. A major setback for women in crossborder trade is violence. This ranges from rape and other forms of sexual abuse, theft, robbery to seizure of goods. This paper therefore, examined the incidence of violence against young women in informal cross-border trading in South- West Nigeria and its implications for economic development and poverty reduction, relying purely on secondary sources of data and relevant sociological theories. Findings in this project will bring to the fore, the constraints to the success of economic activities of young women and the effects on wealth creation and poverty reduction in South-West, Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{conducted by}} students {{as part of}} the MECH 4552 advanced design course at The University of Queensland. This is a capstone course offered to senior students in Space Engineering. It requires a synthesis of multidisciplinary material to achieve a complex design task, and validation of the results through construction, assembly and ground and flight testing. Groups of up to 4 students spend 8 to 10 months researching, designing, constructing and testing an engineering payload. The culmination is a field trip to the Woomera Test Range in South Australia, where the payloads are launched onboard a Zuni sounding rocket {{as part of the}} Australian Space Research Institute (ASRI) Small Sounding Rocket Program (SSRP). Payloads launched in recent years include a pulse detonation engine, ramjet, composite payload module and boundary layer transition experiment. Emphasis is placed mostly on directed technical achievement and students are responsible for all stages of the project. Team work and project management play an important role, and students are required to achieve compliance with the <b>documentary</b> <b>requirements</b> of the regulatory bodies involved. It is an intensive, hands-on, educational experience which challenges the students to develop the all-round integrated skills needed to be an effective practicing engineer. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|Trade {{transaction}} costs (TTCs) related to border procedures {{vary depending on}} the efficiency and integrity of interacting businesses and administrations, the characteristics or kind of goods, and the size and type of businesses. Total costs may be seen as being composed of directly incurred costs, such as expenses relating to supplying information and documents to the related authority, and indirectly incurred costs, such as those arising from procedural delays. Empirical studies suggest that directly and indirectly incurred TTCs each amount to 1 - 15 per cent of traded goods’ value. Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that TTCs for agro-food products are higher than those for manufactured goods, as agro-food shipments are subject to special border procedures, such as sanitary and phyto-sanitary controls. Also, small and medium-sized enterprises face cost-disadvantages. In light of this diversity in TTCs, the potential for the realisation of benefits from trade facilitation varies across countries, sectors, and types of traders. In cases where best practices are already applied, further efficiency gains will be difficult to achieve. But if border clearance costs are substantially above those encountered under best practices, room for improvement through suitable measures of trade facilitation will tend to exist. The model-based analysis of the economic impacts of trade facilitation carried out in this study differs from earlier research by taking several salient features of import and export procedures into account. In particular, the differing characteristics of direct and indirect TTCs are represented, and country-specific differences in trade facilitation potential are reflected according to empirical information on border waiting times and survey-based evidence on the quality of border processes. In addition, the higher TTCs for agro-food products and small and medium-sized enterprises are incorporated into the analysis. The analysis does not evaluate the economic and trade impact of specific trade facilitation measures or instruments, such as those that might result from a possible future WTO agreement on trade facilitation. Instead, the aim of the assessment is to better represent empirical characteristics of the border process in model-based analysis and to identify those features that crucially affect the results and that, therefore, deserve to be further explored in future analysis. Several scenarios of hypothetical, multilateral trade facilitation efforts are evaluated, focusing on the comparison of scenarios rather than the overall welfare gains that might result from trade facilitation.

40|$|Background: The {{significance}} of the paper is twofold. Firstly, it adds to the small but growing body of literature focusing on the decomposition of South Africa’s export growth. Secondly, it identifies the determinants of the intensive and extensive margins of South Africa’s exports – a topic that (as far as the authors are concerned) has not been explored before. Aim: This paper aims to investigate {{a wide range of}} market access determinants that affect South Africa’s export growth along the intensive and extensive margins. Setting: Export diversification has been identified as one of the critical pillars of South Africa’s much-hoped-for economic revival. Although recent years have seen the country’s export product mix evolving, there is still insufficient diversification into new markets with high value-added products. This is putting a damper on export performance as a whole and, in turn, hindering South Africa’s economic growth. Methods: A Heckman selection gravity model is applied using highly disaggregated data. The first stage of the process revealed the factors affecting the probability of South Africa exporting to a particular destination (extensive margin). The second stage, which modelled trade flows, revealed the variables that affect export volumes (intensive margin). Results: The results showed that South Africa’s export product mix is relatively varied, but the number of export markets is limited. In terms of the extensive margin (or the probability of exporting), economic variables such as the importing country’s GDP and population {{have a positive impact on}} firms’ decision to export. Other factors affecting the extensive margin are distance to the market (negative impact), cultural or language fit (positive impact), presence of a South African embassy abroad (positive impact), existing free trade agreement with Southern African Development Community (positive impact) and trade regulations and costs (negative impact). In terms of the intensive margin (or the factors influencing the volume of exports), there are strong parallels with the extensive margin, with the exception being that the time involved in exporting has more of an impact than <b>documentary</b> <b>requirements.</b> Conclusion: Among the factors contributing to South Africa’s exports having largely developed in the intensive margin are a general lack of market-related information, infrastructural weaknesses (both of a physical and technological nature) and a difficult regulatory environment – all of which add to the cost and time involved in exporting. Policymakers have long spoken about the need for the country to diversify its export basket, but now talk about needs to give way to action. The government and its economic partners need to arrive at a common vision of an export sector that will be able to expand into new products and markets, be an active participant in global value chains and deliver sustainable jobs...|$|E
