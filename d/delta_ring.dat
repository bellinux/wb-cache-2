The primary objective {{of this study was}} the determination of the constraints on the sizes of the ring particles. The Voyager UVS and PPS occultations probed the epsilon and <b>delta</b> <b>rings</b> at significantly shorter wavelengths (0. 11 μm and 0. 27 μm, respectively) and at substantially different viewing geometries than a large number of existing Earth-based occultations. These differences combine to produce a unique mutual sensitivity among the UVS, PPS and Earth-based observations to the particle properties of the rings. Our results yield slight, but significant differences between PPS and UVS optical depths. We interpret these differences as wavelength dependent scattering due to a population of small particles in the mm to cm size range in epsilon and <b>delta</b> <b>rings.</b> The size distribution of particles in epsilon and <b>delta</b> <b>rings</b> were found to be similar, the main difference being the total number of particles. In contrast to studies at longer wavelengths, our results imply a relatively steep particle size distribution characterized by a power law of index 3 or greater...|$|R

Observational evidence is presented for interactions between 1986 U 7 and 1986 U 8 and the epsilon, delta, and gamma rings. The likelihood that these two satellites are shepherding the epsilon ring and are responsible for some of its internal structure is assessed, {{and the results are}} used to propose a reduction in the ring radius scale.

The results of theoretical investigations of planetary ring dynamics are then applied to these associations, and their dynamical significance is evaluated.

40|$|To improve beam quality, the <b>DELTA</b> storage <b>ring</b> (TU Dortmund) {{conducted}} {{a number of}} orbit-feedback developments in the past, including a successful fast local orbit feedback project. To enable hadron accelerators to benefit from this knowledge, a collaboration was formed between <b>DELTA,</b> the storage <b>ring</b> COSY (Forschungszentrum Jülich) and the SIS 18 accelerator (GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung GmbH, Darmstadt). The goals were {{the development of a}} global fast orbit feedback system for the <b>DELTA</b> storage <b>ring,</b> the development of a local feedback for the COSY electron beam cooler section and a global feedback for the SIS 18 accelerator. This thesis describes the development and application of a universal position measurement system, usable for electron and hadron accelerators and targeted to fast orbit feedback applications, in the framework of this collaboration. The developed distributed system has input capabilities for electron or hadron beam position monitors and output options for feedback tasks and different control system connections. It is connected by a versatile communication structure. The developed common hardware platform is re-programmable and therefore usable as an input device as well as for feedback- or other measurement tasks. It delivers data at a constant data rate of 10 kHz, resulting in a target feedback-rate of up to 1 kHz. It was used to evaluate beam position data globally at DELTA, locally at SIS 18 and locally at the COSY beam cooler section. At DELTA, the system forms the basis for a future fast orbit feedback system, which is expected to significantly increase the beam quality for synchrotron radiation based research as well as ongoing electron-beam/laser interaction experiments. The system can also be used as a high precision data source for the slow orbit feedback system in operation. The COSY measurements show the possibility of a local fast orbit feedback system at the storage ring's electron cooler. The data analysis of the SIS 18 accelerator suggests the utilization of a feedback system to improve beam quality during ramping.

40|$|Ring orbit {{studies for}} Uranus have been {{particularly}} fruitful because of the ability, through occultations, to obtain data of high spatial resolution {{at the rate of}} 1 to 2 times per year. The occultation program at M. I.

Two stellar occultations by Uranus occurred in May 1985, and were observed with a network of large telescopes that encompassed the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Portable quartz-oscillator time standards were used at all observatories, and were calibrated before and after each event.

40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of renewable energy}} sources such as wind, CHPs, photovoltaic in the electrical power networks has coined the term of distributed generation (DG) penetration into the electrical power grids. Often this DG penetration is concentrated in the distribution grids leading to complex electrical behaviour, in terms of power flow and voltage of the distribution grid. At present, the understanding of stability and dynamic behaviour of the medium voltage distribution grids {{as a result of}} increased DG penetration is limited. As a consequence, {{there is a need to}} improve the present monitoring of medium voltage (MV) electrical distribution grids. This has prompted Delta Network Group (DNWG), one of the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) of the Netherlands to install Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in their 50 kV <b>Delta</b> <b>ring</b> distribution grid resulting in increased observability of the 50 kV distribution grid. However, with the increased observability there is a need to analyse the distribution grid based on the data generated by the PMU monitoring system. The aim of this thesis, is to analyse and evaluate the 50 kV <b>Delta</b> <b>ring</b> distribution grid in terms of steady state and dynamic voltage and power flow behaviour based on the real time data acquired from the PMUs. The approach involves at first modelling the Delta distribution grid under study in PowerFactory software. The grid is modelled partly in detail based on actual parameters of components like 50 kV cables, transformers, CHP synchronous generators and assuming already available standard generic models for distributed generation like wind turbines, and controller models for CHP plants. The software model forms the basis for analysis of the distribution grid; at first the instantaneous steady state power flow behaviour based on PMU and SCADA data. Furthermore, evaluating the distribution grid during two contingencies considered as case studies; -Switching out a 50 kV cable. (contingency in the 50 kV distribution grid) -Loss of generation from wind power plant. (contingency in the 0. 4 / 10 kV sub distribution grid) The contingencies are actual past grid events observed by the PMUs and using this data, along with the data from the SCADA monitoring system the contingencies are simulated, analysed in terms of power flow and voltage behaviour. The results for each contingency are compared with the PMU and SCADA monitoring system. The analysis reveals the bi-directional power flow nature in the Delta distribution grid majorly influenced by the variation in the distributed generation. Extending the analysis in case of contingencies, the common observations during both the cases show slight changes in voltages and redistribution of power flow in the 50 kV distribution grid. The voltage fluctuations are within the stable operating limits. A possible explanation for this is the connection of the Delta 50 kV ring distribution grid to a secure 150 kV transmission network of the Netherlands. The power balancing of the distribution grid is also done by the 150 kV transmission network in both the cases without having a significant impact on the response of the distributed generation during both the cases studied. Lastly, the work conducted in this thesis provides an insight and a general framework into analysing the Delta MV distribution grid containing distributed generation based on the data obtained from the PMU monitoring system.

The experiment was performed at the <b>DELTA</b> storage <b>ring</b> in Dortmund, Germany, employing the interaction of external intensity-modulated laser pulses with an electron bunch, which causes a periodic longitudinal modulation of the charge density on a sub-millimeter scale. Furthermore, a strong influence of third-order dispersion in the laser pulses on the bandwidth and peak intensity of the THz radiation was observed. This effect is discussed in detail based on numerical simulations of the laser pulse generation and laser-electron interaction, and a modification of the laser system for compensating third-order dispersion is proposed...|$|R

For most of the thesis Delta = R, a commutative ring with unity. However, in the early work, some results on the general structure of alglat are obtained, and in particular, Theorem 1. 9 shows that it is an inverse limit. The next section of the thesis is concerned with reflexivity, and considers rings R for which all non-torsion or all finitely generated R-modules are reflexive. Theorem 3. 4 gives eight equivalent conditions on an h-local domain R to the assertion that every finitely generated R-module is reflexive, that is R is scalar- reflexive. A local version of this property is introduced, and it is shown in Theorem 2. 17 that a locally scalar-reflexive ring is scalar-reflexive.

The Elites ally with the humans of In Amber Clad to stop the firing of the ring, but inadvertently set all the remaining Halo rings to be remotely activated from a location known as the Ark, placed outside the range of the Halo Array to protect certain species from the firing of the Halo rings, built as a foundry for the rings including replacing any that get destroyed.|$|R
