5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, Mulkey {{resigned}} the seat effective December 17, 1918, and McNary was then reappointed to the Senate on December 12, 1918, and took office on December 18, {{instead of taking}} office <b>in</b> <b>January,</b> <b>when</b> his term {{he was elected to}} would have started. Mulkey resigned in order to give McNary a slight seniority edge over other new members of the Senate. In 1920, former adversary Stanfield defeated incumbent Democrat George Earle Chamberlain for Oregon's other Senate seat, making McNary the state's senior senator. McNary won re-election four times, in 1924, 1930, 1936, and 1942, serving in Washington, D.C., until his death.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} rest of the 1894–95 winter {{preparing}} clothing and equipment for the forthcoming sledge journey. Kayaks were built, to be carried on the sledges until needed for the crossing of open water. Preparations were interrupted early <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>when</b> violent tremors shook the ship. The crew disembarked, fearing that the vessel would be crushed, but Fram proved herself equal to the danger. On 8 January 1895 the ship's position was 83°34′N, above Greely's previous Farthest North record of 83°24.|$|E
5|$|Following Mikan's {{retirement}} in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but {{still managed to}} win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals. Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year. Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season. Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games. They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>when</b> the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.|$|E

5|$|White {{became a}} member of Hui Aloha ʻĀina oNa Kane (Hawaiian Patriotic League for Men), a {{patriotic}} group founded shortly after the overthrow of the monarchy to oppose annexation and support the deposed queen. A corresponding female league was also founded. The ranks of the men's group were largely composed of the leading native politicians of the former monarchy, including Nāwahī, who served as its president. A delegation (not including White) was elected by its members to represent the case of the monarchy and the Hawaiian people to the United States Commissioner James Henderson Blount sent by President Grover Cleveland to investigate the overthrow. During this politically uncertain time, White traveled to Honolulu at the end of 1893 on the steamer W.G. Hall upon hearing rumors of the monarchy's restoration and returned to Lahaina <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>when</b> he discovered the reports were false. The native resistance, the results of the Blount Report, and President Cleveland's refusal to annex the island stopped the annexationist scheme and prompted the Provisional Government to establish an oligarchical government, styling itself the Republic of Hawaii, until a more favorable political climate emerged in Washington. In April 1894 White and John Richardson gave a speech at Lahaina opposing the new regime and asking the people not to participate in the election of delegates to the constitutional convention in Honolulu. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina gave speeches and held meetings across much of the island, and it was reported that foreigners and natives alike in Maui (with the exception of the residents of Hana) were strongly against the attempts to establish a republic.|$|E

In mid-1970, Hachème was chosen to be the {{chief of staff of the}} Service Civique, a command whose officers did not see service. The Civique was, rather, more agricultural in nature, and served several other roles. Captain Pierre Kadjo Koffi was named his assistant.|$|E
25|$|Earlier, <b>in</b> <b>January,</b> <b>when</b> {{the company}} formed, Henry Tizard, the rector of Imperial College London and {{chairman}} of the Aeronautical Research Committee (ARC), had prompted the Air Ministry's Director of Scientific Research to ask for a write-up of the design. The report was once again passed on to Griffith for comment, but was not received back until March 1937 by which point Whittle's design was well along. Griffith had already started construction of his own turbine engine design and, perhaps to avoid tainting his own efforts, he returned a somewhat more positive review. However, he remained highly critical of some features, notably the use of jet thrust. The Engine Sub-Committee of ARC studied Griffith's report, and decided to fund his effort instead.|$|E
500|$|The Rules of the Game {{is remembered}} as a {{commentary}} on the moral callousness of the European upper class and their servants just {{before the beginning of}} World War II. While making the film, Renoir knew a new world war was coming; he later said {{there was a sense of}} it in film, and wrote [...] "it is a war film and yet there is no reference to the war." [...] This sense of doom began just before shooting started <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>when</b> Barcelona fell to Franco and throughout the production when Prime Minister of France Édouard Daladier recognized Francoist Spain, Italy annexed Albania and Adolf Hitler prepared his Polish invasion.

500|$|By October {{the inmates}} were {{evacuated}} to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, where inmates were suffering from severe overcrowding and {{a shortage of}} food. Wiesenthal's big toe on his right foot had to be amputated after a rock fell on it while he {{was working in the}} quarry. He was still ill <b>in</b> <b>January</b> <b>when</b> the advancing Soviets forced yet another evacuation, this time on foot, to Chemnitz. Using a broom handle for a walking stick, {{he was one of the}} few who survived the march. From Chemnitz the prisoners were taken in open freight cars to Buchenwald, and a few days later by truck to Mauthausen concentration camp, arriving in mid-February 1945. Over half the prisoners did not survive the journey. Wiesenthal was placed in a death block for the mortally ill, where he survived on 200 calories a day until the camp was liberated by the Americans on 5 May 1945. Wiesenthal weighed [...] when he was liberated.|$|E
500|$|The Allied Air Forces {{had used}} 233,847 rounds of ammunition, and dropped 261 500-pound and 253 thousand-pound bombs. They claimed 19 hits and 42 near misses with the former, and 59 hits and 39 near misses from the latter. Of the 137 bombs dropped in low level attacks, 48, or 35percent, were {{claimed to have}} hit, but only 29, or 7.5percent, of the 387 bombs dropped from medium altitude. This {{compared}} favourably with efforts in August and September 1942 when only 3percent of bombs dropped were claimed to have scored hits. It was noted that the high and medium altitude attacks scored few hits but dispersed the convoy, while the strafing runs from the Beaufighters had knocked out many of the ships' anti-aircraft defences. Aircraft attacking from multiple directions had confused and overwhelmed the Japanese defences, resulting in lower casualties and more accurate bombing. The results therefore vindicated not just the tactics of mast height attack, but of mounting coordinated attacks from multiple directions. [...] The Japanese estimated that at least 29 bombs had hit a ship during the battle. This was a big improvement over the Battle of Wau back <b>in</b> <b>January,</b> <b>when</b> Allied aircraft attacked a Japanese convoy consisting of five destroyers and five troop transports travelling from Rabaul to Lae, but managed to sink just one transport and beach another.|$|E
500|$|Mousinho {{missed the}} start of the 2011–12 season due to {{suffering}} a calf injury during pre-season, subsequently missing Stevenage's first three games of the campaign. He returned to first-team action on 16 August 2011, starting in a 3–1 away victory against Bournemouth, scoring Stevenage's second goal of the game from the penalty spot. Mousinho's second goal of the season came in Stevenage's 5–1 win against Sheffield Wednesday at Broadhall Way, beating defender Rob Jones for pace before driving a shot from 20 yards past goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell. He injured a metatarsal bone in his right foot in Stevenage's 1–0 away victory against Hartlepool United in the FA Cup on 12 November 2011, and was subsequently ruled out of first-team action for six weeks. Mousinho suffered another setback <b>in</b> <b>January,</b> <b>when</b> scans revealed further damage to the metatarsal bone. After a brief substitute appearance in Stevenage's reserve game against Southend United in early April 2012, Mousinho returned to first-team action on 14 April 2012, coming on as a late substitute in the club's 6–0 away victory at Yeovil Town. In the club's next match, a [...] "vital" [...] game against fellow play-off contenders Carlisle United, Mousinho came on as a substitute in the 73rd minute and scored the winning goal three minutes later as Stevenage ran out 1–0 winners. He made 23 appearances during an injury-hit season, scoring three goals. Just three days after Stevenage's play-off semi-final defeat, on 17 May 2012, Stevenage announced that Mousinho had turned down an improved contract and was leaving the club after two years.|$|E
