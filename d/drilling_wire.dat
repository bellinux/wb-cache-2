The reliability trends for the <b>wired</b> <b>drill</b> pipe telemetry system on Martin Linge are positive.

Early start-up of the utilization of <b>wired</b> <b>drill</b> pipe telemetry has familiarized everyone with the equipment and handling of the tools, and has contributed to the network uptime gradually increasing. Several examples of how to use the along string measurement pressure sensors will be presented, with respect to pack-off detection, hole cleaning, lost circulation and leak off testing. These can be used as means of analysing downhole data in real-time and used as a basis for software development. In the end, high speed transfer of data between downhole tools and surface are reducing telemetry time and saving rig time. Currently, a reduction in telemetry time of 5. 87 [hours/ 1000 m drilled] has been achieved. Thus, a lot of cost has been saved by decreasing time spent on downhole communication...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringIn any {{drilling}} operation, it {{is important}} to maintain the annulus pressure within the geo-pressure margins (collapse and pore pressure on one side and fracturing pressure on the other side). The downhole pressure management may simply consist of limiting the operational drilling parameters (flow-rate, pump acceleration, rotational and axial velocities and accelerations of the drill-string) {{in such a way that}} the downhole pressure stays within the open hole formation pressure window. In Practice, the downhole pressure is only sparsely measured, both in time and depth. With traditional mud pulse telemetry, it is only possible to have sensors in the direct vicinity of the MWD (Measurement While Drilling) tool and because of the low communication bandwidth, the measurement sampling interval is seldom better than half a minute. Even with the best downhole telemetry system available for <b>drilling</b> (<b>wired</b> pipe data transmission), the sampling interval is about five seconds and multiple pressure sensors, if any, are usually distant by 300 – 400 m. Considering that the speed of sound in drilling fluids is usually more than 1000 m/s, it is not possible to capture, with currently available downhole pressure instrumentation, any of the transient pressure pulses that may cause problems during a drilling operation. To compensate for this deficiency, simulations of the downhole pressure using mathematical models are used to fill the gaps, in space and time, between the downhole and surface pressure measurements. However there are external factors that influence the accuracy of such models. For instance, the actual wellbore position is derived from indirect measurements: the inclination, the azimuth and the measured depth at the measurement. These angles and length measurements can be biased by systematic errors that can result in a miscalculation of the position of the well. As a consequence, an over or under estimation of the actual vertical depth of the well may introduce discrepancies in the estimation of the downhole pressure. Other sources of inaccuracies are the actual temperature gradient along the well, the proportion of cuttings in suspension, the presence of gas in the drilling fluid, the variations of borehole size due to cuttings beds or hole enlargements. Any of these elements influences the accuracy of the pressure prediction made by models, especially at some distance from the downhole measurement location. This thesis presents quantitative and qualitative estimations of the influence of these factors on the pressure estimation accuracy...|$|R

All the systems presented in this thesis shows great improvement in accuracy and response time compared to conventional kick detection methods. The new early kick detection systems are using different methods to detect kicks; standpipe pressure, annular discharge pressure, well pressure measurements by the use of <b>wired</b> <b>drill</b> pipes, delta-flow comparison, and real-time simulations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Core {{decompression}} is {{an efficient}} treatment for early stage ischemic necrosis of the femoral head. In conventional procedures, the pre-operative X-ray only shows one {{plane of the}} ischemic area, which often results in inaccurate drilling. This paper introduces a new method that uses computer-assisted technology and rapid prototyping to enhance drilling accuracy during core decompression surgeries and presents a validation study of cadaveric tests. Twelve cadaveric human femurs were used to simulate early-stage ischemic necrosis. The core decompression target at the anterolateral femoral head was simulated using an embedded glass ball (target). Three positioning Kirschner <b>wires</b> were <b>drilled</b> into {{the top and bottom}} of the large rotor. The specimen was then subjected to computed tomography (CT). A CT image of the specimen was imported into the Mimics software to construct a three-dimensional model including the target. The best core decompression channel was then designed using the 3 D model. A navigational template for the specimen was designed using the Pro/E software and manufactured by rapid prototyping technology to guide the drilling channel. The specimen-specific navigation template was installed on the specimen using positioning Kirschner <b>wires.</b> <b>Drilling</b> was performed using a guide needle through the guiding hole on the templates. The distance between the end point of the guide needle and the target was measured to validate the patient-specific surgical accuracy. The average distance between the tip of the guide needle drilled through the guiding template and the target was 1. 92 ± 0. 071 mm. Core decompression using a computer-rapid prototyping template is a reliable and accurate technique that could provide a new method of precision decompression for early-stage ischemic necrosis...|$|R
