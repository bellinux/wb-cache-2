40|$|Purpose: The {{introduction}} of the <b>klapskate</b> in speed skating confronts skaters {{with the question of}} how to adjust the position of the hinge in order to maximize performance. The purpose of this study was to reveal the constraint that <b>klapskate</b> hinge position imposes on push-off performance in speed skating. Method: For this purpose, a model of the musculoskeletal system was designed to simulate a simplified, two-dimensional skating push off. To capture the essence of a skating push off, this model performed a one-leg vertical jump, from a frictionless surface, while keeping its trunk horizontally. In this model, <b>klapskate</b> hinge position was varied by varying the length of the foot segment between 115 and 300 mm. With each foot length, an optimal control solution was found that resulted in the maximal amount of vertical kinetic and potential energy of the body's center of mass at take off (...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We analyse the {{development}} of world records speed skating from 1893 to 2000 {{for both men and}} women. The historical data show that {{it is likely that the}} relation between skating speed and distance of the various events is non-linear and converges to a limit value. We pay special attention to technical innovations in speed skating, especially, the introduction of the <b>klapskate</b> in the 1996 / 1997 season, and its impact on the long-run limit value. We focus on endurance and we estimate lower bounds for world records given the current technological state of the art. ...|$|E
40|$|Half the {{improvement}} in 1500 -m speed-skating world records {{can be explained by}} technological innovations and the other half by athletic improvement. It is hypothesized that improved skating economy is accountable for much of the athletic improvement. PURPOSE: To determine skating economy in contemporary athletes and to evaluate the change in economy over the years. METHODS: Contemporary skaters of the Dutch national junior team (n= 8) skated 3 bouts of 6 laps at submaximal velocity, from which skating economy was calculated (in mL O 2 ·kg(- 1) ·km(- 1)). A literature search provided historic data of skating velocity and submaximal V̇O 2 (in mL·kg(- 1) ·min(- 1)), from which skating economy was determined. The association between year and skating economy was determined using linear regression analysis. Correcting the change in economy for technological innovations resulted in an estimate of the association between year and economy due to athletic improvement. RESULTS: An average (±SD) skating economy of 73. 4 ± 6. 4 mL O 2 ·kg(- 1) ·km(- 1) was found in contemporary athletes. Skating economy improved significantly over the historical timeframe (- 0. 57 mL O 2 ·kg(- 1) ·km(- 1) per year, 95 % confidence interval [- 0. 84, - 0. 31]). In the final regression model for the <b>klapskate</b> era, with altitude as confounder, skating economy improved with a non-significant - 0. 58 mL O 2 ·kg(- 1) ·km(- 1) each year ([- 1. 19, 0. 035]). CONCLUSIONS: Skating economy was 73. 4 ± 6. 4 mL O 2 ·kg(- 1) ·km(- 1) in contemporary athletes and improved over the past ~ 50 years. The association between year and skating economy due to athletic improvement, for the <b>klapskate</b> era, approached significance, suggesting a possible improvement in economy over these years...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} project, {{we aim to}} provide speed skaters with {{real-time}} feedback {{on how to improve}} their skating performance within an individual stroke. The elite skaters and their coaches wish for a system that determines the mechanical power per stroke. The push-off force of the skater is a crucial variable in this power determination. In this study, we present the construction and calibration of a pair of wireless instrumented <b>klapskates</b> that can continuously and synchronously measure this push-off force in both the lateral direction and normal direction of the skate and the centre of pressure of these forces. The skate consists of a newly designed rigid bridge (0. 6  kg), embedding two three-dimensional force sensors (Kistler 9602, Kistler Group, Winterthur, Switzerland), which fits between most individual skate shoes and Maple skate blades. The instrumented <b>klapskates</b> were calibrated on a tensile testing machine, where they proved to be unaffected to temperature conditions and accurate up to an RMS of 42  N (SEM =  1  N) in normal and up to an RMS of 27  N (SEM =  1  N) in lateral direction. Furthermore, the centre of pressure of these forces on the blade was determined up to a mean error of 10. 1  mm (SD =  6. 9  mm). On-ice measurements showed the possibility of recording with both skates simultaneously and synchronously, straights as well as curves. The option to send data wirelessly and real-time to other devices makes it possible to eventually provide skaters and coaches with visual real-time feedback during practice...|$|R
40|$|In {{the sport}} of long track speed skating, in recent {{years there has been}} an {{increasing}} desire for training tools which provide deeper technical insight of the skating movement to the athlete and coaches. In previous literature a variety of measurement systems have been presented; one such system included the instrumented <b>klapskate</b> developed at the Delft University of Technology. Alongside the implementation of this new instrumented <b>klapskate,</b> a simplified piezo-resistive pressure sensor system has been applied with high performance Dutch speed skaters; however, to this point the best application of such a system has not been shown. This research examined the potential ways in which this simplified system may provide valuable feedback to a skater, with consideration for the feedback currently available within the sport. Through a combination of bench and on-ice testing, the system was evaluated for its ability to predict skating forces (normal, lateral, and absolute), the center of pressure of force application, peak stroke force, and finally, contact time for individual strokes. Despite an inability to generate a full profile of skating force, the PRPS system provided reasonable estimations of peak stroke normal (RMSE = 50. 2 N) and absolute (RMSE = 50. 5 N) forces in the straights, while in the curve, peak normal (RMSE = 129. 4) and absolute (RMSE = 131. 5 N) force estimates were less accurate. Stroke timing was predicted with accuracy, giving minor underestimation in both the straight (RMSE = 0. 0671 s) and curves (RMSE = 0. 0474 s). Center of pressure measurement was largely unsuccessful when attempted on the bench using a tensile load cell, however estimations applied to on-ice data yielded trends in center of pressure position consistent with previous literature, suggesting future viability as a feedback parameter. For future work, a larger sample size and further on-ice testing would be recommended for verification and improved development of this prototype system. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the current study}} were to 1) test if the hinge position in the binding of skating skis has an effect on gross efficiency or cycle characteristics and 2) investigate whether hinge positioning affects synergistic components of the muscle activation in six lower leg muscles. Eleven male skiers performed three 4 -min sessions at moderate intensity while cross-country ski-skating and using a <b>klapskate</b> binding. Three different positions were tested for the binding's hinge, ranging {{from the front of the}} first distal phalange to the metatarsal-phalangeal joint. Gross efficiency and cycle characteristics were determined, and the electromyographic (EMG) signals of six lower limb muscles were collected. EMG signals were wavelet transformed, normalized, joined into a multi-dimensional vector, and submitted to a principle component analysis (PCA). Our results did not reveal any changes to gross efficiency or cycle characteristics when altering the hinge position. However, our EMG analysis found small but significant effects of hinge positioning on muscle coordinative patterns (P < 0. 05). The changed patterns in muscle activation are in alignment with previously described mechanisms that explain the effects of hinge positioning in speed-skating klapskates. Finally, the within-subject results of the EMG analysis suggested that in addition to the between-subject effects, further forms of muscle coordination patterns appear to be employed by some, but not all participants...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{application}} of genetic technology seems to threaten {{what is considered}} natural in elite sport. This paper explores the role of genetic technology in elite sport and questions the significance of dichotomizing between the natural and artificial element. How do shifts in technology affect the attribution of the human element in athletic performance? To explore the attribution of human agency we compare the genetic enhancement of athletes with two other shifts of the ‘natural performance ’ in sport: first, {{the introduction of a}} revolutionary high jump technique, the Fosbury flop, in 1968; and, second, the introduction of the <b>klapskate</b> in speed skating in 1997. The three cases show that artificiality as such can hardly be a criterion for evaluating processes of innovation. The context of elite sport is itself highly artificial. Boundaries between the natural body and the enhanced body are the outcome of institutional processes of boundary work. When discussing new technologies in sport it is better to ask if athletes are still playing the same game and whether or not there are equal opportunities and an equal distribution of means for playing the game. The introduction of gene technology may result in inequalities, with great impact on the outcome of the game. This outcome may be considered irrelevant for the inequalities that the game is supposed to produce and measure. Genetic enhancement may also threaten the public view of athletes as moral agents and possibly change the appreciation for human performance...|$|E
