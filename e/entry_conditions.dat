2500|$|The first, most casual, {{and most}} usual way {{the game is}} played among {{individual}} gamers not involved in regular group play is what's called the [...] "pick-up game". Each ship in the game has what's called a Basic Point Value, or BPV. This can be considered to be the [...] "cost" [...] of the ship, besides its value in combat. In the pick-up game each player or team is given a certain number of BPV (casually referred to as [...] "points") to [...] "buy" [...] the starships they will play. There are also optional items of equipment available to certain races/ships that can also be [...] "bought" [...] and added to the player's order of battle (including sundries such as improved drones or fire control, mines, extra boarding parties, multirole shuttles or fighters, etc.). Gaming commences when all players have [...] "spent" [...] all their BPV and gathered the required game materials to deploy their chosen battleforces. All players must agree on <b>entry</b> <b>conditions</b> for their forces (weapons status, hexes of first appearance, presence of [...] "terrain" [...] such as asteroid fields or minefields) and the [...] "ground rules" [...] that will be in effect during play (mainly which optional rules will or will not be used; mainly electronic warfare or mid-turn speed changes). Typically victory in the pick-up game demands simple destruction of the enemy (or enemies depending on the number of sides in play) but players may devise other victory conditions by mutual consent.|$|E

We show that prices decrease, and the evolution of demand determines the equilibrium number of varieties {{at the point where the}} oldest vintage firm earns zero profits. Second, under a free <b>entry</b> <b>condition</b> assumption, the lifetime horizon of each variety will be characterized by decreasing prices accompanied by increasing demand levels...|$|R

We use German administrative labor market data to show that the matching function correlation solely based on idiosyncratic productivity and free entry is very close to the empirical matching function. Consequently, we argue that standard matching function estimations are seriously biased if idiosyncratic productivity plays a role for match formation. In this case, they are not suitable for the calibration of labor market models...|$|R
