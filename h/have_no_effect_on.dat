If bees obtain their nectar from certain flowers, the resulting honey can be psychoactive, or even toxic to humans, but innocuous to bees and their larvae.

5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). The beetles <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the nesting birds, {{and the reason for}} their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E

5|$|Viral {{infections in}} animals provoke an immune {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Antibiotics <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> anaphylaxis.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Heros main mode of play is Career Mode, {{where the}} player and in-game band travel between various fictional {{performance}} arenas and perform sets {{of four or}} five songs. Completing songs in this mode unlocks the songs for play within the other game modes. Players can choose their on-stage character and their guitar; these elements <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> gameplay but affect the visuals during the performance. In Career Mode, players can earn money from their performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus content, such as additional songs, guitars and finishes, can be unlocked. Quick Play mode allows the player to play any unlocked track, selecting the difficulty, the character, venue and guitar. After successfully completing a song in either Career or Quick Play mode, the player is given a score and a rating between three-five stars, depending on his or her overall performance.|$|E

5|$|Poehler became {{pregnant}} {{during the latter}} half of the season, with her baby due in the summer or early fall of 2010. The Parks and Recreation producers decided not to write the pregnancy into the show, so they decided to enter into a continuous production after the season ended to bank episodes for the third season. Six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion. However, in May 2010, NBC announced the third season of Parks and Recreation was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow the network's new comedy, Outsourced, to run in the Thursday two-hour comedy schedule block. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the show's momentum, but could actually build anticipation for its eventual return. In November 2010, it was announced Parks and Recreation would return to a 9:30p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011.|$|E
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E

Mice vaccinated with viable H 37 Ra cells produced a high immune response and did develop delayed hypersensitivity to PPD. Rifampin <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> this immune response, but reduced the footpad reactions to PPD. Both mycobacterial RNA and poly(A:U) served as adjuvants for induction of hypersensitivity to PPD. This hypersensitivity was reduced by the administration of rifampin.
