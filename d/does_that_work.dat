60|$|There {{is no more}} {{difficult}} problem {{in the world than}} that of the relation of the state of consciousness, termed volition, to the mechanical work which frequently follows upon it. But no one can even comprehend the nature of the problem, who has not carefully studied the long series of modes of motion which, without a break, connect the energy which <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work</b> with the general store of energy. The ultimate form of the problem is this: Have we any reason to believe that a feeling, or state of consciousness, is capable of directly affecting the motion of even the smallest conceivable molecule of matter? Is such a thing even conceivable? If we answer these questions in the negative, it follows that volition may be a sign, but cannot be a cause, of bodily motion. If we answer them in the affirmative, then states of consciousness become undistinguishable from material things; for it is the essential nature of matter to be the vehicle or substratum of mechanical energy.|$|E
6000|$|Those {{who have}} {{appreciated}} his work most {{up to the}} present time articulate no wish for a change, so completely <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work</b> seem to them, in its kind, the exact translation of his thought, the exact [...] "fit" [...] of his artistic temperament. It is difficult to imagine a young painter less in the dark about his own ideal, more lucid and more responsible from the first about what he desires. In an altogether exceptional degree does he give us the sense that the intention and the art of carrying it out are for him one and the same thing. In the brilliant portrait of Carolus Duran, which he was speedily and strikingly to surpass, he gave almost the full measure of this admirable peculiarity, that perception with him is already by itself a kind of execution. It is likewise so, of course, with many another genuine painter; but in Sargent's case the process by which the object seen resolves itself into the object pictured is extraordinarily immediate. It is as if painting were pure tact of vision, a simple manner of feeling.|$|E

40|$|When I was {{considering}} {{the question of}} the moral right to attribution and how unauthorized fan creativity relates to that concept, it struck me that there are two interesting issues from a theoretical perspective. The first is: who gets the credit?

And as a student, my question was – <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work?</b> Is that good enough? I was interested in these disclaimers because copyright law does not have an explicit place in the fair use test for evaluating disclaimers as a factor favoring a defense in the way that trademark law does. I, nonetheless, concluded that, in general, fan fiction was going to be fair use. It has yet to be litigated to any particular conclusion. Although cease and desist letters do so still go out, and fans still either comply or they say no, generally there is no result. That is, I {{think a lot of the}} copyright owners are unwilling to deal with the publicity and the possibility of finding this as fair use in a litigated case...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, the range and power of {{information}} technologies has expanded dramatically. In this chapter, we examine in some detail optical technology, hypertext, and the marriage of the two—interactive multimedia. Each provides powerful tools for accessing and delivering information spanning diverse media. In concert, these technologies underlie a set of new “cognitive enhancers ” that may significantly alter {{the manner in which}} teachers teach and students learn. Optical Technologies Perhaps our first acquaintance with optical technology was the compact disc, or CD, that brought noise-free music into our living rooms. These 12 -centimeter (4. 72 -inch) shiny silver disks, introduced in the 1980 s, have rapidly advanced in the consumer market. Both CDs and their larger siblings, videodiscs, hold information that is read by a light beam generated by a low-intensity laser—thus, their designation as “optical” technologies. How <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work?</b> The Basics of the Technology Standard computer storage media like hard disks and floppies store information magnetically; variations in magnetism along each disk track are interpreted as strings of 0 s and 1 s.

When the narrow, concentrated light beam from the laser strikes the surface of the optical disc, the reflected light varies in intensity, depending on whether all the ligh...|$|E
40|$|A {{recurring}} {{question in}} narrative scholarship {{has been the}} relationship of narrative to law. Most narrative scholars agree that stories are central to law. As Stephen Paskey recently pointed out, stories {{are more than a}} tool for persuasion. They are embedded in law’s very structure. But how <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work?</b> Are rules just stories articulated in a different form? We have barely begun to explore narrative’s roles, but it is already clear that, in the words of Meryl Streep, “it’s complicated. ” A conceptual map of what we’ve learned so far can help us unpack the complexity. Otherwise we may run into two problems: We may be less likely to understand and appreciate each other’s work, and we may have trouble thinking clearly about how law and narrative relate. This article takes a first run at a conceptual map, one that honors the work of narrative scholars of various stripes and explains how the strands in this rich body of work interrelate. With that proposed structure in mind, the article then offers some thoughts about how stories relate to rules. It argues that rules are not the opposite of stories, nor are they just stories in a different form. Rather, at every level of their creation, justification, interpretation, and application, rules are constructed from multiple narrative influences. Understanding these influences will produce judges better able to make good decisions and lawyers better able to perfect their craft. Much work remains to be done, but as the map demonstrates, we are well on our way...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{community}} team at Sobell House {{needed to}} find ways of managing increasing numbers of referrals. It was felt that one person exclusively undertaking telephone support would free more time for others to visit patients with the greatest need at home. The idea was viewed by some with scepticism -"palliative care by phone? How <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work</b> then?". In December 2009 an advanced nurse practitioner was appointed on a six month trial. PROCESS: The telephone support nurse holds a caseload of 80 - 100 patients. Call frequency is agreed individually and ranges from weekly to monthly. Patients or others can also phone for advice or to discuss changes. Home visits, outpatient appointments or admissions can be arranged as needed. Aspects of care covered include psychological support, symptom management, medication changes, coordination with other services, the provision of information, suggesting 'coping strategies', and so on. RESULTS: The role rapidly proved its worth and the post was made substantive after three months. Feedback from patients and carers from three surveys using detailed questionnaires has been unequivocally positive: We find it very reassuring that help, support and understanding is just a phone call away … Thank you for being there for us and making a difference … [has] taken a positive holistic view outside the treatment regimes … They [other services] are more task and treatment orientated, this provides something which supports living my life. More detailed feedback is available for presentation. CONCLUSION: Regular telephone contact in palliative care can work safely and effectively in providing support at all levels. The role is fully integrated into and valued by the community team and service as a whole. Key is an open, empathic and unhurried approach...|$|E

It isimportant {{to be able to help}} capture the students ’ ideas, before they disappear and seem like little more than moments of magic! In enabling children to learn how numbers work, the current emphasis on mental computation is driven by the principles of constructive learning. It is here that questions of ‘how ’ and ‘why’ become particularly important for both teachers and students. When students are working mentally, simple questions posed to an individual or a class of students, such as, ‘How did you work this out? ’ and, ‘Why <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work?</b> ’ allow us to peer into the world of number and gain an understanding from the perspective of the students. It also encourages students to re-evaluate their own ideas when exposed to the thinking of their peers. Experiences that encourage discussion and learning are far removed from the emphasis on activities that focus on testing that have dominated mental computation in primary and secondary classrooms for so long. Many teachers rightly feel that testing activities of some sort still have a place in the classroom, for example, as a quick way of gauging what types of questions students are able to cope with. However, as the sole approach to teaching mental computation, they really are a thing of the past. Talking in depth to students is often thought to be the privi-lege of a researcher, but increasingly teachers are being encouraged ANNALIESE CANEY provides questioning techniques to help teachers ‘capture ’ the mathematical ideas of children as they explain their mental computation strategies.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how different organizations and authorities work and collaborate to make children of mentally ill parents more visible. The question formulations, which are used in our research, are: - How do different organizations and authorities work to make children of mentally ill parents more visible and how can this work be improved? - How do laws and guidelines affect the organizations and authorities work to make children of mentally ill parents more visible? - Is there any collaboration between the different organizations and authorities concerning work with children of mentally ill parents, and how <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work</b> appear? A qualitative method strategy was chosen to gather an in-depth understanding of the informant’s experiences and to collect descriptive information. Six organizations and authorities were selected from the comprehension that they could be important in giving support and because it is possible for them to pay attention to these children. Interviews were performed by using a half- structured interview guide. The study indicates that it is important to pay attention to these children in an early state. It is unclear which organization or authority that has the main responsibility for this task. There seems to be a need for more information and knowledge in the society about mentally illness to decrease the stigmatization. A wider perspective is more often used in the society rather than the specific subject “children of mentally ill parents”. This wider perspective often contains other features, such as abuse and addiction. The secrecy and the obligation to give notice to the social services, can affect the way of paying attention to these children in a negative way. There seems to be a lack of mutual guidelines concerning paying attention to children of mentally ill parents. Collaboration between the organizations and authorities is considered to be necessary, but there is an uncertainty about how it should be organized and accomplished in practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to better {{understand}} how efforts to make non-formal education more "evidence-based" actually unfold in practice. I focus specifically on three cases, two of which involve mandates to implement evidence-based programs, while the third involves incorporation of evidence-based practices. The three cases are instances of a larger contextual shift towards more "scientific" approaches to education research and evaluation, part of the "era of accountability. " That shift has fomented much debate in recent years, producing theoretical critiques that-while insightful-are often rhetorical and polemical, lacking a clear grounding in particular practical settings. To address that lack, this study analyzes what actually happens, in practice, when people support the implementation of evidence-based programs or engage in related efforts to make non-formal education more "evidence-based. " In essence, I ask: What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>work</b> entail? Specifically, I ask (1) How is evidence-based program and evidence-based practice work actually practiced? (2) What perspectives and assumptions about what non-formal education is are manifested through that work? and (3) What conflicts and tensions emerge through that work related to those perspectives and assumptions? Empirically, this qualitative study is based on data from in-depth interviews, observation, and document analysis. Theoretically, it is informed by critical perspectives on epistemological politics, drawing especially from the field of science and technology studies. Through my elucidation of the intricacies and contingencies involved in making nonformal education more "evidence-based," I am able to highlight divergent perspectives and assumptions about what non-formal education is and about how it should be informed by research evidence. Specifically, non-formal education is constituted by some people as an infrastructure for the dissemination of scientific information and by others as a grassroots site for knowledge sharing. Relatedly, it is alternatively perceived and performed as a program (meaning a tightly bounded, scripted curriculum) or as a set of practices. While the conflicts and tensions between these divergent perspectives may appear academic or irrelevant, I argue that they have stark implications for what non-formal education is and can be in society, concluding that the self-evident superiority of evidence-based programs must be revisited. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|E
