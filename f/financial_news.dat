25|$|After 57 {{years of}} rivalry the Financial Times and the <b>Financial</b> <b>News</b> were merged in 1945 by Brendan Bracken {{to form a}} single six-page newspaper.

The longest-running of these was the former <b>Financial</b> <b>News</b> Index, started on 1 July 1935 by the <b>Financial</b> <b>News.</b> The FT published a similar index; this {{was replaced by the}} <b>Financial</b> <b>News</b> Index—which was then renamed the Financial Times (FT) Index—on 1 January 1947. The index started as an index of industrial shares, and companies with dominant overseas interests were excluded, such as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later BP), British-American Tobacco, Lever Brothers (later Unilever) and Shell.

25|$|During World War II, Bracken became {{close to}} Lord Camrose, the {{proprietor}} since 1919 of the Financial Times. The two privately agreed {{to raise their}} advertising rates to protect their finances, and eventually agreed that the other would have first refusal if one wanted to sell. Towards {{the end of the}} war, Camrose decided to sell the Financial Times, and arrangements for a merger were put in place. The financial deal was a complex one: the <b>Financial</b> <b>News</b> raised the cost of buying a controlling interest in the Financial Times by selling its own offices and investments, and by a share issue, but could only make up the full amount by simultaneously selling to the Financial Times the copyright and goodwill of the <b>Financial</b> <b>News.</b> Camrose himself bought some <b>Financial</b> <b>News</b> shares to help the deal along.|$|E
25|$|The new {{ownership}} was {{put together}} by Brendan Bracken, who had been elected {{to the board of}} Eyre & Spottiswoode.

25|$|In August 2008, the American {{cable channel}} CNBC began {{to present the}} first series on Monday nights, but it was aired in {{disparate}} time slots {{or not at all}} due to the network's abrupt shifting of their programme schedule in order to cover developments regarding the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, leading to the series not being broadcast in full.
