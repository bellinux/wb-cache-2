5000|$|The {{photoconductive}} gain [...] is {{the probability}} that an excited electron contributes to the photocurrent—or more generally, the number of electrons in the external circuit, divided {{by the number of}} quantum well electrons that absorb a photon. Although it might be counterintuitive at first, it is possible for [...] to be larger than one. Whenever an electron is excited and extracted as photocurrent, an extra electron is injected from the opposite (<b>emitter)</b> <b>contact</b> to balance the loss of electrons from the quantum well.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of an in-situ {{hydrogen}} bake and an ex-situ HF etch prior to polysilicon deposition on the electrical characteristics of bipolar transistors fabricated with low thermal budget in-situ phosphorus doped polysilicon emitter contacts. <b>Emitter</b> <b>contact</b> deposition in an UHV-compatible LPCVD cluster tool is also compared with deposition in a LPCVD furnace. TEM and SIMS are used to characterise the <b>emitter</b> <b>contact</b> material and the interface structure and a comparison is made with Gummel plots and emitter resistances on bipolar transistors. The SIMS results show that an in-situ hydrogen bake in a cluster tool gives an extremely low oxygen dose at the interface of 6. 3 E 13 cm- 2, compared with 7. 7 E 14 and 2. 9 E 15 cm- 2 for an ex-situ HF etch and deposition in a cluster tool or a LPCVD furnace respectively. TEM shows that the in-situ hydrogen bake results in single-crystal silicon with a high density of defects, including dislocations and twins. The ex-situ HF etch gives polycrystalline silicon for deposition in both a cluster tool and a LPCVD furnace. The single-crystal silicon <b>emitter</b> <b>contact</b> has an extremely low emitter resistance of 21 ohm. µm 2 {{in spite of the}} high defect density and the light emitter anneal of 30 s at 900 ?C.

This solar cell architecture requires excellent front and rear surface passivation as well as a very low recombination emitter. Moreover, laser doping may be an attractive technique to create both selective <b>emitter</b> and base <b>contacts</b> using appropriate dielectric layers as dopant sources, i. e.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{results of}} metal wrap through (MWT) cells produced from n-type Czochralski silicon wafers, and modules produced from those cells. The use of n-type silicon as base material allows for high efficiencies: for front emitter contacted industrial cells, efficiencies upto nearly 20 % have been reported. MWT cells allow even higher cell efficiency, and additionally full back-contacting of the MWT cells in a module results in reduced cell to module (CTM) losses. MWT cells were produced by industrial process technologies. The {{efficiency of the}} MWT cells reproducibly exceeds the front contact cells {{based on the same}} technology by about 0. 2 - 0. 3 %, and routes for further improvement are analysed. 60 -cell modules were produced from both types of cells. The MWT module, based on integrated backfoil, produced 3 % higher power output than the comparable tabbed front <b>emitter</b> <b>contact</b> module. In particular differences in CTM loss of current and fill factor will be presented. CTM current differences arise from the higher packing density, and lower reflectance of the backfoil, in MWT modules. CTM FF differences are related to resistive losses in copper circuitry on the backfoil versus tabs. The CTM FF loss of the MWT module was 2. 2 %abs lower than for the tabbed front <b>emitter</b> <b>contact</b> module. Also here the losses are analysed and routes for improvement discussed...|$|E
