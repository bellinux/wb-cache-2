5000|$|The Board {{found that}} there was not a strong {{likelihood}} of consumer confusion. The Board based its decision on the fact that Mattel presented no evidence of actual confusion (although it was not required to), the mark had a low degree of <b>inherent</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> (as it is a short form of the name [...] "Barbara"), {{and the nature of the}} uses by the two parties were very different.|$|E

40|$|This Comment {{discusses}} {{the controversy over}} whether secondary meaning should be a prerequisite for trademark protection of product packaging, in light of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros. The United States Supreme Court held in Wal-Mart that secondary meaning {{is a prerequisite for}} trademark protection of product design, limiting its earlier decision in Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc. In discussing Wal-Mart 2 ̆ 7 s application to trademark protection for product packaging, this Comment focuses on the difficulty of distinguishing between product packaging and product design. This Comment argues that secondary meaning should be a prerequisite for trademark protection of product packaging; in fact, courts should not use the <b>inherent</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> standard in determining whether trade dress deserves trademark protection. It argues that courts should not use the <b>inherent</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> standard in trade dress cases because, unlike trademarks, trade dress is not used to identify source; rather, marketers choose particular product packaging or design to make their product more appealing...|$|E
40|$|Professor Linford, unlike Caesar’s Antony, seeks {{not only}} to bury Abercrombie, but to praise it, at least in part. Using {{linguistic}} evidence, both historical and experimental, he would relocate a bobbled boundary—from the descriptive–suggestive transition to the suggestive–arbitrary transition—and thereby establish a reformed template for sorting word marks according to their source-signifying strength. The basic difference between acquired and <b>inherent</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> not only remains in Linford’s account, however; it draws new strength from insights about semantic change. Behold, Abercrombie 2. 0 ! His recent article, which is both provocative and engaging, continues the reconstructive work Linford began in his critique of the conventional view that a generic word can never serve as a trademark, even if a substantial share of consumers have come to perceive it as a source signifier...|$|E
40|$|This article explores, {{from the}} point of view of both law and linguistics, how far the {{application}} and effect of the law of registered trade marks is shaped not only by legislative initiative but also by changing consumer behaviour and the shifting linguistic currency of the particular signs used (or proposed for use) as marks. It does so by focusing on the thirty-year campaign to register HAVE A BREAK for a chocolate bar, marketed as ‘KitKat’. It considers the changing approach of courts both to <b>inherent</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> and to distinctiveness acquired through use. It also considers the relationship between the average consumer test for distinctiveness and the public interest in leaving certain signs free. It suggests that while the present trade mark regime is open to the registration of slogans, it is not clear that courts have sufficiently considered the public interest implications of increasing trade mark protection in this way...|$|E
40|$|Mandeville’s first {{publication}} – the thesis Disputatio Philosophica de Brutorum Operationibus (1689) – advocated the Cartesian position that both denied feeling and sensation, let alone thought, to non-human animals and stressed the <b>inherent</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> of the conscious sensory and inferential capacities of human agents. Yet his later writings subscribed to a directly opposed Enlightenment position. His translation of La Fontaine’s Fables drew comparisons {{between humans and}} animal throughout, {{and by the time}} of the Fable of the Bees, Mandeville was clearly in the camp stressing the continuity of human and non-human animal nature, a tradition following Hobbes, Montaigne and La Rochefoucauld, and later to include Helvétius, de la Mettrie and Hume. The function of pride in Mandeville’s ethics is examined in terms of this debate, framed by Bayle’s famous ‘Rorarius’ entry in his Dictionary. With this background in place, Mandeville’s claim regarding the psychological role of pride as the ‘other Recompense : : : [of] the vain Satisfaction of making our Species appear more exalted and remote from that of other Animals’ is then discussed. It is presented as a critique of Shaftesbury’s discussion in the Characteristics relating to the norm of fulfilling one’s human nature...|$|E
40|$|Homegrown {{terrorism}} has attracted significant attention following the 2004 Madrid and the 2005 London bombings. Homegrown terrorism is usually {{thought to be}} a new phenomenon, with few observed events, and inherently distinct from transnational terrorism or the old domestic terrorism in Europe. However, little research has so far examined the alleged distinctiveness of homegrown terrorism empirically. I argue that homegrown terrorism shares many similarities with domestic and international terrorism, suggesting that we can learn more about homegrown terrorism from studying these similarities rather than insisting on its <b>inherent</b> <b>distinctiveness.</b> I formulate these claims as testable hypotheses, which I examine using the ITERATE data on international and the TWEED on domestic terrorism, and compare these with information on homegrown terrorism. My findings suggest that homegrown terrorism follows the same logic of other types of domestic terrorisms, hence lessons can be learned through observations on domestic typologies. Homegrown terrorism is a separate strain of domestic terrorism due to ideological character of political Islam, yet, differing from international terrorism in targeting patterns. The implications of the study are that counterterrorism efforts for homegrown terrorism should resemble those of domestic terrorism rather than international terrorism...|$|E
40|$|Lucknow is {{the capital}} city of India’s most populous state Uttar Pradesh. Urban growth {{currently}} is largely on par with other cities of similar size, and is anticipated to be slightly faster in the immediate future. The better economic prospect has lead to an increase in the urban population of the city during last few years. It has lead to large-scale urban sprawl and the <b>inherent</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> of hydrological environment is being neglected in urban planning. With the expansion of the urban sprawl and the increasing population, there has been a surmounting pressure on a) natural and built drainage systems b) surface/subsurface hydrological storage units, of Lucknow. The anthropogenic factors have also contributed to the presence of heavy metals in the hydrological units of the city. Upto now the regeneration of water by nature kept the surface and subsurface water ecosystem pure, satisfying the urban and peri-urban requirements. But during last few years, increasing demands from new urban extensions as well as intense agriculture and irrigation practices in surrounding rural areas have stressed the hydrological cycle considerably, raising questions over the sustainability of the water resources in the city. This paper attempts to highlight some important environmental criteria and propose methodology to achieve it, during the design of master plan with a focus on surface and subsurface water integrity of Lucknow building upon city’s natural and built environments.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (the “FTDA”) in 1995, which incorporated a federal dilution clause into the Lanham Act, was preceded by {{a great deal of}} debate. The question lying {{at the heart of the}} discussion was whether the dilution doctrine is consistent with sound trademark policy or whether the far-reaching entitlements that the FTDA affords the owners of famous marks have instead created “dilution” of a kind that Congress may not have envisaged: a blurring of the conceptual boundaries of trademark law. It turns out that this question has important implications on a number of trademark doctrines (such as <b>inherent</b> <b>distinctiveness,</b> functionality, and trade dress). This Article’s thesis is that the dilution doctrine and the traditional tests for trademark infringement have the same rational basis – that they may all be coherently explained on the basis of the functional approach. To prove this the- sis, I will introduce two concepts: the “communication function” and “intrinsic reputation. ” On the basis of these concepts, I will argue that trademarks could not fulfill their economic functions if they were not protected against dilution. Hence, I will conclude that the FTDA should be welcomed and that it should be applied to any name or device that is capable of fulfilling the functions for which we consider trademarks beneficial, be it a word, a symbol, or a product configuration. Part I explores the economic functions that trademarks per- form, how they relate to each other and whose interests they serve, arguing first, that trademarks fulfill both a product-identifying function and a communication function, and finally, that some trademarks have an intrinsic reputation. These two concepts suggest a utilitarian justification of the dilution doctrine. Part I also examines the various ways in which the likelihood of confusion test and the dilution doctrine (as well as the so-called identity rule in European trademark regimes) act together to ensure that trademarks can fulfill their economic functions. Part I concludes that the dilution doctrine is as vital to preserving the economic and social benefits that are expected to ensue from trademarks as the traditional tests. Part II examines why the dilution doctrine has sparked so much criticism in academia. My explanation is essentially twofold. First, one’s attitude towards the dilution doctrine depends on one’s understanding of the functional canon of trade- marks. So long as the debate surrounds the issue of trademark functionality, the dilution doctrine will remain controversial. Second, the lack of popularity of the dilution doctrine in the academic world may have to do with the exclusive rights-free competition dichotomy that characterizes intellectual property law in general. Although this dichotomy is sometimes thought to apply to trademarks with particular force, I will argue that it should not. The questions discussed in this Article are not Lanham Act- specific; they are basic questions every modern trademark regime confronts. As a result, it is interesting to see how other jurisdictions address them. A comparative analysis will also complement the historical context in which the dilution doctrine has evolved in the United States. The idea of protecting trademarks in the absence of a likelihood of confusion on the part of consumers began with an article that Frank Schechter wrote for the Harvard Law Review in 1927. Schechter’s views were markedly influenced by the German trademark law of that period. 5 As we will see, German trademark law has undergone a number of major changes since 1927, one of the most significant ones involves the impact of European Community (“EC”) law on national law. It may, for this reason alone, be interesting to see how the dilution doctrine, that has remained a debated topic in the United States for almost a century, is construed and applied both in Germany and Europe today...|$|E
