5|$|Alvarez {{spent the}} summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes {{returning}} from battle in bad weather, and also training the British <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. While there he encountered the young Arthur C. Clarke, who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station {{as the basis for}} his novel Glide Path, which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez. Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.|$|E
5|$|In 1974–75, the {{reception}} and meeting rooms were further upgraded with {{extensive use of}} imported goods from the West. However, over time, Altes Stadthaus became less important to the GDR government. Important events, celebrations and ceremonies {{took place in the}} Rotes Rathaus, the Palace of the Republic or the State Council Building. The historical high point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building under the GDR came in its final phase, when the only freely elected government of East Germany, under Lothar de Maizière relocated there. The provisions of the agreement on German reunification were therefore negotiated there.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, the {{grooming}} hypothesis {{emphasized that}} all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly {{suited for the}} mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental spacing is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms. Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing. Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more important role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toothcomb than food procurement.|$|E

40|$|A {{subjective}} well-being {{approach is}} followed {{to assess the}} magnitude <b>of</b> inefficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> income. <b>The</b> information comes from a Mexican survey and an X-inefficiency technique is <b>used.</b> <b>The</b> paper shows that there exists substantial inefficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> income at all income levels, even for those in income poverty. It is shown that inefficiency is significantly related to practices, attitudes, and motivations for consuming. Economic theory has focused on rising people’s income to increase their economic well-being; this paper shows that reducing inefficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> income is an alternative instrument which deserves further consideration...|$|R
5|$|The slouch hat was the {{preferred}} choice of many soldiers, including officers. The hat was normally a floppy, wide brimmed, woolen body head-cover, meant {{to protect the}} individual from the sun, and inclement weather. It was normally a civilian hat, of brown, gray, or black wool. This simple hat saw widespread use throughout the Confederate Armies, and even with U.S. Army personnel. Occasionally, the hat was adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E
5|$|During the 7th century {{there were}} {{significant}} changes to the East Platform, including {{a new version of}} Temple 5D-87 that faced away from the Mundo Perdido. Around AD 700 this version was sealed and another version built on top, making Temple 5D-87 one of the three highest structures in the Mundo Perdido. This new version created a new orienting axis in the complex, breaking the primary axis associated with the ancient E-Group complex and its relationship with the old solar cult, thus marking a major change in the ceremonial use of the Mundo Perdido complex. It is about this same time that the twin pyramid complex came into use, demonstrating a major internal reorganisation of the city. During the Late Classic, access to the complex was gradually restricted by closing various access points with new structures, this included discontinuing the use of the causeway that had linked the complex with the North Acropolis since the Preclassic. A new palace complex was built in the northern section of the Mundo Perdido, developing during the 7th and 8th centuries AD; This marked an important change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mundo Perdido, which until then had been dedicated to purely ritual activities. The construction of the palace indicates the permanent inhabitation of the complex by an elite group, apparently involved in some way with the administration of the city.|$|E
5|$|Galileo made {{a number}} of {{contributions}} to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, {{and a variety of other}} calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compasses for 120 lire.|$|E

5|$|In South Africa {{cylinders}} may {{be filled}} {{for commercial purposes}} by {{a person who is}} competent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filling equipment to be used, who knows the relevant sections of the applicable standards and regulations, and has written permission from the owner of the cylinder to fill it. The cylinder must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled, and the cylinder may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled. An external inspection of the cylinder must be made, and specified details of the cylinder and fill must be recorded. If the fill is of a gas other than air, the analysis of the completed fill must be recorded by the filler and signed by the customer. If the residual pressure in a cylinder presented for filling does not produce a reasonably strong flow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill the cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty, as there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated.|$|E
5|$|Under Operation Peppermint, orders {{went out}} for medical {{personnel}} to report the details of any fogging or blackening of photographic or X-ray film, and medical officers were ordered to report diseases of unknown etiology involving fatigue, nausea, leukopenia or erythema. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Peterson instructed Chemical Warfare Service personnel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipment, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance.|$|E
