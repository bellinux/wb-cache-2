5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|Asma is a {{professional}} Emirati puppeteer, storyteller and creative drama specialist. A graduate of the United Arab Emirates University, Asma earned her BA in English Literature, minoring in drama and theater. Through a Summer Master’s Degree Program in Applied Drama at the City University of New York, Asma distinguished herself as a creative drama specialist, {{with a focus on}} puppetry and early childhood education. This led her to be chosen by the Zayed Higher Organization in 2012 to work with children with special needs. As a result of her training with the ‘Kids on the Block’ program, which uses special puppets crafted with different disabilities, Asma <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> a new field of early childhood intervention; one that uses the dynamics of puppetry and creative drama to enhance education for the most impressionable audience in the UAE.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{has reduced}} as wind turbine {{technology}} has improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance costs {{have continued to}} decline. For example, the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations.

25|$|Attacking pieces {{can easily}} become trapped behind enemy lines, as the {{opponent}} can often drop a pawn on a protected square {{to cut off}} the line of retreat. For this reason, rooks, which can retreat in only one direction, are commonly kept at a safe distance in the early parts of the game, and used to support attacks by weaker pieces. However, once the game <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up,</b> a promoted rook is an especially deadly piece behind enemy lines.|$|E

25|$|The task of {{interpretation}} has been {{hampered by the}} lack of works of archaeological synthesis for the Anglo-Saxon period in general, and the early period in particular. This is changing, with new works of synthesis and chronology, in particular the work of Catherine Hills and Sam Lucy on the evidence of Spong Hill, which <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> the possible synthesis with continental material culture and, most interestingly, has moved the chronology for the settlement earlier than AD 450, with a significant number of items now in phases before this historically set date.|$|E

25|$|The natural {{heritage}} of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture, logging, mining, resettlement, {{oil and gas}} extraction, over-fishing, wildlife trade, dams and infrastructure, water pollution, climate change, fire, and invasive species.

Construction of highways <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement; dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats; and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape. At least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region, including the controversial Belo Monte hydroelectric dam.|$|E

25|$|The new {{building}} materials of the 19th {{century and a}} better understanding of the forces within structures from the 20th century <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> new possibilities. Iron and steel beams, steel cables, and pre-stressed concrete have eliminated the need for external buttressing and enabled far thinner domes. Whereas earlier masonry domes may have had a radius to thickness ratio of 50, the ratio for modern domes can be in excess of 800. The lighter weight of these domes has not only permitted far greater spans, but also allowed for the creation of large movable domes over modern sports stadiums.|$|E
25|$|The two river {{catchments}} {{have very}} different natures. While the open Manawatu Plains became more densely settled by Europeans, inland Ruapehu, Rangitikei and Whanganui remained more Māori-dominated, remote and independent, and is still heavily forested. As late as the 1950s the Whanganui River remained a river of mystery. Since then exploitation of the river's commercial potential <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> the area, often causing friction with local Māori, who have long-standing grievances. Manawatu-Wanganui {{as a whole is}} one of the most important pastoral areas in New Zealand, its status recognised when the government opened the Massey Agricultural College in the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|The second BJP-led NDA Government also {{opened up}} the coal {{industry}} through {{the passing of the}} Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Bill of 2015. It effectively ended the Indian central government's monopoly over the mining of coal, which existed since nationalization in 1973 through socialist controls. It <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> the path for private, foreign investments in the sector, since Indian arms of foreign companies are entitled to bid for coal blocks and licences, as well as for commercial mining of coal. This could result in billions of dollars investments by domestic and foreign miners. The move is also beneficial to the state-owned Coal India Limited, which may now get the elbow room to bring in some much needed technology and best practices, while opening up prospects of a better future for millions of mine workers.|$|E
25|$|Since Singapore lacks natural {{freshwater}} {{rivers and}} lakes, {{the primary source}} of domestic water is rainfall. Demand for fresh water is approximately twice that supplied by rainfall, so Singapore imports much of its fresh water from Malaysia and Indonesia. To lessen its reliance on imports, Singapore has built reservoirs to collect rainwater from both forest catchment and urban catchment run-offs and from recycled water facilities. In addition, Singapore has built three desalination plant on the western coast of Tuas with two more under construction. They are expected to at least meet 30% of Singapore's water demands in 2060. Recent plans to produce NEWater-recycled water from treatment by filtration via reverse osmosis have been very successful as the government <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> three plants around the island to help meet the demand.|$|E
25|$|UniversityBus became Uno in 2005, a {{bus service}} {{not only for}} University staff and {{students}} but also the entire Hertfordshire community.
