5000|$|This {{standard}} method is recognized by U.S. EPA, which is labeled Method 5210B in the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [...] In {{order to obtain}} BOD5, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in a sample must be measured {{before and after the}} incubation period, and appropriately adjusted by the sample corresponding dilution factor. This analysis is performed using 300 ml incubation bottles in which buffered <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> is dosed with seed microorganisms and stored for 5 days in the dark room at 20 °C to prevent DO production via photosynthesis. In addition to the various dilutions of BOD samples, this procedure requires <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> blanks, glucose glutamic acid (GGA) controls, and seed controls. The <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> blank is used to confirm the quality of the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> that is used to dilute the other samples. This is necessary because impurities in the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> may cause significant alterations in the results. The GGA control is a standardized solution to determine the quality of the seed, where its recommended BOD5 concentration is 198 mg/l ± 30.5 mg/l.For measurement of carbonaceous BOD (cBOD), a nitrification inhibitor is added after the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> has been added to the sample. The inhibitor hinders the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen, which supplies the nitrogenous BOD (nBOD). When performing the BOD5 test, it is conventional practice to measure only cBOD because nitrogenous demand does not reflect the oxygen demand from organic matter. This is because nBOD is generated by the breakdown of proteins, whereas cBOD is produced by the breakdown of organic molecules.|$|E
50|$|The minimum aliquot volume {{transferred}} to a 300 mL CBOD bottle will be 3 mL as set by Standard Methods. If a smaller volume is needed to meet the DO depletion requirements, then you must make dilutions to the sample. Add approximately 0.1 g of Nitrification Inhibitor (2-chloro-6-(trichloro-methyl) pyridine) to each 300mL CBOD bottle before adding CBOD <b>dilution</b> <b>water.</b> If the sample is being prepared as a seeded sample, add enough prepared seed to the sample to achieve acceptable dissolved oxygen depletion. Add CBOD <b>Dilution</b> <b>water</b> to each CBOD sample bottle so as to completely fill the bottle with no air spaces or bubbles when the stopper {{is placed in the}} bottle.|$|E
50|$|Seed CBOD Uptake: Typically a 10, 20, and 30 mL {{sample of}} seed added to 3 {{separate}} CBOD bottles with approximately 0.1 g Nitrification Inhibitor and diluted with CBOD <b>dilution</b> <b>water.</b> Run these QC samples with each batch of seeded CBOD. Calculate the DO uptake per mL of seed added to each bottle using either the slope method or the ratio method.|$|E

Globally, biopesticides are currently {{available in the}} market as wettable powder, liquid, and granular formulations (Singh et al., 2012, 2014).

50|$|For {{the slope}} method, plot DO {{depletion}} in milligrams per liter versus mLs of seed for all seed control bottles having a 2.0 mg/L depletion and 1.0 minimum residual DO. The plot should present {{a straight line}} for which the slope indicates DO depletion per mL of seed.

50|$|Transfer a known {{amount of}} glucose-glutamic acid {{solution}} to a CBOD bottle and add sufficient seed to achieve acceptable dissolved oxygen depletion. Fill CBOD bottle with CBOD <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> and Nitrification Inhibitor. Determine the 5 Day CBOD. Passing results will have a CBOD of 198 (+ 30.5) mg/L. Run these check samples with each batch of CBOD samples. It is {{important to realize that}} glucose-glutamic acid is not intended to be an accuracy check in the test. Its sole purpose is to demonstrate that the seed is viable and metabolizing in the proper range of activity under the conditions of the test.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dilution</b> <b>water</b> demand (DWD) {{can cause}} a {{positive}} error when the dilution biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) method is used. <b>Dilution</b> <b>water</b> demand {{may be attributed to}} oxidation of organic impurities in the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> and nitrification of ammonia added as a nutrient. To minimize the error associated with these sources, the standard BOD method requires that DWD be less than 0. 2 mg/L in 5 days and does not allow correction for DWD when calculating test results. This study derives a set of theoretical equations to analyze the uncorrected errors with and without seeding. The authors concluded that DWD can be completely corrected if seeded <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> is used for the sample dilution. When seeding individual bottles, the uncorrected error approaches 8. 3 to approximately 8. 8 % at a 5 -day depletion of 2 mg/L for a typical secondary effluent. Tests without seeding show an almost 1 % higher uncorrected error than seeded tests. The analysis also suggests that these errors can be effectively reduced to less than 3 % when the 5 -day depletion approaches 6 mg/L, even for 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand concentrations exceeding 1 X 10 (4) mg/L. Further analysis indicates that, if not inhibited, the ammonium added to <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> as a nutrient may contribute additional error due to nitrification...|$|E

However, its role in supporting the growth and yield of sweet corn, especialy in Inceptisols, has not been reported.

The pot study was conducted in a greenhouse of the Assessment Institute for Agriculture Technology of Jakarta.

40|$|The {{present study}} used a system {{identification}} ARMAX modeling approach to analyze how the pulp properties can be predicted {{from the traditional}} input variables such as hydraulic pressures and <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> feed rates at stable production. As a complement internal states from the refining zones are used as inputs in a commercial production line comprising two serially linked Twin refiners. It is shown that neither the hydraulic pressures and <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> feed rates nor the motor loads from primary and secondary refiners are sufficient as inputs to the ARMAX model to describe the dynamics in the pulp properties. Instead, the temperature profile measurements from the refining zones outperform these traditional inputs and capture the major dynamics in the pulp property studied. It is also shown that the process should be controlled {{in a way that}} reduces as much variations inside the refining zones as possible. It is not only necessary to include the maximum temperatures in the refining zones as internal states when estimating pulp properties but also the periphery temperature since temperature profiles are affected differently depending on whether the changes are made in the hydraulic pressure, production or the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> feed rates. From a control perspective, refining zone temperature control is preferable to any concepts based on specific energy for minimization of pulp quality variations...|$|E

40|$|The Liffey Estuary and Dublin Bay, Ireland {{are of a}} great {{recreational}} and conservational value. Until recently, the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) plant at Poolbeg, Dublin, abstracted <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> from the estuary for cooling purposes and subsequently discharged this water back to the estuary at temperatures that were sometimes 7 - 9 oC above ambient values. Prior to its discharge to the estuary, the ESB cooling water was mixed with the sewage effluent from Ringsend Treatment Works, creating a warmer and less-saline pollutant plume that remained buoyant on the water surface, adversely effecting water quality. The ESB plant has since closed {{as part of a}} competitive energy market agreement. This paper examines the impact of this closure on water quality in the Liffey Estuary and Dublin Bay using a three-dimensional hydro-environmental model. Three discharge scenarios corresponding to the periods before and after the cessation of thermal discharges are compared [...] The results showed considerably lower E. coli concentrations in the Estuary and inner Bay in comparison to the time when the thermal discharges and extraction of <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> ceased, although the effect on E. coli concentrations of removing the cooling water was small...|$|E
