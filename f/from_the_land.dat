As Ocampo's ships began returning with slaves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> Las Casas had been granted, he went to Hispaniola to complain to the Audiencia.

5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object.

The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E
