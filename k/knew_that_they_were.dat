5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Sean Friedrich {{and tells him}} about the girl-on-girl event and that Dick and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} Japanese Occupation, Japanese {{cultural}} {{products such}} as music, film, and books were banned in both North and South Korea. The boycott was lifted in South Korea starting in 1998. Some Japanese cultural items, including {{but not limited to}} manga, anime, and music, have been introduced into South Korea even while they were banned (the South Korean public was not informed of their Japanese origin, though people mostly <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were).</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite the setback, the {{supporters}} of the line <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> close to getting approval. As a result Moorsom was dismissed and Isambard Kingdom Brunel was asked to design a new scheme for the 1846 session. Brunel brought in William Johnson, whom he fully trusted, to survey and redesign the line. This was a full fresh survey and not simply a tidying up of Moorsom's work. It was ready within three months and was lodged in Parliament with a new Bill on 30 November 1845.|$|E

25|$|The {{signatory}} on the Safavid {{side was}} the envoy Ismail Beg, {{who had been}} sent by king Tahmasp II himself. When {{the text of the}} treaty was brought to the temporary capital of Qazvin in April 1724 by Prince Boris Meshcherskii (a sub-lieutenant of the Preobrazhensky Guard regiment), the population was well aware of Russia's actions. Unruly mobs received Meshcherskii and his entourage with violent threats. He was received with customary ceremoniousness by Tahmasp II, but the latter refused to ratify the treaty. This decision was made as {{it was clear that the}} Russians, though having occupied the Iranian territories, were too small to pose a major threat to Iran, even though the latter had been seriously weakened through the frantic events of the early 1720s. Furthermore, Tahmasp II <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> incapable of aiding him in expelling the Afghan rebels. There's also a possibility that Tahmasp II was aware of Russia's secret negotiations with the Ottoman Empire (see Treaty of Constantinople (1724)). Ismail Beg was forced to flee punishment upon return, and died in exile in Astrakhan some twenty years later.|$|E
500|$|Hogg's {{father died}} in late 1823. This removed one of the {{potential}} obstacles to him openly living with Jane, the possibility of his father disinheriting him. Jane was initially hesitant to pursue a relationship with Hogg, however. As a condition of her acceptance, she insisted that he qualify by taking a tour of Europe. He left England in August 1825 and returned nine months later. She moved into his house in April 1827, and shortly after became pregnant. Few people in London <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not married, {{with the exception of}} Hogg's family and their close friends. Mary Shelley was particularly approving of their union.|$|E
500|$|On the IX Corps front, the 33rd Brigade (11th Division) {{had been}} ordered to advance to Vandamme Farm at [...] but the message was delayed and the troops did not reach the {{assembly}} area at Rommens Farm until [...] half an hour late. To cover the delay, the corps commander ordered the 57th Brigade (19th Division) from reserve, to take the Oosttaverne line from Van Hove Farm to Oosttaverne village then to Bug Wood, so that only the southern [...] were left for the 33rd Brigade. These orders were also delayed and the 19th Division commander asked for a postponement then ordered the 57th Brigade to advance without waiting for the 33rd Brigade. The troops only <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> to advance downhill and keep up to the barrage but were able to occupy the objective in [...] against light opposition, meeting the Australians at Polka Estaminet.|$|E

500|$|Without a map, {{the route}} they chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to [...] {{and could see}} the {{northern}} coast. They were above Possession Bay, which meant {{they would need to}} move eastward to reach their intended destination of Stromness. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge. There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge. [...] Early next morning, 20 May, seeing Husvik Harbour below them, they <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> on the right path. At seven o'clock in the morning they heard the steam whistle sound from Stromness, [...] "the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914". After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety.|$|E
500|$|Alexander O. Smith, {{who worked}} as a writer on the {{localization}} of the first Ace Attorney game, also worked on the localization of Apollo Justice. Localization of the game was already in progress by August 2007. The name [...] "Apollo Justice" [...] was decided in collaboration between the Japanese and American divisions of Capcom; it took them twenty-two meetings to decide on it. The name refers to how Apollo fights for justice. During the localization, there was some debate about {{the use of the word}} [...] "panties" [...] to describe Trucy's magical bloomers, a prop she uses in her magic shows; some on the localization team felt that it was inappropriate to joke about an underage girl's panties, and wanted them to be localized as [...] "magic pants", while some felt that the joke would be lost if the player already <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> massive bloomers. Janet Hsu, one of the staff members working on the localization, made an argument for [...] "emotional accuracy", saying that the Japanese version of the game was trying to make the player feel at unease over looking for what they might imagine to be [...] "sexy lingerie", and then let the player feel relief at finding out that it is a prop for a magic show. In the end, they were referred to as [...] "panties".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Marshal von Kluge—commanding all German {{forces on}} the Western Front (Oberbefehlshaber West)—was {{mustering}} reinforcements, and elements of the 2nd and 116th Panzer Divisions were approaching the battlefield. The U.S. XIX Corps—led by Major General Charles H. Corlett—entered the battle on 28 July on the left of VII Corps, and between 28 and 31 July became embroiled with these reinforcements in the fiercest fighting since Cobra began. During the night of 29 July near Saint-Denis-le-Gast, {{to the east of}} Coutances, elements of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division found themselves fighting for their lives against a German column from the 2nd SS Panzer and 17th SS Panzergrenadier Divisions, which passed through the American lines in the darkness. Other elements of the 2nd Armored were attacked near Cambry and fought for six hours; however, Bradley and his commanders <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> currently dominating the battlefield and such desperate assaults were no threat to the overall American position. When ordered to concentrate his division, Colonel Heinz Günther Guderian—116th Division's senior staff officer—was frustrated by the high level of Allied fighter-bomber activity. Without receiving direct support from the 2nd Panzer Division as promised, Guderian stated that his panzergrenadiers could not successfully counterattack the Americans. Advancing southward along the coast, later that day, the U.S. VIII Corps seized the town of Avranches—described by historian Andrew Williams as [...] "the gateway to Brittany and southern Normandy"—and by 31 July XIX Corps had thrown back the last German counterattacks after fierce fighting, inflicting heavy losses in men and tanks. The American advance was now relentless, and the First Army was finally free of the bocage.|$|E

2500|$|Lipstadt {{hired the}} British {{solicitor}} Anthony Julius to present her case. Penguin hired Davenport Lyons libel specialists Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman. Together they briefed the libel barrister, Richard Rampton QC. Penguin also instructed Heather Rogers as junior barrister. Penguin <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{going to have}} to dig deep to defend against Irving's claims. Lipstadt's claims would need to be backed up by some heavyweight experts and Penguin would foot the bill. They retained Professor Richard J. Evans, historian and Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, as their lead witness. As an expert witness, Evans was expected to prepare a report, and to be cross-examined. Also working as expert witnesses were the American Holocaust historian Christopher Browning, the German historian Peter Longerich, the Dutch architectural expert Robert Jan van Pelt, and the Political Science Professor [...] of the Free University of Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|Richmond {{were now}} openly {{at odds with}} the VFA, and matters failed to improve in the next few years. The club was campaigning against {{violence}} (both on-field and among the crowd), ungentlemanly conduct and poor sportsmanship, issues that plagued the VFA to a far greater extent than the rival VFL since the 1896 split. Richmond cultivated links with some VFL clubs by playing practice matches against them. Richmond <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> a major asset to the VFA, had built up a large following and played on one of the best grounds in the competition, where they remained unbeaten for five years. In 1905, Richmond confirmed their status with a second premiership, this time overcoming bitter rivals North Melbourne, [...] "Mallee" [...] Johnson had moved to Carlton, but youngster Charlie Ricketts dominated the season and won plaudits among the pressmen, who voted him {{the best player in the}} VFA.|$|E

"General Howe {{remained}} in {{camp on the}} Brandywine, and on the evening after the battle sent a detachment of troops to Wilmington to seize President John McKinly and secure such plunder as might fall in their way. They took the President from his bed at dead of night, and seizing a sloop that lay in the stream, loaded it with valuables stolen from the people, a large quantity {{of public and private}} money, many of the public and private records and all the papers and certificates of the loan and treasury offices. With these rich prizes the marauders returned to camp, but on the 12th and 13th the town of Wilmington was occupied in force by the British, while the men-of-war Roebuck and Liverpool laid opposite the town.

2500|$|I learned quite a {{lot from}} him, I must say. I learned that {{you have got to}} work at it. You have to rehearse.

2500|$|This {{being the}} first stage after the Pyrenees, many riders were hoping to get an easy day, sitting {{at the back of}} the peloton; however, there were also a lot of riders who had lost a lot of time during those {{mountain}} stages and who <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not going to get a good position in the general standings. Those riders all tried to get into the escape group which led to everyone chasing everyone for the first 100 kilometers and an extremely fast pace which caused the first riders already passing the 46-kilometre mark after just one hour. As a result, 4 riders dropped from the race during the first hour; among those were Paolo Savoldelli and Benjamín Noval from [...] and the sprinter Isaac Gálvez. Another important fact for the large number of riders trying to escape was the fact that it was the 14 July, in France known as Bastille Day. On this day the French are extra motivated as it is their national holiday, which shows in the results of the latest years with David Moncoutié winning in 2005 and Richard Virenque in 2004 on this day.|$|E

2500|$|Despite being {{regarded}} as an iconic figure and a popular member of the Royal Family, Diana was subject to criticism during her life. Patrick Jephson, her private secretary of eight years, wrote {{in an article in}} The Daily Telegraph that [...] " [...] had an extra quality that frustrated her critics during her lifetime and has done little to soften their disdain since her death". Some have said that it was Diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the source of her power, thus she had [...] "overburdened herself with public duties" [...] and destroyed the border between private and public life. Diana was famously criticised by philosophy professor Anthony O'Hear, who in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties, her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy, and she was [...] "self-indulgent" [...] in her philanthropic efforts. Following his remarks, the Princess was defended by the charity organisations that were supported by her, and Peter Luff who called O'Hear's comments [...] "distasteful and inappropriate". Further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself, which in return [...] "demeaned her royal office". Diana's unique type of charity work, which sometimes included physical contact with people affected by serious diseases, in some cases, had a negative reflection in the media.|$|E
