5|$|NY33 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s, {{but only to}} the portion of its modern routing between Batavia and Rochester. It was extended on both ends—to Buffalo {{in the west and}} Marion in the east—as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, the eastern extension was eliminated in 1949. In Buffalo, NY33 was moved onto the Kensington Expressway in the mid-1960s, and its former surface routing along Genesee Street subsequently became the short-lived New York State Route33B. Smaller realignments in the years since have moved NY33's western terminus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> downtown Buffalo to the northern fringe of the city's center.|$|E
5|$|On Shelter Island itself, NY114 acts as {{the main}} thoroughfare, once again turning along {{different}} local roads. It traverses {{the length of the}} island, and ends in historic Shelter Island Heights at the North Ferry terminal. Once across to Greenport, NY114 ends quickly at NY25, again just a block or so <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the village. Despite the short distance between the North Ferry terminal and the northern terminus, NY114 includes three streets in Greenport. Northbound Route114 runs on Third Street from the ferry terminal to NY25. Southbound NY114 runs along Fifth Street then one block later turns left onto Wiggins Street, where it heads eastbound until it passes the historic Greenport Railroad Station, and terminates at Third Street and the North Ferry terminal. The portion of NY114 within Greenport is maintained by the village.|$|E
5|$|The college's {{students}} {{became known}} as free spirited outsiders within the university for their different dress, apathetic demeanor, and greater interest in reading books. The college's demographics were {{unlike the rest of}} the university, with students largely not from Wisconsin and disproportionately of Jewish and East Coast families. The college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy, especially within Wisconsin. The students lived and worked with their teachers, called advisers, in Adams Hall, away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the university. They had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades, though they read from a common syllabus. The advisers taught primarily through tutorial instead of lectures. Extracurricular groups, including philosophy, law, and theater clubs, were entirely student-led.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden, {{and they}} were {{responsible}} for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also {{a central part of}} an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period. Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly utilized in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land. Dogs, cats, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> Africa, such as Sub-Saharan African lions, were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses. During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth, and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be {{subdivided}} {{into the study}} of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis).

While some areas might seem unrelated, the Langlands program has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.|$|E
