5|$|H. pylori is a helix-shaped (classified as {{a curved}} rod, not spirochaete) Gram-negative {{bacterium}} about 3μm long with {{a diameter of}} about 0.5μm. H. pylori can be demonstrated in tissue by <b>Gram</b> <b>stain,</b> Giemsa stain, haematoxylin–eosin stain, Warthin–Starry silver stain, acridine orange stain, and phase-contrast microscopy. It is capable of forming biofilms and can convert from spiral to a possibly viable but nonculturable coccoid form.|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and <b>Gram</b> <b>stain</b> of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E
30|$|Among {{associated}} factors, {{the presence}} of leukocytes on <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stain</b> was associated with an improvement in sensitivity versus the absence of leukocytes for any microorganism (0.87, p <  0.001), for GPc (0.83, p =  0.04) and for GNr (0.63, p =  0.036). Other associated factors failed to influence the results of <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stains.</b> False negative <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stain</b> for any microorganism {{was significantly associated with}} non-adapted empirical antibiotic treatment (p =  0.008).|$|R
40|$|We prospectively studied 45 central venous {{catheters}} {{to determine}} whether <b>Gram's</b> <b>staining</b> and culture of skin swabs from the entry site {{could be used to}} predict catheter-related infection. Data were collected from insertion site swabs, intracutaneous and intravascular catheter segments, and blood cultures. Surveillance site cultures at the time of dressing changes showed that bacterial growth, once established, persisted until removal of the catheter but that the time of onset of infection was not predictable. <b>Gram's</b> <b>staining</b> alone and <b>Gram's</b> <b>staining</b> combined with culture were tested for their ability to predict catheter colonization and catheter-related infection. Bacteria seen with <b>Gram's</b> <b>staining</b> invariably denoted catheter colonization. When bacteria were not seen with <b>Gram's</b> <b>staining,</b> positive results of culture did not change the pretest probabilities of colonization or infection; however, negative results of culture reduced the probability of colonization to low levels (likelihood ratio less than 0. 06). We conclude that <b>Gram's</b> <b>staining</b> and culture of skin swabs from the entry site provide, without line removal, a simple, inexpensive and practical test for the diagnosis of catheter-related infection...|$|R
40|$|A self-contained, {{portable}} <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> apparatus (GSA) {{has been}} developed {{for use in the}} microgravity environment on board the Space Station Freedom. Accuracy and reproducibility of this apparatus compared with the conventional <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> method were evaluated by using gram-negative and gram-positive controls and different species of bacteria grown in pure cultures. A subsequent study was designed to assess the performance of the GSA with actual specimens.

5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid <b>Gram</b> <b>stain</b> and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{was known}} {{in the nineteenth century}} that {{bacteria}} are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained Treponema pallidum—the spirochaete that causes syphilis—into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the <b>Gram</b> <b>stain</b> and the Ziehl–Neelsen stain.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Klebs was {{the first}} to observe {{bacteria}} in the airways of persons having died of pneumonia in 1875. Initial work identifying the two common bacterial causes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was performed by Carl Friedländer and Albert Fraenkel in 1882 and 1884, respectively. Friedländer's initial work introduced the <b>Gram</b> <b>stain,</b> a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria. Christian Gram's paper describing the procedure in 1884 helped to differentiate the two bacteria, and showed that pneumonia could be caused by more than one microorganism.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stain</b> {{identification}} upon TPC samples has acceptable accuracy {{for predicting}} positive culture for {{the diagnosis of}} VAP. Prediction of GPc or GNr bacteria involved in VAP has poor accuracy excepted for GNr specificity. The presence of leukocytes on TPC results of <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stain</b> improves sensitivity for VAP-positive culture. Taking <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stain</b> information into account for establishing empiric antibiotic treatment may generate non adapted therapy. Results must be confirmed by prospective and multicenter studies.|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{examine whether}} <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> can {{influence}} the choice of antibiotic {{for the treatment of}} peritonsillar abscess. Methods. Between 2005 and 2009, a total of 57 cases of peritonsillar abscess were analyzed with regard to cultured bacteria and <b>Gram</b> <b>staining.</b> Results. Only aerobes were cultured in 16 % of cases, and only anaerobes were cultured in 51 % of cases. Mixed growth of aerobes and anaerobes was observed in 21 % of cases. The cultured bacteria were mainly aerobic Streptococcus, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and anaerobic Gram-negative rods. Phagocytosis of bacteria on <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> was observed in 9 cases. The bacteria cultured from these cases were aerobic Streptococcus, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and anaerobic Gram-negative rods. The sensitivity of <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> for the Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods was 90 % and 64 %, respectively. The specificity of <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> for the Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods was 62 % and 76 %, respectively. Most of the Gram-positive cocci were sensitive to penicillin, but some of anaerobic Gram-negative rods were resistant to penicillin. Conclusion. When <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> shows only Gram-positive cocci, penicillin is the treatment of choice. In other cases, antibiotics effective for the penicillin-resistant organisms should be used...|$|R

25|$|Standard {{treatment}} for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting {{it open and}} drainage. If the diagnosis is uncertain, the wound should be aspirated with a needle, with aspiration of pus confirming the diagnosis and availing for <b>Gram</b> <b>stain</b> and bacterial culture.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Group B {{streptococcus}} (GBS, Streptococcus agalactiae) is {{an important}} cause of neonatal sepsis. Prevention is possible by intrapartum screening for maternal GBS carriership and antimicrobial treatment of colonized women with risk factors during labor. The conflicting results of diagnostic performance are reported both for the newly developed rapid GBS antigen tests and <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stain.</b> Methods: The value of <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stain</b> in GBS screening was investigated prospectively in 1, 020 women. Intrapartum <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stains</b> of the cervix from these women and of the introitus from 510 of them were compared with cultures of the cervix, introitus, and anorectum in a semiquantitative way. Results: The sensitivities of the cervical and introital <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stains</b> were 25 % and 31 %, respectively, and the specificities 99 % and 98 %, respectively. Higher sensitivities (52 % and 44 %, respectively) were found in heavily colonized parturients. No significant influence of rupture of the membranes was detected. There was a poor correlation {{between the number of}} gram-positive cocci in the <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stain</b> and the growth density. Conclusions: We do not recommend the routine use of the <b>Gram’s</b> <b>stain</b> for intrapartum GB...|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} 194 revision arthroplasties {{of the hip}} {{and knee}} performed over a ten-year period. The results of intraoperative <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> were available in 169 (87 %). Thirty-two {{were found to be}} infected (11 hips and 21 knees) and 137 had no evidence of infection. Intraoperative <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> was negative in all 169 cases. The method therefore had a sensitivity of 0 % for detecting infection. We conclude that the absence of organisms on intraoperative <b>Gram</b> <b>staining</b> during revision arthroplasty does not confirm the absence of infection...|$|R

500|$|The <b>Gram</b> <b>stain,</b> {{developed}} in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, characterises bacteria {{based on the}} structural characteristics of their cell walls. The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the [...] "gram-positive" [...] cell wall stain purple, while the thin [...] "gram-negative" [...] cell wall appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (gram-positive cocci, gram-positive bacilli, gram-negative cocci and gram-negative bacilli). Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the <b>Gram</b> <b>stain,</b> particularly mycobacteria or Nocardia, which show acid-fastness on Ziehl–Neelsen or similar stains.
