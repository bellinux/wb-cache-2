40|$|Abstract: It is {{required}} to keep the ambient temperature within a space-ship at air-conditioned values. This requirement is to be fulfilled while the vehicle moves in free space. The paper presents the scheme of a compensated digital control system which governs the flow of <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> the space ship to regulate the ambient temperature. The loss of heat is compensated by on-off control of current flowing through resistance elements in the oil-bath. The current is created by storage batteries fed from solar cells.

H 577 P BSE 2016 Liuxix, 107, 8, 73, 3, 10 pages :color illustrationsOpen kitchens {{are adopted}} in small {{residential}} units in tall buildings {{to make room}} spacious. These residential flats characterized by small floor area and high fire load density in tall buildings pose serious fire hazards. In this thesis, the fire hazards associated with open kitchens were first studied. Then, fire resulting environments of kitchen fires were examined. And at last, the application and effectiveness of water mist fire suppression system in these kitchens were evaluated. Fire hazards originating from cooking area were reviewed and analysed. The leading cause of home cooking fires was identified. A scenario with special hazards was also identified. When frozen food is dipped into hot oil, the water turns into steam instantly and can violently explode <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> many directions with large volume of flames. In this case, the fire may spread out of the cooking area and ignite surrounding combustibles, resulting in a big fire. Water and ice were used to simulate the water content in frozen foods and experiments were conducted under varying ratio of water or ice to oil to evaluate the associated hazards. In the experiments, an induction cooker was used to heat the oil which is allowed to use in open kitchens. Temperature and characteristics of flames were obtained and discussed. Flashover is a big concern in small units with a high fire load density. Nonlinear dynamics was applied to study flashover in flats with an open kitchen. Evolution equation was developed based on a two-layer zone model. The upper smoke temperature was taken as the system state with selected control parameters. The effect of heat release rate, floor geometry, thermal properties of wall material and other parameters on the occurrence of flashover was investigated. It was proved that flashover can be demonstrated by the model developed, though the results {{are sensitive to the}} parameters selected. Kitchen fires were then investigated numerically by the Computational Fluid Dynamics software Fire Dynamics Simulator (version 6. 0). Fire source was determined based on the plate size of the induction cooker and heat release rate per unit surface area of canola oil. Common household furnishings in a typical layout were input to the model. Then, the fire environment was evaluated under various scenarios. The presence of combustibles in the immediate vicinity of the cooker, state of the exhaust hood fan, fire barrier required to install adjacent to the exit and wind effect were taken into consideration. The extinguishment of cooking oil fires is very challenging. Water mist fire suppression system is one of the alternative protection measures in open kitchen. The effectiveness of water mist fire suppression system depends on the fire scenario. Full-scale fire extinguishment experiments were conducted in a mock-up open kitchen. The suppression performance of water mist system was examined under different types of nozzle head, various system operating conditions and different oil depths. Parameters such as free burning time, discharge duration, extinguishing time, quantity of water used and temperatures were recorded and measured. The suppression of cooking oil fire by water mist was also numerically studied. The cooking oil fire was modelled in different ways and the water mist system was modeled with varying spray characteristics. The numerical results were compared with the experimental data.

The timber is soaked at hot temperature to dry it (water vaporization, resulting in increased pressure and therefore vapor transport) and at cold temperature to treat it (vapor condensation, resulting in decreased pressure and oil transport). A model involving three equations, one for heat transfer (conduction, phase change), one for vapor transport (Darcy's law) and one for oil transport (Darcy's law) is developed (3 multiphysics equations). This gives a set of three equations {{that can be used}} to evaluate the changes in three independent intensive variables: T, p and (oil volume fraction). A Heavyside function is used for simulating vaporization and condensation. The change in density creates pressure, inducing vapor transport in the porous medium.

40|$|Stir-frying is {{a cooking}} method, {{originating}} from Asia, in which food is fried in {{small amount of}} very <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b> Nowadays <b>in</b> {{many other parts of}} the world stir-frying is a very popular method to prepare vegetables, because it is fast and fried vegetables are tasty. However, the retention of phytochemicals like the health-beneficial glucosinolates in Brassica vegetables is less explored for stir-frying in comparison to other cooking methods. This study investigates the retention of glucosinolates in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) and pakchoi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) as affected by stir-frying at various cooking durations and temperatures. Stir-frying experiments were performed at set pan temperatures ranging from 160 to 250 °C for a duration of 1 to 8 min. Results showed that aliphatic glucobrassicanapin is the most abundant glucosinolate identified in fresh Chinese cabbage and pakchoi, contributing for 48 and 63 % of the total glucosinolate content, respectively, followed by glucoiberin and gluconapin. Stir-frying retains the glucosinolates even at the highest temperature applied. Such retention is explained by the quick inactivation of the glucosinolate-hydrolytic enzyme myrosinase during the first minutes of frying, and by the thermal stability of the glucosinolates at those temperature/time conditions. Moreover, due to the absence of a separate water phase, leaching losses did not occur, in contrast to what is observed when boiling Brassica vegetables. These results show that stir-frying may be a suitable health-beneficial cooking option that prevents the loss of glucosinolates...|$|R
