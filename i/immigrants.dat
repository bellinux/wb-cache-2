5|$|According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, {{there are}} three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted {{on the basis of}} a point system that {{accounts}} for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the <b>immigrants</b> into Canada's labour market) and Refugee class (those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 <b>immigrants</b> in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic <b>immigrants</b> amongst the 247,243 total <b>immigrants</b> to the country. Canada resettles over one in 10 of the world's refugees and has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world.|$|E

5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of <b>immigrants.</b> The first settlers were Jewish <b>immigrants</b> from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of <b>immigrants</b> from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new <b>immigrants,</b> 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel <b>immigrants</b> from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number of <b>immigrants</b> from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E

First, how do the two-countries´ <b>immigrant</b> integration policies correspond with the EU framework? Secondly, which country has succeeded in developing a more coherent <b>immigrant</b> integration policy? And finally, how do the policies meet the demands of their respective <b>immigrant</b> populations? The results are that both Sweden and Finland conform to the EU framework on <b>immigrant</b> integration extremely well. Sweden has a more coherent <b>immigrant</b> integration policy than Finland and that as a result, allows Sweden to meet the demands of its <b>immigrant</b> population better.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Canada received many American Vietnam War draft dissenters. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Canada's growing Pacific trade brought with it a large influx of South Asians, who tended to settle in British Columbia. <b>Immigrants</b> of all backgrounds tend to settle in the major urban centres.

50|$|<b>Immigrant</b> {{population}} density and states’ <b>immigrant</b> Medicaid eligibility rules interactively shape the native-foreign born Medicaid coverage gap.

Additionally, <b>immigrant</b> eligibility is conditional on the annual changes of states’ <b>immigrant</b> {{population density}}; where states with decreases in foreign-born population densities have negative effects on eligibility. Immigration brings states with exclusive Medicaid policies and a small <b>immigrant</b> population increases in the participation gap between native and foreign populations. In states with inclusive Medicaid policies and small <b>immigrant</b> population, immigration {{does not affect the}} participation gap. In states with a large <b>immigrant</b> population, immigration decreases social inequality regardless of the Medicaid policy.|$|R

Intermarried <b>immigrant</b> women have spent more time in Germany, immigrated at younger ages, report better linguistic proficiency and a greater identification with Germany. They are less risk averse than women in <b>immigrant</b> marriages, are more often friends with Germans and view themselves as more open and outgoing. Over 17 percent of <b>immigrant</b> women in intermarriage report that each spouse manages his/her own money separately, which contrasts to only 4 percent among women in <b>immigrant</b> marriages.

More in particular, the study explores how those <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs who own a cross-border business identify and seize business opportunities.

40|$|Objective: The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to define and operationalize the concept of <b>immigrant</b> capital, a key factor that differentiates <b>immigrant</b> from host country entrepreneurs in how they recognize and start new ventures. Research Design & Methods: A detailed analysis of contemporary <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurship and opportunity recognition literature was carried out. Using grounded theory, we synthesized the outcomes from the analysis of eight Canadian and U. S. case studies of successful <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs with the key findings from the literature to define and develop a model of <b>immigrant</b> capital. Findings: Based on our grounded theory development process we show that the concept of <b>immigrant</b> capital as a distillate of human, cultural, economic and social capital that goes beyond expected opportunity recognition (OR) drivers like prior knowledge and prior experience to differentiate and enhance the <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneur’s ability to recognize business opportunities compared to host country entrepreneurs. We found <b>immigrant</b> capital to be a consequence of being boundary spanners in host and home country networks. Implications & Recommendations: Understanding a unique resource like <b>immigrant</b> capital, will help <b>immigrant</b> as well as host country entrepreneurs further develop their opportunity recognition ability by bridging gaps and fulfilling the needs for both, <b>immigrant</b> and host country consumers. Contribution & Value Added: The main contribution is the theoretical development, identification and definition of the <b>immigrant</b> capital model and propositions that will articulate the factors that lead to the conceptualization and operationalization of <b>immigrant</b> capital. Furthermore, the <b>immigrant</b> capital model can serve host country entrepreneurs to develop cross-cultural networks and jump-start entrepreneurial activities in their home countries as well as learn how to expand their operations into global markets...|$|R
