25|$|In recent times, reaction–diffusion {{systems have}} {{attracted}} much interest as a prototype model for pattern formation. The above-mentioned patterns (fronts, spirals, targets, hexagons, stripes and dissipative solitons) {{can be found}} in various types of reaction-diffusion systems in spite of large discrepancies e.g. in the local reaction terms. It has also been argued that reaction-diffusion processes are an <b>essential</b> <b>basis</b> for processes connected to morphogenesis in biology and may even be related to animal coats and skin pigmentation. Other applications of reaction-diffusion equations include ecological invasions, spread of epidemics, tumour growth and wound healing. Another reason for the interest in reaction-diffusion systems is that although they are nonlinear partial differential equations, there are often possibilities for an analytical treatment.|$|E
25|$|Trần {{literature}} had {{a special}} role {{in the history of}} Vietnamese literature for its introduction and development of Vietnamese language (Quốc ngữ) literature written in chữ nôm. Before the Trần dynasty, Vietnamese language was only used in oral history or proverbs. Under the rule of the Emperor Trần Nhân Tông, the Vietnamese language was used {{for the first time as}} the second language in official scripts of the royal court, besides Chinese. It was Hàn Thuyên, an official of Nhân Tông, who began to compose his literary works in the Vietnamese language, with the earliest recorded poem written in chữ Nôm in 1282. He was considered the pioneer who introduced chữ nôm in literature. After Hàn Thuyên, chữ Nôm was progressively used by Trần scholars in composing Vietnamese literature, such as Chu Văn An with the collection Quốc ngữ thi tập (Collection of national language poems) or Hồ Quý Ly who wrote Quốc ngữ thi nghĩa to explain Shi Jing in the Vietnamese language. The achievement of Vietnamese language literature during the Trần era was the <b>essential</b> <b>basis</b> for the development of this language in the subsequent literature of Vietnam.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have always}} been {{strongly}} in favour of secular education, {{in the sense of}} education without theology; but I must confess I have been no less seriously perplexed to know by what practical measures the religious feeling, which is the <b>essential</b> <b>basis</b> of conduct, was to be kept up, in the present utterly chaotic state of opinion on these matters, without the use of the Bible. The Pagan moralists lack life and colour, and even the noble Stoic, Marcus Antoninus, is too high and refined for an ordinary child. Take the Bible as a whole; make the severest deductions which fair criticism can dictate for shortcomings and positive errors; eliminate, as a sensible lay-teacher would do, if left to himself, all that it is not desirable for children to occupy themselves with; and there still remains in this old literature a vast residuum of moral beauty and grandeur. And then consider the great historical fact that, for three centuries, this book has been woven into the life of all that is best and noblest in English history; that it has become the national epic of Britain, and is as familiar to noble and simple, from John-o'-Groat's House to Land's End, as Dante and Tasso once were to the Italians; that it is written in the noblest and purest English, and abounds in exquisite beauties of mere literary form; and, finally, that it forbids the veriest hind who never left his village to be ignorant of the existence of other countries and other civilizations, and of a great past, stretching back to the furthest limits of the oldest nations in the world. By the study of what other book could children be so much humanized and made to feel that each figure in that vast historical procession fills, like themselves, but a momentary space in the interval between two eternities; and earns the blessings or the curses of all time, according to its effort to do good and hate evil, even as they also are earning their payment for their work? ...|$|E
6000|$|It will be found, however, that, of {{the various}} {{industrial}} [...] rewards, profits tend to diminish, meaning by “profits” only the [...] interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk {{in the use of}} [...] capital; but that the manager’s wages (wages of superintendence) [...] are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other [...] industrial rewards, owing to the position of monopoly practically [...] held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully [...] manage large business interests. To the laborer this large payment [...] to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital. [...] This we now know to be wrong. The manager’s wages are payments of [...] exactly the same nature as any laborer’s wages. It makes no [...] difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor. The [...] payment to capital, purely as such, known as interest (with [...] insurance for risk), is unmistakably decreasing, even in the [...] United States.

Inevitably to the conclusion [...] that the laborer, if he would become something more than a [...] receiver of wages, in the ordinary sense, must himself move up in [...] the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to [...] command manager’s wages. The importance of this principle to the [...] working-man can not be exaggerated, and there flows from it [...] important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower [...] classes. It leads us directly to the means by which the lower [...] classes may raise themselves to a higher position—the actual [...] details of which, of course, are difficult, but, as they are not [...] included in political economy, they must be left to sociology—and [...] forms the <b>essential</b> <b>basis</b> of hope for any proper extension of [...] productive co-operation. In short, co-operation owes its existence [...] to the possibility of dividing the manager’s wages, to a greater [...] or less degree, among the so-called wages-receivers, or the [...] “laboring-class.” And it is {{from this point of view}} that [...] co-operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way. [...] For it is to be said that in some of its forms co-operation gives [...] the most promising economic results as regards the condition of [...] the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion [...] upon the relations of labor and capital.|$|E

In this paper, we create the BGO calorimeter thermal modal by hyper-mesh & NASTRAN FEM software based on the thermal mechanical structure design. Then the temperature distribution of the BGO calorimeter with the given on-orbit conditions are calculated which shows that the thermal structure design meets the demands to protect the calorimeter from damage.
