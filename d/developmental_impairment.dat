2500|$|Neisseria meningitidis, often {{referred}} to as meningococcus, is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx. As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing <b>developmental</b> <b>impairment</b> and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic [...] and endemic form.|$|E
2500|$|Theory of mind is {{a theory}} insofar as the mind {{is the only thing}} being {{directly}} observed. The presumption that others have a mind is termed a theory of mind because each human can only intuit the existence of their own mind through introspection, and no one has direct access to the mind of another. It is typically assumed that others have minds analogous to one's own, and this assumption is based on the reciprocal, social interaction, as observed in joint attention, the functional use of language, and the understanding of others' emotions and actions. Having theory of mind allows one to attribute thoughts, desires, and intentions to others, to predict or explain their actions, and to posit their intentions. As originally defined, it enables one to understand that mental states can be the cause of—and thus be used to explain and predict—the behavior of others. Being able to attribute mental states to others and understanding them as causes of behavior implies, in part, that one must be able to conceive of the mind as a [...] "generator of representations". If a person does not have a complete theory of mind it may be a sign of cognitive or <b>developmental</b> <b>impairment.</b>|$|E

As {{the number of}} CHD survivors has increased, {{there is a growing}} focus on <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments.</b> <b>Developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> within a variety of developmental domains have been reported in school-age children with CHD. Less is known about the occurrence and persistence of <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> in early childhood in children with CHD. The aim of this dissertation was therefore to study <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> during {{the first three years of}} life in children with CHD. For this purpose, data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, was linked with a nationwide medical CHD registry. Children with different severity of CHD were compared with children without CHD on <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> in the motor, communication, and social domains. All information on child development was reported by mothers in MoBa questionnaires. For the age span under study we found important differences between children with CHD and the controls. In early infancy two groups stood out as being particularly at risk for developmental impairments: Children with severe CHD showed higher odds for impairments in gross and fine motor skills. Children with CHD and comorbidity showed <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> across gross motor, fine motor, and social domains. At age 18 months the same two groups differed from controls in levels of symptoms of communication impairments and social impairments. The largest differences from controls were found in children with CHD and comorbidity. At 3 years of age children with severe CHD had higher odds of both gross motor and communication impairments compared with controls. Children with mild and moderate CHD had higher odds of gross motor impairments but did not otherwise differ from controls. Predictors of impairments identified in children with severe CHD were: previous <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments,</b> smaller head circumference at birth, small for gestational age, and maternal distress. These findings are important for our understanding of early development in children with CHD. They underline the importance of early attentiveness to <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> and the importance of considering patient-specific conditions at birth for providing individualized, targeted therapeutic strategies that may improve developmental outcomes in children with CHD...|$|R

50|$|N. meningitidis is a {{major cause}} of illness, <b>developmental</b> <b>impairment</b> and death during {{childhood}} in industrialized countries and has been responsible for epidemics in Africa and in Asia. Every year, about 2,500 to 3,500 people become infected with N. meningitidis in the US, with a frequency of about 1 in 100,000. Children younger than 5 years are at greatest risk, followed by teenagers of high school age. Rates in the African meningitis belt were as high as 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100 before introduction of a vaccine in 2010. The incidence of meningococcal disease is highest among infants (children younger than 1-year-old) whose immune system is relatively immature. In industrialized countries there is a second peak of incidence in young adults, who are congregating closely, living in dormitories or smoking. Vaccine development is ongoing.It is spread through saliva and other respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, and chewing on toys. Inhalation of respiratory droplets from a carrier which may be someone who is themselves {{in the early stages of}} disease can transmit the bacteria. Close contact with a carrier is the predominant risk factor. Other risk factors include a weakened general or local immune response, such as a recent upper respiratory infection, smoking, and complement deficiency. The incubation period is short, from 2 to 10 days. In susceptible individuals, N. meningitidis may invade the bloodstream and cause a systemic infection, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, breakdown of circulation, and septic shock.|$|E

Since related studies have used different methodological approaches, direct comparisons of the prevalence of developmental delays are difficult.

We used data from school entry examinations in Bavaria to measure the prevalence of <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> in pre-school children beginning primary school in 1997 – 2009. Methods The <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> of all school beginners in the district of Dingolfing- Landau, Bavaria were assessed using modified “Bavarian School Entry Model” examination from 1997 to 2009 (N= 13, 182). The children were assessed for motor, cognitive, language and psychosocial impairments using a standardised medical protocol. Prevalence rates of impairments in twelve domains of development were estimated. Using uni- and multivariable logistic regression models, association between selected factors and development delays were assessed. Results The highest prevalence existed for impairments of pronunciation (13. 8 %) followed by fine motor impairments (12. 2 %), and impairments of memory and concentration (11. 3 %) and the lowest for impairments of rhythm of speech (3. 1 %). Younger children displayed more developmental delays. Male gender was strongly associated with all <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> (highest risk for fine motor impairments = OR 3. 22, 95 % confidence interval 2. 86 - 3. 63). Preschool children with siblings (vs. children without any siblings) were at higher risk of having impairments in pronunciation (OR 1. 31, 1. 14 - 1. 50). The influence of the non-German nationality was strong, with a maximum risk increase for the subareas of grammar and psychosocial development. Although children with non-German nationality had a reduced risk of disorders for the rhythm of speech and pronunciation, in all other 10 subareas their risk was increased. Conclusions In preschool children, most common were delays of pronunciation, memory and concentration. Age effects suggest that delays can spontaneously resolve, but providing support at school entry might be helpful.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{critical}} periods {{is a widely}} accepted and prominent theme in development, with strong implications to developmental plasticity. Critical periods establish a time frame in which the shaping of neural networks can be carried out. During these critical periods in development, plasticity {{occurs as a result}} of changes in the structure or function of developing neural circuits. Such critical periods can also be experience-dependent, in the instance of learning via new experiences. Or can be independent of the environmental experience and be dependent on biological mechanisms including endogenous or exogenous factors. Again, one of the most pervading examples of this {{can be seen in the}} development of the visual cortex in addition to the acquisition of language as a result of developmental plasticity during the critical period. A lesser known example, however, remains the critical development of respiratory control during developmental periods. At birth, the development of respiratory control neural circuits is incomplete, requiring complex interactions from both the environment and internal factors. Experimentally exposing two week-old kittens and rats to hyperoxic conditions, completely eliminates the carotid chemoreceptor response to hypoxia, and consequently resulting in respiratory impairment. [...] This has dramatic clinical significance as newborn infants are often supplemented with considerable amounts of oxygen, which could detrimentally affect the way in which neural circuits for respiratory control develop during the critical period. Additionally, when stimuli or experiences are elicited outside of the critical period, usually the results have little to no lasting effect, which could also lead to severe <b>developmental</b> <b>impairment.</b>|$|E

In this study, male mice were orally administered different concentrations of PFOA (2. 5, 5, or 10 mg/ kg/day) to evaluate the reproductive toxicity. Exposure to PFOA for 14 consecutive days obviously disrupted seminiferous tubules and reduced sperm count. The highest concentration of PFOA (10 mg/kg/day) caused growth retardation and diminished absolute testis weight. Furthermore, PFOA treatment significantly increased the generation of oxidative stress indicators malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide, decreased the expression of transcription factor NRF 2, and inhibited the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase in the testis.

Children with mild/moderate (n = 115) and severe (n = 60) CHD were compared with children without CHD (43, 929) on motor, communication, and social impairments as reported by mothers in Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study questionnaires. Predictors of <b>developmental</b> <b>impairment</b> were analyzed for the group with severe CHD. RESULTS: Children with severe CHD had > 3 times higher odds of communication and gross motor impairments compared with controls, and had 2 times higher odds of any <b>developmental</b> <b>impairment</b> compared with controls.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of antigen receptors {{expressed by the}} immune system {{is a function of}} developmentally regulated site-specific recombination events. A portion of each antigen receptor is encoded by an exon, assembled from V, D, and J segments, during V(D) J recombination. Failure to produce a functional receptor through recombination results death of developing lymphocytes, and can lead to immunodeficiencies. Cells with deficiencies in recombination generally experience <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> at transitions that require signaling through precursor or mature antigen receptors for differentiation. The production of a functional immune system relies upon on the coordination of antigen receptor accessibility, cellular differentiation pathways, and DNA damage response mechanisms during the recombination process. The research presented in this thesis uses various mouse genetic backgrounds to examine the roles of different trans factors and cis elements on TCRβ locus accessibility, TCRβ rearrangement, and lymphocyte development to elucidate potential functions in V(D) J recombination. These studies have shown accessibility of the TCRβ locus is highly dynamic, and likely dependent upon a variety of mechanisms mediating changes in chromatin accessibility in response to developmental cues. The importance of the resolution of DNA breaks is highlighted by deletion of Dicer, a protein critical for miRNA biogenesis; Dicer deletion results in reduced thymocyte survival and <b>developmental</b> <b>impairments</b> in response to recombination-mediated DNA breaks.

RESULTS: 68 % Category 1 deliveries were achieved within 30 min and 66 % Category 2 within 75 min (26 % for antepartum Category 2 deliveries). Category 1 deliveries were quicker using general rather than regional anaesthesia (21 vs. 29 min, odds ratio [OR] for delivery < 30 min 4. 2, 95 %CI 1. 3 - 14. 2). 8 % Category 1 and 4 % Category 2 neonates were acidotic or asphyxiated. The risk of acidosis was not reduced by delivery within 30 min for Category 1 (OR 0. 56; 0. 11 - 2. 81), or within 75 min for Category 2 (OR 2. 72; 0. 6 - 25. 1).
