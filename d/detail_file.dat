Using restricted-use versions of the National Mortality <b>Detail</b> <b>File</b> combined with Census data, we use this quasi experiment to examine the income mortality link in an elderly population. Estimates from difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models show the higher-income group has a statistically significantly higher mortality rate, contradicting the previous literature. We also found that younger cohorts responded to lower incomes by increasing postretirement work effort, suggesting that moderate employment has beneficial health effects for the elderly.

40|$|This {{study is}} a racial/ethnic {{comparison}} of the over 4 million women who gave birth to live babies in 2006, {{and the health of}} the mothers and of these newborns. Using the recently released 2006 Natality <b>Detail</b> <b>File</b> data, I conducted a racial/ethnic analysis of these women’s and newborns’ demographic, pregnancy, and medical care and experiences. Other than the governmental statisticians who reported on the basics of these 2006 data, I am one of the first, if not the first, to analyze these data. Overwhelmingly, research on mothers’ pregnancies and birth outcomes that have included race/ethnicity, has been limited to a binary of Black and white woman and babies, largely excluding Latinas, as well as Native American/Alaskan Native (NA/AN) and Asian American/Pacific Islander (AA/PI) mothers and their newborns. To my knowledge, my thesis is the first study to conduct racial/ethnic comparisons of mothers and their babies using five race/ethnicity categories: Latina, Black, NA/AN, AA/PI, and white. The findings stress the importance of such expanded race/ethnicity categories for researching pregnant women and their newborns, and provide some support for the Latina Paradox in terms of mothers and newborns...|$|E

40|$|There is {{widespread}} and longstanding agreement that life expectancy and income are positively correlated. However, it has proven {{much more difficult}} to establish a causal relationship since income and health are jointly determined. We use a major change in the Social Security law as exogenous variation in income to examine the impact of income on mortality in an elderly population. The legislation created a notch' in Social Security benefits based upon date of birth; those born before January 1, 1917 generally receive higher benefits than those born afterwards. We compare mortality rates after age 65 for males born {{in the second half of}} 1916 and the first half of 1917. Data from restricted-use versions of the National Mortality <b>Detail</b> <b>File</b> combined with Census data allows us to count all deaths among elderly Americans between 1979 and 1993.

40|$|This study {{examines}} low-skill wage and employment opportunities {{for men and}} women at the county level over the period 1989 - 96. Currently, reliable direct measures of wages and employment rates for different demographic and skill groups are only available for large geographic areas such as regions and populous states or at infrequent intervals (e. g., from the Decennial Census) for some smaller areas. This study constructs indirect annual measures for all counties from 1989 - 96 by combining skill-specific information on earnings and employment from the Sample Edited <b>Detail</b> <b>File</b> (SEDF) of the 1990 Decennial Census and the 1990 - 97 Annual Demographic files of the Current Population Survey (CPS) with annual industry-specific information from the Regional Economic Information System (REIS). Special versions of the SEDF and CPS files that identify county of residence are used. The study regresses the low-skill wage and employment data from the SEDF and CPS files on a set of personal variables from the combined files and local employment measures derived from the REIS. The wage regressions are corrected for selectivity from the employment decision and account for county-specific effects as well as general time effects. Estimates from the regressions are then combined with the available employment data from the REIS to impute wage and employment rates for low-skill adults across counties.

We also found that the younger cohort responded to lower incomes by increasing post-retirement work effort. These results suggest that moderate employment has beneficial health effects for the elderly. In Chapter Two, we examine another potential determinant of mortality among the elderly, pre-natal shocks to the mother’s health. D. J. P. Barker has presented epidemiologic evidence that maternal health status affects the later-life mortality of children. We use the 1918 influenza epidemic as a health shock which is orthogonal to chronic health status. Our findings are that the influenza-exposed cohorts do not experience significantly higher mortality. This allows us to bound any Barker effect of the epidemic as raising mortality less than ten percent...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} allocation of public biomedical research expenditure, and present some empirical evidence about the determinants of this allocation. The structure of expenditure should depend on the relative costs {{as well as the}} relative benefits of different kinds of research. Analysts of technical change typically have data on neither of these, but the measures of disease burden we use are indicative of the benefit of achieving advances against different diseases. We calculate distributions of government-funded biomedical research expenditure, by disease, from records of all research projects supported by the US Public Health Service: to obtain a reasonably complete accounting of disease burden, we utilize data on both the dying (from the Vital Statistics-Mortality <b>Detail</b> <b>file)</b> and the living (from the National Health Interview Survey). We find a very strong positive relationship across diseases between total life-years lost before age 65 and public R&D expenditure. But the amount of publicly-funded research on a disease decreases with the share of life-years before age 65 lost to the deases by non-whites, perhaps because lack of scientific knowledge is a less important cause of premature mortality among non-whites than it is among whites. The number of research grants mentioning a chronic condition is completely uncorrelated with the number of people with the condition but very strongly positively related to the number of people whose activities are limited by that condition. There tends to be more research about chronic conditions that are prevalent among people living in low-income households, and that are prevalent among the young (under age 18) and the old (above age 75). ...|$|E
