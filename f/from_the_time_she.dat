5|$|Always a tomboy, James quickly {{developed}} {{an interest in}} sports. Her godfather gave her a baseball bat and glove to celebrate her first holy communion. She excelled at hockey, baseball and synchronized swimming as a young child. Her mother wanted her to focus on swimming {{due to the lack}} of opportunities for girls in hockey in the 1970s. Her passion was for hockey, however, and she was constantly playing ball hockey with the neighbourhood boys <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> was in kindergarten. James first played organized hockey in a Flemingdon Park boys house league at the age of eight, and then only after her mother threatened legal action as officials opposed her inclusion.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, five years older than he, as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.|$|E

25|$|Especially in Orthodox Judaism, the Biblical {{laws are}} {{augmented}} by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the Torah mandates {{that a woman}} in her normal menstrual period must abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped. The Rabbis conflated ordinary niddah with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as zavah, and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her husband <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> begins her menstrual flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, Rabbinical law forbids the husband from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a mikveh.|$|E
25|$|Hantuchová {{also has}} {{endorsed}} four racquet brands. She first endorsed Babolat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> {{was a junior}} until late 2003, then Yonex until the 2007 Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, when she started using the Prince Ozone Seven Racquets in the 2007 Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. Photos were released from Prince giving the impression that Hantuchová, {{from the start of}} the 2011 season, will be using the Prince EXO3 Tour 100. However, she signed a deal with Volkl Tennis and then used the Volkl Power Bridge 9. Starting with the 2011 Fed Cup, she began using the Prince EXO3 Tour Team 100 again, with which she won her fourth career title. In spring of 2015, Hantuchová started using HEAD rackets and bags although the racket is not part of the current range and appears to be all black in color. During the 2015 Grass Court Season to now, Hantuchová started using the HEAD Graphene Instinct MP racket. In 2016, Hantuchová switched her racquet brand back to Babolat.|$|E
25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

50|$|The older {{students}} read the Seven brothers by Aleksis Kivi, the smaller children {{were engaged in}} handicrafts, and stories were read to them, songs were sung, and the children read on their own.

500|$|The {{discussion}} of Genesis 25:1–6 in the Genesis Rabbah includes statements by Rabbi Yehuda ha-Nasi arguing that Hagar returned to Abraham and was renamed Keturah. [...] Her new name (Keturah means incense in Hebrew) {{is said to}} refer to the pleasant aroma of incense—symbolic of her having turned from misdeeds committed during her time away from Abraham. Since Keturah is referred to in First Chronicles as Abraham's concubine (in the singular), some scholars concluded that this was why Keturah was identified with Hagar in the Midrash and the Palestinian Targumim. [...] An alternative interpretation of the name Keturah (based on an Aramaic root meaning [...] "to tie" [...] or [...] "to adorn") is also cited in the Genesis Rabbah to suggest that Hagar did not have sexual relations with anyone else <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> left Abraham until her return. [...] The theory that Keturah was Hagar was also supported by the 11th-century scholar Rashi.|$|E
500|$|Following his death, Watts' mother {{moved the}} family to Llanfawr Farm in Llangefni and Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, towns {{on the island of}} Anglesey in North Wales, where they lived with Watts' {{maternal}} grandparents, Nikki and Hugh Roberts, for three years. During this time, Watts attended a Welsh language school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni. She later said of her time in Wales: [...] "We took Welsh lessons in a school {{in the middle of nowhere}} while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt and pick up the regional accent. It's obviously significant now, me being an actress. Anyway, there was quite a lot of sadness in my childhood, but no lack of love." [...] In 1978, her mother remarried (though she would later be divorced again) and Watts and her brother then moved to Suffolk, where she attended Thomas Mills High School. Watts has stated that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> watched the 1980 film Fame.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund, who had previously shot the controversial clip for the song [...] "Smack My Bitch Up" [...] (1997) by The Prodigy. Madonna had been planning the video for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> was filming the clip for previous single [...] "Frozen" [...] in the Mojave Desert. [...] "Smack My Bitch Up" [...] was her current favorite and she enlisted Åkerlund. Madonna stated that when she makes an album, she [...] "puts [...] soul on it", but a music video {{is a lot more}} working with a director. With the Ray of Light album, she wanted to have videos with fresh expression, and hence wanted to collaborate with new directors. She liked Åkerlund's [...] "special way of working" [...] and spoke with him over the telephone. Their conversations continued for over six months, {{and most of the time}} was spent coming with a final concept for the clip. Åkerlund said in an interview with Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet: ...|$|E

500|$|Two {{years after}} Sam Houston's death, Baylor University {{president}} William Carey Crane {{was commissioned by}} Margaret to write her husband's biography, allowing complete access to all correspondence and records. Crane was a Lea family friend from Alabama who had {{little more than a}} passing acquaintance with [...] "the hero of San Jacinto". His perception of Margaret, however, was that of an extraordinary woman, in many aspects equal to the man she married. He stated that Houston's [...] "guardian angel", as he called her, had set out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> met Houston to refine his rough edges and provide a solid foundation for his personal life. That assessment of Margaret's relationship with her husband was echoed over a century later by author James L. Haley, [...] "...Houston trusted the care of his soul to Margaret, that he had no more war to fight within himself, left him with more energy to wage political battle." [...] Ultimately, several of Houston's associates were cooperative with the Crane endeavor, but not everyone was inspired to join the effort. According to daughter Maggie, the author had told her that many valuable documents were destroyed by Margaret in a fit of anger when someone she considered a friend expressed disinterest. Life and Select Literary Remains of Sam Houston of Texas was rejected by the initial publisher, but was eventually published by J. B. Lippincott in 1884.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{called it}} {{inappropriate}} {{for the first}} lady to {{play a central role}} in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband's presidency. Bill Clinton's campaign promise of [...] "two for the price of one" [...] led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as [...] "co-presidents" [...] or sometimes use the Arkansas label [...] "Billary". The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures. Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's [...] "politics of meaning" [...] to overcome what she saw as America's [...] "sleeping sickness of the soul"; that would lead to a willingness [...] "to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium." ...|$|E
500|$|Debate has raged {{regarding}} how unusual this pairing {{was based on}} the couple's age and blood relationship. Noted Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn argues it was not particularly unusual, nor was Poe's nicknaming his wife [...] "Sissy" [...] or [...] "Sis". Another Poe biographer, Kenneth Silverman, contends that though their first-cousin marriage was not unusual, her young age was. It has been suggested that Clemm and Poe had a relationship more like that between brother and sister than between husband and wife. Biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn disagreed with this view, citing a fervent love letter to argue that Poe [...] "loved his little cousin not only with the affection of a brother, but also with the passionate devotion of a lover and prospective husband." [...] Some scholars, including Marie Bonaparte, have read many of Poe's works as autobiographical and have concluded that Virginia died a virgin. It has been speculated {{that she and her husband}} never consummated their marriage, although no evidence is given. This interpretation often assumes that Virginia is represented by the title character in the poem [...] "Annabel Lee": a [...] "maiden... by the name of Annabel Lee". Poe biographer Joseph Wood Krutch suggests that Poe did not need women [...] "in the way that normal men need them", but only as a source of inspiration and care, and that Poe was never interested in women sexually. Friends of Poe suggested that the couple did not share a bed for at least the first two years of their marriage but that, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> turned 16, they had a [...] "normal" [...] married life until the onset of her illness.|$|E
