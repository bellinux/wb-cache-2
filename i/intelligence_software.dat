2500|$|A {{platform}} (or [...] "computing platform") {{is defined}} as [...] "some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run". As Rodney Brooks pointed out many years ago, {{it is not just}} the artificial <b>intelligence</b> <b>software</b> that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., there needs to be work in AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.|$|E
2500|$|When {{companies}} are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make {{the distinction between}} gross attrition and net attrition. Gross attrition {{is the loss of}} existing customers and their associated recurring revenue for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called Recurring Monthly Revenue (or RMR). [...] In the 2000s, there are also a number of business <b>intelligence</b> <b>software</b> programs which can mine databases of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated predictive analytics software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.|$|E

2500|$|To ensure {{survivability}} to {{and effectiveness}} against a target, the LRASM {{is equipped with}} a BAE Systems-designed seeker and guidance system, integrating jam-resistant GPS/INS, passive RF and threat warning receiver, an imaging infrared (IIR infrared homing) seeker with automatic scene/target matching recognition, a data-link, and passive Electronic Support Measure (ESM) and radar warning receiver sensors. [...] Artificial <b>intelligence</b> <b>software</b> combines these features to locate enemy ships and avoid neutral shipping in crowded areas. [...] Automatic dissemination of emissions data is classified, located, and identified for path of attack; the data-link allows other assets to feed the missile a real-time electronic picture of the enemy battlespace. [...] Multiple missiles can work together to share data to coordinate an attack in a swarm. [...] Aside from short, low-power data-link transmissions, the LRASM does not emit signals, which combined with the low-RCS JASSM airframe and low IR signature reduces detectability. [...] Unlike previous radar-only seeker-equipped missiles that went on to hit other vessels if diverted or decoyed, the multi-mode seeker ensures the correct target is hit in a specific area of the ship. [...] An LRASM can find its own target autonomously by using its active radar homing to locate ships in an area, then using passive measures once on terminal approach. [...] Like the JASSM, the LRASM is capable of hitting land targets.|$|E
