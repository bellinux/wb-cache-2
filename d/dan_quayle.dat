25|$|President George H. W. Bush and Vice President <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> easily won renomination by the Republican Party.

Bush allowed Buchanan to give the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas, and his culture war speech alienated many moderates.|$|E
25|$|In November 1991, {{a series}} of strips {{appeared}} to give credibility to a real-life prison inmate who falsely stated that former Vice President <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> had connections with drug dealers.

Six years later, the reporter who broke the Quayle story, some weeks after the Doonesbury cartoons, later published a book saying he no longer believed the story had been true.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on May 31, 1987. In a {{surprising}} move, the U.S. Department of Justice supported CWA's appeal. The Solicitor General at the time, Charles Fried, {{argued that the}} voluntary nature of collective bargaining agreements (including agency fee clauses) made the issue of coercion moot. Because states could and did ban agency fee agreements, there was no governmental action {{on which to base}} a constitutional claim against the union. And because Section 8(a)3 plainly requires uniform dues and fees (e.g., unions could not charge agency fee payers more nor less than regular members), the Justice Department felt Beck's claim was justified. Upset by the Justice Department's stand, Republican Senators Jesse Helms, <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle,</b> Steve Symms, and Strom Thurmond filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Supreme Court to rule in Beck's favor.|$|E
25|$|After {{wrapping}} up the 1988 Republican nomination, Bush selected Senator <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> of Indiana {{as his running}} mate, surprising many who expected Bush to select a more experienced running mate. Quayle was often mocked for his verbal gaffes, and many Republicans urged Bush to dump Quayle from the ticket. Bush selected a mostly new Cabinet, but kept around many former Reagan officials, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. Bush's long-time friend James Baker, who had served as Reagan's Chief of Staff, became Secretary of State. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney had previously served as Gerald Ford's Chief of Staff and would later serve as vice president under George W. Bush. Bush's first pick for Defense Secretary, John Tower, {{was rejected by the}} Senate, becoming the first cabinet nominee of an incoming president to be rejected.

25|$|The Bulgarian {{elections}} of June 1990 and October 1991 {{brought a new}} government into power that favored closer relations with NATO, the EU, and the United States. Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev visited the United States and had talks with U.S. President George H. W. Bush in 1990, followed by the official visit to Sofia by U.S. Vice-President <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle.</b> In 1996, President Bill Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Bulgaria, speaking to a huge crowd in Battenberg Square.

40|$|Heard {{any good}} lawyer jokes, lately? If so, you're not alone. Contemporary Americans hear law-related humor frequently, but usually don't realize that such jokes are {{exceedingly}} unoriginal. Complaints about too many lawyers {{did not begin}} with Vice-President <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle's</b> 1991 remarks to the American Bar Association, nor did legal satire originate on MTV Comedy Hour. Legal criticisms thread through Western tradition. Many criticisms against lawyers are justified or explicable because of high costs, lengthy procedures, immoral behavior, greedy motivations, and legal monopolization. At the same time, lawyers provide necessary services and leadership to American society. Many reforms under consideration could reshape the Bar's image, but never completely. Lawyers are not societal aberrations. They simply reflect the culture which both forms and ridicules them. Centuries before Christ was born, ancient Greek literature satirized lawyers and their New Logic. The Bible portrays Christ's antagonists as conspiring lawyers, or Pharisees, who try to extract self-incriminating statements from Him. At {{the height of the}} Roman Empire, the legal profession thrived. As Rome waned, the profession crumbled with it. Saint Augustine's Confessions (400 AD) decries legal contentiousness and rhetoric. Legal satire frequents Medieval and Renaissance Literature. In the late sixteenth century, Montaigne and Shakespeare criticized lawyers. Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Goethe take parting shots in their prominent eighteenth century works, Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts and Faust, respectively. " [...] from page 2...|$|R
