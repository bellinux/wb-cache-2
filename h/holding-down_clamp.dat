40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for depalletizing and/or picking up pliable flat sack bundles not collected by auxiliary means. The device comprises a gripper unit and a mobile bottom-support part and a clamping cylinder to grip the parts to be raised. The gripper unit has a first <b>holding-down</b> <b>clamp</b> which is lowered onto the parts to be raised, and a second <b>holding-down</b> <b>clamp</b> which is placed form-fitting on the parts lying below. A contact gap is thus created for the bottom support element arranged in the second <b>holding-down</b> <b>clamp</b> and movable relative to the latter. The bottom support element leaves {{the area of the}} second <b>holding-down</b> <b>clamp</b> during the travel movement and supports the parts from below whereby it is in form-fitting contact with the lower parts during the entire travel movement. After the travel movement, a clamping cylinder is placed on the parts to be raised. It grips the parts together with the bottom support element...|$|E
