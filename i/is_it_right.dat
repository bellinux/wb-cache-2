500|$|For Bhattacharya, Ahalya is {{the eternal}} woman who {{responds}} to her inner urges and the advances {{of the divine}} ruler, a direct contrast to her ascetic husband, who did not satisfy her carnal desire. The author regards Ahalya as an independent woman who makes her own decisions, takes risks and is driven by curiosity to experiment with the extraordinary and then accept the curse imposed on her by patriarchal society. It is this undaunted acceptance of the curse that makes the Ramayana praise and venerate her. V. R. Devika, author of Ahalya: Scarlet Letter, asks, [...] "So <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> to condemn adultery and physical encounters as modern afflictions and against our [...] culture? Or do we learn from Ahalya who made a conscious choice to fulfil her need and yet has been extolled?" ...|$|E
500|$|Allusions {{to legal}} issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, {{particularly}} in scenes {{outside of the}} courtroom, have drawn the attention of legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that [...] "a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals". The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: [...] "Lawyers, I suppose, were children once." [...] Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm, and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him. Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's [...] "fanatical" [...] attempts to place her in them made her feel [...] "a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [...] ". Johnson states, [...] "he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> to destroy villages? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
