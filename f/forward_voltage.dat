25|$|At higher {{currents}} the <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop of the diode increases. A drop of 1 V to 1.5 V {{is typical}} at full rated current for power diodes.|$|E
25|$|Super barrier diodes are {{rectifier}} diodes {{that incorporate}} the low <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop of the Schottky diode with the surge-handling capability and {{low reverse leakage current}} {{of a normal}} p–n junction diode.|$|E
25|$|When {{compensated}} for temperature, the <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> {{drop of a}} transistor's base-emitter junction can provide a usably accurate logarithmic or exponential function. Op amps scale the output voltage {{so that it is}} usable {{with the rest of the}} computer.|$|E
25|$|Approximately, {{this same}} current is {{obtained}} for <b>forward</b> <b>voltages</b> {{up to the}} point where the diode conduction becomes significant.|$|R
50|$|When using LEDs with {{different}} <b>forward</b> <b>voltages,</b> {{such as when}} using different color LEDs, some LEDs can light when not desired.|$|R
50|$|The {{commonly}} accepted {{values for}} the transition point voltage are 0.7V for silicon devices and 0.3V for germanium devices. An even simpler model of the diode, sometimes used in switching applications, is short circuit for <b>forward</b> <b>voltages</b> and open circuit for reverse voltages.|$|R
25|$|The term stabistor {{refers to}} a special type of diodes {{featuring}} extremely stable <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> characteristics. These devices are specially designed for low-voltage stabilization applications requiring a guaranteed voltage over a wide current range and highly stable over temperature.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{substantially}} lower <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> (0.3V versus 0.7V for silicon diodes) germanium diodes have an inherent advantage over silicon diodes, especially in circuits like full-wave bridge rectifiers which result in 2X voltage drop because the current must pass through two diodes.|$|E
25|$|In modern sets, a {{semiconductor}} diode {{is used for}} the detector, which is much more reliable than a cat's whisker detector and requires no adjustments. Germanium diodes (or sometimes Schottky diodes) are used instead of silicon diodes, because their lower <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop (roughly 0.3V compared to 0.6V) makes them more sensitive.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study between GaN/SiC heterojunction and 6 H-SiC homojunction diodes has been performed {{to understand the}} physical properties of n-p GaN/SiC heterojunction interface. The 6 H-SiC homojunction diodes presented typical I-V characteristics with satisfactory breakdown voltage (≅- 800 V), however, the GaN/SiC heterojunction diodes showed an abnormal low <b>forward</b> turn-on <b>voltage</b> (≅ 1. 8 V). The presence of a deep-level 1 eV below the p-SiC conduction band, is probably responsible for a tunneling- assisted current at low <b>forward</b> <b>voltages,</b> due to {{a high concentration of}} interface defects...|$|R
50|$|Stabistors are {{manufactured}} using planar epitaxial technology and a typical device is the BAS17, manufactured by several semiconductor companies. Devices {{are also available}} with multiple diodes connected in series inside a single package offering higher <b>forward</b> <b>voltages</b> than a single device but lower than those obtained using standard zener diodes.|$|R
50|$|Parallel {{operation}} {{is also possible}} but can be more problematic. Parallel LEDs must have closely matched <b>forward</b> <b>voltages</b> (Vf) {{in order to have}} similar branch currents and, therefore, similar light output. Variations in the manufacturing process can make it difficult to obtain satisfactory operation when connecting some types of LEDs in parallel.|$|R
25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop than p–n junction diodes. Their <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E
25|$|In a mercury-arc valve, an arc forms {{between a}} {{refractory}} conductive anode and {{a pool of}} liquid mercury acting as cathode. Such units were made with ratings up to hundreds of kilowatts, and were important {{in the development of}} HVDC power transmission. Some types of smaller thermionic rectifiers had mercury vapor fill to reduce their <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop and to increase current rating over thermionic hard-vacuum devices.|$|E
25|$|This term is {{used both}} for {{conventional}} p–n diodes {{used to monitor}} temperature because of their varying <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> with temperature, and for Peltier heat pumps for thermoelectric heating and cooling. Peltier heat pumps may be made from semiconductor, though {{they do not have}} any rectifying junctions, they use the differing behaviour of charge carriers in N and P type semiconductor to move heat.|$|E
30|$|A feed <b>forward</b> DC <b>voltage</b> {{control scheme}} has been {{proposed}} {{in order to enhance}} the FRT capability of the VSC HVDC connected WPPs under host power system faults. The proposed feed <b>forward</b> DC <b>voltage</b> control scheme considers both the DC voltage error between the reference and measured values, and the AC current from the WPP collector system ensuring fast and robust FRT. The PHIL tests show that the proposed feed <b>forward</b> DC <b>voltage</b> control scheme can fast and efficiently reduce the WPP collection system voltage when there is a voltage dip in the host power system and the wind turbines within the WPP can be triggered into the FRT model, and reduce active power and supply reactive power. As such, the proposed feed <b>forward</b> DC <b>voltage</b> can successfully enable the VSC HVDC connected WPP ride through faults in the host power systems.|$|R
50|$|The method {{uses the}} tri-state logic {{capabilities}} of microcontrollers {{in order to}} gain efficiency over traditional multiplexing. Although it is more efficient in its use of I/O, there are issues that cause it to be more complicated to design and render it impractical for larger displays. These issues include duty cycle, current requirements and the <b>forward</b> <b>voltages</b> of the LEDs.|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{optimization}} {{method for}} the rectifier circuit of a vibration energy harvesting system that uses macro-fiber composite (MFC) piezoelectric elements. MFC elements have previously been investigated intensively for piezoelectric energy harvesting. A bridge rectifier circuit composed of diodes and capacitors {{is often used}} as the rectifier circuit, which functions as an AC–DC converter. In contrast, a double-voltage rectifier circuit can generate twice the voltage of the bridge rectifier. In this study, both types of rectifier circuits are optimized by varying {{the values of the}} diode <b>forward</b> <b>voltages</b> and thecapacitance of the capacitors. In addition, the current–voltage characteristic and electric power efficiency of these rectifier circuits are evaluated and compared. The experimental results show that the electric power efficiency of the bridge rectifier circuit is higher than that of the double-voltage rectifier circuit at maximum electric power; however, the double-voltage rectifier circuit is suitable foruse in high voltage situations. In addition, the use of diodes with lower <b>forward</b> <b>voltages</b> leads to higher electric power efficiency, but the capacitance of the capacitors has no effect on electric power efficiency...|$|R
25|$|As a dopant, gold (or platinum) acts as {{recombination}} centers, {{which helps}} a fast recombination of minority carriers. This allows the diode {{to operate at}} signal frequencies, {{at the expense of}} a higher <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop. Gold-doped diodes are faster than other p–n diodes (but not as fast as Schottky diodes). They also have less reverse-current leakage than Schottky diodes (but not as good as other p–n diodes). A typical example is the 1N914.|$|E
25|$|The {{on-state}} <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop in IGBTs behaves {{very differently}} from power MOSFETS. The MOSFET voltage drop can be modeled as a resistance, with the voltage drop proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like voltage drop (typically {{of the order}} of 2V) increasing only with the log of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.|$|E
25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.|$|E

25|$|The General Electric Tungar {{rectifier}} was a mercury vapor (ex.:5B24) or argon (ex.:328) gas-filled electron tube {{device with}} a tungsten filament cathode and a carbon button anode. It operated similarly to the thermionic vacuum tube diode, but the {{gas in the}} tube ionized during forward conduction, giving it a much lower <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop so it could rectify lower voltages. It was used for battery chargers and similar applications from the 1920s until lower-cost metal rectifiers, and later semiconductor diodes, supplanted it. These were made up to a few hundred volts and a few amperes rating, and in some sizes strongly resembled an incandescent lamp with an additional electrode.|$|E
25|$|Operation of a {{solar cell}} can be {{understood}} from the equivalent circuit at right. Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the bandgap of the material), creates mobile electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the p-n junction in thermal equilibrium (a contact potential creates the field). This charge separation between positive holes and negative electrons across a p-n junction (a diode) yields a <b>forward</b> <b>voltage,</b> the photo voltage, between the illuminated diode terminals. As has been noted earlier in the terminology section, the photo voltage is {{sometimes referred to as}} the photo emf, rather than distinguishing between the effect and the cause. The charge separation causes a photo voltage that drives current through any attached load.|$|E
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with temperature. This arises because silicon {{has a small}} energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is {{as likely to be}} occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a p-type semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p-n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.|$|E
40|$|Thyristors able {{to block}} 4 kV have been {{fabricated}} and characterised. The experimental forward current is 1. 3 A @ V-AK = 10 V for a 9 mA gate current during 550 ns. The device active area is 2. 3 mm(2). The devices and their edge terminations {{have been designed}} using numerical simulations. Two different edge terminations have been envisaged (mesa and a combination of mesa and JTE). A SiO 2 passivation layer also improves the <b>forward</b> blocking <b>voltage</b> depending on the sign and {{the magnitude of the}} effective charge density in the oxide. The mesa protection is not enough to allowing the thyristor to block 5 kV, due to the low etching rate in SiC. Thus, a mesa/JTE protection has been used. The influence of the etching depth, the JTE dose and length on the <b>forward</b> blocking <b>voltage</b> of the thyristor has been studied in details. Simulation results have allowed designing the devices, not far from the optimal structure. The best results of the <b>forward</b> blocking <b>voltage</b> are 4 kV for the mesa protected thyristor, while the mesa/JTE combination yields 3. 6 M Furthermore, experimental results confirm the simulations concerning the influence of the oxide thickness on the <b>forward</b> blocking <b>voltage.</b> The better results for the mesa protected thyristor are due to a lower interface SiC/SiO 2 charge density provided by the different oxidation processes (at different foundries). In addition, the comparison between experiments and simulations allows estimate the effective charge density of the SiO 2 layer in 10 (12) - 5 x 10 (12) cm(- 2) range for the two fabricated thyristors. The improvement in the <b>forward</b> blocking <b>voltage</b> must pass through an improvement of the passivation layer. Passivation still remains a technological key step to obtain SiC high-voltage devices. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

2500|$|An IGBT {{features}} a significantly lower <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> drop {{compared to a}} conventional MOSFET in higher blocking voltage rated devices, although, MOSFETS exhibit much lower <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> at lower current densities due {{to the absence of}} a diode Vf in the IGBT's output BJT. As the blocking voltage rating of both MOSFET and IGBT devices increases, the depth of the n- drift region must increase and the doping must decrease, resulting in roughly square relationship decrease in forward conduction versus blocking voltage capability of the device.
