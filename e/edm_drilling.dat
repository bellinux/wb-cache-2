30|$|The {{principle}} of EDM and <b>EDM</b> <b>drilling</b> is same except that during drilling process the electrode rotates and removes the burrs effectively with fluid pressure {{supplied by the}} channels in the electrode. Drilling micro-holes with conventional methods is often extremely difficult if not impossible. After drilling micro-holes, the geometrical accuracy was distorted and also the surface quality {{was not so much}} effective. <b>EDM</b> <b>drilling</b> is often the only practical method for producing such holes. As conventional drills enter or exit, they can break if torque is not carefully controlled. Small broken drills are often difficult to remove from the workpiece, and time is wasted replacing broken drills and parts may have to be scrapped.

Taguchi Method is used to find the optimal drilling parameters for hole diameter in drilling operation. The orthogonal array, the signal-to-noise ratio, and analysis of variance are employed to study the performance characteristics in drilling operations of mild steel (50 mm length x 75 mm width x 5 mm height) as workpiece by using 1 mm copper (Cu) pipe electrode. Three drilling parameters namely, pulse off time, peak current, and servo standard voltage, are optimized with considerations of hole diameter. It is found that Taguchi’s robust orthogonal array design method is suitable to analyze the hole diameter problem. Also parameter design of Taguchi method provides a simple, systematic and efficient methodology for the optimization of drilling process.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{these last}} years, the {{evolution}} of the machining speed of the EDM processes has become a key challenge for this technology. The recent progress made on the spark generators leads to a higher production speed in all processes such wire <b>EDM,</b> die-sinking, <b>drilling,</b> milling, etc. Nevertheless, if the electrical process is developing fast, many limiting factors still remain under investigations. In this context, our group started 7 years ago a research program to increase the understanding of the EDM particle hydrodynamics. We describe in this paper some results obtained and discuss the physical aspects related to the evacuation of the machining debris. During the EDM process, if the cleaning of the dielectric is not effective and some debris remain in the gap, the electrical resistance is locally reduced and the spark occurs at the same place. The process cannot go farther. In this situation, i. e. when the spark frequency and power are high enough, the machining speed is governed mainly by hydrodynamics. In this paper we will present efficient strategies to clean the gap in the wire EDM (part 1) and die sinking processes (part 2). For the wire EDM process (part 1), we have designed and analysed dielectric injection nozzles with the aim of improving the cleaning processes in the gap. Three main tools have been used to achieve this goal. The first is a fluid flow simulation model using CFD solvers. Then, the results have been validated using experimental techniques at full scale on EDM machines. Finally, a test rig has been developed and experimental analyses have been done...|$|R

30|$|Electrical {{discharge}} machining (<b>EDM)</b> <b>drilling</b> {{is becoming the}} standard method for producing small, tight tolerance holes. It is an extremely cost-effective method for producing fast and accurate holes for hard or soft conductive materials (Bhattacharya et al. 1996). It {{is the process of}} machining electrically conductive materials using precisely controlled sparks that occur between an electrode and a workpiece {{in the presence of a}} dielectric fluid. It is based on the erosion of material through the series of spatially discrete high-frequency electrical discharges (sparks) between the tool and the workpiece. The spark removes material from both the electrode and workpiece, which increases the sparking gap (distance between the electrode and the workpiece) at that point. This causes the next spark to occur at the next-closest points between the electrode and workpiece. As EDM is a thermal process, material is removed by heat. Every discharge (or spark) melts a small amount of material from both of the electrodes. Part of this material is removed by the dielectric fluid and the remaining solidifies on the surface of the electrodes (Jain 2004).|$|E

In this study, the parameters of micro-electrical discharge machining (EDM) in drilling of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy is optimized for higher machining accuracy with less hole-dilation and hole taper ratio. The micro-EDM machining parameters includes, peak current and pulse on time. Fuzzy analysis was developed to evaluate the machining accuracy. The analysis shows that hole-dilation and hole-taper ratio are increased with the increasing of peak current and pulse on time. However, the surface quality deteriorates as the peak current and pulse on time increase. The combination that gives the optimum result for hole dilation is medium peak current and short pulse on time.

40|$|The {{drilling}} {{of small}} holes, typically less than 300 μm in diameter, is most commonly accomplished by using micro-hole electric discharge machining (MH-EDM). An important {{application of this}} technology is in the drilling of fuel injector nozzle holes for diesel engines. Past research in die-sinking and wire-cut EDM has established that {{the single most important}} factor influencing the EDM process is the spark-gap condition. While adaptive control systems have been developed and utilized successfully in die-sinking and wire-cut EDM applications, the state of art of <b>EDM</b> for <b>drilling</b> micro-holes is still in a primitive stage in terms of spark-gap control. This is {{because of the lack of}} knowledge pertaining to the spark-gap of the MH-EDM process. The adaptive control systems developed for conventional applications can not be directly used with MH-EDM because the discharges occur at very high frequencies in MH-EDM. In the present work, an attempt has been made to understand the spark-gap conditions in MH-EDM. A high speed measurement system capable of sampling up to 250 MSamples/sec is used to measure the gap-voltage, gap-current and radio frequency emissions from the gap and the data is stored for off-line analysis. A classifier has been developed using digital signal processing techniques to classify the discharges into good and bad machining discharges. Parametric studies have been conducted to understand the effect of the controllable EDM parameters on the spark-gap conditions and on the resulting quality of the micro-hole. Replica and sectioning techniques have been used to evaluate the quality of these micro-holes with respect to diameter, taper and surface finish. The suitability of the replica technique for measuring the quality of micro-holes has also been assessed. The results of the study show that, by optimizing conditions in the spark-gap, the MH-EDM process can be substantially improved. Schemes for the on-line monitoring of the gap conditions are discussed along with a brief description of the schemes currently being considered for implementation in MH-EDM. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDebris {{distribution}} and dielectric fluid flow within the machining gap in {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) are important factors related to stable and precision machining. Hence understanding of the debris removal process is essential in improving EDM process. In this research, electrode jump motion with different jump heights and speeds was investigated to comprehend {{its effect on the}} fluid flow and debris-fluid interaction. A simplified fluid dynamics model characterizing the motion of the square shape electrode was established to study theoretically the effect of electrode jump speed on the debris-fluid flow. A setup to realize the electrode motion was designed. The Z-axis equipped with a linear motor was used to provide high speed jump function. The flow images were recorded by a high-speed camera, and the flow of the debris inside the hole was captured for analysis. Analytical results show that the fluid pressure at the bottom region of the electrode would reduce with the increase of electrode jump speed. Bubbles are generated once this pressure falls below the vapor pressure of the fluid. For the square shape electrode, it is found from the experiment that bubbles are prone to occur when the machining depth is increased. The result also shows that debris can be excluded easier when the electrode jump height is larger than 1 / 4 machining depth. Furthermore, using a large jump height incorporated with an electrode jump speed near the critical speed of bubble generation results in the most effective debris removal. On the other hand, the flow field of a high aspect ratio thin and flat electrode is {{different from that of the}} square electrode. There is no bubble generated during high-speed jump motion.

Conventional technologies - Electrical Discharge Machining (<b>EDM),</b> <b>Drilling</b> and Milling - have limitations in creating continuous straight or continuous curved internal channels {{and none of}} them are capable of producing continuous free-path internal channel in a single step. FSC is an innovative method within solid-state manufacturing technologies which is able to produce continuous internal channels in monolithic plates in a single step. FSC is capable of producing both straight and curved channels in metal plates with control of technical parameters similar to that of Friction Stir Welding (FSW). However, FSC is in initial phases and still more research {{needs to be done in}} order to improve FSC tools for producing channels in more diverse metals. This thesis designs and builds new tools for FSC with improved geometrical parameters, and by means of these new tools, performs experiments in order to investigate technical condition of FSC and its capability in various industries. This thesis produces various Friction Stir (FS) channel prototypes in aluminum alloy plates AA 6082 -T 6 and AA 5083 -H 111. This work performs thermal and flow analysis in order to evaluate capability of FSC for battery cooling. Following conclusions are arrived at in this thesis: The experimental results of this work shows that by means of our improved FSC tools and by selecting the right technical parameters, high quality of channel surface finish with low roughness is obtained using position control as opposed to forced control. Moreover, FS tool rotation and travel speed affect the channel size so that channel size increases by increasing travel speed and decreasing rotation speed. Pressure tests conclude that the FS channels produced in this work can endure high pressure levels. Furthermore, investigation and analysis in this thesis concludes that FSC has high potential in heat exchanger industries and conformal cooling channels for mould industries, and results in high productivity and low cost of production.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{precision}} and good surface quality that it can give, Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is potentially an important process for the fabrication of micro tools, micro components and parts with micro features. However, {{a number of issues}} remain to be solved before micro EDM can become a reliable process with repeatable results and its full capabilities as a micro manufacturing technology can be realised. This work presents some developments in advancing the state-of-the-art in the micro EDM process. <b>EDM</b> <b>drilling</b> and EDM milling are regarded as separate processes as they require different approaches in investigating and implementing the results of the study. At the beginning, special attention is paid to factors and procedures influencing the accuracy achievable, including positioning approaches during EDM and electrode grinding. In particular, the main parameters affecting the size and position of a machined feature are discussed and new techniques for minimising errors are proposed. The technological capabilities of different methods of setting up and dressing the electrode on the machine are analysed. Factors contributing to electrode wear, the main systematic cause for inaccuracy of the dimensions achieved, during the micro EDM process are studied. A method for calculating the volumetric wear ratio based only on geometrical information obtained from the process is proposed. This study investigates the suitability of micro EDM electrode wear compensation methods. Electrode shape deformation and random variations in the volumetric wear are also investigated as the two main factors affecting the applicability of the wear compensation methods as well as indicating the accuracy achievable with micro EDM. When producing features and parts on the micro scale, the phenomena that take place between the electrodes in EDM is not fully understood. A barrier to a complete exploitation of the potential natural tolerance of this process and to the further development of the process towards the production of components on the nano-scale is therefore in place. An analytical micro EDM model of electrode wear based on electrode shape deformation and wear ratio is suggested, verification of which requires experimental work with pure metals. Electrode-tool wear is studied during the micro EDM process of pure metals and the effect of electrode wear on the process accuracy and process variability. Objectives in this case are to advance the experimental knowledge of the electrical discharges during micro EDM operations which often conflicts with existent theoretical models of the EDM process. In particular, the remit of this investigation is to identify the effects that electrode materials have on selected electrical characteristics of the discharge process. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach is adopted in order to draw conclusions from the performed experimental activity. The material removal mechanism in the micro EDM process was confirmed to be mainly attributed to the melting and vaporisation phenomenon. Metal removal takes place {{as a result of the}} extremely high temperature generated by the discharge sparks. It was also found in this study that the volumetric wear ratio depends not only on the sparking conditions but also on the electrode materials. In addition, the research also proved that the electrode material severely influences the energy distribution between the electrodes during the sparks.
