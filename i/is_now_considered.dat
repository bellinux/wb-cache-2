5|$|Authorities {{disagree}} as {{to whether}} Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders, but an extinct salamander-like family, the Albanerpetontidae, <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> part of Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog, Triadobatrachus.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the Suffolk {{was often}} criticised for its poor feet, having hooves {{that were too}} small for its body mass. This was {{corrected}} {{by the introduction of}} classes at major shows in which hoof conformation and structure were judged. This practice, unique among horse breeds, resulted in such an improvement that the Suffolk Punch <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> to have excellent foot conformation.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{how much of a}} {{concurrent}} increase in fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> vulnerable. Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.|$|E

5|$|Stegosaurus madagascariensis from Madagascar {{is known}} solely from teeth and was {{described}} by Piveteau in 1926.
