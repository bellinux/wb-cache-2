Instead, Thawne decides to ruin Barry's life during the latter's childhood, erasing his best friend from existence to result in greater introversion on Barry's part, and various other torments such as killing his mother. Thawne later reveals that the new timeline was created by Barry himself, who went {{back in time to}} stop the Reverse Flash from killing his mother. After Thawne is killed by the Batman of this reality with an Amazonian sword, the <b>Flash</b> <b>travels</b> back in time to stop his younger self from altering history but instead, under the manipulations of Pandora, a third, new timeline is created, in which DC Comics' continuity takes place from 2011 onwards.|$|R

5000|$|Although not {{strictly}} shrapnel, a 1960s weapons project produced splintex shells for 90 and 106 mm recoilless rifles and 105 mm Howitzers {{where it was}} called a 'Beehive' round. Unlike the shrapnel shells’ balls, the splintex shell contained flechettes. The result was the 105 mm M546 APERS-T (Anti-PERSonnel-Tracer) round, first used in the Vietnam War in 1966. The shell consisted of approximately 8,000 one-half gram flechettes arranged in five tiers, a time fuze, body shearing detonators, a central flash tube, a smokeless propellant charge with a dye marker contained in the base and a tracer element. The functioning of the shell was as follows: the time fuze fires, the <b>flash</b> <b>travels</b> down the <b>flash</b> tube, the shearing detonators fire, and the forward body splits into four pieces. The body and first four tiers are dispersed by the projectile's spin, the last tier and visual marker by the powder charge itself. The flechettes spread, mainly due to spin, {{from the point of}} burst in an ever-widening cone along the projectile's previous trajectory prior to bursting. The round is complex to make, but is a highly effective anti-personnel weapon [...] - [...] soldiers report that after beehive rounds were fired during an overrun attack, many enemy dead had their hands nailed to the wooden stocks of their rifles, and these dead could be dragged to mass graves by the rifle. It is said that the name beehive was given to the munition type due to the noise of the flechettes moving through the air resembling that of a swarm of angry bees.|$|R

At 16:25 HMS Queen Mary was cut in two by detonation of the forward magazine and sank with all but 21 of her crew of 1283. As the rear section capsized it also exploded. At 18:30 HMS Invincible was cut in two by detonation of the midships magazine and sank in 90 seconds with all but six of her crew. 1026 men died, including Rear Admiral Hood.

Professor Zoom later reveals this {{to have been a}} trap for the Flash, whom he will kill Flash along with thousands of others, and link Flash's name to the destruction. The Justice League shows up and defuses all the bombs that Zoom set and all the villains are arrested. Shaken by what transpired, and full of thoughts about his dead mother, Flash parts from his Justice League colleagues and chooses to be alone. The next day, Flash wakes up in a universe where history has happened differently. Here, he has none of his powers, his mother is alive, Iris is married to someone else, and a feud between Aquaman and Wonder Woman has triggered an all-out global war. Flash blames Professor Zoom for messing with the timeline. He enlists the help of Batman (Thomas Wayne, Bruce's father) to regain his speed. He does so by recreating the accident that gave him his powers. The first attempt fails, leaving Barry with third degree burns. the second attempt however is successful, with him fully regaining his speed. Barry then gathers up a band of heroes including Cyborg (a government agent), and the Shazam Kids (all of whom become one Captain Thunder when they all say the wizard Shazam's name together) to stop the war and restore the timeline. However, during a fight with Professor Zoom, Flash discovers that Zoom didn't do anything, and that it was him who altered time by going back and saving his mother. After Batman kills the evil speedster, <b>Flash</b> <b>travels</b> back and prevents himself from saving his mother, but once again fractures time, creating another alternate timeline which differs in subtler ways from the original. Barry is also in a better place with his mom's death, and is reunited with Iris. He also gives Batman (Bruce Wayne) a letter that Thomas asked him to deliver to his son.|$|R
40|$|SummaryA crucial early wound {{response}} is {{the recruitment of}} inflammatory cells drawn by danger cues released by the damaged tissue. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) has recently been identified as the earliest wound attractant in Drosophila embryos and zebrafish larvae [1, 2]. The H 2 O 2 signal is generated by activation of an NADPH oxidase, DUOX, and as a consequence, the first inflammatory cells are recruited to the wound within minutes. To date, nothing is known about how wounding activates DUOX. Here, we show that laser wounding of the Drosophila embryo epidermis triggers an instantaneous calcium <b>flash,</b> which <b>travels</b> as a wave via gap junctions several cell rows back from the wound edge. Blocking this calcium flash inhibits H 2 O 2 release at the wound site and leads {{to a reduction in}} the number of immune cells migrating to the wound. We suggest that the wound-induced calcium flash activates DUOX via an EF hand calcium-binding motif and thus triggers the production of the attractant damage cue H 2 O 2. Therefore, calcium represents the earliest signal in the wound inflammatory response...|$|R
