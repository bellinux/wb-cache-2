500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|E

IGN reviewer Cindy White commented: [...] "This episode {{proved that the}} show can be funny without him (Steve Carell)". She also praised Rainn Wilson and John Krasinski's performance in the episode calling it [...] "one of my favorite dynamics on the show". However, she criticized the Andy-Gabe-Erin love triangle storyline, commenting: [...] "It's only been made worse by the way they've turned Gabe from meek, bumbling burocrat [...] into unhinged stalker guy." [...] She ultimately gave the episode an 8.0/10. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "fun" [...] and a [...] "drastic improvement from 'The Inner Circle. He mainly praised the return of [...] "The Dwight/Jim dynamic", writing that he [...] "briefly rethought the idea of Dwight as long-term boss", {{and went on to}} praise the writers for featuring Dwight as manager for only one episode. He ultimately concluded that [...] "the first real impression of the show after Michael was a strong one." [...] TV Squad writer Joel Keller was very positive towards the episode commenting that [...] "The story also gave me faith that Lieberstein and company might actually do a credible job of exploring the other <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office now that the show's dominant force, Michael, is gone".|$|E

The emotional intensity of the hymns represent spontaneous expression of thought as an emotional responses to God.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{samples of}} Urmuz's prose have been {{traditionally}} seen as his secondary, less relevant, contributions. These are [...] "After the Storm" [...] and the posthumous [...] "A Little Metaphysics and Astronomy". In the former, an unnamed cavalier {{makes his way}} into a grim monastery, his heart moved {{at the sight of}} a pious hen; the repentant man then finds [...] "ecstasy" [...] in nature, leaping through the trees or releasing captive flies. Agents of the revenue service make efforts to confiscate his tree, but the protagonist is still able to squat on one of the branches after he gives proof of naturalization, and then—swimming his way through an [...] "infected pond"—shames his adversaries into giving up their claim. Born-again as a cynic, strengthened by his affair with the hen, he heads back to his [...] "native village" [...] to train <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "art of midwifery." [...] According to critics, [...] "After the Storm" [...] should be seen as a caricature of minor Romanticism, of conventional fantasy, or of travel literature. Simona Vasilache likens it to [...] "an Odyssey covering some twenty lines", [...] "a misalliance of heroism and pilferage" [...] with echoes from Urmuz's hero Ion Luca Caragiale.|$|E
