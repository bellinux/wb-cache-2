5|$|Observations in 2004 {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} an inner belt containing silicate material at a distance of 6.4 AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> Silicate material was also detected at 16 and 30 AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> with a lack of dust between 6.4 and 16 AU providing evidence that a massive planet may be orbiting in this region. Magnesium-rich olivine has also been detected, strikingly similar to that found in the Solar System comets and different from the olivine found in Solar System asteroids.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind moves away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E

5000|$|The warm {{material}} surrounding IRAS 08544-4431 {{has been}} resolved using interferometry with the AMBER and MIDI instruments at the Very Large Telescope. It is a circumbinary disc surrounding both stars, is heated mainly by <b>the</b> primary post-AGB <b>star,</b> {{and has a}} total mass of [...] The disc starts 9 AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> and is approximately 4 AU thick at its inner edge. The thick disc protects much of <b>the</b> dust <b>from</b> direct heating out to 70 AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> Beyond 70 AU, the disc is thick enough to receive direct radiation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R

5|$|Gliese 876 d {{is located}} in an orbit with a semimajor axis of only 0.0208 AU (3.11 million km). At this {{distance}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> tidal interactions should in theory circularize the orbit; however, measurements reveal {{that it has a}} high eccentricity of 0.207, comparable to that of Mercury in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, further {{measurements}} {{revealed the}} presence of a long-period planet in an orbit at around 5 AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> Even when both of the two planets were accounted for, there was still a periodicity at around 43 days. However, this period is close to the rotation period of 55 Cancri A, which led to the possibility that the 43-day period was caused by stellar rotation rather than a planet. Both the 43-day planet (designated 55 Cancri c) and the 5 AU planet (designated 55 Cancri d) were announced in the same paper, labeled in order of increasing distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough to distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an inclined orbit removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E
