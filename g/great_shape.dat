5|$|There was {{a strong}} belief that the race would be a battle between Carrera Jeans–Vagabond {{teammates}} Visentini and Roche. El Mundo Deportivo stated that Visentini had the edge in the time trial discipline and sprinting, while Roche had the advantage in climbing mountains. However, unlike Visentini, Roche came into the race in <b>great</b> <b>shape</b> after winning the Tour de Romandie and placing second in the Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Critérium International. Cycling expert and author Bill McGann thought that the race would be disputed between Visentini and Gianbattista Baronchelli.|$|E
25|$|They met on October 25, 1990. Douglas {{came into}} the fight at 246lb. and offered little {{in the fight against}} Holyfield, who was in <b>great</b> <b>shape</b> at 208lb. In the third round Douglas tried to start a {{combination}} with a big right uppercut. Holyfield countered with a straight right hand that was lightning quick and Douglas went down for the count. Holyfield was the new undefeated, Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World. At the time of the knockout, Holyfield was ahead on all three judges' scorecards, all seeing it 20–18 for Holyfield.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{returned}} for the 2014–15 season, his 19th {{season with the}} Lakers, who had replaced D'Antoni with Bryant's former Lakers teammate, Byron Scott. On November 30, 2014, in a 129–122 overtime victory against the Toronto Raptors, Bryant recorded his 20th career triple-double with 31 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. At age 36, he became the oldest NBA player to ever achieve 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a game. On December 14, Bryant became the NBA's third all-time leading scorer, passing Jordan (32,292) in a 100–94 win against Minnesota. He played in the first 27 games of the season, averaging team-highs with 26.4 points and 35.4 minutes per game while leading the league with 22.4 shots per game. However, Scott held him out for three straight games to rest after one of his worst performances of the season, when Bryant committed nine turnovers and scored 25 points on just 8-for-30 shooting in a 108–101 loss to Sacramento. He was suffering from soreness in his knees, feet, back, and Achilles tendons, and Scott planned to reduce his workload going forward. Three times Bryant had exceeded 40 minutes in a game, and the coach blamed himself for overloading him after he started the season in such <b>great</b> <b>shape.</b> For the season, Bryant had been shooting just 37 percent from the field, and the team's record was only 8–19. In his second game back after resting, he had 23 points, 11 assists, and 11 rebounds in a 111–103 win over Denver, and became just the third player in league history to record multiple triple-doubles in a season at age 36 or older. On January 21, 2015, Bryant suffered a rotator cuff tear in his right shoulder while driving baseline for a two-handed dunk against the New Orleans Pelicans. Though he is right-handed, he returned {{to play in the}} game and ran the offense while shooting, dribbling, and passing almost exclusively with his left hand. Prior to the injury, Bryant had been rested in 8 of 16 games. He underwent season-ending surgery for the injury, finishing the season averaging 22.3 points but shooting a career-low 37.3 percent, well below his 45.4 percent career mark to start the season. He was expected to be sidelined for nine months with a return targeted toward the start of the 2015–16 season.|$|E

30|$|Respecting the Egyptians in {{this present}} study, line shaped rugae {{were the most}} {{frequent}} rugae shape (76.67 %), followed by curve shaped rugae (16.67 %) and lastly sinous shaped rugae (6.66 %). In the Malaysians, Curves (36.67 %), sinouses (33.33 %) and lines (30 %) were the most frequent rugae shapes respectively. Circularly shaped rugae were the least frequent rugae pattern among both genders and both races, furthermore, none of the Malaysian males possessed this pattern of rugae. Significant results were observed among males and females. Malaysian males showed significantly <b>greater</b> curve <b>shaped</b> rugae, sinous shaped rugae and complexly shaped rugae than Egyptian males. Concerning the females, the Egyptians had significantly <b>greater</b> line <b>shaped</b> rugae while the Malaysians had significantly <b>greater</b> sinous <b>shape</b> rugae than the Egyptians.|$|R

500|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{not include}} the 1987 winner, Stephen Roche, who was sidelined {{for the majority of the}} 1988 season with a knee injury. l'Unità writer Gino Sala, author Bill McGann and an El Mundo Deportivo writer named several riders as contenders for the overall classification, including Andrew Hampsten, Urs Zimmermann, Erik Breukink, Franco Chioccioli, and Pedro Delgado. Sala believed Jean-François Bernard came into the Giro in <b>great</b> <b>shape</b> and that the French rider could win the race if he could do well in the time trials and the mountains. In addition, Bernard Hinault told Sala that if Jean Francois could do well in this edition of the Giro, he could one day lead a team in the Tour de France. Former Giro champion Gianni Motta thought Hampsten would win because of the effort he was expected to make on the Gavia Pass stage. Motta believed that Hampsten would excel there, while the Italian riders – the majority of the peloton – would not because they did not realize its difficulty and thought the Gavia was [...] "just another climb." ...|$|E

The Adam Ant of today's Latitude shows no flakiness of recent times, and it's testament to his enduring popularity that fans are left wide-eyed, grinning and speechless by a performance that's every bit as theatrical as you'd hope."
