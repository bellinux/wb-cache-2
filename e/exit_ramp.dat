5|$|When the New Jersey Department of Transportation started {{construction}} on upgrading the bypass, the fly-over ramp and on-ramp {{to and from}} Route172 were torn down for {{construction of a new}} interchange along a new local/express format. The overpass was closed on October 12, 2007 to begin the construction. The bridge was built by 1955 and was replaced in 2008. On January 2, 2009, the new <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> for Route18 to Route172 was reopened to traffic.|$|E
5|$|During the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli {{occupation}} of South Lebanon (1985â€“2000), the temple site was neglected and was invaded by vegetation overgrowth; it was cleared and recovered its former condition after the Israeli withdrawal. Today the Eshmun sanctuary can be visited {{all year round}} and free of charge, it is accessible from an <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> off the main Southern Lebanon highway near Sidon's northern entrance. The site holds a particular archaeological importance {{since it is the}} best preserved Phoenician site in Lebanon; it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List's Cultural category on , 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Governor Christine Todd Whitman {{approved}} the project, and construction began on November 4, 1998. After {{construction on the}} freeway began, Wynn's interests were purchased by MGM Grand Inc., thus creating the MGM Mirage company, and plans for Le Jardin were canceled. Despite the fact that Le Jardin was canceled and MGM Mirage's new casino, Borgata, was not scheduled to open until 2003, Trump still fought against the project's plans to build the exit directly to the new casino. Eventually, in January 2000, Trump dropped his case after an <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> leading to the Trump Marina {{was added to the}} project.|$|E

50|$|I-210, {{including}} the Israel LaFleur Bridge, was constructed between its western terminus and Prien Lake Road circa 1963 to 1965. Initially, the western terminus at I-10 consisted solely of eastbound entrance and westbound <b>exit</b> <b>ramps.</b> The eastern remainder of I-210 was built circa 1975 to 1976, and westbound entrance/eastbound <b>exit</b> <b>ramps</b> {{were added to}} the western terminus in 1986.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFreeway diverge {{areas have}} long been {{considered}} crash prone locations. Research is needed {{to better understand the}} relationship between the severity consequences of crashes reported at freeway diverge areas and various contributing factors such as geometric layouts and traffic characteristics. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the impacts of contributing factors related to crash injury severity at freeway diverge areas. An ordered probit (OP) model was developed to relate the severity of crash to various explanatory variables using data collected at 326 freeway exit segments in Florida, United States. It is found that the factors significantly influencing crash severity at freeway diverge areas included the mainline lane number, length of ramp, difference of speed limits between mainline and ramp, light condition, weather condition, surrounding land type, alcohol/drug involvement, road surface condition, shoulder width, and crash types of rear-end and sideswipe. The two-lane <b>exit</b> <b>ramps</b> without optional lane were found to have minor crash injury as compared with single-lane <b>exit</b> <b>ramps.</b> The injury severity of crashes do not show significant difference between single-lane <b>exit</b> <b>ramps</b> and single-lane <b>exit</b> <b>ramps</b> with a taper and two-lane <b>exit</b> <b>ramps</b> with an optional lane. Marginal analysis was conducted to quantitatively interpret the marginal effects of contributing factors on each crash severity...|$|R
5|$|The freeway {{has also}} been {{expanded}} with an extra lane northbound between Perth and Hutton Street, in conjunction with works to increase {{the capacity of the}} Graham Farmer Freeway tunnel. Works progressed in two stages, with Vincent Street as the midpoint. As part of the project, the overpasses at Powis Street, Vincent Street and Scarborough Beach Road have been widened. An additional slip lane has been constructed, from Graham Farmer Freeway's Loftus Street <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> to Mitchell Freeway northbound, to access Vincent Street without changing lanes to the left lanes of Mitchell Freeway northbound. The project commenced in February 2013 and was completed in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} tornado, later named the Lone Grove Tornado, first touched down in southeast Jefferson County, Oklahoma at 6:48pm CST (00:48UTC) near the Red River. The tornado crossed through {{rural areas as}} it moved to the northeast into Love County, before going into Carter County at 7:10pm CST (01:10UTC). The tornado continued moving to the northeast for the next 15 minutes before striking Lone Grove, Oklahoma. The tornado then crossed Interstate 35 {{just north of the}} Prairie Valley Road <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> and tracked through rural areas of northeastern Carter County to the east of Springer, ending at 7:43pm CST (01:43UTC).|$|E

5|$|US 113 closely {{parallels}} the railroad west of Friendship to north of its right-in/right-out junction with MD 575 (Worcester Highway), an interchange only {{accessible to the}} northbound U.S. Highway. The route leaves the railroad track and meets MD90 (Ocean City Expressway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange; MD90 connects {{the northern part of}} Ocean City with US50 west of Berlin. US113 continues north to its interchange with the northern end of MD575 and MD589 (Racetrack Road), which leads to Ocean Pines and Ocean Downs, a harness racing track with a slot machine casino. The <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> from northbound US113 intersects MD575 a short distance south of its intersection with MD 589, and the southbound ramps connect with West Frontage Road (unsigned MD 575A), which serves St. Martin's Episcopal Church.|$|E
5|$|East of the railway, {{the route}} crosses below US1. The {{eastbound}} lane has an <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> that connects to both directions of US1; in contrast, the westbound lane has a dedicated exit for both US1 northbound and a loop to US1 southbound. The road continues to the east, crossing a small inlet {{and a small}} island before ascending over the Indian River with twin bridges. At {{the eastern end of}} the bridges, the route again crosses a small island and inlet before reaching a narrow portion of Merritt Island. There, the causeway intersects with CR3. The route crosses a series of islands, forming another twin set of bridges over the Banana River. After reaching land for the final time, the route enters South Patrick Shores. It has a partial interchange with SR513, with only an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance. After passing north of a housing development, the causeway ends at an intersection with SR A1A.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the town line, NY275 enters the hamlet of Nile, where it becomes a two-lane {{residential}} street named Pennsylvania Avenue. In {{the center of the}} community, the route meets the east end of CR1 (Fifth Avenue). From here, NY275 bends back to the north, crossing through rural sections of the town of Friendship mostly populated by farms. The rural surroundings end ahead of the hamlet of Friendship, where NY275 heads through the residential western portion of the community. Near the center of Friendship, the highway intersects CR20 (West Main Street), the primary eastâ€“west street through the hamlet. NY275 continues on, crossing over the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line (formerly the Erie Railroad's Main Line) to reach exit29 of the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY17). NY275 ends at the <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> leading away from the westbound direction of the freeway; however, NY275's right-of-way continues north to NY19 in Belfast as CR17.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} {{bank of the}} river, NY31 exits NY690 but joins NY370 {{at the end of}} the <b>exit</b> <b>ramp.</b> Together, NY31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, {{intersecting}} NY48 in the village center. Three blocks from NY48, NY370 splits from NY31. As NY370 heads for downtown Syracuse, NY31 continues east, overlapping NY631 for a short distance before passing through Lysander New Community and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of Clay, NY31 meets NY481 at an interchange in the shadow of the Great Northern Mall. NY31 continues eastward through the town to Cicero, where it meets US11 and I-81 at exit30. As NY31 heads away from I-81, Oneida Lake slowly becomes visible to the north. NY31 comes within a mile (about 1.6km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the Madison County line, here delimited by Chittenango Creek, NY31 enters the western half of Bridgeport and meets the eastern terminus of NY298 near the banks of the creek. NY31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{slated for}} the {{interchange}} with County Routes 516 and 527 in Old Bridge {{as there is}} no way to access either of them without driving through a residential area off Route 18. The traffic flow along CR 516 (Old Bridge into Matawan) and 527 (Old Bridge into Englishtown/Manalapan) has increased significantly in the past ten years which called for the <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> off Route 18. The Old Bridge improvements include adding inside shoulders and widening County Routes 516 and 527. A signalized ramp is to be added for access to County Routes 516 and 527. Subsequently, County Route 516's intersection with Old Matawan Road is to be relocated. The project would cost over $28 million and was slated to begin in 2009 and to end in 2010. As of the end of 2009 the large project was put on hold because of the lack of funds and the economic situation. Demolition was completed in 2009 on Marlboro Road, taking down several residential houses and along Old Matawan Road and CR 516 and taking down an old gas station in preparing for the project. There is no new date released by NJDOT in when construction will begin.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced plans to}} widen the Northeast Extension to six lanes between Mid-County and Lansdale. The project divided this stretch of highway into two sections. Work on the southern section began in January 2008 with the replacement of two bridges over the Northeast Extension to accommodate the widened highway. Construction on the actual widening phase commenced in January 2011. Completion was originally planned in 2013; however, construction fell a year behind schedule. The southern section finished up in October 2014, while work on the northern section started in May 2014. By this point the project scope was expanded to include the Lansdale interchange itself, the roadway to a point one mile north of the interchange, and two new E-ZPass-only ramps at the Lansdale interchange to relieve congestion at the toll plaza. This new northbound <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> opened December 4, 2016, and the companion southbound on-ramp opened a week later.. The northern section was originally planned to finish {{by the end of}} 2016 but was delayed until mid-2017. Construction is to be substantially complete, with all six lanes open, by August 31, 2017.|$|E

25|$|MD 980B {{begins at}} a dead end at a gate just north of Lyons Creek. The road heads north as two-lane Southern Most Road, which passes close to the ramp from {{southbound}} MD 4 to eastbound MD 260 (Chesapeake Beach Road) and begins to parallel the southbound direction of MD 4 (Southern Maryland Boulevard). MD 980B's name changes to MD 4 Service Road at Lower Pindell Road, where an <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> from southbound MD 4 meets the service road. There is an entrance ramp to southbound MD 4 south of Upper Pindell Road. The highway closely parallels MD 4 until the latter highway's diamond interchange with MD 258 (Bay Front Road) in Bristol. MD 980B curves around the interchange and reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with Wrighton Road just west of Wrighton Road's intersection with {{the western end of}} MD 258 and an <b>exit</b> <b>ramp</b> from southbound MD 4.|$|E
25|$|Past North French Road, I-990 bends {{back to the}} northeast, {{crossing}} Hopkins Road (CR87) as {{it approaches}} an at-grade intersection with NY263 (Millersport Highway).
