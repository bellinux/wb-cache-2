5|$|The Pranatoshini Tantra (18th century) narrates two {{tales of}} Chhinnamasta's birth. One legend, {{attributed}} to the Narada-pancharatra, tells how once, while bathing in Mandakini river, Parvati becomes sexually excited, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> and gives her blood to satisfy their hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour <b>her</b> <b>nails.</b> The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} of working with {{resistance}} is essentially a hypnotic one, it goes beyond hypnosis and trance. In a typical example, a girl that bit <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> was told that she was cheating herself of really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let some of <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> grow a little longer before biting them, so that she really could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> long enough that she might really enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.|$|E

25|$|In this performance, Abramović {{sought to}} re-evoke {{the energy of}} extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire {{at the start of}} the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramović cut <b>her</b> <b>nails,</b> toenails, and hair. When {{finished}} with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramović leapt across the flames, propelling herself into the center of the large star. Due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that, once inside the star, the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen. Some members of the audience realized what had occurred only when the flames came very near to her body and she remained inert. A doctor and several members of the audience intervened and extricated her from the star.|$|E
500|$|The {{element of}} speed and {{surprise}} is vital and the circumciser immediately grabs the clitoris by pinching it between <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> aiming to amputate it with a slash. The organ is then shown to the senior female relatives of the child who will decide whether the amount that has been removed is satisfactory or whether more is to be cut off.|$|E
500|$|It is Day 15, October 6, 2004, and Claire {{wakes up}} from nightmares two {{nights in a}} row, screaming. In the first, Claire wakes to find herself no longer pregnant, as she walks into the forest and {{encounters}} John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at a table, playing cards. She asks him why he is there, but Locke interrupts, telling her [...] "He was your responsibility, but you gave him away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now." [...] Locke looks up with one white and one black eye. She hears crying and finds a baby crib. After unfolding several layers of material she dips her hands into {{a pool of blood}} and then wakes screaming; she has injured her hands by digging <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> deeply into her palms. In the second dream, someone holds Claire down and injects something into her stomach, though she has no wound.|$|E
40|$|Yellow nail {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disease of unclear etiology. We describe a patient who develops yellow nail syndrome, with primary nail and sinus manifestations, shortly after amalgam dental implants. A study of the patient's nail shedding showed elevated nail titanium levels. The patient had her dental implants removed and had complete resolution of her sinus symptoms with no change in <b>her</b> <b>nail</b> findings. Since the patient's nail findings did not resolve {{we do not believe}} titanium exposure is a cause of <b>her</b> yellow <b>nail</b> syndrome but perhaps a possible relationship exists between titanium exposure and yellow nail syndrome that requires further studies...|$|R

500|$|Precise {{detail is}} not spared in {{descriptions}} of decay and disease, two vivid {{elements in the}} novel. Marneffe, for example, represents [...] His decrepit body {{is a symbol of}} society's weakness at the time, worn away from years of indulgence. The poison which kills Valérie and Crevel is also described in ghastly detail. The doctor Bianchon explains: [...] "Ses dents et ses cheveux tombent, elle a l'aspect des lépreux, elle se fait horreur à elle-même; ses mains, épouvantables à voir, sont enflées et couvertes de pustules verdâtres; les ongles déchaussés restent dans les plaies qu'elle gratte; enfin, toutes les extrémités se détruisent dans la sanie qui les ronge." [...] ("She is losing her hair and teeth, her skin is like a leper's, she is a horror to herself; her hands are horrible, covered with greenish pustules, <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> are loose, and the flesh is eaten away by the poisoned humors.") ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. [...] "She {{told me to}} pack up all my stuff, I'm getting kicked out—the video starts off like that", said Roache. It opens with Beyoncé filing <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Beyoncé orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Beyoncé follows her then-ex-boyfriend outside the house and leans on a 2007 Jaguar XK. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the {{audience}} {{to find out that}} she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Beyoncé manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. There are additional beats mixed to the arrangement for the video version that can be heard, when Beyoncé sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama, towards the end. It ends with Beyoncé greeting her new boyfriend at the front door.|$|E
500|$|While Vicky {{was close}} with her eldest daughter, this changed {{as the girl}} grew older; {{by the time she}} was two years old, Charlotte had become known as [...] "sweet naughty little Ditta" [...] and would prove to be the most {{difficult}} of the family's eight children. As a young girl, she acted nervously and made frequent displays of agitation, such as pulling at her clothes. An early habit of biting <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> led to preventative measures like the forced wearing of gloves, but any methods only provided temporary relief. Queen Victoria wrote to her daughter, [...] "tell Charlotte I was appalled to hear of her biting her things. Grandmamma does not like naughty little girls". In 1863 the Crown Princess recorded in her diary that Charlotte's [...] "little mind seems almost too active for her body – she is so nervous & sensitive and so quick. Her sleep is not so sound as it should be – and she is so very thin". Charlotte developed violent tantrums, to her mother's displeasure; Vicky described them as [...] "such outbreaks of rage & stubbornness that she screams blue murder". The young girl was also underweight and had a troublesome digestion.|$|E

Also that sixteen ounces were one pound, and sixteen drams one ounce; but there she got stuck, and began making figures and rubbing them out, as if in hopes that would clear up her mind. Mrs. King pecked on for ten minutes on <b>her</b> <b>nail.</b>|$|R

As she limps back to the road, she meets Leonard again. Inside his van, she sees a hat identical to Sophie's. The next day, the day of the solstice, after recovering from her fall, she walks down to Leonard's house. She finds farming equipment and several large knives.|$|R

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Shakira {{getting out of}} bed in the middle of a full-moon night. <b>Her</b> <b>nails</b> begin to grow and she is shown lacing a pair of boots. Shakira then enters a closet, which leads to the inside of a {{glittering}} ruby-red cave, where she begins dancing wearing a black asymmetric bodysuit. The next scene depicts Shakira striking different poses inside a golden cage (with the sign [...] "Do Not Feed the Animal" [...] on top), clad in a skin-toned leotard. Shakira explained the usage of the golden cage in the video, saying that [...] "I just wanted to express what it feels like for a she-wolf to be in captivity. To be in a golden cage. I think I've been in a golden cage most of my life. And now not anymore". The setting changes and Shakira is seen performing a dance routine in a club with many back-up dancers. A wolf is also shown walking in the club and transforming into a woman. Near to the end of the video, Shakira dances on a rooftop with a backdrop resembling San Francisco. As the song ends, she falls backwards from the roof and lands in her closet. The video ends with Shakira lying back in her bed and smiling as thunder cracks.|$|E

The look {{was described as a}} [...] "soft smokey eye" [...] with pink lips and cheeks. <b>Her</b> <b>nails</b> were painted by manicurist Marina Sandoval in a mixture of two polishes: a [...] "barely there pink" [...] and a [...] "sheer beige" [...] to complement her skin tone and gown.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 May, {{a second}} autopsy was {{performed}} on demand of Wienke Zitzlaff (Meinhof's sister) by Dr. Werner Janssen and Dr. Jürgen Schröder, even though the brain, a lot of critical organs, and tissue parts had been previously removed from the body. Also <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> had been cut, so the doctors could not determine clearly if there were traces of struggle. Some examinations could not take place since critical time had passed. Janssen concluded that the most probable {{cause of death was}} [...] "suicide by hanging", however in order to come to a definite conclusion he insisted to be given access to the report of the first autopsy, something that never happened.|$|E

It continues a cult movie related focus for Azalea's music videos, her earlier single [...] "Fancy" [...] paid homage to the 1990s teen film Clueless and [...] "Black Widow" [...] to the Kill Bill films. The clip is a homage to the 1988 film, Earth Girls Are Easy, directed by Julien Temple and starring Geena Davis. It therefore is heavily styled on 1980s fashion and technology {{as well as the}} loose plot of the film. The video begins with Spears reclining poolside filing <b>her</b> <b>nails</b> with the health and wellness supplement MateFit. visible. Suddenly, an alien Iggy Azalea crash lands into the pool.
