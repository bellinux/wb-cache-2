25|$|In {{the graph}} {{to the right}} the value above the line {{represents}} the out-of-pocket cost per trip, per person <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>mode</b> of transportation; the value below the line shows subsidies, environmental impact, social and indirect costs. When cities charge market rates for on-street parking and municipal parking garages for motor vehicles, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled for these modes, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs compared to other modes of transportation. When municipal motor vehicle parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, the shortfall in tax expenditures by drivers, through fuel tax and other taxes, might {{be regarded as a}} very large subsidy for automobile use: much greater than common subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.|$|E
500|$|Another design approach, {{particularly}} {{suitable for}} CAD {{because it is}} a numerical method, is to decompose the filter into a number of finite elements. [...] These elements are a large number of simple steps and ridges. [...] A number of methods are available to analyse the individual elements. [...] The mode matching technique expands the field equations of the element into a series of eigenfunctions and then <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>mode</b> matches the field at the interface between elements. [...] The Galerkin method expands the field equations into polynomial functions such as Gegenbauer polynomials or Chebyshev polynomials. [...] These methods can be mixed according to what is convenient for a particular type of element. [...] Whichever analysis method is used, the final output needed is the scattering parameters matrix for each element. [...] The overall filter response is then found from the combined scattering matrix of all the individual element matrices. [...] This method is analytic rather than synthetic, that is, a trial design must first exist in order to be analysed unlike synthesis methods where the starting point is a prescribed transfer function from which a design is synthesised.Manuilov and Kobrin, 2005, pp.93–94Manuilov et al., 2009, pp.527–528 ...|$|E
