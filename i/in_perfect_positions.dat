FS Nick Collins who was a couple yards behind Wayne was <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> to intercept the ball and returned it 62 yards for the touchdown to take the commanding 24-7 lead early in the 3rd.|$|R
500|$|The Screaming Skull was {{directed}} by Alex Nicol, an actor who had roles on Broadway productions and often played supporting characters. He decided to try directing a film, as {{he felt that he}} had not been performing the roles that he desired. Nicol noted that [...] "as an actor, you're <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position,</b> if you choose to do so, to watch the directors you're working with setting up the shots, making decisions as to where to place the camera, and so I picked up a lot over the years".|$|R
5000|$|As he and Quasimodo confront one another, the maddened Frollo finally {{admits that}} he was {{responsible}} for the death of Quasimodo's mother, and declares that he will kill Quasimodo. Frollo subsequently uses his cape to knock Quasimodo off the balcony, but Quasimodo manages to grab on and ends up pulling Frollo down (but is unwilling to let him fall) as well. Frollo dangles momentarily but is able to climb onto a nearby gargoyle <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> to kill Esmeralda, who is attempting to save Quasimodo, who has passed out from exhaustion. Frollo raises his sword and maniacally quotes a faux Bible verse created for the film: ...|$|R
50|$|Paul Tanqueray {{opened his}} first studio at 139, High Street, Kensington in 1925. As London's then {{youngest}} photographer, he was <b>in</b> a <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> to document an era {{that had become}} obsessed with youth and modernism. During this time he employed an ex-Cambridge graduate as his assistant, Cecil Beaton, until Beaton was taken on by Vogue.|$|R

50|$|The most {{productive}} period for Scholtz, however, was after 1950, after his retirement from UCT in 1965. He now {{had time for}} his art studies, and also to publish analyses of the textual material that L.C. van Oordt had mined out of the Kaapse Argief.

50|$|Tim Watters was {{a rarity}} in the National Hockey League (NHL), a {{physical}} defenceman who stood under 6 feet tall and under 200 pounds. He played in 2 Olympics and well over 700 NHL games, quietly playing a solid though unspectacular role from 1981 through 1995 with the Winnipeg Jets and Los Angeles Kings, two teams that didn't enjoy much success or fanfare. Not having the size to out-muscle opponents, Watters learned to be <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> and angled shooters out of harm's way. He read the oncoming rushes very well, and thanklessly cut off passing lanes and blocked shots. He learned to tie up players' sticks {{and was one of}} the few modern players to master the hip check.|$|R
50|$|The 6-step is {{foundational}} to b-boying {{not only}} because it is the first footwork sequence breakers often learn, but also because it remains the move around which many sets are structured. Many break moves can begin from the 6-step. The move sets up the direction of rotation and builds momentum while imparting body control. The breaker stays low and in contact with the ground, which places him <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> for performing other moves. Each of the six distinct steps puts the body in a different position which can be used as starting points for other moves. Steps 1/2 and 3/4 (described below) are most often used for launching other moves. Conversely, any move which ends on the ground can be transitioned smoothly back into the 6-step.|$|R
5000|$|Kaufman went {{a perfect}} six for six, {{catching}} all balls thrown {{to him in}} the preseason, including one touchdown. (One catch was called back for offensive line holding). His biggest highlight came on his first official catch, against the Colts in game one. The Colts’ sideline read the play before the snap and called in from the sideline to their cornerback that Kaufman was going to run a double-move go route. Despite the advance warning allowing the defender to be <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position,</b> Kaufman was still able to pull down the circus catch and get both feet in-bounds. Kaufman consistently was able to get open throughout the preseason, despite very few throws being made overall in the last game in which he saw the most field-time.|$|R

25|$|The next day, Balao {{investigated}} smoke on the horizon, {{found two}} cargo ships, tracked {{them through a}} rain squall, and as she passed into clear weather, found the convoy <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> for her torpedoes. She fired four stern tubes at the leading ship, but heard no explosions. The torpedoes were duds or had again passed underneath. As the escorts actively pursued the submarine, Balao submerged {{to wait out the}} inevitable depth charges. When the submarine surfaced again, all trace of the convoy was gone, and she set course for Langemak Bay, New Guinea, with all her torpedoes expended. On 7 March, Balao moored alongside Coucal and took on fuel and provisions. She got underway again on the following morning, bound for Pearl Harbor where she arrived for refit on 19 March.|$|R
50|$|The final was slow, with André Bucher {{leading the}} first lap in 53.43. Down the back stretch Andrea Longo moved {{shoulder}} to shoulder with Bucher and at the 600 meter mark, just under 1:20 Longo dropped his shoulder forcing Bucher into the infield. Longo charged into the lead around the final turn with world record holder in next to last place chasing the notable young kicker Yuriy Borzakovskiy. Kipketer had to go out to lane 4 to try to get around the wall of runners ahead of him with Djabir Saïd-Guerni in lane 5 trying to get around Kipketer. Longo faded with 30 meters to go, with Nils Schumann <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> to pick up the pieces, holding off the late rush on the outside to take the gold. For the interference, Longo was disqualified.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982 Stinnett {{was working}} as a sports {{photographer}} for the Oakland Tribune. With 4 seconds left in the Big Game (football game) between Cal and Stanford, Stinnett stationed himself behind the south end zone in California Memorial Stadium, at Berkeley. As it happened, Kevin Moen and teammates Dwight Garner, Richard Rodgers, and Mariet Ford pulled off [...] "The Play", in which Moen fielded the Stanford kickoff, lateraled the ball, and five laterals later, received the final lateral, which he ran into the end zone through the Stanford Band. Stinnett was <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> for a famous photographic shot wherein Moen is on the zenith point of his leap, roaring in triumph, the football held high over his helmet, and about to land on Stanford trombone player Gary Tyrell.|$|R

25|$|Unbeknownst to General Baratieri, Emperor Menelik {{knew his}} troops had {{exhausted}} {{the ability of}} the local peasants to support them and had planned to break camp the next day (2 March). The Emperor had risen early to begin prayers for divine guidance when spies from Ras Alula, his chief military advisor, brought him news that the Italians were advancing. The Emperor summoned the separate armies of his nobles and with the Empress Taytu beside him, ordered his forces forward. Negus Tekle Haymanot commanded the right wing, Ras Alula the left, and Rasses Makonnen and Mengesha the center, with Ras Mikael {{at the head of the}} Oromo cavalry; the Emperor and his consort remained with the reserve. The Ethiopian forces positioned themselves on the hills overlooking the Adwa valley, <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> to receive the Italians, who were exposed and vulnerable to crossfire.|$|R

25|$|Hillyard's {{relationship}} to the En-tout-cas company throughout the years is somewhat diffuse. Clearly, he was <b>in</b> the <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> to promote the court surface, and he was certainly involved {{in the decision to}} construct en-tout-cas courts at the new Wimbledon grounds, giving them a marketing coup. In 1929, when being involved in the construction of a golf course – a job which was given to En-tout-cas on Hillyard's recommendation –, he eventually disclosed that he was a director of En-tout-cas, thus obviously receiving income from the company.|$|R

5|$|Wake's post-score kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback. With time running down, Georgia Tech had a chance for a game-winning score if it could sustain a drive into Wake Forest {{territory}} from its own 20-yard line. The drive began with a promising 14-yard completion to Calvin Johnson, but after Reggie Ball threw three incomplete passes, Georgia Tech was forced to punt the ball back to Wake Forest. The Deacons, after getting the ball at their own 20-yard line, began a drive of their own. Riley Skinner completed his first four passes of the drive, including a long 45-yard strike to Willie Idlette for the longest play of the game. With a first down inside the Georgia Tech red zone, the Deacons seemed to be <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> for a potentially game-winning touchdown. But as had every other drive previous, Wake Forest's offense failed to cross the goal line. Sam Swank kicked a 22-yard field goal to give the Deacons a 96 lead, but Georgia Tech still had time for one final drive.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDiflavin reductases are {{essential}} proteins capable of splitting the two-electron flux from reduced pyridine nucleotides {{to a variety}} of one electron acceptors. The primary sequence of diflavin reductases shows a conserved domain organization harboring two catalytic domains bound to the FAD and FMN flavins sandwiched by one or several non-catalytic domains. The catalytic domains are analogous to existing globular proteins: the FMN domain is analogous to flavodoxins while the FAD domain resembles ferredoxin reductases. The first structural determination of one member of the diflavin reductases family raised some questions about the architecture of the enzyme during catalysis: both FMN and FAD were <b>in</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>position</b> for interflavin transfers but the steric hindrance of the FAD domain rapidly prompted more complex hypotheses on the possible mechanisms for the electron transfer from FMN to external acceptors. Hypotheses of domain reorganization during catalysis {{in the context of the}} different members of this family were given by many groups during the past twenty years. This review will address the recent advances in various structural approaches that have highlighted specific dynamic features of diflavin reductases...|$|R
