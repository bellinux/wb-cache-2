50|$|Three {{prisoners are}} {{locked up in}} the same cell. <b>Green-Eyes</b> (Yeux-Verts) has killed a woman and is to be guillotined. Maurice and Lefranc are sentenced for more minor crimes. Maurice has a deep {{attachment}} to <b>Green-Eyes,</b> as does Lefranc, but secretly. He also hates Maurice, while feigning to hate <b>Green-Eyes,</b> preferring him to Snowball (Boule-de-Neige). Snowball himself is also condemned to death (his presence in the play is only evoked, not actual) and along with <b>Green-Eyes</b> they are considered the Kings of the prison. In fact their sentence traps them in a solitude and an immense unhappiness which lends them a certain dignity. Lefranc who is constantly in conflict with Maurice--especially because of Green-Eyes's woman that both of them desire--ends up strangling him so as to join <b>Green-Eyes</b> in his solitude and dejection.|$|R

50|$|Feeding {{mostly on}} sardines, Galápagos sea lions {{sometimes}} travel 10 to 15 {{kilometers from the}} coast over the span of days to hunt for their prey. This is when they {{come into contact with}} their biggest predators: sharks and killer whales. Injuries and scars from attacks are often visible. During el Niño events, which occurs when the water temperature changes and causes climate change in the Pacific, more <b>green-eyes</b> and myctophids are consumed due to a decrease in sardine population. El Nino caused many population decreases by changing the sea lion's availability for food, causing these Galapagos sea lions to be listed as endangered.|$|R
