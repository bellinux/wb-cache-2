5|$|Quern stones: Quern {{stones were}} used in China at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour. The {{production}} of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours. Due to their form, dimensions, {{and the nature of}} the treatment of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in <b>Hukou,</b> Shaanxi in 2007. The site is located in the heartland of the northern Chinese loess plateau near the Yellow River.|$|E
25|$|Four of China's five main {{freshwater}} lakes contribute their {{waters to}} the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream {{part of the}} Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to <b>Hukou</b> County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from <b>Hukou</b> to Shanghai.|$|E

25|$|The {{discrimination}} {{enforced by}} the <b>hukou</b> system became particularly onerous in the 1980s after {{hundreds of millions of}} migrant workers were forced out of state corporations, co-operatives and other institutions. Attempts by workers classified as rural to move to urban centers were tightly controlled by the Chinese bureaucracy, which enforced its control by denying access to essential goods and services such as grain rations, housing, and health care, and by regularly closing down migrant workers' private schools. The <b>hukou</b> system also enforced pass laws similar to those in South Africa. Rural workers required six passes to work in provinces other than their own, and periodic police raids rounded up those without permits, placed them in detention centers, and deported them. As in South Africa, the restrictions placed on the mobility of migrant workers were pervasive, and transient workers were forced to live a precarious existence in company dormitories or shanty towns, suffering abusive consequences. Anita Chan comments further that China's household registration and temporary residence permit system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in apartheid South Africa, which were designed to regulate the supply of cheap labor.|$|E
25|$|Abolition of {{this policy}} has been {{proposed}} in 11 provinces, mainly along the developed eastern coast. After a widely publicised incident in 2003, when a university-educated migrant died in Guangdong province, the law was changed to eliminate the possibility of summary arrest for migrant laborers. The Beijing law lecturer who exposed the incident said it spelt {{the end of the}} <b>hukou</b> system: he believed that in most smaller cities, the system had been abandoned, and had 'almost lost its function' in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.|$|E
25|$|Besides these {{economic}} changes the Party implemented major social {{changes in the}} countryside including the banishing of all religious and mystic institutions and ceremonies and replacing them with political meetings and propaganda sessions. Attempts were made to enhance rural education {{and the status of}} women (allowing them to initiate divorce if they desired) and ending foot-binding, child marriage and opium addiction. The old system of internal passports (the <b>hukou)</b> were introduced in 1956, preventing inter-county travel without appropriate authorization. Highest priority was given to the urban proletariat for whom a welfare state was created.|$|E
25|$|Li's ancestral {{family name}} was {{actually}} Xu (許). His ancestors had migrated from <b>Hukou,</b> Jiangxi Province to Hefei, Anhui Province. Li's eighth-great-grandfather, Xu Yingxi (許迎溪), {{had given up}} his second son, Xu Shen (許慎), for adoption by a relative, Li Xinzhuang (李心莊). Xu Shen and his descendants had taken Li (李) to be their family name since then. Li's father, Li Wen'an (李文安; 1801–1855), obtained a jinshi degree in the imperial examination in 1838 – {{the same year as}} Zeng Guofan. Li Wen'an also served as a langzhong (郎中) in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
25|$|Shanghai ranked {{first in}} the 2009 and 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), a {{worldwide}} study of academic performance of 15-year-old students conducted by the OECD. Shanghai students, including migrant children, scored highest in every aspect (math, reading and science) in the world. The study concludes that public-funded schools in Shanghai have the highest educational quality in the world. Critics of PISA results counter that, in Shanghai and other Chinese cities, most children of migrant workers can only attend city schools up to the ninth grade, and must return to their parents' hometowns for high school due to <b>hukou</b> restrictions, thus skewing {{the composition of the}} city's high school students in favor of wealthier local families.|$|E
25|$|With a {{population}} of approximately 93.6 million, Henan is the third most populous Chinese province after Guangdong and Shandong. It is also the fifth most populous sub-national division in the world. If it were a country by itself, {{it would be the}} twelfth most populous in the world, just behind Mexico and ahead of the Philippines. However, the <b>hukou</b> system shows Henan as the most populous province in China with over 103 million people, as it counts the migrant Henanese laborers as residents of Henan, instead of the province they currently reside in. On the other hand, Guangdong is shown as having only 81 million people, though the actual population is 95 million due to the influx of migrants from other provinces.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{there was}} a net inflow of Han people to Xinjiang, {{many of whom were}} {{previously}} prevented from moving because of the declining number of social services tied to <b>hukou</b> (residency permits). As of 1996, 13.6% of Xinjiang's population was employed by the publicly traded Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (Bingtuan) corporation. 90% of the Bingtuans activities relate to agriculture, and 88% of Bingtuan employees are Han, although the percentage of Hans with ties to the Bingtuan has decreased. Han emigration from Xinjiang has also resulted in an increase of minority-identified agricultural workers as a total percentage of Xinjiang's farmers, from 69.4% in 1982 to 76.7% in 1990. During the 1990s, about 1.2 million temporary migrants entered Xinjiang every year to stay for the cotton picking season. Many Uyghur trading communities exist outside of Xinjiang; the largest in Beijing is one village of a few thousand.|$|E
25|$|Along with Jiangxi, Henan {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{unbalanced}} gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government. Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1–4 age group; this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the <b>hukou</b> in order to escape fines.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{human rights}} groups have publicized human rights issues in China that they {{consider}} the government to be mishandling, including: the death penalty (capital punishment), the one-child policy (which China had made exceptions for ethnic minorities prior to abolishing it in 2015), the political and legal status of Tibet, and neglect of {{freedom of the press}} in mainland China. Other areas of concern include the lack of legal recognition of human rights and the lack of an independent judiciary, rule of law, and due process. Further issues raised in regard to human rights include the severe lack of worker's rights (in particular the <b>hukou</b> system which restricts migrant labourers' freedom of movement), the absence of independent labour unions (which have since been changing), and allegations of discrimination against rural workers and ethnic minorities, as well as the lack of religious freedom rights groups have highlighted repression of the Christian, Tibetan Buddhist, and Falun Gong religious groups. Some Chinese activist groups are trying to expand these freedoms, including Human Rights in China, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group. Chinese human rights attorneys who take on cases related to these issues, however, often face harassment, disbarment, and arrest.|$|E

500|$|After {{the story}} of Feng Jianmei's {{abortion}} gained widespread domestic and international exposure, Zhenping County officials denied the allegations, saying that the abortion was legal and that Feng had requested it.

[...] According to Zhenping County officials, authorities had contacted Feng in March 2012 and told her that she needed to obtain documentation, including a new household registration (referred to as <b>hukou),</b> in order to file an application to have the child. Her family denies this, saying that officials did not notify them until several days before the abortion was induced.|$|E
500|$|On June 26, {{the results}} of the {{investigation}} were announced.

[...] "The incident showed that some officials at the grassroots level have a weak sense of the law and show little concern for the well-being of the people," [...] the report said. [...] The head of the family planning bureau of Zhenping, Jiang Nenghai, and one other official were fired. Five other government and hospital employees received some form of punishment.

2500|$|Following the {{large-scale}} movement of Chinese rural population {{to the cities}} the children of these migrant workers either stay as [...] left-behind children in the villages or they migrate with their parents to the cities. Although regulations by the central government stipulate that all migrant children {{have the right to}} attend a public school in the cities public schools nevertheless effectively reject these children by setting high thresholds such as school fees and exams or by requesting an urban registration (<b>Hukou).</b> Providing an alternative, private entrepreneurs established since the 1990s semi-official private schools that offered schooling to migrant children for lower fees. However, this system contributed to the segregation between urban and migrant children. Furthermore, these schools often have a poor teaching quality, provide only school certificates of limited value and sometimes even do not comply with safety regulations. Since the beginning of the 2000s, some local governments thus started campaigns to close these private schools but nevertheless in many cities these schools still exist. Although Chinese scholars have conducted case-study research on migrant children and their schools [...] there is a lack in studies with a nationwide scope.|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} of the reform is to merge urban and rural <b>hukou</b> systems into one in which migrant workers can have equal access to public resources as urban residents do. At {{the beginning of the}} New Millennium, Fujian, Liaoning and Shandong Provinces abolished the dual-type <b>hukou</b> system and issued identical <b>hukou</b> status to both urban and rural residents. Up to 2008, twelve provinces had abolished the dual urban-rural <b>hukou</b> system. Due to the complication of this issue, however, it is still very difficult for migrant workers to gain access to social welfare in urban areas, though with a <b>hukou</b> reform. For example, some cities such as Zhengzhou once opened public schools to rural migrant children in 2002, but these cities soon realized that there were not enough schools for the large number of migrant children. According to China Daily, Huang Ming, vice-minister of public security, addressed that the national <b>hukou</b> reform would be done by 2020. He said in the interview that the new <b>hukou</b> system would gradually extend pension, education and health care services to qualified residents, both urban and rural.|$|E
50|$|Hukou(户口)-The <b>Hukou</b> {{system in}} China {{is similar to}} the US's green card system. For {{citizens}} of the PRC, <b>Hukou</b> residency status based on cities indicates what kind of medical and education service he or she can obtain from the local Chinese government. <b>Hukou</b> residency is not determined by where people actually live, but by their parents' <b>Hukou</b> status. Fairly good education, employment opportunities and medical services are available only in big cities in China, such as Beijing, Shanghai and some second tier cities, because China is a developing country. Hukous' premiums in big cities in China should be evaluated properly when justifying the Chinese property bubble. For instance, the education and medical premium of a Beijing <b>Hukou</b> can be evaluated at RMB 600,000 ($100,000), which is popular cited on the Chinese internet. Most government and state-owned enterprises only provide interview opportunities to people with the local <b>Hukou.</b>|$|E
50|$|The unique <b>hukou</b> {{system of}} China distinguishes Chinese {{internal}} migration from migration in other developing countries.

It aimed to tie farmers to land, secure agricultural supply {{as well as to}} support industrial sector in cities after the Great Leap Forward and Great Chinese Famine which caused at least 30 millions deaths. The government allocated housing, jobs, food and other necessities based on the <b>hukou</b> system, which made it almost impossible for people without local <b>hukou</b> status to live in urban areas.|$|E

Attending high school made it more likely that they would have the opportunity to take China's college entrance exam. Succeeding at the exam and progressing to college made it very likely that the student would obtain a good job, however failure meant that they would return to the countryside, where they would revert back to rural <b>Hukou</b> and peasant status.|$|E
