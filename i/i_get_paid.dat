2500|$|In 1983, Fekner formed his own band City Squad {{composed}} of musicians and non-musicians {{as an extension}} of Queensites, a group of teenagers from Jackson Heights who assisted with the outdoor stencil work. In September, Fekner released his first rap/rock 12" [...] EP on his own Vinyl Gridlock record label. The A-side, [...] "2 4 5 7 9 11" [...] had Kwame Monroe, aka Bear 167, a South Bronx graffiti artist as the guest rapper; and the B-side featured Dave Santaniello on rock vocals on [...] "Rock Steady". [...] On the Apple II, Fekner experimented with early speech synthesis programs, Votrax and SAM-Software Automatic Mouth as vocal tracks on [...] "2 4 5 7 9 11" [...] and on his Idioblast (album) in 1984. [...] In addition to playing keyboards, electronic drums and vocals, he wrote the music and lyrics for the eight songs on the album which featured extensive sampling and tape loops of TV, radio, Native American voices, phone and airport transmissions over rock/rap/hip hop beats. Tracks on the album included Travelogue The 80s, <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Paid</b> To Clap, The Beat, The Sight Of The Child, Wheels Over Indian Trails and Rapicasso, which Fekner also created as a 6' × 12' six-panel painting. Both the painting and song pay homage to Picasso’s The Three Dancers. Fekner spray painted LCD-style letters on industrial silkscreens to portray three breakdancers, the song’s lyrics acknowledging the work, energy and spirit in breakdancing, rapping and graffiti: [...] "Watch the street, see the modern art, it's the present and future tied to his heart." ...|$|E

"I have {{a capital}} fellow, a native, who is {{carrying}} on the cattle business for me and, at Chittagong, I shall {{try and get}} hold {{of three or four}} more trustworthy fellows, to take charge of depots. I see a big future before us, and that before long. I did well with those gems of yours--they fetched 3500 pounds, which I used, besides what you handed over to me--for there was no buying up the cattle without cash and, as I generally have to wait two months after they are shipped, before <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid,</b> ready money was invaluable and, indeed, I could not have gone into the thing on anything like the same scale, {{if it had not been}} for your money. The Calcutta people would have helped me, to a certain point; but they would never have ventured upon such advances as I required. Your 5000 pounds has doubled itself since I met you at Rangoon. I calculate that our stores at the different depots are worth 4000 pounds so that, at the present moment, the firm of Pearson & Brooke have at their command a capital of 14,000 pounds." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1960 Garland was {{promoted}} from feature editor to women's {{editor of the}} magazine, but a financial recession in Chicago, declining circulation of the Courier and increasing coverage of black issues in mainstream newspapers had led to serious financial problems at the paper.

5000|$|Critics {{say that}} Motley Rice has a {{conflict}} of interest in promoting pre-packaged bankruptcies.

5000|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} for Songwriting Magazine, Parsons recalled: [...] "I think a good producer can transform a song.
