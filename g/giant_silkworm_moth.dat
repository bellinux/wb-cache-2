50|$|Lonomia obliqua (or <b>Giant</b> <b>Silkworm</b> <b>Moth,</b> a name {{also used}} {{for a wide range}} of other Saturniid moths) is a species of Saturniid moths from South America. It is famous for its larval form, rather than the adult moth, {{primarily}} because of the caterpillar's defense mechanism, urticating bristles that inject a potentially deadly venom. The caterpillar has been responsible for fatal disseminated intravascular coagulation, especially in southern Brazil. Its venom has been the subject of numerous medical studies.|$|E
40|$|When the {{epicuticle}} of a silkworm larva, Bombyx mori, was lightly abraded in {{the presence}} of live Bacillus licheniformis, Enterobacter cloacae, or bacterial cell wall components, cecropin mRNAs were detected in the underlying epithelial cells and in fat body cells remote from the abraded area. Antibacterial activity due to cecropin was detected in the matrix of the lightly abraded cuticle but not in nonabraded portions of the cuticular matrix or in the hemolymph surrounding the fat body, unless a more severe cuticular abrasion was administered. A light abrasion to a larva of the <b>giant</b> <b>silkworm</b> <b>moth,</b> Hyalophora cecropia, {{in the presence}} of E. cloacae also induced antibacterial activity in the abraded cuticle. These data illustrate that the ectodermally derived lepidopteran larval integument, when challenged by live bacteria or their cell wall components, mounts an immune response. Hence, the insect exoskeleton, which is often considered as an inert protective armor, is indeed actively participating in defense...|$|E

40|$|Male moths are {{endowed with}} odorant receptors (ORs) to detect species-specific sex pheromones with {{remarkable}} sensitivity and selectivity. We serendipitously discovered that an endogenous OR in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is highly {{sensitive to the}} sex pheromone of the <b>silkworm</b> <b>moth,</b> bombykol. Intriguingly, the fruit fly detectors are more sensitive than the receptors of the <b>silkworm</b> <b>moth,</b> although its ecological significance is unknown. By expression in the “empty neuron” system, we identified the fruit fly bombykol-sensitive OR as DmelOR 7 a (= DmOR 7 a). The profiles of this receptor in response to bombykol in the native sensilla (ab 4) or expressed in the empty neuron system (ab 3 sensilla) are indistinguishable. Both WT and transgenic flies responded with high sensitivity, in a dose-dependent manner, and with rapid signal termination. In contrast, the same empty neuron expressing the moth bombykol receptor, BmorOR 1, demonstrated low sensitivity and slow signal inactivation. When expressed in the trichoid sensilla T 1 of the fruit fly, the neuron housing BmorOR 1 responded with sensitivity {{comparable to that of}} the native trichoid sensilla in the <b>silkworm</b> <b>moth.</b> By challenging the native bombykol receptor in the fruit fly with high doses of another odorant to which the receptor responds with the highest sensitivity, we demonstrate that slow signal termination is induced by overdose of a stimulus. As opposed to the empty neuron system in the basiconic sensilla, the structural, biochemical, and/or biophysical features of the sensilla make the T 1 trichoid system of the fly a better surrogate for the moth receptor...|$|R

50|$|Bombykol is a {{pheromone}} {{released by}} the female <b>silkworm</b> <b>moth</b> to attract mates.

Minute quantities of this pheromone can be used per acre of land to confuse male insects about the location of their female partners, it can thus serve as a lure in traps to effectively remove insects without spraying crops with large amounts of pesticides.

40|$|In this paper, the pheromone-oriented {{behavior}} of moths will be demonstrated by synthesis with biosensors {{and a small}} mobile robot that is controlled by recurrent neural networks. Since antennae on a <b>silkworm</b> <b>moth</b> are very sensitive as compared to conventional arti-ficial gas sensors, {{they can be used}} as living gas sensors that detect pheromone molecules. A simple recurrent artificial neural network was used to control pheromone-tracing behavior {{in the manner of a}} living male <b>silkworm</b> <b>moth.</b> This neural network generates mothlike behavior while interacting with the environment. The turning behav-ior, in particular, is a suitable tactic for small intelligence when a robot misses pheromone molecules. Our neural network is so simple that it can be very easily used as the controlling devices for micro-robots, which have a small amount of space for intelligence. Our robot is a hybrid system that combines living organisms and artificial machines, and is therefore a new type of robot. This approach has the advantage of a real-world experiment with biosensors instead of computer simulation. The difference between the real world and the simulation conditions yields a discrepancy in results. An additional discrepancy is generated by the sensor model. Therefore, real-world experiments with living antennae may provide a fascinating interface between computer simulation and neuroethology. 1...|$|R

40|$|The insect {{olfactory}} system, {{particularly the}} peripheral sensory system for sex pheromone reception in male moths, is highly selective, but specificity determinants at the receptor level are hitherto unknown. Using the Xenopus oocyte recording system, {{we conducted a}} thorough structure-activity relationship study with the sex pheromone receptor of the <b>silkworm</b> <b>moth,</b> Bombyx mori, BmorOR 1. When co-expressed with the obligatory odorant receptor co-receptor (BmorOrco), BmorOR 1 responded in a dose-dependent fashion to both bombykol and its related aldehyde, bombykal, but {{the threshold of the}} latter was about one order of magnitude higher. Solubilizing these ligands with a pheromone-binding protein (BmorPBP 1) did not enhance selectivity. By contrast, both ligands were trapped by BmorPBP 1 leading to dramatically reduced responses. The <b>silkworm</b> <b>moth</b> pheromone receptor was highly selective towards the stereochemistry of the conjugated diene, with robust response to the natural (10 E, 12 Z) -isomer and very little or no response to the other three isomers. Shifting the conjugated diene towards the functional group or elongating the carbon chain rendered these molecules completely inactive. In contrast, an analogue shortened by two omega carbons elicited the same or slightly higher responses than bombykol. Flexibility of the saturated C 1 –C 9 moiety is important for function as addition of a double or triple bond in position 4 led to reduced responses.
