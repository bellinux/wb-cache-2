40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} and describe the operational models that are currently being used in Spain for physical distribution for the HORECA channel and to propose a selection guide that will allow the manufacturer to select the distribution model that best fits their system according to a set of operational variables. Firstly, a description of the present situation of the HORECA channel in Spain will be given. Secondly, we will outline the complete cycle order-delivery-payment in each one of the distribution models identified for this channel: auto-sales, pre-sales, direct delivery, distributor (manufacturer sales), and <b>distributor</b> (<b>distributor</b> sales). Thirdly, operational variables are defined that help the manufacturer identify which distribution model is more appropriate according to their needs and a selection guide is proposed (main contribution of this study). Finally, the conclusions of the study are presented and future developments in this area are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Methanol-to-olefins (MTO) {{coupled with}} {{transformation}} of coal or {{natural gas to}} methanol gives an interesting and promising way to produce ethylene and propylene. To investigate solid concentration in gas-solid fluidized bed for methanol-to-olefins process catalyzed by SAPO- 34, a cold model experiment system is established in this paper. The system comprises a gas distributor in a 300 mm internal diameter and 5000 mm height acrylic column, the fiber optic probe system and series of cyclones. The experiments are carried out at ambient conditions and under different superficial gas velocity ranging from 0. 3930 m/s to 0. 7860 m/s and different initial bed height ranging from 600 mm to 1200 mm. The effects of radial distance, axial distance, superficial gas velocity, initial bed height on solid concentration in the bed are discussed. The effects of distributor shape and porosity on solid concentration are also discussed. The time-averaged solid concentration profiles under different conditions are obtained. Keywords—Branched pipe <b>distributor,</b> <b>distributor</b> porosity, gas-solid fluidized bed, solid concentration. I...|$|E
40|$|A {{search in}} {{economics}} literature {{shows that there}} are numerous models {{in order to determine}} the optimum pricing and/or amount of goods between producer and customer (integrated enterprise) or producer, distributor and customer (two-stage supply chain), as the case may be. In reality, however, one will most likely find a multi-stage supply chain (producer, several distributor and customer). Of course, in a multi-level supply chain the focus can be restricted to focus on the bilateral relationship of the different stages (i. e. producer – <b>distributor,</b> <b>distributor</b> – <b>distributor,</b> <b>distributor</b> – customer). Yet, most of such analyses neglect the impact the pricing and/or the amount of goods may have on the entire supply chain where a multi-level supply chain is the subject matter. Furthermore, almost none of the existing analyses take into account the bargaining power of each single stage even though the bargaining power reflects the position of one stage within the supply chain to improve its position vis-à-vis any other stage and, thus, is important for the question of pricing and/or amount of goods within the supply chain. For integrated enterprises a number of models exist that explore a deterministic or stochastic market demand. For two-stage supply chains mostly a deterministic market demand presumed. The prevailing applied demand function is the linear demand function. The present work attempts to illuminate a number of problematic configurations of supply chains with varying lengths (including an integrated enterprise) by using successively developed models and to analyse how they impact on the pricing and the amount of goods within the supply chain. For this purpose the different models are examined taking into consideration a deterministic and a stochastic market demand and, in each case, based on a linear as well as a multiplicative demand function. In addition, for multi-stage supply chains a distinction was drawn between co-operation and non-cooperation. In order to furthermore include the so far (mostly) neglected bargaining power of each single stage of the supply chain into the analysis a new criterion was introduced, the minimum return. Overall, this dissertation examines one-stage, two-stage, three-stage and multi-stage supply chains and presents an algebraic solution and/or an exemplary illustration for every single configuration analysed therein...|$|E

Research method used in this research is qualitative descriptive method of phenomenologist by taking research subject of the Tianshi distributors in town Malang which amounts to 5 man who have been up to standard as distributor, which has known calculation bonus and has mastered product, has mastered mode of action of business multi-level marketing Tianshi, and has elaborated marketing business of network fully. Data collecting technique in this research is observation, interview and documentation. As for data analytical technique applied is reduction of data, presentation and conclusion withdrawal. Theory applied in this research is the social network theory and the social transfer theory. Result of research concludes that in multi-level marketing Tianshi, form of the social network pattern consisted of producer, independent distributor and ends in consumer. In this case distributor takes important role in marketing product and develops activity network.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates how {{the hospitality}} sector in Switzerland has embraced {{the new world}} of (online) distribution.

Data is gathered through an online survey among Swiss hotels resulting in 196 usable questionnaires. Findings show that direct booking channels remain the dominant sales tools in Switzerland, although their proportion in the distribution mix has been decreasing steadily in the last years. The Internet Distribution System channel reaches 16. 4 % and thus is the channel with the highest growth rate in 2011. A cluster analysis on multi-channel distribution strategies results in four groups: multi-channel <b>distributors,</b> electronic <b>distributors,</b> real time <b>distributors,</b> and traditional <b>distributors.</b> Further, it is shown {{that more than half of}} the hotels manage rates and availabilities manually and only one out of four hotels has implemented a channel manager able to manage different channels...|$|R

40|$|The <b>distributor</b> plate {{effects on}} the {{hydrodynamic}} characteristics of turbulent fluidized beds are investigated by obtaining measurements of pressure and radial voidage profiles in a column diameter of 0. 29 m with Group A particles using bubble bubble-cap or perforated plate <b>distributors.</b> <b>Distributor</b> pressure drop measurements between the two <b>distributors</b> are compared with the theoretical estimations while {{the influence of the}} mass inventory is studied. Comparison is established for the transition velocity from bubbling to turbulent regime, Uc, deduced from the pressure fluctuations in the bed using gauge pressure measurements. The effect of the <b>distributor</b> on the flow structure near the bottom region of the bed is studied using differential and gauge pressure transducers located at different axial positions along the bed. The radial voidage profile in the bed is also measured using optical fiber probes, which provide local measurements of the voidage at different heights above the <b>distributor.</b> The <b>distributor</b> plate has a significant effect on the bed hydrodynamics. Owing to the jetting caused by the perforated plate <b>distributor,</b> earlier onset of the transition to the turbulent fluidization flow regime was observed. Moreover, increased carry over for the perforated plate compared with the bubble caps has been confirmed. The results have highlighted the influence of the <b>distributor</b> plate on the fluidized bed hydrodynamics which has consequences in terms of comparing experimental and simulation results between different <b>distributor</b> platesPublicad...|$|R

Shurlock responded later that month, re-affirming the denial on the basis of the light treatment of the subject matter. Following this denial Schwartz dropped his pursuit of the seal.|$|R
