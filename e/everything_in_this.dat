25|$|This {{subsection}} {{deals with}} the notion of jets of local sections of a vector bundle. Almost <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> section generalizes mutatis mutandis to the case of local sections of a fibre bundle, a Banach bundle over a Banach manifold, a fibered manifold, or quasi-coherent sheaves over schemes. Furthermore, these examples of possible generalizations are certainly not exhaustive.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian {{carnivores}} {{can compete}} {{for some of}} the same prey as golden eagles but can also themselves become prey, the main prey family of carnivores being the canids (dog family). 12 species of canid are known to have been hunted by golden eagles and they collectively make up about 2.8% of the diet from all surveyed golden eagle nests. For the most part, foxes are the preferred prey, usually as juveniles though foxes of any age or condition, including adult male red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) heavier than the eagles themselves, may be hunted. Across much of both species' ranges, red fox co-exist with golden eagles and eagles hunt them in small numbers. Red foxes make up 13.5% of nest remains in Sicily and 5.9% in the Republic of Macedonia. In a nest in Mongolia, Corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) were surprisingly the main prey species, making up 38% of sampled remains. Kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), swift fox (Vulpes velox), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and island fox (Urocyon littoralis) are readily predated in North America. The other family of carnivores that turns up with some regularity in the golden eagle's diet are the mustelids, at about 2.3% of the diet. <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> diverse family from least weasels (Mustela nivalis), the smallest mammalian carnivore, to wolverines (Gulo gulo), the largest terrestrial mustelid, have turned up as prey in golden eagle nests. The members of this family which are most regularly hunted are probably the martens, such as the American marten (Martes americanus), pine marten (Martes martes) and beech marten. The young of larger species are also occasionally hunted in Scotland and Ireland, including Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badgers (Meles meles). Similarly, amongst wolverines, “young and inexperienced” specimens are usually targeted as prey by golden eagles. In North America, full-grown large mustelids, including American badgers (Taxidea taxus) and fishers (Martes pennanti), have also turned up as prey. The largest percentage of mustelids was 13.2% in a nest in central Alaska. Mustelids, mainly martens, turned up in large numbers in the French Alps where they made up 10.1% of nest remains.|$|E

500|$|A Man of the People was {{published}} in 1966. A bleak satire set in an unnamed African state which has just attained independence, the novel follows a teacher named Odili Samalu {{from the village of}} Anata who opposes a corrupt Minister of Culture named Nanga for his Parliament seat. Upon reading an advance copy of the novel, Achebe's friend John Pepper Clark declared: [...] "Chinua, I know you are a prophet. <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> book has happened except a military coup!" ...|$|E

He proclaimed that, [...] "We've lost <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> thing, my wife and I. It's devastating." [...] In November 1989, Keating was subpoenaed to testify before the House Banking Committee, but refused to answer questions, invoking his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. Also in November, his Phoenician Resort was seized by the FBI; under their operation it became known as [...] "Club Fed" [...] before later being sold to a Kuwaiti group.

500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be with my friends. Out of <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E

2500|$|The {{architectural}} {{history of}} the temple has been widely analysed. While the Mon architecture of Burmese origin is noted, strong influence of Indian Architecture from many temples of Bengal and Orissa is very clear. In this regard archaeologist Duroiselle has made these observations: [...] "There {{can be no doubt}} that the architects who planned and built the Ananda were Indians. <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> temple from Shikara to basement, as well as the numerous stone sculptures found in its corridors, and the terra-cotta plaques adorning its basement and terraces, bear the indubitable [...] stamp of Indian genius and craftsmanship...In this sense we may take it, therefore, that the Ananda, though built in the Burmese capital, is an Indian temple." [...] It is also said that the architecture of this temple greatly represents the Ananta cave temple in Udayagiri hills in Orissa, India.|$|E

2500|$|Sunday is a holy day of {{obligation}} for Catholics that {{requires them to}} attend Mass. At Mass, Catholics believe that they respond to Jesus' command at the Last Supper to [...] "do this in remembrance of me." [...] In 1570 at the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V codified a standard book for the celebration of Mass for the Roman Rite. <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> decree pertained to the priest celebrant and his action at the altar. The participation of the people was devotional rather than liturgical. The Mass text was in Latin, as this was the universal language of the church. This liturgy was called the Tridentine Mass and endured universally until the Second Vatican Council approved the Mass of Paul VI, {{also known as the}} New Order of the Mass (...) , which may be celebrated either in the vernacular or in Latin.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} introspective themes which critics {{considered}} to be uncommon in Insane Clown Posse's music; however, Violent J states that these themes are important in the duo's work, and reveal their depth. In response to accusations that the group has changed its style and gone soft, Violent J calls the song [...] "classic ICP," [...] noting that the group has always included one or two deep and meaningful songs on every album, {{and that this is}} just the first time that they've created a video for one of those songs. Several reviewers have suggested that the song contains an anti-science message. Violent J disputes the claim, asserting that [...] "the [...] concept is about appreciating <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world. It's not about God; [...] religion; [...] science." [...] Joseph Laycock of Religion Dispatches suggests that rather than rejecting science, the song disapproves of disenchantment.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Lucas made {{a further}} {{suggestion}} {{that there would}} be a fifth film, revealing an idea [...] "to make Shia LaBeouf the lead character next time and have Harrison Ford come back like Sean Connery did in the last movie." [...] At the time Last Crusade was filmed, Connery was still only 58. Lucas also said that age need not be a factor, as Ford was [...] "65 and did <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> movie. The old chemistry is there, and it's not like he's an old man. He's incredibly agile; he looks even better than he did 20 years ago, if you ask me." [...] In August 2008, Lucas was researching potential plot devices, and stated Spielberg was open to the idea of the fifth film. He also changed his mind about continuing the series with a spin-off, joking [...] "Indiana Jones is Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones. If it was Mutt Williams it would be Mutt Williams and the Search for Elvis or something." [...] Two months later, Ford stated that he would not return if the fifth film was an animated film like , because [...] "I'd hate to see it reduced in any way from the movies that we have done and the way we have done them." [...] He also called Lucas' concept for the fifth film [...] "crazy but great".|$|E
