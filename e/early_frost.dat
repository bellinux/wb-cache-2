5|$|Although {{societal}} {{awareness of}} AIDS had developed {{at a slower}} pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An <b>Early</b> <b>Frost</b> respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.|$|E

Vázquez de Ayllón and about 450 of the original 600colonists subsequently {{died as a result}} of desertion, disease, and an <b>early</b> <b>frost.</b> Lacking effective leadership, the new settlement lasted for only two months; the survivors abandoned the colony and fled to Hispaniola, leaving their horses behind.|$|E

25|$|By the 1850s the fur trade had {{expanded}} across the Great Plains, and the bison robe trade began to decline. The Métis {{had a role}} in the depopulation of the bison. Like the Indians, the Métis had a preference for cows, which meant that the bison had trouble maintaining their herds. In addition, flood, drought, <b>early</b> <b>frost,</b> and the environmental impact of settlement posed further threats to the herds. Traders, trappers, and hunters all depended on the bison to sustain their way of life. The Métis tried to maintain their lifestyle through a variety of means. For instance, they often used two wheel carts made from local materials, which meant that they were more mobile than Indians and thus were not dependent on following seasonal hunting patterns.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} persimmon fruit needs frost to ripen and soften, called bletting. Some, such as the early-ripening varieties [...] "pieper" [...] and [...] "NC21"(also known as [...] "supersweet"), easily lose astringency and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touch—these are then very sweet, even in the British climate. On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited [...] "yates", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate). Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen. Only completely ripe and soft fruit can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception). The {{same goes for the}} Oriental persimmon (Diospyros kaki), where <b>early</b> <b>frost</b> can severely damage a fruit crop.|$|E

The song became popular with both the communist authorities and the people, becoming an anthem of the Yugoslav youth. After just few months of cooperation, Verica Todorović and Bora Đorđević left the band (Đorđević forming his famous hard rock band Riblja Čorba), so Biljana Krstić and Balašević recorded Rani Mraz's first album Mojoj mami umesto maturske slike u izlogu (To my Mom instead of Prom Photo in the Shop-Window) {{with the help of}} studio musicians.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and <b>earlier</b> <b>frosts.</b> In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowering}} {{habit of}} Japanese wisteria {{is perhaps the}} most spectacular of the Wisteria family.

The early flowering time of Japanese wisteria can cause problems in temperate climates, where <b>early</b> <b>frosts</b> can destroy the coming years' flowers.
