5|$|The modern {{method for}} {{producing}} <b>glass</b> wool is {{the invention of}} Games Slayter working at the Owens-Illinois <b>Glass</b> Co. (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make <b>glass</b> wool in 1933. The first commercial production of <b>glass</b> fiber was in 1936. In 1938 Owens-Illinois <b>Glass</b> Company and Corning <b>Glass</b> Works joined to form the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation. When the two companies joined to produce and promote <b>glass</b> fiber, they introduced continuous filament <b>glass</b> fibers. Owens-Corning is still the major glass-fiber producer in the market today.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} types of <b>glass</b> fiber used in {{fiberglass}} is E-glass, which is alumino-borosilicate <b>glass</b> {{with less than}} 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of <b>glass</b> used are A-glass (Alkali-lime <b>glass</b> {{with little or no}} boron oxide), E-CR-glass (Electrical/Chemical Resistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), C-glass (alkali-lime <b>glass</b> with high boron oxide content, used for <b>glass</b> staple fibers and insulation), D-glass (borosilicate <b>glass,</b> named for its low Dielectric constant), R-glass (alumino silicate <b>glass</b> without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement), and S-glass (alumino silicate <b>glass</b> without CaO but with high MgO content with high tensile strength).|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the <b>glass</b> was melted using local raw materials, {{including}} {{sand from}} neighbouring villages, sodium carbonate (from the Dead Sea), and coloring additives such as iron oxide and copper oxide. Nowadays, recycled <b>glass</b> {{is often used}} instead. <b>Glass</b> production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets {{of which have been}} preserved and passed down by a few Palestinian families who operate the <b>glass</b> factories located just outside the city. The products made include <b>glass</b> jewellery, such as beads, bracelets, and rings, as well as stained <b>glass</b> windows, and <b>glass</b> lamps. However, due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, <b>glass</b> production has suffered a decline.|$|E

5|$|After {{the others}} leave, Fitzgerald {{attempts}} to smother <b>Glass</b> but is discovered by Hawk. Fitzgerald stabs {{him to death}} as <b>Glass</b> watches helplessly.

When Fitzgerald and Bridger meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells him that <b>Glass</b> died and Hawk vanished.|$|E
5|$|After the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes {{and kills}} Henry. <b>Glass</b> uses Henry's corpse {{on his horse}} as a decoy and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm.

5|$|Because gallium wets <b>glass</b> or porcelain, gallium {{can be used}} {{to create}} {{brilliant}} mirrors. When the wetting action of gallium-alloys is not desired (as in Galinstan <b>glass</b> thermometers), the <b>glass</b> must be protected with a transparent layer of gallium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>glass</b> is very brittle in its solid state, it {{is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of <b>glass</b> {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. <b>Glass</b> that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the <b>glass</b> transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E

25|$|Glassware {{was also}} {{replenished}} at this time. Mrs. Lincoln ordered 24 plain cut goblets (probably for family dining) in November 1864 and January 1865 from the D.C. firm of Webb & Beveridge. The cost was just $30. On January 30, 1865, she also ordered glassware to replace broken and stolen glassware for public events from John Kerr's China Hall, {{at a cost}} of $612.50. This service included four dozen each of goblets, champagne <b>glasses,</b> claret <b>glasses,</b> burgundy <b>glasses,</b> madeira <b>glasses,</b> sherry <b>glasses,</b> hock <b>glasses,</b> and cordial <b>glasses.</b> The bases appear to have been plain (unlike the 1861 order), except for the madeira glasses—which were more richly carved and featured the rays on the foot. The hock <b>glasses</b> were ruby (not green) in color, and the madeira <b>glasses</b> may also have been red colored. She ordered another four decanters on March 25.|$|R

5|$|Cobalt {{has been}} used to color <b>glass</b> since the Bronze Age. The {{excavation}} of the Uluburun shipwreck yielded an ingot of blue <b>glass,</b> cast during the 14th century BC.

The source of that cobalt is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in <b>glass</b> for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead <b>glass</b> is used for this purpose, but this type of <b>glass</b> shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the <b>glass.</b> Therefore, the front panel is made from a different <b>glass</b> mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the <b>glass</b> mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E

5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by <b>glass</b> fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The <b>glass</b> fibers used in the material are made of various types of <b>glass</b> depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} <b>glass,</b> or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make <b>glass</b> fibers.|$|E
