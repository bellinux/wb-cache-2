5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and the country's coastal defences {{received}} little attention. The Gorges family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward Gorges taking up the post in 1610, but the castle was neglected. In 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent, as only <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the castle's twenty-seven guns were functional, and the fort had no ammunition or powder for them. The government replaced all the brass ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.|$|E

At the time of her trial, there were reports of <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> their children dying young while they were living away from County Durham. None of these deaths are registered, but this was not compulsory until 1874. The only birth recorded was that of their daughter, Margaret Jane, born at St Germans in 1856.|$|E
25|$|There are varying {{texts in}} the Sephardic version; in some traditions the hymn {{comprises}} six stanzas of two verses each, but the fourth (which is but an amplification of the third) is omitted by the Ashkenazim, in others it has 15 lines, in yet others it has 16 lines. For so widespread and beloved a hymn, the traditional tunes are singularly few. Only <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> them {{deserve to be}} called traditional.

25|$|In 1851, Day & Son was {{commissioned}} by Matthew Digby Wyatt, known for his work as an architect, to produce the book The Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century, an imposing imperial folio in two volumes which illustrates a selection of items from the Great Exhibition of 1851. There are 160 chromolithographed plates. Wyatt himself stated that he had used 'the best means of graphic representation available'. Wyatt proudly {{drew attention to the}} previously unsurpassed scale and speed of production of the book. But what brought the entire project into being was the desire of Day & Son to demonstrate the potential of chromolithography. The firm was particularly associated with the process. However, as Wyatt himself explained, the proposal was not even formalized until after the Great Exhibition had opened. Such a grandiose production must have called into play a significant proportion of Day's resources, including skilled craftsmen and lithographers such as Francis Bedford, J.A. Vinter and Henry Rafter, as well as significant capital, and management. According to Wyatt, <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> Day's staff were constantly engaged upon the business details of the operation alone.|$|E
500|$|Dahl {{said that}} the {{original}} novel was [...] "Ian Fleming's worst book, with no plot in it which would even make a movie", and compared it to a travelogue, stating {{that he had to}} create a new plot [...] " [...] I could retain only <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the original story's ideas." [...] On creating the plot, Dahl said he [...] "didn't know what the hell Bond was going to do" [...] despite having to deliver the first draft in six weeks, and decided to do a basic plot similar to Dr. No. Dahl was given a free rein on his script, except for the character of Bond and [...] "the girl formula", involving three women for Bond to seduce— an ally and a henchwoman who both get killed, and the main Bond girl. While the third involved a character from the book, Kissy Suzuki, Dahl had to create Aki and Helga Brandt to fulfil the rest.|$|E
500|$|At 14:00 on August 17, a UN {{air strike}} took place, attacking the hill with napalm, bombs, rockets and machine guns. At {{this time a}} North Korean officer said that American {{soldiers}} were closing in on them and they could not continue to hold the prisoners. The officer ordered the men shot, and the North Koreans then fired into the kneeling Americans as they rested in the gully. One of the North Koreans who was later captured said {{all or most of}} the 50 guards participated, but some of the survivors said only a group of 14 North Korean guards, directed by their non-commissioned officers, fired into them with PPSh-41 [...] "burp guns". Before all the North Korean soldiers left the area, some returned to the ravine and shot survivors of the initial massacre. Only <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the men in this group survived, by hiding under the dead bodies of others. In all, 41 American prisoners were killed in the ravine. The bulk of these men—26 in all—were from the mortar platoon but prisoners captured elsewhere were also among them.|$|E

The CMJ New Music Report gave Spit {{a positive}} review: [...] "the teenage babes in Ontario, Canada's Kittie will scratch and claw their way into the dark recesses of your hearts thanks to their debut, the smashing 'n' stomping Spit". The Washington Post criticized the album: [...] "All four members of this Canadian metal-punk band are women, which is still a novel (though certainly not unique) lineup for a headbanging ensemble. Too bad that's virtually the quartet's only distinguishing feature". The review concluded, [...] "After <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> these pounding rockers, Kittie becomes a bore." [...] Exclaim! also criticized the album: [...] "Guidance Counsellor's advice: pull the plug and stay in school". NME gave the album a four-out-of-ten rating: [...] "Like kindred spirits System of a Down, Kittie want to give you the impression that they're just too tasty to fuk wit, too unhinged to view as normal folk, too pierced for the mainstream."

500|$|Park's plan worked. The Biggin Hill squadrons, 72 and 92 Squadrons {{made contact}} with the enemy over Canterbury. Arriving at , they found {{themselves}} [...] above the top covering German fighters (JG 53). Beyond Canterbury, they could also see KG 76 and JG 3 over Ashford. At 11:50, they attacked out of the sun. Taken by surprise, <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> I./JG 53s Bf 109s were hit by the Spitfires. Spitfires of 92 Squadron tried to charge through the fighter screen {{to get at the}} Dorniers but were blocked. Soon afterwards, No. 603 Squadron joined the fight. Park had broken up the top level escort. Some 23 Hurricanes of Nos. 253 and 501 Squadrons arrived at the same height as the bombers and delivered a head-on attack. Lindmayr's crews were experienced and the formation held its nerve and remained intact. JG 3 in turn attacked the Hurricanes dispatching two from 501 Squadron. Northolt's No. 229 and No. 303 Squadron RAF were also arriving and engaged JG 52. One of 239 Squadrons Hurricanes and a JG 52 Bf 109 collided. The bombers ploughed on and reached Lewisham. However, the formation was now isolated. The escorts were embroiled in dogfights all over Kent and half the RAF fighters were yet to engage. JG 53 were further engaged by several squadrons; Nos. 1, No. 46, No. 249 and No. 605 Squadron RAF. No. 605, led by Archie McKellar broke away and delivered a 12-fighter attack scoring some hits on the bombers. JG 27 meanwhile suffered two casualties, one possibly against No. 19 Squadron. It claimed only one British fighter that day.|$|E
