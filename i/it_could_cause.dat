5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company were {{a company}} {{responsible}} for providing potable water to the inhabitants of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. In 1976, they purchased a borehole outside Sawston to deal with rising demand. In 1980, a European Directive was issued requiring nations of the European Community to establish standards {{on the presence of}} perchloroethene (PCE) in water, which the United Kingdom did in 1982. It was found that the Sawston borehole was contaminated with PCE that had originated in a tannery owned by Eastern Counties Leather. Prior to 1980, there was no knowledge that PCE should be avoided or that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> harm, but the Cambridge Water Company brought a case against Eastern Counties Leather anyway.|$|E

5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E

25|$|During the 18th century, opium {{was found}} to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its {{sedative}} and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia. However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> anger or depression, and due to the drug's euphoric effects, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because they would get used to being high.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitutionality}} of the self-service bans has been disputed. The Oregon statute was brought into court in 1989 by ARCO, and the New Jersey statute was challenged in court in 1950 by a small independent service station, Rein Motors. Both challenges failed. New Jersey governor Jon Corzine sought to lift the ban on self-service for New Jersey. He asserted {{that it would be}} able to lower gas prices, but some New Jerseyans argued that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> drawbacks, especially unemployment.|$|E

25|$|Mannitol is {{an alcohol}} {{derivative}} of simple sugar mannose, {{and its use}} has been investigated since 1962. With a σ=.9, molecular weight of 182 daltons, half life of 2–4 hours, ease of preparation, chemical stability and free radical scavenging properties, it's been regarded as the principal osmotic agent for clinical use. However, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> diuresis, renal failure, hyperkalemia and hemolysis. If mannitol is administered, the dosage used is mannitol 20% solution of 1-1.5 g/kg, followed by 0.25-1 g/kg doses as needed every 1 to 6 hours depending on the ICP.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of 18 July 2013 at 8:20a.m. (2320 GMT) small amounts of steam escaped from the reactor building. Video images made by a subcontractor, filming the {{destroyed}} building and preparing to remove rubble from the place, showed some vapors rising, but it was unclear where it came from. Although there was {{no change in the}} afternoon, TEPCO said that radiation levels did not change, and the reactor was still cooled. According to TEPCO rain could have found its way to the primary containment of the reactor, and because this vessel was still hot, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> the steam.|$|E
25|$|Periphery {{countries}} are continuously exploited by countries {{due to the}} exportation of surpluses of raw goods to the more technologically industrialized core countries for manufacturing and distribution. Recently some of the manufacturing has been moved to periphery countries {{but it is still}} controlled and owned by the core countries. There are, however, ways in which periphery countries can rise from their poor status and become semi-periphery countries or even core countries. It is crucial for the core countries to keep exploiting the natural resources of the periphery countries and to keep the governments semi-stable or else <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> economic unrest for the core countries as a whole.|$|E

50|$|After To Have and Have Not, Bacall {{was seen}} {{opposite}} Charles Boyer in Confidential Agent (1945), which was poorly received by critics. By her own estimation, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have <b>caused</b> considerable damage to her career, had her {{performance as the}} mysterious, acid-tongued Vivian Rutledge in Hawks's film noir The Big Sleep (1946), co-starring Bogart, not provided a quick career resurgence.|$|R
25|$|If the {{infection}} in the feet and toes entered the bones, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; although, this {{was seen as a}} benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, {{a report}} on urban {{transport}} planning policy, Traffic in Towns, was produced for the UK Department of Transport by a team headed by the architect, civil engineer and planner Colin Buchanan. While it advocated the construction and reorganisation of towns to accommodate the motor car and lorry, it stressed that this {{would have to be}} balanced with restrictions, in accordance with local needs. It highlighted the urgency of the problem of dealing with the expected massive growth in road traffic, the damage <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> to our towns and cities if unplanned, the eventual need for demand management but with implications of restricting the mass of the population from doing something they didn't see as wrong, and of the inevitable need for a change in policy as the social costs increased.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, Commonwealth {{soldiers}} billeted in Stevenage {{are reported}} to have stolen the bones. It was rumoured that the soldiers could be persuaded to part with the bones for a fee but supplemented the supply {{with the help of}} a local butcher. A letter to a local newspaper revealed that in 1917, a resident went into the barn to look in the coffin and found horse bones. A nearby horse-riding school explained that copies of the will were still being sold and, if word got around that the coffin was empty, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> a drop in revenue. The coffin was temporarily removed in 1999 when the barn was refurbished. Some reports say that the coffin was found to be empty, though others state that the Letchworth undertakers who restored the coffin buried any remains. Trigg's plan had ultimately failed.|$|E
