5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
500|$|On {{the eve of}} the coronation, Edward progressed {{on horseback}} from the Tower to the Palace of Westminster through thronging crowds and pageants, many based on the pageants for a {{previous}} boy king, Henry VI. <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> a Spanish tightrope walker who [...] "tumbled and played many pretty toys" [...] outside St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
500|$|Seann William Scott, {{famous for}} portraying Steve Stifler in the 1999 film American Pie, {{was hired as}} class clown Billy Hitchcock. [...] Scott admired the film, and felt that [...] "it's [...] dark and eerie as any Twilight Zone". <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> his role, saying that [...] " [...] is lacking some social skills, he doesn't have quite a few friends, and he's like the tag-along". Scott was {{surprised}} when in the script his character was written as fat. The writers eventually changed it for Scott.|$|E

500|$|The Adhyatma Ramayana tells that Kabandha (the name Vishvavasu is not used) was a Gandharva chief, who {{was blessed}} by Brahma with immortality. He was [...] "drunk with the wine {{of youth and}} beauty" [...] and used to roam the {{universe}} enchanting beautiful maidens. Once, <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> the sage Ashtavakra ("one who was eight deformities"), who cursed {{him to become a}} Rakshasa, though the sage assured him that Rama would free him of the curse. Still arrogant, Kabandha once chased Indra. The rest of the Indra episode mirrors the Ramayana telling.|$|E
500|$|Cope {{took his}} sinking {{fortunes}} in stride. In writing to Osborn about the articles, <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> the outcome, saying, [...] "It will now rest largely with you {{whether or not}} I am {{supposed to be a}} liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerus." [...] Cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of [...] "Cope" [...] and [...] "hater", Anisonchus cophater. Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers—his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier.|$|E
500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

2500|$|As Queen Elizabeth was displeased by {{the fall}} of the Ruthven Regime, Walsingham was sent as {{ambassador}} to Scotland in September 1583. He spoke to James VI at Perth, and was convinced that Queen Mary's influence was dominant in Scotland, and working to the young king's confusion. He wrote to Elizabeth that Mary, [...] "though she cannot live many years" [...] would see his overthrow. James VI had not enjoyed the Ruthven government. Walsingham found the King unable to take his complaints seriously, and <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> Walsingham, [...] "falling into a distemperture", telling him that he was an [...] "absolute King" [...] and would order his subjects as he would [...] "best lyke himself." [...] James was 17, Mary was 40.|$|E
2500|$|McCarver {{was also}} known to make gaffes {{from time to}} time. One of his more amusing miscues came during the 1992 National League Championship Series when he {{repeatedly}} referred to Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Tim Wakefield as [...] "Bill Wakefield." [...] He finally explained that Bill Wakefield {{was one of his}} old minor-league teammates, and <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> himself because [...] "I forgot my own name!" [...] The year prior, during Game 6 of the World Series, McCarver's broadcast colleague, Jack Buck talked about Atlanta third baseman Terry Pendleton, who hit [...]367 in the series. Buck said, [...] "TP. That's what his teammates call him." [...] A few seconds later, McCarver rather oddly added, [...] "TP. An appropriate name for someone who plays on the Braves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schulmerich {{was sent}} to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League where he spent one season. Schulmerich {{returned}} to the Los Angeles Angels for the 1936 season and played in 142 games, batting [...]301 with 14 HRs and 85 RBIs. In 1937, he was traded to the Portland Beavers of the PCL upon his request. He played in only 19 games that year, hitting [...]241. Schulmerich was let go early in the season after an error cost the team a game, an error <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> during the play. He then signed with the Lewiston Broncos in Idaho of the Western International League as a player-manager, winning the triple crown on the field, but doing poorly as manager. After the 1937 season, the team relocated to Bellingham, Washington, and Schulmerich became just a player. Halfway through the 1938 season he was traded to Spokane in the same league where he also spent 45 games of the 1939 season. The rest of the season was spent playing in the Pioneer League for the Twin Falls Cowboys. The next year, he retired, though he did play in several games in 1941, again for Twin Falls.|$|E

2500|$|Atto was {{captured}} by Task Force Ranger on September 21, 1993, from a location near Digfer Hospital. The Rangers had made an earlier attempt at Atto's capture, but missed him by seconds. In a speech at a church in Daytona, in January 2002, William Boykin, responsible for the operation, recounted, [...] "There {{was a man in}} Mogadishu named Osman Atto... He went on CNN and <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> us, and he said, 'They'll never get me because Allah will protect me.'" [...] The arrest was later portrayed in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down. In an interview with the BBC, Atto indicated that many aspects of the movie are factually incorrect. He took exception with the ostentatious character chosen to portray him; Atto does not look like the actor who portrayed him, smoke cigars, or wear earrings, facts which were later confirmed by SEAL Team Six sniper Howard E. Wasdin in his 2012 memoirs. Wasdin also indicated that while the character in the movie ridiculed his captors, Atto in reality seemed concerned that Wasdin and his men had been sent to kill rather than apprehend him. Atto additionally stated that he was not consulted about the project or approached for permission, and that the film sequence re-enacting his arrest contained several inaccuracies: [...] "First of all when I was caught on 21 September, I was only travelling with one Fiat 124, not three vehicles as it shows in the film... And when the helicopter attacked, people were hurt, people were killed... The car we were travelling in, and I have got proof, it was hit at least 50 times. And my colleague Ahmed Ali was injured on both legs... I think it was not right, the way they portrayed both the individual and the action. It was not right.|$|E
