5|$|The DRR's Primeval World <b>Diorama</b> was put {{on display}} later in 1966, {{adjacent}} to the Grand Canyon <b>Diorama.</b> One year prior, the DRR's track on {{the eastern edge of}} its route had been expanded outwards to accommodate the diorama's construction. The Audio-Animatronic dinosaurs from Ford's Magic Skyway, one of the attractions created by Disney for the 1964 New York World's Fair, were incorporated into the <b>diorama,</b> including a Tyrannosaurus confronting a Stegosaurus. The <b>diorama</b> {{was one of the last}} additions made to the DRR, and Disneyland in general, before the death of Walt Disney on December 15, 1966.|$|E
5|$|When {{the journey}} continues, the train goes across another access road and enters a tunnel {{containing}} the Grand Canyon <b>Diorama</b> {{followed by the}} Primeval World <b>Diorama.</b> As the train runs alongside the Grand Canyon <b>Diorama,</b> the main theme from On the Trail, the third movement of Ferde Grofé's Grand Canyon Suite, can be heard; and as the train runs alongside the Primeval World <b>Diorama,</b> music from the 1961 film Mysterious Island can be heard. Shortly after leaving the tunnel, the train arrives back at Main Street, U.S.A. Station, completing what the park refers to as The Grand Circle Tour.|$|E

Two {{floors of the}} current Minneapolis {{location}} display <b>dioramas</b> that feature Minnesota's habitats, along with the birds, animals, plants and insects that populate them. Meet moose, elk, bear, beavers, cranes, fish, and more. The <b>dioramas</b> serve {{as an opportunity to}} learn animal facts, observe animal behavior, and find out how species survive. Constructed between 1920 and the late 1940s, the Bell Museum's <b>dioramas</b> illustrate what Minnesota was like before the ax and plow. Visitors can discover what has changed, and what remains the same.Renowned artist, Francis Lee Jaques completed backgrounds on nine of the large <b>dioramas</b> and ten of the medium-size <b>dioramas.</b> Jacques grew up in Minnesota where he pursued his passion for painting and illustrating nature.

25|$|In 1962, artists Dwight Franklin and Robert N.S. Whitelaw {{completed}} 12 <b>dioramas</b> (worth $75,000) to {{be placed}} in the assembly hall and which depicted key incidents in Washington's life. These <b>dioramas</b> {{had been part of the}} original decorative scheme for the memorial, with eight <b>dioramas</b> (two for each corner) {{to be placed}} in the assembly hall. Due to a dispute over the subject matter, 12 rather than eight <b>dioramas</b> were ordered. Air conditioning was added to the North Lodge (form the Cryptic Lodge) Room in 1963.|$|R
5|$|In {{the rear}} of the main {{entrance}} hall is a series of six dioramas illustrating communications and the press throughout Indonesian history.

50|$|The film follows {{how these}} {{intricate}} <b>dioramas</b> are still used to train homicide detectives, {{despite all the}} technological advances in death investigation. The <b>dioramas</b> also provided inspiration for The Miniature Killer, a recurring villain in season seven of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. The villain's modus operandi is to leave behind accurate <b>dioramas</b> of her crime scenes.|$|R

25|$|Although Chapman was not {{the first}} to create museum <b>dioramas,</b> he was {{responsible}} for many of the innovations that would separate and eventually define the <b>dioramas</b> in the American Museum. Whereas other <b>dioramas</b> of the time period typically featured generic scenery, Chapman was the first to bring artists into the field with him in the hopes of capturing a specific location at a specific time. In contrast to the dramatic scenes later created by Carl Akeley for the African Hall, Chapman wanted his <b>dioramas</b> to evoke a scientific realism, ultimately serving as a historical record of habitats and species facing a high probability of extinction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dioramas</b> {{can vary}} {{in the amount}} of detail they contain. Early coin-operated <b>dioramas</b> {{consisted}} of simple meter gauges (such as the Mills 'Owl Lifter'), whereas other fortune-telling machines attempted to bridge the uncanny valley gap. Probably the most creative though were the <b>dioramas</b> that utilized pins nailed onto a wooden board and sling-shot ball mechanics to give players a feeling of control but also a degree of unpredictability in the outcome (unlike mechanical testers, which had largely predictable outcomes). The most popular of these were Pickwick, Parlor Table Bagatelle, Log Cabin, and Clown Catchers. <b>Dioramas</b> are {{not to be confused with}} motion simulators, which also became popular around the same time.|$|R
5|$|Silverchair {{returned}} to recording in June 2001, and released <b>Diorama</b> in 2002.

5|$|After the {{war ended}} with the defeat of Japan in 1945, the ban on nonessential {{construction}} was lifted, and the state restarted construction and restoration activities in Constitution Square in 1948. These activities included restoring and re-roofing the buildings, adding furniture to the buildings, constructing walkways, erecting signs, and adding landscaping to the park. The restorations were completed in 1955. From 1960 to 1968, the state added a fence around the site, installed a new lighting and <b>diorama</b> system, constructed {{a replica of the}} square's original pillory, and renovated several buildings, including an early 19th-century brick schoolhouse which became the caretaker's residence.|$|E
50|$|All events {{depicted}} in the <b>diorama's</b> showcases took place in Yogyakarta and its surrounding region.

5|$|In {{addition}} to Cimarron scenery, RKO continued {{to create a}} vast array of diverse sets for its ever-expanding movie ranch that included a New York avenue, brownstone street, English row houses, slum district, small town square, residential neighborhood, three working train depots, mansion estate, New England farm, Western ranch, a mammoth medieval City of Paris, European marketplace, Russian village, Yukon mining camp, ocean tank with sky backdrop, Moorish casbah, Mexican outpost, Sahara Desert fort, plaster mountain range <b>diorama,</b> and a football field-sized United States map, which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers danced across in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939).|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon <b>Diorama</b> in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped awnings {{on all of the}} cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the <b>diorama.</b> That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought the total number of freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E
5|$|Animal Lifestyles, in {{the western}} {{quadrant}} of the zoo, features indoor habitat exhibits. Visitors in the foyer of the building are shown Life in the Water, Life in Air, and Life on Land dioramas. Each <b>diorama</b> holds a carefully controlled environment that features select animals. These central displays broadly relate animals to their surrounds. Exhibits featuring more specific biota branch off from the central foyer. Side exhibits center on cotton-top tamarins, meerkats, emerald tree boas, dwarf mongooses, desert monitors, among others. Some of these exhibits feature critically endangered animals.

5|$|Following several {{donations}} by {{the people}} of Cooma and the Monaro District, a Memorial Plaque to Corey was erected in Centennial Park, Cooma in 1979. In 1995, the plaque was moved to the Cooma Memorial and the committee involved with the relocation decided to erect a <b>diorama</b> based on a painting in the Australian War Memorial depicting stretcher bearers bringing in wounded soldiers under heavy shell fire at Mont St Quentin during the First World War. A local artist and sculptor, Chris Graham, was commissioned to undertake the project which was constructed from steel and concrete. It was erected in the Cooma War Memorial area on 23 April 1996.|$|E
