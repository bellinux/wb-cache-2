During {{the reign of}} Sultan Abdul Hamid II when the Jezreel Valley railway, {{which was part of}} the Haifa-Damascus extension of the Hejaz railway was constructed, a limited revival took place.

That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church. There are many church records that showed <b>feudal</b> <b>land</b> tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's wine press if it was available. This was likely because added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus manual treading was substantial enough to justify the cost.|$|E

25|$|India's {{independence}} movement had strong roots in East India. The <b>feudal</b> <b>land</b> system, established through the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, was unpopular among the peasant cultivators and the numerous agricultural labourers found all over Bihar and Bengal (Khetmazdoors). The Indian Rebellion of 1857 started in Bengal. British war propaganda asserted there were atrocities by the mutinous {{soldiers in the}} Black Hole of Calcutta. Eventually the British prevailed, and Calcutta remained capital of Britain's Asian dominions until 1911. During Gandhi's {{independence movement}}, the Bihari village of Champaran was an important supporter of non-violent resistance. Great poets of the stature of Rabindranath Tagore championed the movement for self-rule.|$|E
25|$|While {{the basket}} press was {{becoming}} more widely used by Church owned estates in France and Germany, winemaking in the Iberian peninsula and by small local farmers throughout Europe was still mostly down by treading in stone lagers. However, there are many church records that showed <b>feudal</b> <b>land</b> tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's wine press if it was available. This was probably due in part to added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus treading. But safety could have also been a driving force since many parish records from the period reported wine cellar works suffocating to death (from the released carbon dioxide) while treading fermenting wine grapes in a vat.|$|E

He served in this capacity as custodian of the royal castles of Corfe (1221 and 1224) and Sherborne (1224) in Dorset and of the castles of Peveril and Bolsover in Derbyshire. He served as Sheriff of Somerset in 1223-1224. He was granted the royal manor of Kingston Russell in Dorset under a <b>feudal</b> <b>land</b> tenure of grand serjeanty. Between 1212 and about 1215 he acquired a moiety of the feudal barony of Newmarch, (shared with John de Bottrel/Bottreaux) the caput of which was at North Cadbury, Somerset, in respect of which he received a summons for the military service of one knight in 1218.|$|E

500|$|The {{social status}} was {{becoming}} increasingly {{based on the}} size of <b>feudal</b> <b>land</b> possessions. Those included the lands controlled by the Piast princes, their rivals the great lay land owners and church entities, and the knightly class. The work force ranged from hired [...] "free" [...] people to serfs attached to the land, to slaves (either purchased, forced into slavery after capture in war or forced into slavery as prisoners). The upper layer of the feudal lords, first the Church and then others, was able to acquire economic and legal immunity, which it exempt to a significant degree from court jurisdiction and economic obligations such as taxation that had previously been imposed by the ruling dukes.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism in {{the reign of}} David I {{had a profound impact}} on the development of Scots law, establishing <b>feudal</b> <b>land</b> tenure over many parts of the south and east, which eventually spread northward. Sheriffs—originally appointed by the King as royal administrators and tax collectors—developed legal functions, and as early as 1214, they were holding court to hear a variety of cases. Feudal lords were also normally permitted to hold court where disputes between their tenants, including criminal matters, were adjudicated. By the fourteenth century, some of these feudal courts had developed into [...] "petty kingdoms" [...] where the King's courts did not have authority, except for cases of treason. Burghs, towns which had been given this special status usually by the King, also had their own set of local laws dealing mostly with commercial and trade matters and may have become similar in function to sheriff's courts.|$|E

Poitevin created the subordinate Manor of Manchester out of the hundred, which has since in local government been separate from Salford. Poitevin forfeited the manor in 1102 when he was defeated in a failed rebellion attempt against HenryI. In around 1115, for their support during the rebellion, HenryI placed the Hundred of Salford {{under the control of the}} Earldom of Lancaster, and it is from this exchange that the Hundred of Salford became a royal manor. The Lord of the Manor was either the English monarch, or a <b>feudal</b> <b>land</b> owner who administered the manor for the king. During the reign of Henry II the Royal Manor of Salford passed to Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester.|$|E

50|$|Tilly {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Europe after {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire. During this period, state organization was mostly informal and the work of local lords who controlled relatively small areas. Peasants gave up revenue in order to benefit from the security and protection offered by a powerful local lord. Over time, these <b>feudal</b> <b>lands</b> consolidated and required bigger armies in order to offer protection from both internal and external threats. Larger armies proved more effective and subsequently, more money was needed to pay these armies. <b>Feudal</b> <b>lands</b> continued to develop and combine into larger kingdoms ruled by kings. Kings then demanded money in the form of taxes. To impose these taxes, they required a protocol for counting and enforcing collections, so they set up formal state institutions.|$|R

He created an Anglo-Norman style of court, introduced the office of justicar to oversee justice, and local offices of sheriffs to administer localities.
