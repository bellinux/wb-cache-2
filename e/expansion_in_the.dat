5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, {{it is evident that}} the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, most of the major structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major <b>expansion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E

5|$|Before {{implementing}} Steam, Valve Corporation {{had problems}} updating its online games, such as Counter-Strike; providing patches {{would result in}} most of the online user base disconnecting for several days. Valve decided to create a platform that would update games automatically and implement stronger anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. Through user polls {{at the time of its}} announcement in 2002, Valve also recognized that at least 75% of their users had access to high-speed Internet connections, which would only grow with planned Internet <b>expansion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following years, and recognized that they could deliver game content faster to players than through retail channels. Valve approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and RealNetworks to build a client with these features, but were declined.|$|E

5|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{that of the}} 12 million with private insurance via the ACA exchanges in 2017, about 10 million receive premium tax credit subsidies and will be shielded from premium increases, as their after-subsidy premiums are limited {{as a percentage of}} income under the ACA. However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face the brunt of the 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond.

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, M.A.C. {{expanded}} its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough it {{changed its name}} to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, John A. Hannah, became president of the College. He began the largest <b>expansion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> institution's history, {{with the help of the}} 1945 G.I. Bill, which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.|$|E
5|$|ISMB 1997 {{was held}} in Halkidiki, Greece and marked the {{foundation}} of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB).

ISCB has assisted in organising the ISMB conference series since 1998. The period following the formation of ISCB also marked an <b>expansion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of ISMB attendees: ISMB 2000 (held at the University of California, San Diego) was attended by over 1,000 delegates, submitting 141 scientific papers.

The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States.

Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E
5|$|Many of the fortifications {{built by}} the Romans in England survived into the Middle Ages, {{including}} the walls surrounding their military forts and cities.
