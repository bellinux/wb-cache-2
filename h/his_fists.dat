5|$|The book {{reports that}} Senator John McCain {{expressed}} {{frustration with the}} Bush administration's Iraq policy, at one point clenching <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> and screaming at Woodward that “Everything is fucking spin” {{coming out of the}} White House.|$|E
5|$|A Canadian mutant who has {{no memory}} of his life before he was grafted with an indestructible adamantium skeleton. A gruff loner, Wolverine is also a father-figure to Rogue and feels love toward Jean. He wields three blades {{that come out of}} each of <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> has keen animal-like senses and the ability to heal rapidly, and is a {{ruthless}} and aggressive fighter.|$|E
5|$|In {{a medical}} clinic, a nurse escapes to the shops from a room, locking it just before someone inside can rape her. Inside the room, {{a group of}} people are screaming, panicking and self-mutilating; one man—Frank Black (Lance Henriksen)—begins {{pounding}} on a reinforced glass window until <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> bleed.|$|E
60|$|On {{his very}} first Sunday he preached to his {{congregation}} on eternal punishment, leaning forward in his black gown and shaking <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> at them. Dr. McTeague had never shaken <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> in thirty years, {{and as for the}} Rev. Fareforth Furlong, he was incapable of it.|$|R

5|$|Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear, {{released}} in 1987 for the MSX2 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, utilized stealth elements within an action-adventure framework, {{and was the}} first mainstream stealth game to be released on consoles. Since the MSX2 was not available in North America, only the NES version was released there. Metal Gear placed a greater emphasis on stealth than other games of its time, with the player character Solid Snake beginning without any weapons (requiring him to avoid confrontation until weapons are found) and having limited ammunition for each weapon. Enemies are able to see Snake from a distance (using a line-of-sight mechanic) and hear gunshots from non-silenced weapons; security cameras and sensors are placed at various locations, and a security alarm sounds whenever Snake is spotted and causes all enemies on screen to chase him. Snake could also disguise himself in enemy uniform or a cardboard box, and use <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> to fight enemies.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with <b>his</b> <b>fists.</b> With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E

25|$|After McLoren was stabbed, Farris {{entered the}} fort and became {{involved}} in the melee. Farris confronted Jason, who turned and, without hesitation, stabbed Farris twice in the torso. Immediately thereafter, McLoren observed Hein beating Farris in the head and face with <b>his</b> <b>fists.</b> Farris did not resist or otherwise defend himself from the blows administered by Hein.|$|E
25|$|On July 12 of that year, Bonie {{beat his}} wife with a tray table, his belt and <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> {{fracturing}} her skull in the process. He {{was arrested and charged}} with second-degree assault against Campbell, a felony. At the time, Moore told a neighbor that Bonie had been trying to extort money from her under the guise of rent.|$|E
25|$|In Scott's first appearance, {{his body}} would glow green or be {{bathed in a}} green light {{whenever}} he used his power, such as passing through a wall or flying. During his earliest appearances, he would project a beam of green light from his ring that could do {{a variety of things}} such as move objects, melt metal, shrink objects, or put out fires. He rarely used it as an actual weapon and preferred to fight with <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> like any other pulp-adventure hero would do. The ring made him invulnerable to any weapon not made of wood.|$|E

25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put her arms around him in concern.|$|E
25|$|During combat, {{the player}} {{character}} is Agrippa, who can use various gladiatorial weapons such as swords, scimitars, maces, spears, bows, slingshots and flails. If Agrippa has severed {{the arm of}} an enemy, he can {{pick it up and}} also use it as a weapon. However, weapons can only be used for {{a certain amount of time}} before they break. During combat, a meter indicates the remaining vitality of Agrippa's weapon(s) and helmet (if he has one equipped). Agrippa can attack with his main weapon, his sub-weapon or shield, or with a two-handed weapon. The player can lock on to enemies to make Agrippa target them. Agrippa can also throw weapons at his enemies, and can fight with <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> using strong and soft punches as well as shoulder tackles. If timed correctly, Agrippa can also steal weapons from his enemies, or knock their weapons out of their hands using a shoulder tackle. He can also attack from the ground by flinging sand into an approaching enemy's face, and he can attack downed enemies by stomping on them or stabbing them. If Agrippa stands behind a groggy enemy he can perform a suplex on them.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{he began}} racing on asphalt ovals {{when he entered}} the American Speed Association (ASA) as well as {{part-time}} in the NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series). In the same year, Johnson won the ASA Pat Schauer Memorial Rookie title. One year later, he had two wins and finished third in the standings. In 2000, he was announced the driver for Herzog Motorsports in the Busch Series. During the season, he had a spectacular accident on lap 46 during the Lysol 200 at Watkins Glen when his brakes failed entering the first turn. He had to swerve quickly to the right to avoid the 86 of Dennis Demers, but went into the grass on the inside of turn one, then went back across the track, caught some air on the gravel trap before finally crashing head-on into the carafoam barriers {{at the far end of}} the turn while still more than 150+ MPH. Many feared that this accident could have resulted in career ending injuries or potentially have killed him, but he climbed out of the car unscathed and raised <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> in the air like he'd won the race, much to the delight of the crowd. Otherwise, in a rather uneventful season which featured one DNQ at Daytona and 6 top-10's, he finished tenth in the point standings. During the 2001 season, Johnson recorded one win, which was at Chicagoland Speedway, and finished eighth in the point standings. He also began racing in the Winston Cup Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) for Hendrick Motorsports. In the following season, Johnson left Herzog Motorsports to move to Hendrick Motorsports in the Winston Cup Series, driving the No. 48 Lowe's Chevrolet.|$|E

500|$|Tall {{like his}} brothers, Wyatt Earp was [...] when the average height was about [...] He was {{described}} in 1887 by the Los Angeles Herald as [...] "quiet, unassuming, broad-shouldered, with a large blonde mustache. He is dignified, self-contained, game and fearless, and no man commands greater respect..." [...] He weighed about , was long-armed, and muscular, and was very capable of using <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> instead of his weapon to control those resisting his authority.|$|E
500|$|Weapon XI is {{a genetically}} altered mutant killer. He has powers taken from other mutants killed or kidnapped in the film, {{as well as}} {{retractable}} blades in his arms. He is referred to by Stryker as [...] "the pool, the mutant killer: Deadpool" [...] because the compatible powers of the other mutants have been 'pooled' together into one being. This interpretation of Deadpool is lacking his traditional red suit and mask, and also includes a mouth sewn shut and the abilities of Cyclops' optic blasts, Wraith's teleportation, and samurai swords {{that come out of}} <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> from within his arms, similarly to Wolverine's claws. [...] Ryan Reynolds portrays Weapon XI for close-ups, standing shots, and simple stunts while Scott Adkins is used for the more complicated and dangerous stunt work.|$|E
500|$|For combat, in {{addition}} to using <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> (the first Silent Hill game where unarmed combat is possible), Travis accumulates a range of weapons throughout the town: firearms, melee weapons, and one-shot items usable in close combat; the latter two are breakable. Although one-shot items {{can be used to}} quickly kill some of the monsters encountered early on, Travis is vulnerable while performing this action to damage from quick enemies or those with long-ranged attacks. Origins also introduces the [...] "grapple" [...] system, a quick time event activated when a monster grabs him. [...] Should he escape, no damage is done to either him or the monster. The status of his [...] "health" [...] is indicated in the inventory, since the game does not feature a heads-up display; however, when his health is critical, the edges of the screen throb red, and his heartbeat is heard.|$|E

500|$|On the Broadway beat, Broderick swiftly {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for violence. <b>His</b> <b>fists</b> were once described as [...] "huge lethal pistons that could beat a man senseless in half a heartbeat," [...] and to [...] "broderick" [...] became Broadway slang for being knocked out by a single punch. His knuckles were broken many times. Once he knocked out the gangster Francis [...] "Two Gun" [...] Crowley with a single punch, even though Crowley was pointing a gun at him. He {{was said to have}} demanded that hoodlums tip their hat to him, and once was said to have gone to the funeral of a member of the Hudson Dusters gang and spat in his eye. Broderick would wrap a lead pipe in a newspaper, which allowed him to beat gangsters while it looked like he was giving them a friendly swat with a rolled-up newspaper.|$|E
500|$|... {{immediately}} {{became evident}} {{to family and}} friends. He was on medication for stomach problems and tightly wound, with any unexpected sound triggering a defensive reflex reaction to an imagined attack. When he slept, {{it was with a}} loaded pistol under his pillow. Recurring nightmares had him reliving the war, repeatedly calling out to individual soldiers. Turning the lights on sometimes brought relief, if only to keep him from falling asleep again. He had waking graphic flashbacks that caused him to freeze, reliving a life-threatening moment on the battlefield. His first wife Wanda Hendrix stated that he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being moved to tears by newsreel footage of German war orphans, guilt-ridden that his war actions might have been the cause of their having no parents. As others had noticed since his return from Europe, Hendrix said his dreams were punctuated with the battles he had fought. She tried to coax him into seeking psychiatric help. During a publicity tour in 1952, his dreams caused him to beat the wall of his motel room until <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> bled.|$|E
500|$|The Golden Age of Grotesque is {{the final}} studio album to feature {{longtime}} keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy and guitarist John 5, who would both acrimoniously quit the group over the following years. John 5's relationship with Manson had soured {{over the course of}} the Grotesk Burlesk Tour. According to John, Manson spoke to him only once during the entire tour: [...] "It was on my birthday and he turned to me and said, 'Happy birthday, faggot'—then walked away." [...] Manson also displayed hostility towards the guitarist on stage. During a performance of [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] at the 2003 Rock am Ring festival, Manson kicked and then shoved John, who responded in anger by throwing his guitar to the ground and raising <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> to Manson, before resuming the song. Gacy, who was also the band's last remaining original member – excluding Manson – quit shortly before the recording of the band's next studio album, Eat Me, Drink Me (2007). He would later file a $20 million lawsuit against Marilyn Manson for unpaid [...] "partnership proceeds", accusing the vocalist of spending money earned by the band on [...] "sick and disturbing purchases of Nazi memorabilia and taxidermy, including the skeleton of a young Chinese girl." ...|$|E
