2500|$|In October {{the same}} year, Marr reignited {{speculation}} when he hinted on BBC Radio 5 Live at a potential reunion in the future, saying that [...] "stranger {{things have happened}} so, you know, who knows?"

Maybe we will in 10 or 15 years' time when we all need to for whatever reasons, but right now Morrissey <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> thing and I'm doing mine, so that's the answer really." [...] This suggested a change of heart, given that Marr had previously said reforming the band would be a bad idea.|$|E

[...] This was the first indication of a possible Smiths reunion from Marr, who previously had said that reforming the band would be a bad idea. In 2008 Marr and Morrissey met and discussed the possibility of a reunion, but after initial enthusiasm from both parties, neither pursued the idea.|$|E
2500|$|During a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, a {{creative}} writing student asked Borges what he regarded as [...] "a writer's duty to his time". Borges replied, [...] "I think a writer's {{duty is to}} be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> duty. Besides, I think of my own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings—except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six Days' War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody knows my opinions, but as for my dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think. I don't want to intrude into them, I'm writing fiction, not fables." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Micky {{takes the}} {{occasional}} {{phone call from}} an angry Rudi, now returning from a boxing match in Birmingham (where all his fighters lost). Paige gets increasingly fearful of {{what he will do}} to her when he returns, but Micky refuses to change his mind – not because he wishes this on her, but because he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> job. In spite of this, Paige rescues Micky when Arabella takes an interest in his boxing career, claiming he was brilliantly successful when in fact he was a dismal failure. After Arabella falls and breaks fourteen glasses, the evening starts to fall flat. Derek makes a few lame jokes that his family find hilarious, then attempts to start a couple of racist jokes.

2500|$|Three {{weeks before}} the Present, Hook thinks that Merlin is not helping Emma at all, as Hook sees her making Dreamcatchers instead of {{sleeping}} now. But Merlin tells Hook that he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> best to help her, as he knows {{what it means to}} lose a loved one to the Dark One. Merlin tells the residents they need to acquire Excalibur from Arthur, while he takes Emma with him {{to the site of the}} Promethean Flame to acquire the spark needed to reunite Excalibur's halves. Before they go on their mission, Hook gives Emma a necklace with a ring as reminder of their love, and as a keepsake. As Emma embarks on this quest, Merlin tells her that the quest will force her to choose between the light and darkness, which could have dire consequences for the two of them. As they reached the ruins of Oxleigh, the site of the Flame, Merlin had brought the dagger with him and gives it to Emma, in order for her to summon the oldest and darkest of the Dark Ones to obtain the Spark. As Emma looked into the dagger, its display rolls back the names of the previous Dark Ones, until they saw Nimue, who appeared to them, as she was the original Dark One. Then Nimue attacks Merlin through Emma. Nimue forces Emma's hand to choke Merlin’s throat, with Nimue telling her to finish him off. Nimue urges Emma to kill Merlin, telling her that Merlin wants to destroy them and make her go back to being powerless, while Merlin counters by telling Emma to fight the darkness and to [...] "let the light win." [...] However, Emma fights it off by telling Nimue, [...] "I’m not nothing! I was never nothing! The power you have I don’t need!" [...] Then, she uses the Dagger to scroll back to her name, giving her control of Nimue, before removing the Promethean Spark from Nimue's chest. However, Nimue warns Emma that it isn't over yet, that the reforged Excalibur [...] "has more than one purpose," [...] and adds that she is still inside her head, before disappearing.|$|E
