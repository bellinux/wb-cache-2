50|$|Studies {{around this}} time had {{a focus on the}} {{economic}} structure of distribution channels, looking at it from more of a macro view. A significant study was that by Cox, Goodman, and Fichandler, which built upon previous research conducted by Stewart, Dewhurst and Field (1939) and examined the distribution in a high level economy. Bert McCammon, in 1963, enriched the field further. He drew <b>from</b> <b>previous</b> <b>literature</b> by Schumpter and Coase, bringing together research and ideas from a number of behavioural sciences exploring the processes of change occurring in channel systems.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1960s, {{two major}} studies {{established}} {{an approach that}} was often replicated in the following decades. W. Irwin Gillespie of the Brookings Institution (1965) and George A. Bishop of the Tax Foundation (1967) published extensive studies of U.S. taxes and spending for 1960 and 1961-65, respectively. Gillespie criticized previous literature for its limited scope and inadequate incidence analyses. Bishop departed <b>from</b> <b>previous</b> <b>literature</b> as well, basing tax and spending allocations on a single, consistent household survey—the Consumer Expenditure Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which was relatively new at the time—and developing a broad income concept rooted {{in the framework of}} the National Income and Product Accounts. Both studies found that the U.S. tax system was roughly proportional overall and mildly progressive over some ranges, while the distribution of expenditure benefits was sharply progressive, resulting a progressive overall distribution of fiscal incidence for 1961 and 1965.|$|E
