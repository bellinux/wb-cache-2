5|$|After death, {{the empty}} shell of this sea snail {{is often used}} by <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of shell use in the diogenid hermit crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% of the population of these <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of shell type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, and the degree of resistance the shell offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
5|$|Spotted {{eagle ray}} preys mainly upon bivalves, crabs, whelks, benthic infauna they also feed on mollusks, crustaceans, {{particularly}} malacostracans. and also upon <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> shrimp, octopuses, and some small fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} {{is the only}} species of the genus Birgus, and {{is related to the}} {{terrestrial}} <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> of the genus Coenobita. It shows a number of adaptations to life on land. Like <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> juvenile coconut crabs use empty gastropod shells for protection, but the adults develop a tough exoskeleton on their abdomen and stop carrying a shell. Coconut crabs have organs known as branchiostegal lungs, which are used instead of the vestigial gills for breathing and they will drown if immersed in water for long. They have an acute sense of smell, which has developed convergently with that of insects, and which they use to find potential food sources.|$|E
50|$|Pagurus pollicaris is a <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> {{commonly}} found along the Atlantic coast of North America from New Brunswick to the Gulf of Mexico. It is known {{by a number}} of common names, including gray <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> flat-clawed <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> flatclaw <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> shield <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> thumb-clawed <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> broad-clawed <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> and warty <b>hermit</b> <b>crab.</b>|$|R
50|$|Clibanarius tricolor is a <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> {{that lives}} in shallow water of the Caribbean Sea and is popular in the home {{aquarium}} trade. Its common names include blue-legged <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> tricolor <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> blueleg reef <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> equal handed <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> and blueleg <b>hermit</b> <b>crab.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{halloween}} <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> Ciliopagurus strigatus, {{also known}} as the striped <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> or orange legged <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> is a brightly colored aquatic <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> of the family Diogenidae. Besides its ability to routinely clean algae in aquariums, the halloween <b>hermit</b> <b>crab's</b> festive striped coloration also appeals to enthusiasts; it is considered the most brightly colored <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> in normal aquarium use.|$|R
5|$|Animals without blood {{were divided}} into soft-shelled Malakostraka (crabs, lobsters, and shrimps); {{hard-shelled}} Ostrakoderma (gastropods and bivalves); soft-bodied Malakia (cephalopods); and divisible animals Entoma (insects, spiders, scorpions, ticks). Other animals without blood included fish lice, <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> red coral, sea anemones, sponges, starfish and various worms: Aristotle did not classify these into groups.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{float in}} the pelagic zone of the ocean with other {{plankton}} {{for three to four}} weeks, during which a large number of them are eaten by predators. The larvae pass through three to five zoea stages before moulting into the post-larval glaucothoe stage; this process takes from 25 to 33 days. Upon reaching the glaucothoe stage of development, they settle to the bottom, find and wear a suitably sized gastropod shell, and migrate to the shoreline with other terrestrial <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> At that time, they sometimes visit dry land. Afterwards, they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water. As with all <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> they change their shells as they grow. Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the right size often use broken coconut pieces. When they outgrow their shells, they develop a hardened abdomen. The coconut crab reaches sexual maturity around five years after hatching. They reach their maximum size only after 40 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the more}} unusual {{relationships}} are those between certain anemones (such as Adamsia, Calliactis and Neoaiptasia) and <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> or snails, and Bundeopsis or Triactis anemones and Lybia boxing crabs. In the former, the anemones live on the shell of the hermit crab or snail. In the latter, the small anemones are carried in the claws of the boxing crab.|$|E
50|$|Paguristes cadenati, the red reef <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> or scarlet <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> {{is a small}} (about 3 cm across) {{species of}} <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> with a bright red body and yellow eyestalks that lives in the Caribbean Sea.|$|R

5|$|In the spring, {{the adult}} females {{of this species}} lay eggs in {{tower-shaped}} structures. The eggs hatch as veliger larvae, which can float in the plankton for up to 14 weeks before settling onto the seabed as tiny snails. Crabs are a predator of this sea snail. After {{the death of the}} snails, if the shells are still intact they are often used by <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Malacostracans {{live in a}} {{wide range}} of marine and {{freshwater}} habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (terrestrial <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as mantis shrimps, are carnivores.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E

5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|The {{nursehound}} {{feeds on}} a variety of benthic organisms, including bony fishes such as mackerel, deepwater cardinalfishes, dragonets, gurnards, flatfishes, and herring, and smaller sharks such as the small-spotted catshark. It also consumes crustaceans, in particular crabs but also <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> and large shrimp, and cephalopods. Given the opportunity, this shark will scavenge. Adults consume relatively more bony fish and cephalopods, and fewer crustaceans, than juveniles. Known parasites of this species include the monogeneans Hexabothrium appendiculatum and Leptocotyle major, the tapeworm Acanthobothrium coronatum, the trypanosome Trypanosoma scyllii, the isopod Ceratothoa oxyrrhynchaena, and the copepod Lernaeopoda galei. The netted dog whelk (Nassarius reticulatus) preys on the nursehound's eggs by piercing the case and extracting the yolk.|$|E
5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs),</b> annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. It has been observed attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E
50|$|Calliactis parasitica {{can survive}} without the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> and the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> can survive without C. parasitica, but they {{associate}} {{with each other}} to their mutual benefit; this is known as mutualism. The <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> gains protection from predators by the sea anemone's stinging, and the sea anemone gains an increase in food from the material thrown up by the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab's</b> movements. The relationship is apparently instigated by the sea anemone, which begins a complex series of manoeuvres in order to mount the shell carried by the hermit crab; the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> remains passive while these manoeuvres take place.|$|R
50|$|Clibanarius digueti is {{a species}} of <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> that lives off the western coast of Mexico, and is {{abundant}} in the Gulf of California. It is known under various common names such as the Mexican <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> the blue-eyed spotted hermit or the Gulf of California <b>hermit</b> <b>crab.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{halloween}} <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> is omnivorous and a scavenger, eating nearly {{anything that}} appears in its environment, including small animals. It feeds on live and dead animal material, including filamentous algae and detritus. If a halloween <b>hermit</b> <b>crab's</b> shell is too small, it may attack a snail for a larger shell. The halloween <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> can eat quickly.|$|R
5|$|Some {{species are}} benthic (living on the seabed) and others pelagic (living in mid-water), {{but most are}} found close to, {{crawling}} on or burrowing into the mud or sand. Most marine species are benthic by day but leave the seabed at night to become planktonic. Locomotion is mostly by swimming, the pleopods being used for this purpose. Some mysids live among algae and seagrasses, some are solitary while many form dense swarms. Mysids form {{an important part of}} the diet of such fish as shad and flounder. In general, they are free-living, but a few species, mostly in the subfamily Heteromysinae, are commensal and are associated with sea anemones and <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> Several taxa have also been described from different freshwater habitats and caves. Mysis relicta and its close relatives inhabit cold, deep lakes and have a diurnal cycle of vertical migrations.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} from the Admiralty required a detailed geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly whether they rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of tides measured with specially constructed gauges. He chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work. Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a limited range of native plants and no land birds, but <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of the theory he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank. This idea was supported by the numerous soundings FitzRoy had taken showing a steep slope outside the reef with no living corals below 20â€“30 fathoms (10â€“15m).|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the coconut}} crab is, like that of all decapods, divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> are large, {{powerful}} walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs to grip {{the inside of a}} shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. There is some difference in color between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.|$|E
50|$|Dardanus gemmatus, the jeweled anemone <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> native to {{tropical}} reefs surrounding the Indo-Pacific, typically at depths of 2 - 100 m.|$|R
