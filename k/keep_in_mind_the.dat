He had to protect inbound trade convoys from the Americas, {{keep track of}} the Franco-Spanish fleet, while also {{keeping an eye on the}} Dutch fleet at port in the Texel but {{reportedly}} ready to sail. He also had to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>the</b> need to attempt a relief of Gibraltar which had been under siege for several years and would be forced to surrender if it wasn't resupplied soon. Howe had to accomplish these tasks with significantly fewer ships than his combined opponents. Keppel observed the Royal Navy's best hope was to quickly shift their limited forces from one area of danger to another.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Greeks put Dionysius in a {{difficult}} position. With the Greek fleet beaten, Mago had gained the option of making a dash at Syracuse itself, repeating the feat the Carthaginians had pulled off at Messene on Syracuse. On the other hand, if Dionysius could now attack and defeat the army of Himilco, Mago would be compelled to fall back to a secure base. However, Dionysius also had to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>the</b> possibility of political trouble in Syracuse while deciding his strategy. The Greek army was opposed to facing a siege, and at first Dionysius was inclined to seek the Carthaginian army out and measure swords with Himilco. However, his advisers pointed out the threat of Mago and his fleet capturing Syracuse, and Dionysius decided to break camp, leave Catana and march south to Syracuse.|$|E

5000|$|According to Bhikkhu Analayo, {{a similar}} {{practice}} {{is found in}} the Pali commentaries relating to mindfulness of bodily postures. Analayo writes that according to the Papañcasudani [...] "the difference between simple walking and walking meditation as a Satipatthana is that a meditator <b>keeps</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>the</b> question: [...] "Who goes?

Marchiori explained that [...] "the graver a matter of State and the more widespread its possible effects, the more respect will be given, {{within the framework of the}} constitution, to the democracy to decide its outcome". In such instances, the executive and legislature are accountable to the electorate, not the judiciary. Those who are unsatisfied should sound their dissatisfaction in the ballot box.|$|E

2500|$|The goal of {{anthropology}} {{is to provide}} a holistic account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>the</b> biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called [...] "primitive" [...] in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of [...] "inferior". Today, anthropologists use terms such as [...] "less complex" [...] societies or refer to specific modes of subsistence or production, such as [...] "pastoralist" [...] or [...] "forager" [...] or [...] "horticulturalist" [...] to refer to humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (ethnos) remaining of great interest within anthropology.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{important}} to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>the</b> difference between the domain {{of a family of}} densities and the parameters of the family. [...] Different values of the parameters describe different distributions of different random variables on the same sample space (the same set of all possible values of the variable); this sample space is the domain of the family of random variables that this family of distributions describes. [...] A given set of parameters describes a single distribution within the family sharing the functional form of the density. From the perspective of a given distribution, the parameters are constants, and terms in a density function that contain only parameters, but not variables, are part of the normalization factor of a distribution (the multiplicative factor that ensures that the area under the densitythe probability of something in the domain occurring equals 1). This normalization factor is outside the kernel of the distribution.|$|E
