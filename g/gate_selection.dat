50|$|The {{standard}} CMOS APS pixel today {{consists of}} a photodetector (a pinned photodiode), a floating diffusion, a transfer gate, reset <b>gate,</b> <b>selection</b> gate and source-follower readout transistor—the so-called 4T cell. The pinned photodiode was originally used in interline transfer CCDs due to its low dark current and good blue response, and when coupled with the transfer gate, allows complete charge transfer from the pinned photodiode to the floating diffusion (which is further connected to {{the gate of the}} read-out transistor) eliminating lag. The use of intrapixel charge transfer can offer lower noise by enabling the use of correlated double sampling (CDS). The Noble 3T pixel is still sometimes used since the fabrication requirements are easier. The 3T pixel comprises the same elements as the 4T pixel except the transfer gate and the photodiode. The reset transistor, Mrst, acts as a switch to reset the floating diffusion which acts in this case as the photodiode. When the reset transistor is turned on, the photodiode is effectively connected to the power supply, VRST, clearing all integrated charge. Since the reset transistor is n-type, the pixel operates in soft reset. The read-out transistor, Msf, acts as a buffer (specifically, a source follower), an amplifier which allows the pixel voltage to be observed without removing the accumulated charge. Its power supply, VDD, is typically tied to the power supply of the reset transistor. The select transistor, Msel, allows a single row of the pixel array to be read by the read-out electronics. Other innovations of the pixels such as 5T and 6T pixels also exist. By adding extra transistors, functions such as global shutter, as opposed to the more common rolling shutter, are possible. In order to increase the pixel densities, shared-row, four-ways and eight-ways shared read out, and other architectures can be employed. A variant of the 3T active pixel is the Foveon X3 sensor invented by Dick Merrill. In this device, three photodiodes are stacked {{on top of each other}} using planar fabrication techniques, each photodiode having its own 3T circuit. Each successive layer acts as a filter for the layer below it shifting the spectrum of absorbed light in successive layers. By deconvolving the response of each layered detector, red, green, and blue signals can be reconstructed.|$|E

The gate is a three terminal on-chip device that consists of: (1) the input optical port, (2) the <b>gate</b> <b>selection</b> port, and (3) the output optical port.

The speed of the gate for logic operations as well as for reprogramming the function of the gate is primarily limited to the small signal modulation speed of a laser, which can be on the order of tens of GHz.

40|$|Contemporary {{integrated}} circuits are designed and manufactured in a globalized environment leading to concerns of piracy, overproduction and counterfeiting. One class of techniques to combat these threats is circuit obfuscation {{which seeks to}} modify the gate-level (or structural) description of a circuit without affecting its functionality {{in order to increase}} the complexity and cost of reverse engineering. Most of the existing circuit obfuscation methods are based on the insertion of additional logic (called “key gates”) or camouflaging existing gates {{in order to make it}} difficult for a malicious user to get the complete layout information without extensive computations to determine key-gate values. However, when the netlist or the circuit layout, although camouflaged, is available to the attacker, he/she can use advanced logic analysis and circuit simulation tools and Boolean SAT solvers to reveal the unknown gate-level information without exhaustively trying all the input vectors, thus bringing down the complexity of reverse engineering. To counter this problem, some ‘provably secure’ logic encryption algorithms that emphasize methodical selection of camouflaged gates have been proposed previously in literature [1, 2, 3]. The contribution of this paper is the creation and simulation of a new layout obfuscation method that uses don't care conditions. We also present proof-of-concept of a new functional or logic obfuscation technique that not only conceals, but modifies the circuit functionality in addition to the gate-level description, and can be implemented automatically during the design process. Our layout obfuscation technique utilizes don’t care conditions (namely, Observability and Satisfiability Don’t Cares) inherent in the circuit to camouflage selected gates and modify sub-circuit functionality while meeting the overall circuit specification. Here, camouflaging or obfuscating a gate means replacing the candidate gate by a 4 X 1 Multiplexer which can be configured to perform all possible 2 -input/ 1 -output functions as proposed by Bao et al. [4]. It is important to emphasize that our approach not only obfuscates but alters sub-circuit level functionality in an attempt to make IP piracy difficult. The choice of gates to obfuscate determines the effort required to reverse engineer or brute force the design. As such, we propose a method of camouflaged <b>gate</b> <b>selection</b> based on the intersection of output logic cones. By choosing these candidate gates methodically, the complexity of reverse engineering can be made exponential, thus making it computationally very expensive to determine the true circuit functionality. We propose several heuristic algorithms to maximize the RE complexity based on don’t care based obfuscation and methodical <b>gate</b> <b>selection.</b> Thus, the goal of protecting the design IP from malicious end-users is achieved. It also makes it significantly harder for rogue elements in the supply chain to use, copy or replicate the same design with a different logic. We analyze the reverse engineering complexity by applying our obfuscation algorithm on ISCAS- 85 benchmarks. Our experimental results indicate that significant reverse engineering complexity can be achieved at minimal design overhead (average area overhead for the proposed layout obfuscation methods is 5. 51 % and average delay overhead is about 7. 732 %). We discuss the strengths and limitations of our approach and suggest directions that may lead to improved logic encryption algorithms in the future. References: [1] R. Chakraborty and S.

Compared to conventional circuits, its implementation {{is more complicated}} especially when {{we deal with the}} fine-grained adaptivity. The unconventional and sophisticated nature of adaptive design further requires timing verification to validate the design. However timing analysis becomes more complicated due to complexities arising from nanometer VLSI technologies. A well-known challenge is process variations, which need to be addressed in timing analysis at least by considering different process corners. Adaptive circuit design further needs statistical static timing analysis (SSTA), which is much more time consuming than variation-oblivious timing analysis. Besides timing analysis, <b>gate</b> implementation <b>selections</b> of the adaptive design process are also computational expensive.

Moreover, PFC and striatum correlated with distinct behavioral profiles. Whereas PFC recruitment correlated with mean efficiency of selection from WM, striatal recruitment and frontostriatal interactions correlated with its reliability, as though such dynamics stochastically gate WM’s output.

Different guidance cues elicit translation of subsets of mRNAs that differentially regulate the cytoskeleton, yet little is understood about how specific mRNAs are selected for translation.

For the organophosphates dimethyl methylphosphonate, diethyl methylphosphonate and diisopropyl methylphosphonate, two ion mobility peaks were observed, which are shown to be the ammoniated monomer and ammoniated dimer ions. Using an ElectroSpray Ionisation (ESI) - ITMS, the fragmentation pathway of dimethyl ethylphosphonate (DMEP) is investigated. The isotopomers of DMEP have unusual fragmentations, and density functional theory calculations are used to aid in the interpretation of the mechanisms involved in these fragmentations.

Conclusions: the exposed features are in realization of technical and tactical actions the hockey players of high class of different playing line of business, it is necessary certainly to take into account in the process of estimation and control...|$|R
40|$|CorA is {{a family}} of {{divalent}} cation transporters ubiquitously present in bacteria and archaea. Although CorA can transport both Mg 2 + and Co 2 + almost equally well, its main role has been suggested {{to be that of}} primary Mg 2 + transporter of prokaryotes and hence the regulator of Mg 2 + homeostasis. The reason is that the affinity of CorA for Co 2 + is relatively low and thus considered non-physiological. Here, we show that Thermotoga maritima CorA (TmCorA) is incapable of regulating the Mg 2 + homeostasis and therefore cannot be the primary Mg 2 + transporter of T. maritima. Further, our in vivo experiments confirm that TmCorA is a highly selective Co 2 + transporter, as it selects Co 2 + over Mg 2 + at > 100 times lower concentrations. In addition, we present data that show TmCorA to be extremely thermostable in the presence of Co 2 +. Mg 2 + could not stabilize the protein to the same extent, even at high concentrations. We also show that addition of Co 2 +, but not Mg 2 +, specifically induces structural changes to the protein. Altogether, these data show that TmCorA has the role of being the transporter of Co 2 + but not Mg 2 +. The physiological relevance and requirements of Co 2 + in T. maritima is discussed and highlighted. We suggest that CorA may have different roles in different organisms. Such functional diversity is presumably a reflection of minor, but important structural differences within the CorA family that regulate the <b>gating,</b> substrate <b>selection,</b> and transport...|$|R
