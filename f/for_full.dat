5|$|Between 1867 and 1873, Fauré wrote a symphonic work <b>for</b> <b>full</b> orchestra.

5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part <b>for</b> <b>full</b> choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E

5|$|In 1855, Melvin {{was elected}} as the Commonwealth's {{attorney}} of Hancock County, {{despite the fact}} that he was under the required minimum age of 21 to hold public office.

Melvin continued to serve as Hancock County's prosecuting attorney notwithstanding his relocation to Wheeling in 1857. Following his move to Wheeling, he established a law practice known as Pendleton & Melvin with Joseph H. Pendleton, who was one of the city's preeminent lawyers. During this period, Melvin was affiliated with the Whig Party.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} section in {{spirited}} 3/8 time, the predominant mood is of joyous exaltation reflecting the text from Isaiah. The structure of the choral material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two homophonic episodes; here a homophonic episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, the final section ends with a short coda <b>for</b> <b>full</b> chorus and orchestra.|$|E

5|$|The Smithsonian {{recognized}} the locomotive's age in 1931, but, since the museum didn't have {{the funds to}} refurbish the locomotive <b>for</b> <b>full</b> operation again, {{it was decided to}} run the locomotive in place (with the driving wheels lifted off the rails using jacks) with compressed air. The museum borrowed an 1836 coach from the Pennsylvania Railroad to display on the track behind the newly rebuilt tender, and the locomotive's 100th birthday was officially celebrated on November 12, 1931. The locomotive's semi-operation was broadcast over the CBS radio network with Stanley Bell narrating the ceremonies for the radio audience.|$|E
