5|$|Helper T cells {{regulate}} {{both the}} innate and adaptive immune responses and help <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> immune responses the body makes {{to a particular}} pathogen.

5|$|If {{tuberculosis}} recurs, {{testing to}} <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> antibiotics it {{is sensitive to}} is important before determining treatment. If multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24months is recommended.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E

5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets to <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use {{that information to}} select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which players take {{the role of an}} unnamed man who explores the post-apocalyptic remains of Tokyo. Like its predecessor Megami Tensei II has players navigate dungeon environments in first-person, but between dungeons they also navigate an overworld from an overhead perspective. During their journey, the protagonist's party can visit shops and towns to gain additional story information and to purchase items using in-game currency. As they progress through the story, the protagonist is presented with morality-based dialogue options which influence how people respond to him and ultimately <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> ending is received.|$|E

Trump hires one of the finalists to be his apprentice. Starting with season7, celebrities participated {{as a way to}} revitalize the series, with the winners donating their proceeds to charity. Trump departed the series after the fourteenth season to focus on his 2016 presidential campaign, in which actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger would now serve as host of the series. The fifteenth season, featuring Schwarzenegger has been branded as The New Celebrity Apprentice.|$|E

Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere.
