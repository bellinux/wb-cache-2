When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the right balance in the <b>internal</b> <b>compartment.</b> When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing.

50|$|Planctomycetes have a {{distinctive}} morphology {{with the appearance}} of membrane-bound <b>internal</b> <b>compartments,</b> {{often referred to as the}} paryphoplasm (ribosome-free space), pirellulosome (ribosome-containing space) and nucleoid (condensed nucleic acid region, in these species surrounded by a double membrane). Until the discovery of the Poribacteria, planctomycetes were the only bacteria known with these apparent <b>internal</b> <b>compartments.</b> Three-dimensional electron tomography reconstruction of a representative species, Gemmata obscuriglobus, has yielded varying interpretations of this observation. One 2013 study found the appearance of <b>internal</b> <b>compartments</b> to be due to a densely invaginated but continuous single membrane, concluding that only the two compartments typical of Gram-negative bacteria - the cytoplasm and periplasm - are present. However, the excess membrane triples the surface area of the cell relative to its volume, which may be related to Gemmata's sterol biosynthesis abilities. A 2014 study using similar methods reported confirmation of the earlier enclosed compartment hypothesis.|$|R

We use a kinetic control strategy with block copolymer blending to construct complex nanoparticles through the demixing of unlike block copolymers within the same nanoscale particle. Successful nanoparticle construction relies on kinetic trapping of unlike block copolymers into the same nanoparticle with solution processing. Not only can we make nanoparticles with multiple <b>internal</b> <b>compartments</b> of a desired size, but we can also make nanoparticles of hybrid geometries (e. g. a blend of cylindrical and spherical geometries).

40|$|We {{introduce}} a general computational model for all-electric ships and <b>internal</b> <b>compartments</b> (open and closed domains) that contain heat sources and sinks. A simplified physical model, which com-bines principles of classical thermodynamics and heat transfer, is developed {{and the resulting}} three-dimensional (3 D) differential equations are discretized in space using a 3 D cell-centered volume element scheme. The combination of the proposed simplified physical model with the adopted finite volume scheme for the numerical discretization of the differential equations is therefore called a vol-ume element model (VEM). Two case studies are presented: a simulation of a whole ship at sea, {{and one of the}} ship’s <b>internal</b> <b>compartments</b> (or cabinet). The proposed model was utilized to simulate numerically the steady-state responses of the systems in both cases. Of particular interest in the first case is the possibility of predicting the ship’s thermal signature at sea. Mesh refinements were conducted to ensure the convergence of the numerical results. The converged mesh in both cases was relatively coarse (175 and 320 cells) and therefore the solutions were obtained with low compu-tational time. Since accuracy and low computational time are combined, the model is shown to be efficient and {{could be used as a}} tool for simulation, design and optimization of thermal management of all-electric ships, <b>internal</b> <b>compartments</b> and cabinets. Finally, experiments are conducted in a test-bed facility to demonstrate, from simulated sea conditions, how to quantify the electric motors transient heat rejection to cooling water and the environment in a notional all-electric ship, with the objective of serving as known heat generation inputs to the mathematical model to simulate the transient thermal response of the entire ship and its compartments...|$|R

40|$|Using FM 4 - 64 {{to label}} endosomes and Abp 1 p-GFP or Sac 6 p-GFP to label actin patches, {{we find that}} (1) endosomes colocalize with actin patches as they {{assemble}} at the bud cortex; (2) endosomes colocalize with actin patches as they undergo linear, retrograde movement from buds toward mother cells; and (3) actin patches interact with and disassemble at FM 4 - 64 –labeled <b>internal</b> <b>compartments.</b> We also show that retrograde flow of actin cables mediates retrograde actin patch movement. An Arp 2 / 3 complex mutation decreases the frequency of cortical, nonlinear actin patch movements, but {{has no effect on}} the velocity of linear, retrograde actin patch movement. Rather, linear actin patch movement occurs at the same velocity and direction as the movement of actin cables. Moreover, actin patches require actin cables for retrograde movements and colocalize with actin cables as they undergo retrograde movement. Our studies support a mechanism whereby actin cables serve as “conveyor belts” for retrograde movement and delivery of actin patches/endosomes to FM 4 - 64 –labeled <b>internal</b> <b>compartments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of over-pressures and temperatures that are generated by hydrogen explosions {{in case of}} a severe nuclear accident is a crucial stage of the safety analysis of the containment. The investigation presented in this paper is a continuation of the numerical studies of validation and benchmarking that were carried out in the European co-sponsored project HYCOM. In the present work, numerical simulations of hydrogen deflagrations within a simplified, real-scale EPR (European Pressure Reactor) containment have been performed with two CFD codes, CFX 4 and REACFLOW.

50|$|The {{design of}} an <b>internal</b> <b>compartment</b> {{that could be}} readily {{inserted}} during the canning process was devised by Alan Forage and William Byrne, and work started on the widget during the period 1984-85.

This would be sufficient to initiate the product and give it the characteristic creamy head. However, Tony Carey observed that this resulted in beer being forced into the widget during pressurisation, which reduced the quality of the head.

5000|$|There {{are also}} pencils which use {{mechanical}} methods to push lead {{through a hole}} at the end.

The erasers (sometimes replaced by a sharpener on pencils with larger lead sizes) are also removable (and thus replaceable), and usually cover a place to store replacement leads. Mechanical pencils are popular for their longevity {{and the fact that they}} may never need sharpening.

5000|$|The MNR2 gene encodes {{a protein}} {{closely related to}} the Alr proteins, but {{includes}} conserved features that define a distinct subgroup of CorA proteins in fungal genomes, suggesting a distinct role in Mg2+ homeostasis. Like an alr1 mutant, growth of an mnr2 mutant was sensitive to Mg2+-deficient conditions, but the mnr2 mutant was observed to accumulate more Mg2+ than a wild-type strain under these conditions. These phenotypes suggested that Mnr2 may regulate Mg2+ storage within an intracellular compartment. Consistent with this interpretation, the Mnr2 protein was localized to the membrane of the vacuole, an <b>internal</b> <b>compartment</b> implicated in the storage of excess mineral nutrients by yeast. A direct role of Mnr2 in Mg2+ transport was suggested by the observation that increased Mnr2 expression, which redirected some Mnr2 protein to the cell surface, also suppressed the Mg2+-requirement of an alr1 alr2 double mutant strain. Interestingly, the mnr2 mutation also altered accumulation of other divalent cations, suggesting this mutation may increase Alr gene expression or protein activity. Recent work [...] supported this model, by showing that Alr1 activity was increased in an mnr2 mutant strain, and that the mutation was associated with induction of Alr1 activity at a higher external Mg concentration than was observed for an Mnr2 wild-type strain. These effects were observed without any change in Alr1 protein accumulation, again indicating that Alr1 activity may be regulated directly by the Mg concentration within the cell.|$|E

40|$|The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome {{includes}} eight PIN-FORMED (PIN) {{members that}} are molecularly diverged. To comparatively examine their differences in auxin-transporting activity and subcellular behaviors, we expressed seven PIN proteins specifically in Arabidopsis root hairs and analyzed their activities {{in terms of}} the degree of PIN-mediated root hair inhibition or enhancement and determined their subcellular localization. Expression of six PINs (PIN 1 –PIN 4, PIN 7, and PIN 8) in root hair cells greatly inhibited root hair growth, most likely by lowering auxin levels in the root hair cell by their auxin efflux activities. The auxin efflux activity of PIN 8, which had not been previously demonstrated, was further confirmed using a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cell assay system. In accordance with these results, those PINs were localized in the plasma membrane, where they likely export auxin to the apoplast and formed <b>internal</b> <b>compartments</b> in response to brefeldin A. These six PINs conferred different degrees of root hair inhibition and sensitivities to auxin or auxin transport inhibitors. Conversely, PIN 5 mostly localized to <b>internal</b> <b>compartments,</b> and its expression in root hair cells rather slightly stimulated hair growth, implying that PIN 5 enhanced internal auxin availability. These results suggest that different PINs behave differentially in catalyzing auxin transport depending upon their molecular activity and subcellular localization in the root hair cell...|$|R
