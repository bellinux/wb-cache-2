I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

His father and grandfather both were Edward's men, and held their castle for us; {{his father was a}} great friend of the Black Prince, and he, too, took a wife from England. Since then things have not gone well with us in France, and they say that our lord has had difficulty in keeping clear of the quarrels that are always <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> between the great French lords; and, seeing that we have but little power in Artois, he has to hold himself discreetly, and to keep aloof as far as he can from the strife there, and bide his time until the king sends an army to win back his own again. But I doubt not that, although our lady's wishes and the queen's favour may have gone some way with him, the king thought more of the advantage of keeping this French noble,--whose fathers have always been faithful vassals of the crown, and who was himself English on his mother's side,--faithful to us, ready for the time when the royal banner will flutter in the wind again, and blood will flow as it did at Cressy and Poitiers.|$|E

Twelve-year veteran Stephane Yelle was another strong addition to the roster. Added to a line-up featuring young stars such as Phil Kessel and Milan Lucic, the return of Patrice Bergeron, the improved goaltending of veteran Tim Thomas and coming off the back of an impressive post-season, expectations were high for the team.|$|R

Then you would go to a little cubbyhole on the side street in Chungking that was occupied by the liaison officer of the Chinese Communists, who were then our allies, and hear from a charming person like Chou En-lai an explanation of, say, the latest conflict between the Kuomintang forces and the People's Liberation Army in some remote area of the interior, giving in great detail the facts, as he reported them, of what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> It was very tempting indeed to give considerable prominence to the detailed version and very persuasive words that we got from Chou and to more or less ignore—and quite rightly, I think, in most cases—the Nationalists' communiqués.|$|E

I have Christian roots from my childhood and I carry it with me today and I’m sure some people that read the lyrics would say it kind of reflects in the music. As far as individual beliefs, {{some of us have}} more Christian roots than others of us. Faith does play a part in what we’re doing, but we’re still a death metal band and we want to deliver death metal the way it’s supposed to be. We don’t have anything satanic in our music. There’s no profanity in the music, either. We could go on tour with Deicide and get along with those guys just as much as we’d go on tour with Demon Hunter and get along with those guys. There’s really no reason why you shouldn’t get along just because your lyrical content or beliefs might be different than somebody else’s. If that was the case, 90 percent of death metal wouldn’t get along with anybody ‘cause there’s a lot of satanic stuff <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, he {{was again}} {{selected}} as the first candidate on Labor's Senate ticket in the 2013 federal election, causing some controversy as he defeated Penny Wong for the leading Senate position. At the time, Wong was a senior minister in the Second Gillard Ministry {{and a member of}} the Australian Cabinet. Anthony Albanese accused union powerbrokers of not listening to the electorate and instead focusing on its own ructions. He labelled the move as:"...gross self-indulgent rubbish.... by ....those who should care more about the party and less about themselves." [...] He stated that he would demand that Labor's national executive overturn the decision and promote Senator Wong to the number one spot. On 30 October 2012, Farrell stepped aside to give Wong the number one spot on Labor's senate ticket for the 2013 election. He was quoted as saying:"I was concerned that the issue was damaging the Labor Party. ..... I was prepared to do a swap with Penny. This is a case whereby modern Labor can't be seen to be concentrating on our internals at the expense of what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the electorate and what is expected." [...] Wong later expressed favourable sentiments about Farrell after his decision to stand aside:"Throughout his career, Don has always put the Labor Party first and he has demonstrated that principle again today." [...] Farrell was subsequently defeated at the 2013 federal election and his term in the Senate ended on 30 June 2014.|$|E

5000|$|Bruce Miller, the {{executive}} producer of The Handmaid's Tale television serial, declared with regard to Atwood's book, as well as his series, that Gilead is [...] "a society that’s based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes". The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the [...] "utopian idealism" [...] present in 20th-century régimes, such as Cambodia and Romania, as well as earlier New England Puritanism. Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are [...] "not genuinely Christian". The group running Gilead, according to Atwood, is [...] "not really interested in religion; they're interested in power." [...] In fact, in her prayers to God, June (Offred), reflecting on Gilead, prays “I don't believe for an instant that what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> is what You meant…. I suppose I should say I forgive whoever did this, and whatever they’re doing now. I’ll try, but it isn’t easy.” Margaret Atwood, writing on this, says that [...] "Offred herself has a private version of the Lord's Prayer and refuses to believe that this regime has been mandated by a just and merciful God." [...] Christian churches that do not support the actions of the Sons of Jacob are systematically demolished, and the people living in Gilead are never seen attending church. Christian denominations, including Quakers, Baptists and Roman Catholics, as well as Jews, are specifically named as enemies of the Sons of Jacob. To this end, the book includes a scene in which a Catholic Christian nun is [...] "forced to renounce her vow of chastity in order to become a child-bearing handmaid." [...] Likewise, a Catholic Christian priest was hanged from a bridge for refusing to renounce his faith. Atwood pits Quaker Christians against the régime by having them help the oppressed, something she feels they would do in reality: [...] "The Quakers have gone underground, and are running an escape route to Canada, as—I suspect—they would." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} not made. Instead Hill wrote and {{directed}} a second biopic, Wild Bill (1995). This too had little critical or commercial success. Hill reflected on his career in 1995:I think every director thinks that he hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, `Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.Hill admitted his style of films were becoming less fashionable:I admire a lot of what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> but the oversize kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down.
