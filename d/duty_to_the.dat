5|$|Maester Aemon summons Jon and {{explains}} {{to him the}} reason why members of the Night's Watch do not marry: it would force them to choose between their <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> order or loyalty to their loved ones. Aemon knows this very well because he is actually Aemon Targaryen, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen's uncle and Daenerys's great-uncle, who dutifully and reluctantly stayed at the Wall while his family members were killed or exiled when the Targaryens were overthrown. Aemon advises Jon that he must choose either his <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Night's Watch or his family, but also warns that {{the consequences of his}} choice will haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{responded to}} the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor by enlisting in the navy. He {{received}} a commission as ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve on April 13, 1942. On April 20, he reported for active <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> V-5 instructor school at Annapolis, Maryland. After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where {{he was one of}} 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill. In addition, he coached in all nine sports that were offered, but mostly in swimming, boxing and football. During the year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to Lieutenant, Junior Grade, on June 2, 1942, and to lieutenant, in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E

25|$|After leaving Fighter Command, Dowding {{was sent}} on special <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, but there {{he made himself}} unpopular with his outspokenness. On his return he headed a study into economies of RAF {{manpower}} before retiring from the Royal Air Force in July 1942. He was elevated to the peerage, as Baron Dowding of Bentley Priory on 2 June 1943.|$|E
25|$|These deities {{formed a}} core pantheon; there were {{additionally}} hundreds of minor ones. Sumerian gods could thus have associations with different cities, and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities' political power. The gods {{were said to}} have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them. The temples organized the mass labour projects needed for irrigation agriculture. Citizens had a labor <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> temple, though they could avoid it by a payment of silver.|$|E

On 7 May 2015, he made a farewell walkabout at the Sydney Opera House and visited Macquarie University Hospital, where he met Lieutenant Ali Spearing who had undergone pioneering treatment in the hospital to fit prosthetic limbs.|$|E
25|$|He {{enlisted in}} the Marine Corps in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 1, 1941 when he was 18 {{years of age and}} was ordered to Parris Island, South Carolina, where he {{received}} his recruit training. Following the completion of recruit training, he was transferred for <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia, but shortly afterwards was ordered to the Marine Barracks, New River, North Carolina, where he entered parachute training.

25|$|On 7 November, {{the mine}} {{countermeasures}} ship reported for duty with the Commander, Mine Force, Pacific Fleet. Over the next 10 months, she first conducted shakedown training along the west coast and then began normal duty with the Mine Force out of Long Beach, California. That duty lasted until 1 August 1956, when she departed Long Beach for her new home port, Sasebo, Japan. After stops at Oahu and Midway Island, the coastal minesweeper arrived at Sasebo on 21 August, and reported for <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commander, Mine Flotilla 1.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} John's sister Teresa Maria in February 1704, greatly saddened him. It {{caused him to}} avoid {{appearing}} at court for some months and to estrange himself from his father, who favoured John's younger brother, Manuel, Count of Ourém. During this time, much gossip was spread and worries arose about whether John would ever recover from his depression. In May of that year, he eventually returned to the court and reconciled with the king, saying that his saudades for his sister would not {{get in the way}} of his performing his <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king.|$|E
25|$|Another alleged {{retaliation}} came in July 2012. Lieutenant Robert Alvarado gave {{an interview}} to a local D.C. television station in which he discussed his dissatisfaction with Ellerbe's decisions regarding the DCFEMS logo and the stored polo shirts. Ellerbe demanded that Alvarado be suspended for a month for speaking to the media without authorization. Suspensions of more than three days must be determined by a trial board, and in July 2012 the trial board found Alvarado guilty. He was suspended for 22 days. After serving the suspension, Alvarado was transferred from active <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> DCFEMS fire training academy. He also filed an appeal with the D.C. Office of Employee Appeals.|$|E
25|$|On 19 November, the {{two sides}} {{exchanged}} fire, causing only minor damage to each other's barricades. The {{rest of the day}} was uneventful. In the early hours of 20 November, the Greeks received 450 men in reinforcements, most of them were sent on guard <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roads leading to Arachova. On 21 November, 800 soldiers under Abdullah Aga appeared outside Davleia where they broke into two forces. The smaller marched down to the Agia Ierousalim monastery while the larger headed towards Zemeno. Zemeno was to be the point where Abdullah Aga would strike the Greek rear, enabling Mustafa Bey {{to break out of the}} pocket. The formation was to act as a distraction.|$|E

25|$|Many {{sections}} of the country had reason to be dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy {{and a sense of}} <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy. Perhaps more than any other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Rome's {{military}} {{consisted of}} an annual citizen levy performing military service {{as part of}} their <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state. During this period, the Roman army would prosecute seasonal campaigns against largely local adversaries. As the extent of the territories falling under Roman suzerainty expanded, {{and the size of the}} city's forces increased, the soldiery of ancient Rome became increasingly professional and salaried. As a consequence, military service at the lower (non-staff) levels became progressively longer-term. Roman military units of the period were largely homogeneous and highly regulated. The army consisted of units of citizen infantry known as legions (Latin: legiones) as well as non-legionary allied troops known as auxilia. The latter were most commonly called upon to provide light infantry or cavalry support.|$|E
25|$|Raleigh was {{refitted}} {{and sent}} to join the Mediterranean squadron, where tension was once again rising with Turkey and Russia. In autumn 1876 Tryon was at Bashika Bay, {{where he had been}} twenty-two years before. He noted the improved health of the sailors this time, which he ascribed to the fact that fresh water was now produced on board ship rather than having to be brought aboard. The political tension came to nothing, and the tour was highlighted by escort <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Duchess of Edinburgh aboard the Russian Imperial yacht, hunting trips and visits to places of interest. In June 1877 Tryon was replaced by Captain Jago as commander of Raleigh after a tour of {{three and a half years}} and returned home.|$|E
