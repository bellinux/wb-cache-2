For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things.

The A-side reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was later {{featured on the}} Beach Boys' album 20/20 on February 10, 1969. When Manson discovered he was uncredited on the single, he was furious and threatened Dennis Wilson with murder. Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks recalled [...] "One day, Charles Manson brought a bullet out {{and showed it to}} Dennis, who asked, 'What's this?' And Manson replied, 'It's a bullet. Every time you look at it, I want you to think <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> <b>it</b> is your kids are still safe'". Wilson confronted Manson about the incident, realizing Manson's growing erratic behavior, and ended their friendship soon after.|$|E
500|$|When Thom and Dev stop at Gray's Papaya for hot dogs, a {{confused}} Caroline escapes from Thom's van. Nick and Norah {{meet up with}} Thom and Dev {{to try to find}} her. A confusing phone call leads them to look for her at a club that [...] "Where's Fluffy?" [...] is rumored to be playing, but with no success. Tris, eager to win back Nick, catches up with them when she gets a phone call from Caroline, who is now able to tell Norah that she has [...] "found Jesus" [...] and [...] "an altar boy without pants." [...] They find a drunk Caroline on stage at a gay cabaret dressed as a Christmas tree. When they arrive at Nick's car, Tris is sitting on the hood waiting for him. Norah tells him <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> <b>it</b> was to meet him, but he leaves to talk with Tris without giving Norah a response. An upset Norah meets up at a club with her , Tal (Jay Baruchel), but soon realizes that he has an ulterior motive and hopes to get a deal for his band with Norah's father, a record producer (...) [...] She agrees to pay for Tal and his friends' drinks, but she tells the waitress to increase the tab because there was a miscalculation, and she leaves him to pay. Nick, meanwhile, decides to confront Tris, but she tells him she wants to be together again and asks for a ride home. Tris asks Nick to stop by the river, where she tries to seduce him. Whilst she seductively dances in front of the car, Nick reminisces fondly about Norah and the night's events and drives away, leaving Tris behind.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} after Salk's discovery, many supporters, in {{particular}} the National Foundation, [...] "helped him build his dream of a research complex for the investigation of biological phenomena 'from cell to society'." [...] Called the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, it opened in 1963 in the San Diego neighborhood of La Jolla. Salk believed that the institution would help new and upcoming scientists along in their careers, as he said himself, [...] "I thought <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> <b>it</b> would be if {{a place like this}} existed and I was invited to work there." [...] This was something that Salk was deprived of early in his life, but due to his achievements, was able to provide for future scientists.|$|E
2500|$|Ireland's {{campaign}} in the 200910 ICC Intercontinental Cup, in pursuit of their fourth consecutive title in the competition, began in July 2009. Connell played in their first match, which was against Kenya; opening the bowling, he returned match figures of 2/97. Phil Simmons, Ireland's coach, was dissatisfied with Connell's performance and he was dropped for Ireland's next Intercontinental Cup match, which was against Scotland. Simmons cited [...] "a drop in attitude" [...] for Connell's lack of success and subsequent drop, adding [...] "I need to see that he's back {{to where he was}} at towards the beginning of last year. I want people to realise just <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> <b>it</b> is to be involved with this squad and not take it for granted." [...] Connell was given an opportunity to prove himself in an Ireland A match against Marylebone Cricket Club.|$|E

40|$|I {{must confess}} that putting these {{thoughts}} and ideas onto paper {{is more difficult}} then just opening my mouth and letting those same thoughts roll out. When I began rotational grazing in 1992, I realized {{there was a lot}} I didn’t know. Today I realize that there is even more I don’t know. My management decisions reflect the thought process that I have developed through reading, attending conferences, participating in pasture walks, and trial and error. Without a doubt, the most valuable tool in my possession is the knowledge that I have acquired. Limited time and resources, higher land prices, lower cattle prices, all of these influence the decisions I make. As land prices increase, my carrying capacities must increase and my cost per head must decrease. It will be tough to remain in the cattle business at the ratio of 1 cow/calf pair for every 3 acres; <b>how</b> much <b>nicer</b> <b>it</b> would be to achieve 1 cow/calf pair for every 1. 5 acre. So let’s take a look at various aspects that can perhaps move us in this direction...|$|R

And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, [...] "Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again." [...] And when they {{wake up in the}} summer, Kitty, they dress {{themselves}} all in green, and dance about--whenever the wind blows--oh, that's very pretty!' cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. 'And I do so WISH it was true! I'm sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.|$|R

40|$|In some sense, {{the world}} is {{composed}} of shapes and words, of continuous things and discrete things. The recognition and study of continuous objects {{in the form of}} shapes occupies {{a significant part of the}} effort of unraveling many geometric questions. Shapes can be rep- resented with great generality by objects called currents. While the enormous variety and representational power of currents is useful for representing a huge variety of phenomena, it also leads to the problem that knowing something is a respectable current tells you little about <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> or regular <b>it</b> is. In these brief notes I give an intuitive explanation of a result that says that an important class of minimal shape decompositions will be nice if the input shape (current) is nice. These notes are an exposition of the paper by Ibrahim, Krishnamoorthy and Vixie which can be found on the arXiv: 1411. 0882 and any reference to these notes, should include a reference to that paper as well.
