5|$|Jesus {{is called}} a τέκτων (tektōn) in , {{traditionally}} understood as carpenter but could cover makers of objects in various materials, including builders. The gospels indicate that Jesus could read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, but this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> he received formal scribal training.|$|E

This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the asset will be used whenever the four conditions above are present. Such a decision would be considered only if there were further conditions, for example, {{the nature of a}} given conflict and judgment, goals, alternative means, and judgment of utility.|$|E
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> their number {{reflects}} the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} lands of Robert d'Oilly, who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence for this is that Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of {{the lands of}} William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E
5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> there was an overt struggle between the worship of the Anglo-Saxon gods and the worship of Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} there will be a {{significant}} amount for distribution after the costs of sequestration have been satisfied <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> sequestration will be to the advantage of creditors.

25|$|Referring to {{statistical}} significance <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the overall result is significant {{in real world}} terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.|$|E

25|$|When {{selecting}} a TIM, {{care must be}} taken with the values supplied by the manufacturer. Most manufacturers give a value for the thermal conductivity of a material. However, the thermal conductivity {{does not take into account}} the interface resistances.

25|$|Tolkien's {{painting}} of an eagle on a crag appears in some editions of The Hobbit. According to Christopher Tolkien, the author based this picture on {{a painting by}} Archibald Thorburn of an immature golden eagle, which Christopher found for him in The Birds of the British Isles by Thomas Coward. However, Tolkien's use of this model <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> his birds were ordinary golden eagles.|$|E
25|$|Social nudity {{describes}} the nude {{appearance of the}} human body in relatively public settings not restricted by gender. This occurs both in public spaces and on commercial property, such as at a naturist resort. It is sometimes controversial for addressing and exploring a myriad of sometimes taboo subjects, stereotypes, and mores. Although many issues are discussed, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> they occur frequently.|$|E

25|$|Amsterdam is {{much younger}} than Dutch cities such as Nijmegen, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. In October 2008, {{historical}} geographer Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed {{as early as the}} late 10th century. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> there was already a settlement then, since reclamation of land may not have been for farming—it may have been for peat, for use as fuel.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, however, kuru reached {{epidemic}} proportions in certain Papua New Guinean communities, therefore suggesting that vCJD {{may also have}} a similar incubation period of 20 to 50 years. A critique to this theory is that while mortuary cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s, that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the practice ended. Fifteen years later Jared Diamond was informed by Papuans that the practice continued. Kuru may have passed to the Fore people through {{the preparation of the}} dead body for burial.|$|E
25|$|Euoplocephalus had {{relatively}} small eyes, but this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> it had restricted vision. The complex respiratory passages {{observed in the}} skull suggest that Euoplocephalus had {{a good sense of}} smell, although in 1978 an examination of casts of the endocranium did not show an enlarged olfactory region of the brain. Teresa Maryanska, who has worked extensively on Mongolian ankylosaurids, suggested that the respiratory passages were primarily used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones, which are present in Euoplocephalus.|$|E

25|$|The {{right to}} be heard refers to the right for a party's case to be heard before a {{decision}} is made. Even if a statute does not state the requirement for a hearing, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> a hearing will never be required. However, this right is neither automatic nor absolute. For instance, in Yong Vui Kong, the Court of Appeal noted that at common law a convicted offender seeking mercy had no {{right to be}} heard during the clemency process. In Singapore, this situation is reflected by the absence of any provision in Article 22P of the Constitution for an offender to be heard during the clemency process.|$|E
25|$|Drinking {{water supply}} and {{sanitation}} in Pakistan is characterized by some achievements and many challenges. Despite high population growth the country has increased the share of the population with access to an improved water source from 85% in 1990 to 92% in 2010, although this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the water from these sources is safe to drink. The share with access to improved sanitation increased from 27% to 48% during the same period, according to the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation. There has also been considerable innovation at the grass-root level, in particular concerning sanitation. The Orangi Pilot Project in Karachi and community-led total sanitation in rural areas are two examples of such innovation.|$|E
25|$|Based on a {{research}} by Callieri, {{most of the}} symbols of the Frataraka's coins like the flag, the memorial building and the appearing posture of the person standing opposite to it are derived from the Achaemenids. Daryaee believes that though the Fratarakas probably {{did not know the}} proper application of a building like Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, it still had an ideological importance to them. Therefor, it can be deduced from the similarity of Ardashir's coins with the late coins of local Persian governors there was a movement based on Persian traditions and the local Persian governors' adornment of it. However that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Ardashir was related to the local Persian shahs in all affairs.|$|E
