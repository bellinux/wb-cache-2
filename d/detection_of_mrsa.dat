40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{occurrence}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is still increasing worldwide and {{is associated with}} significant morbidity, mortality and hospital costs. Screening for MRSA {{plays a key role}} in limiting further nosocomial spread of this organism. Control measures require a rapid and sensitive test for direct <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> carriage. This study evaluated an easy-to-use PCR-hybridisation assay for the direct <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> in clinical swab specimens. In total, 508 pairs of swabs from 242 patients at risk for MRSA carriage were analysed by the standard culture method and the PCR assay. One swab was used for PCR and culture, while the second was used for culture only. Of the 508 pairs tested, 37 were positive by culture and 35 were positive by PCR. Among the 471 culture-negative specimens, 465 were negative by PCR and six were PCR-positive. The PCR assay had a sensitivity of 94. 59 %, a specificity of 98. 73 %, a positive predictive value of 85. 37 %, and a negative predictive value of 99. 57 %.

40|$|The global {{epidemiology}} of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{is characterized}} by different clonal lineages with different epidemiological behaviour. There are pandemic hospital clones (hospital-associated (HA-) MRSA), clones mainly causing community-acquired infections (community-associated (CA-) MRSA, mainly USA 300) and an animal-associated clone (ST 398) emerging in European and American livestock with subsequent spread to humans. Nosocomial transmission capacities (RA) <b>of</b> these different <b>MRSA</b> types have never been quantified. Using two large datasets from MRSA outbreaks in Dutch hospitals (dataset 1, the UMC Utrecht for 144 months; dataset 2, 51 hospitals for six months) and a recently developed mathematical model, we determined the genotype-specific RA for ST 398 and non-ST 398 isolates (categorized as HA-MRSA), using observational data, the <b>detection</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> carriage and the discharge rate from hospital as the input. After <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> 42 <b>MRSA</b> index cases in dataset 1 (all non-ST 398 MRSA) 5076 people were screened, yielding 30 secondary cases. In dataset 2, 75 index cases (51 non-ST 398 MRSA and 24 ST 398) resulted in 7892 screened individuals and 56 and three secondary cases for non-ST 398 MRSA and ST 398, respectively. The ratio between discharge and the detection rate was 2. 7. RA values (95 % confidence interval (CI)) were 0. 68 (0. 47 – 0. 95) for non-ST 398 MRSA in dataset 1, 0. 93 (0. 71 – 1. 21) for non-ST 398 MRSA in dataset 2 and 0. 16 (0. 04 – 0. 40) for ST 398.

In this study we evaluated various early warning algorithms for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> an <b>MRSA</b> cluster. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between 1998 and 2003, 557 non-replicate MRSA strains were collected from staff and patients admitted to a German tertiary-care university hospital. The repeat region of the S. aureus protein A (spa) gene {{in each of these}} strains was sequenced. Using epidemiological and typing information for the period 1998 - 2002 as reference data, clusters in 2003 were determined by temporal-scan test statistics. Various early warning algorithms (frequency, clonal, and infection control professionals [ICP] alerts) were tested in a prospective analysis for the year 2003. In addition, a newly implemented automated clonal alert system of the Ridom StaphType software was evaluated. A total of 549 <b>of</b> 557 <b>MRSA</b> were typeable using spa sequencing. When analyzed using scan test statistics, 42 out <b>of</b> 175 <b>MRSA</b> in 2003 formed 13 significant clusters (p < 0. 05).

Bacterial recovery was significantly higher with ESwab ([*]<[*] 0. 01, for both MRSA screening and wounds, quantitative/semi-quantitative method). This lead to a slightly higher <b>detection</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> (128 vs. 124 MRSA-positive ESwabs and dry swabs, respectively, =[*] 0. 50) and a higher <b>detection</b> rate <b>of</b> coagulase-negative spp. (44 isolates with ESwab vs. 29 with Amies gel swab, =[*] 0. 001) and spp. (15 isolates with ESwab vs. 7 isolates with Amies gel swab, =[*] 0. 005) with ESwab (quantitative method).

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an {{important}} nosocomial infection problem. Colonization {{appears to be more}} common than invasive disease is. Eradication of colonization or the carrier state could limit the spread <b>of</b> <b>MRSA,</b> thus reducing the potential for mortality and morbidity in other patients. The <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> patients with <b>MRSA</b> infection in a rehabilitation ward led to a study of the combination of novobiocin-rifampin in vivo and in vitro. We found that 300 mg of rifampin plus 500 mg of novobiocin orally twice daily for 5 days, in 18 courses of treatment given to 12 patients, resulted in the clearing <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> in 79 % of the evaluable courses and 81 % of the evaluable sites. A second course cleared <b>MRSA</b> from one <b>of</b> the patients with a treatment failure. Side effects were not noted. All 18 pretherapy isolates were susceptible to either drug in vitro, but 1 of 2 posttherapy isolates was rifampin resistant. Timed-kill studies demonstrated that the rate of killing was the same with either drug alone or both drugs together. Pretherapy isolates from treatment successes or failure were killed at the same rate by the drug combination. However, with the rifampin-resistant isolate killing ceased after 48 h. Results {{of this study suggest that}} previously untreated patients are likely to have isolates that are susceptible to the combination of drugs and that the combination is commonly effective in eradicating MRSA carriage. Since the regimen is orally administered, and thus convenient, in conjunction with other measures it has the promise of reducing the spread <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> in hospitals...|$|R
40|$|Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an {{established}} pathogen that causes hospital- and community-acquired infections worldwide. The prevalence rate <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> infections {{were reported to}} be the highest in Asia. As there is limited epidemiological study being done in Malaysia, this study aimed to determine the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> infection and the molecular characteristics <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> bacteraemia. Methods: Two hundred and nine MRSA strains from year 2011 to 2012 were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital in Malaysia. The strains were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Patient’s demographic and clinical data were collected and correlated with molecular data by statistical analysis.

40|$|The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{infection}} {{continues to}} rise in many health care settings. Rapid <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> colonization followed by appropriate isolation can reduce transmission and infection. We compared {{the performance of the}} new Roche LightCycler MRSA advanced test to that of the BD GeneOhm MRSA test and culture. Double-headed swabs were used to collect anterior nasal specimens from each subject. For both tests, DNA was extracted and real-time PCR was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. For culture, one swab of the pair was plated directly to CHROMagar MRSA. The swab paired with the BD GeneOhm MRSA test was also placed into an enrichment broth and then plated to CHROMagar MRSA. Colonies resembling staphylococci were con-firmed as S. aureus by standard methods. Discrepant specimens had further testing with additional attempts to grow MRSA as well as sample amplicon sequencing. Agreement between results for the two swabs was 99. 3 % for those with valid results.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{validate}} the primers developed for molecular-based <b>detection</b> and identification <b>of</b> Malaysian clinical isolates of methicilin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using in-silico Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR SYBR with Green I. Rapid molecular diagnostic and risk assessment <b>of</b> the <b>MRSA</b> are possible by real-time PCR SYBR Green I. However, validation of such primers for real-life samples is expensive and time consuming. Hence, development and verification of real-time PCR primers by in-silico PCR can be {{the first step in the}} selection of the most appropriate primers. Three species-specific markers were chosen targeting coa (staphylocoagulase), nuc (thermonuclease) and mecA (methicillin-resistance) and were specifically verified against 35 selected S. aureus strains by using in-silico PCR. For the actual laboratory verification, all of the 3 genes were detected with a single specific melting curve peak (Tm at 76. 16 ± 0. 8 °C, 78. 50 ± 0. 4 °C and 74. 41 ± 0. 6 °C for a coa, nuc and mecA respectively) in 32 bacterial strains including ATCC reference strains. Thus, there is no disagreement between both in-silico PCR and real-time PCR verification and validation of the primers designed for the <b>detection</b> and identification <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> in this study.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Swab-based nasal {{screening}} {{is commonly}} used to identify asymptomatic carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in patients. Bacterial detection depends on the uptake and release capacities of the swabs and on the swabbing technique itself. This study investigates the performance of different swab-types in nasal MRSA-screening by utilizing a unique artificial nose model to provide realistic and standardized screening conditions. METHODS: An anatomically correct artificial nose model was inoculated with a numerically defined mixture <b>of</b> <b>MRSA</b> and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria at quantities of 4 × 10 (2) and 8 × 10 (2) colony forming units (CFU), respectively. Five swab-types were tested following a strict protocol. Bacterial recovery was measured for direct plating and after elution into Amies medium by standard viable count techniques. RESULTS: Mean recovered bacteria quantities varied between 209 and 0 CFU for MRSA, and 365 and 0 CFU for S. epidermidis, resulting swab-type-dependent MRSA-screening-sensitivities ranged between 0 and 100 %. Swabs with nylon flocked tips or cellular foam tips performed significantly better compared to conventional rayon swabs referring to the recovered bacterial yield (p< 0. 001). Best results were obtained by using a flocked swab in combination with Amies preservation medium. Within {{the range of the}} utilized bacterial concentrations, recovery ratios for the particular swab-types were independent of the bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: This study combines a realistic model of a human nose with standardized laboratory conditions to analyze swab-performance in MRSA-screening situations. Therefore, influences by inter-individual anatomical differences as well as diverse colonization densities in patients could be excluded. Recovery rates vary significantly between different swab-types. The choice of the swab has a great impact on the laboratory result. In fact, the swab-type contributes significantly to true positive or false negative <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> nasal <b>MRSA</b> carriage. These findings should be considered when screening a patient...|$|R
