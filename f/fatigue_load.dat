50|$|In true {{corrosion}} fatigue, the fatigue-crack-growth rate {{is enhanced}} by corrosion; this effect is seen in all three regions of the fatigue-crack growth-rate diagram. The diagram {{on the left is}} a schematic of crack-growth rate under true corrosion fatigue; the curve shifts to a lower stress-intensity-factor range in the corrosive environment. The threshold is lower (and the crack-growth velocities higher) at all stress-intensity factors. Specimen fracture occurs when the stress-intensity-factor range is equal to the applicable threshold-stress-intensity factor for stress-corrosion cracking. When attempting to analyze the effects of corrosion fatigue on crack growth in a particular, both corrosion type and <b>fatigue</b> <b>load</b> levels affect crack growth in varying degrees. Common types of corrosion include filiform, pitting, exfoliation, intergranular; each will affect crack growth in a particular material in a distinct way. For instance, pitting will often be the most damaging type of corrosion, degrading a material's performance (by increasing the crack-growth rate) more than any other kind of corrosion; even pits of the order of a material's grain size may substantially degrade a material. The degree to which corrosion affects crack-growth rates also depends on fatigue-load levels; for instance, corrosion can cause a greater increase in crack-growth rates at a low loads than it does at a high load.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} make the wind energy an {{economical}} alternative for energy production, upscaling of turbine to 10 - 15 MW may be necessary to reduce the overall cost of energy production. This production target requires a considerable increase in the turbine size and placing the turbines at high wind speed locations. But increase in turbine size also increases the uneven load distribution across the turbine structure. Therefore an efficient load reduction technique is necessary to increase the turbine reliability in high wind speed locations. Variable speed wind turbine offers most desirable load reduction through actively pitch angle control of turbine blades. Research has shown that the Individual Pitch Control (IPC) is most promising option for turbine load reduction. This thesis work is focused on modelling of a large wind turbine and implementation of a new mutlivariable control concept for turbine load reduction. A detailed mathematical model is designed which includes turbine blade and tower dynamics and a proposed Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) algorithm is implemented for Individual Pitch Control (IPC) loop of wind turbine. Proposed model in this thesis work is derived from the previous turbine model used in ECN with additional tower dynamics. My contribution in turbine modelling portion is to linearize the equations of motion to form a statespace model and to implement LQG algorithm for turbine active load reduction. This proposed method is compared with the previous control technique used in ECN for turbine <b>fatigue</b> <b>load</b> reduction to measure the overall efficiency of the proposed technique. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>load</b> has major effect on the turbine working age. In quantitative way, proposed LGQ design offers 8 - 10 % approx. more <b>fatigue</b> <b>load</b> reduction in comparison with the previous design. In simple convention, decrease in turbine <b>fatigue</b> <b>load</b> increases the turbine age. This 8 - 10 % <b>fatigue</b> <b>load</b> reduction offers 8 - 10 % minimum increase in turbine working age which means that if a turbine works for 20 years in total for energy production, this proposed technique will add 2 extra years into the turbine working life.
