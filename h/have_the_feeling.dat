Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I {{think there will be a}} lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago." [...] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed [...] "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E

He wished that viewers got {{to see more of}} Chris's {{thoughts}} and feelings and less of how his situation affected the people around him. Langford added [...] "I do like that Chris isn't a perfect kid. Many shows tend to make gay teens near saints. Instead, he's a fairly average kid who makes mistakes and messes up, like starting a fight at a basketball game. In July 2011, Langford revealed that he had seen some comments from people thinking that Lucas and Chris should be paired up. He opined {{that there is not a}} hint of romance between the two and wondered why people assumed that if a gay character shares a scene with another guy, they must get together. Langford revealed that he liked Chris and Lucas's mentor and mentee relationship as it is. The writer also commented on the introduction of Chris's father and said that he was [...] "delighted" [...] that Chris was finally getting his own drama, that was [...] "pretty realistic." [...] He added [...] "It's nice to see the father/son dynamic play out. I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that a lot of Chris's dad's issues stem from the fact that his son is gay and I hope the show will delve into those unresoved issues." ...|$|E

As a child, Tajiri enjoyed insect collecting as a hobby, which would be an inspiration for his later video game work. Other children called him [...] "Dr. Bug", and he wanted to become an entomologist. As urban areas of Japan spread and more land was paved over, habitats for hunting bugs were lost.

He claimed that Chernobyl had strengthened [...] "a growing impulse to escape from the nightmare of peace being dependent upon the contemplation of horrific and mutual carnage.

2500|$|Obsessions are {{thoughts}} that recur and persist despite efforts to ignore or confront them. People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or compulsions, to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, {{vary in their}} clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying or intrusions related to [...] "relationship rightness". Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies, or <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that inanimate objects are ensouled.|$|E

I kind of have an idea though, and it's very rough right now. So I'm very eager to start that." [...] Sean Garrett spoke on the album's sound saying it was [...] "a great mish-mash of genres". Rihanna revealed during an interview with GQ's [...] "Men of the Year" [...] that she wanted her music to be uplifting saying [...] "I want to make music that’s hopeful, uplifting. Nothing corny or supersentimental. I just want it to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that brings you out of whatever you’re going through. I want it to spark that fire.

2500|$|By {{that point}} in his life, Negoiţescu made himself known as the ideologue of his generation, {{expanding}} his cultural horizon and familiarizing himself with the Classics, with German philosophy, and with the main works of Romanticism, while dedicating his efforts to promoting the work of isolated young authors such as Stanca and Mircea Streinul. He had slowly moved into the anti-fascist camp, objecting to both the Iron Guard and its partner-rival, the authoritarian general and newly appointed Conducător Ion Antonescu. In 1941, he published Povestea tristă a lui Ramon Ocg ("The Sad Story of Ramon Ocg"), a lengthy prose poem which he presented as a novel. That same year, in autumn, he traveled to {{the capital city of}} Bucharest, visiting modernist critic and theorist Eugen Lovinescu, the doyen of a literary circle known as Sburătorul. Negoiţescu, who had just purchased himself the new critical synthesis newly published by Lovinescu's rival George Călinescu, commented on its strengths and weaknesses with his host. The meeting left an impression on Lovinescu, whose diary for that day reads: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> he is 'different', he is an 'exceptional' young man, who is set to have a singular destiny." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly. Ionesco accused Sartre of {{supporting}} Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote Rhinoceros as {{a criticism of}} blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; {{at the end of}} the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros [...] Sartre criticized Rhinoceros by questioning: [...] "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there". [...] Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution. In a 1966 interview, Claude Bonnefoy, comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, [...] "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".|$|E
