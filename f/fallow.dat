5|$|Herds {{of red and}} <b>fallow</b> deer also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull {{takes place}} each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its <b>fallow</b> deer, which can {{frequently}} be seen in herds {{to the north of}} the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black <b>fallow</b> deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of <b>fallow</b> and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.|$|E

5|$|Between 1833 and 1842 the Petersham Lodge estate, {{and then}} part of Sudbrook Park, were {{incorporated}} into Richmond Park. Terrace Walk was created from Richmond Gate to Pembroke Lodge. The Russell School was built near Petersham Gate in 1851. Between 1855 and 1861, new drainage improvements were constructed, including drinking points for deer. In 1867 and 1876 <b>fallow</b> deer from the park were sent to New Zealand to help build up stocks – the first <b>fallow</b> deer introduced to that country In or around 1870, the Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers were using an area near Bog Gate as a drill ground. Giuseppe Garibaldi, Italian general and politician, visited Lord John Russell at Pembroke Lodge in 1864, as did the Shah of Persia, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar in 1873. He was the first modern Iranian monarch to visit Europe.|$|E

This animal was introduced to the area in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Khmer Loeu {{typically}} practice subsistence slash {{and burn}} shifting cultivation in small villages of between 20 and 60 nuclear families. Each village collectively owns and governs a forest territory whose boundaries are known though not marked. Within this land, each family is allocated, on average, 1–2hectares (2.5–5acres) of actively cultivated land and 5–6hectares (12.5–15acres) of <b>fallow</b> land. The ecologically sustainable cultivation cycle {{practiced by the}} Khmer Loeu generally lasts 10 to 15 years. Villagers supplement their agricultural livelihood with low-intensity hunting, fishing, and gathering over a large area.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and <b>fallow</b> deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E

30|$|As noticed {{from the}} discussion, {{farmers in the}} study area practiced <b>fallowing</b> not {{deliberately}} for restoring soil fertility; rather it was due to very low return from it (i.e., when the cultivable land has reached {{the point of no return}} in crop yield). The small size of farmland {{in the study area}} (WZFEDD 2012) is one of the main motivations for limited <b>fallowing.</b> Reports in different parts of Ethiopia also documented the limited practice of <b>fallowing</b> due to small landholdings (Pound and Jonfa 2005; Abera and Belachew 2011; Tekeste et al. 2015). Continuous cultivation without <b>fallowing</b> the land could affect soil quality and productivity (Yimer and Abdulkadir 2011; Tematio et al. 2011; Oriola and Bamidele 2012).|$|R
40|$|Results {{based on}} a {{socioeconomic}} survey on flood plain forest <b>fallows</b> are presented.

Furthermore, forest conversion and re-conversion processes are a function of community age and parcel size. Over 50 % of landholders manage their forest <b>fallows</b> mainly to encourage two tree species: Calycophyllum spruceanum (capiro na) and Cedrela odorata (cedro).

A small garden behind the house, overlooking the deer park, Moorish in style with a central fountain, has been restored to its former glory. Brown's beech clumps survive in the present day.|$|E
5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let <b>fallow</b> and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays <b>fallow</b> {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effect of <b>fallowing</b> of {{southern}} blue-fin tuna farms in southern Spencer Gulf, South Australia, on macrobenthic assemblage comparing spatial and temporal patterns of distribution and abundance at eight control sites and eight <b>fallowed</b> pontoon sites, during the period October 2002 to October 2003. Two stations at each site were sampled five times throughout the year with four replicates. Polychaetes were the most abundant organisms both at control sites (76. 4 %) and <b>fallowed</b> pontoon sites (80. 5 %). Five dominant taxa (Capitellidae, Cirratullidae, Lumbrineridae, Nephtyidae, and Spionidae), relatively tolerant to organic enrichment, were generally recorded in higher numbers at the <b>fallowed</b> sites than at control sites. Assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses, a significant difference in abundance between the control and <b>fallowed</b> pontoon sites was found, which also showed a significant effect of time. A slight decreased in diversity, number of taxa, and evenness at <b>fallowed</b> pontoon sites compared to those at control sites was observed. Seasonal fluctuations caused by natural variability, especially hydrodynamic conditions and sediment characteristics, are likely to be responsible for the observed changes of the assemblages...|$|R

5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, <b>fallow</b> deer and musk deer. The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E
5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and <b>fallow</b> fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E
