5|$|Although a large <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> not {{required}} to carry an armoured knight, it is held by some historians that a large horse was desirable to increase {{the power of a}} lance strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.|$|E
5|$|Dark <b>Horse</b> <b>is</b> {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living in the Material World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark <b>Horse</b> <b>is</b> {{associated with the}} controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour {{by a member of}} the Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{exhibit a}} {{diverse array of}} coat colors and {{distinctive}} markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex. Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings, which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} animal symbol of Canada. In 1909, the Canadian Parliament {{declared}} it the national breed of the country, and in 2002 was made an official animal symbol of Canada by Parliamentary Act. In 2010, the provincial legislature of Quebec named it a heritage breed of the province.|$|E
5|$|The Spotted Saddle <b>Horse</b> <b>is</b> a horse breed {{from the}} United States that was {{developed}} by crossing Spanish-American type gaited pinto ponies with gaited horse breeds, such as the Tennessee Walking Horse. The result was a colorful, smooth-gaited horse, used in the show ring and for pleasure and trail riding. Two registries have been created for the breed, one in 1979 {{and the other in}} 1985. The two have similar registration requirements, although one has an open stud book and the other is slightly more strict with regard to parentage requirements, having a semi-closed stud book. The Spotted Saddle <b>Horse</b> <b>is</b> a light riding horse, always pinto in color. Solid-colored foals from registered parents may be registered for identification purposes, so their pinto-colored foals have documented parentage. They always perform an ambling gait, rather than a trot, in addition to the gaits of walk and canter, performed by all breeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Quarter <b>Horse</b> <b>were</b> prevalent in America in the early 17th century. These <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> a blend of Colonial Spanish horses crossed with English <b>horses</b> that <b>were</b> brought over in the 1700s. The native horse and the English <b>horse</b> <b>were</b> bred together, resulting in a compact, muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The American Quarter <b>Horse</b> <b>was</b> not recognized as an official breed until {{the formation of the}} American Quarter Horse Association in 1940.|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war ended, the division's <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> taken to the Imperial Remount Depot at Moascar in Egypt. The riding <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{eventually}} reissued, when required, to units of the British Empire. The heavier pack and draught <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> now redundant, so these were shipped to France and sold.|$|R
50|$|There <b>are</b> {{currently}} seven <b>horses</b> in the MPU. The <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> all Standard Bred {{horses and}} range from 14 {{years of age}} to 4 years of age.

5|$|The <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{owned by}} Michael Lauffer and W.D. Cubbedge. Lauffer was {{previously}} a {{co-owner of the}} filly Rachel Alexandra, prior to her 2009 Preakness win. Initially, Lauffer and Cubbedge had put Shackleford up for sale as a yearling at the Keeneland auction, but when the bids failed to reach the reserve price of $275,000, Cubbedge and Lauffer bought back the colt and kept him.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rare solid-colored horse (usually bay or black), most Lipizzans are gray. Like all gray horses, they have black skin, dark eyes, and as adult horses, a white hair coat. Gray horses, {{including}} Lipizzans, are born darkusually bay or blackand become lighter each {{year as the}} graying process takes place, with the process being complete at between 6 and 10 years of age. Lipizzans are not actually true white horses, {{but this is a}} common misconception. A white <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> born white and has unpigmented skin.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E

50|$|In 1952 the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered}} on Takarajima by Shigeyuki Hayashida, {{a professor of}} Kagoshima University, and designated the Tokara <b>horse.</b> It <b>was</b> theorized that the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> brought to Takarajima from Kikaijima around 1900. In 1953, the Tokara <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> designated a natural monument of Kagoshima. When Professor Hayashida first discovered the horses, he counted 43. Their numbers gradually declined during the 1960s because of agricultural mechanization, however, and {{it was difficult to}} monitor the population on Takarajima. Therefore, some of the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> transferred to the Mt. Kaimon Natural Park and Iriki Farm, part of the agricultural department of Kagoshima University.|$|R
5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|In {{a popular}} oleograph {{representation}} of Khandoba, Mhalsa is seated {{in front of}} Khandoba on his white horse. Mhalsa is piercing a demon's chest with a spear, while a dog is biting his thigh and the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> hitting his head. The other demon is grabbing the reins of the horse and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting the horse and attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen seated on a horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's hooves or their heads under Khandoba's knees.|$|E
5|$|In the rideability test, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{evaluated}} {{by a member}} of the studbook evaluation committee by being ridden at a walk, trot and canter. The horse's movement, balance and disposition are evaluated and given 4 to 10 points. The horse should express cooperation, gentleness, attentiveness, sensitivity to cues, and active effort. This test is required for riding-type horses, and optional for pony-sized horses in lieu of the driveability test.|$|E
500|$|The {{value of}} <b>horses</b> <b>was</b> known to all. In 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, {{men at the}} front {{understood}} that [...] "at this stage to lose a <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> worse than losing a man because after all, men <b>were</b> replaceable while <b>horses</b> weren't." [...] For Britain, <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> considered so valuable that if a soldier's <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> killed or died he was required to cut off a hoof {{and bring it back}} to his commanding officer to prove that the two had not simply become separated.|$|R

The Fiddlers Three public house, located at Albion Street, is another older stone building with modern catering facilities. The Black House Inn, evidenced as the Coal Waggon Inn on ordnance survey maps in 1862 at the junction of Carr Hill Road and Co-operative Terrace, was partially demolished in 2011 {{to make way for a}} Tesco Extra store.|$|E
5|$|The Andalusian <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{descended from}} the Iberian horses of Spain and Portugal, and derives its name from its place of origin, the Spanish region of Andalusia. Cave {{paintings}} show that horses have been present on the Iberian Peninsula {{as far back as}} 20,000 to 30,000BCE. Although Portuguese historian Ruy d'Andrade hypothesized that the ancient Sorraia breed was an ancestor of the Southern Iberian breeds, including the Andalusian, genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA show that the Sorraia is part of a genetic cluster that is largely separated from most Iberian breeds.|$|E
5|$|The Associacion Mexicana de Criadores de Caballos de Raza Azteca, or Mexican Breeders Association for the Azteca <b>Horse,</b> <b>is</b> the {{original}} breed registry and still maintains the international registry. The International Azteca Horse Association and its regional affiliates {{was formed in}} 1992. The majority of Aztecas are found in Mexico, and the Mexican association had registered between 10,000 and 15,000 horses as of 2005, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture. The Mexican registry adds approximately 1,000 horses per year.|$|E
50|$|In early years, <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{incredibly}} important to {{farmers in the}} Montmartre area, as they were the primary work animals on a farm. As farms became larger, more land was broken for raising crops. <b>Horses</b> <b>were</b> instrumental in {{the breaking of the}} land, as well as the subsequent farming activities. Steel plows were used by farmers, and required the strength of horses to pull them as they turned up the soil for planting. As plows became larger and more complex, more <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> required. <b>Horses</b> <b>were</b> also required to pull seeding and harvest equipment.|$|R

50|$|Where <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> used {{they were}} worked in shifts and changed {{several times a}} day. The {{nature of the work}} was such that the typical working life of a tramway <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> about four years. Though Christchurch’s flat terrain was {{favourable}} to the operation of tramways the task of the tramway <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> made more difficult upon occasion by the overloading of tramcars.|$|R
5|$|The Banker <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> a {{breed of}} feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) living on barrier islands in North Carolina's Outer Banks. It is small, hardy, {{and has a}} docile temperament. Descended from domesticated Spanish horses and {{possibly}} brought to the Americas in the 16th century, the ancestral foundation bloodstock may have become feral after surviving shipwrecks or being abandoned on the islands {{by one of the}} exploratory expeditions led by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón or Sir Richard Grenville. Populations are found on Ocracoke Island, Shackleford Banks, Currituck Banks, and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|The Nokota <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> a feral and semi-feral horse breed {{located in}} the {{badlands}} of southwestern North Dakota in the United States. The breed developed in the 19th century from foundation bloodstock consisting of ranch-bred horses produced from the horses of local Native Americans mixed with Spanish horses, Thoroughbreds, harness horses and related breeds. The Nokota was almost wiped out during the early 20th century when ranchers, in cooperation with state and federal agencies, worked together to reduce competition for livestock grazing. However, when Theodore Roosevelt National Park {{was created in the}} 1940s, a few bands were inadvertently trapped inside, and thus were preserved.|$|E
5|$|The general {{drivability}} test {{is performed}} by trotter stallions. It is optional for draught type horses {{in lieu of}} the pulling test, and for pony-sized horses {{in lieu of the}} rideability test. The <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> driven by two different members of the studbook evaluation committee during this test, and asked to perform at a walk and trot. Its cooperation and disposition are evaluated on a scale of 4 to 10 points.|$|E
