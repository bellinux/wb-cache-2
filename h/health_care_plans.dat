He particularly argued that President Obama's <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> made maintaining the U.S.' superpower status harder, that withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq occurred prematurely while making another war there more likely, and that the initial U.S. victory in Afghanistan had been undone by government complacency though forces could still pull off a victory. He also wrote op-eds criticizing planned budget austerity measures in both the U.S. and the U.K. as hurting their national security interests.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans,</b> while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E

25|$|In August 2007, at the Florida Medical Association, Romney {{unveiled}} {{his proposed}} {{national health care}} plan, which departed significantly from the universal health care measure that he helped forge as governor of Massachusetts.

2500|$|On April 7, 2014, Carney {{introduced}} the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014 (H.R. 4414; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would exempt expatriate <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> from {{the requirements of}} the Affordable Care Act. Carney argued that expatriates, a group that includes businessmen, pilots, and ship captains, usually already have special, high-quality <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> designed to meet the unique needs to expatriates. Carney said that [...] "expatriate health insurance plans offer high-end, robust coverage to executives and others working outside their home country, giving them access to a global network of health care providers."

Heavy regulation of insurance companies helps reduce the cost to employers.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to poor living conditions, low vaccination rates cause excess cases of disease in slums as well. Slum children {{are less likely}} to be vaccinated mainly because some slum dwellers refuse vaccinations without understanding its importance or no one at home is able to take the child to health sectors for vaccinations. Lack of reliable data also has a negative impact on slum dwellers' health. A number of slum families do not report cases or seek professional medical care, which results in insufficient data. This might prevent appropriate allocation of health care resources in slum areas since many countries base their <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> on data from clinic, hospital, or national mortality registry. [...] Moreover, health service does not exist in most of the world's slums. Emergency ambulance service and urgent care is typically unavailable in slums. Health service providers avoid servicing slums. A study shows that more than half of slum dwellers are prone to visit private practitioners or seek self-medication with medicines available in the home. Private practitioners in slums are usually those who are unlicensed or poorly trained and they run clinics and pharmacies mainly for the sake of money. Recent study has shown that there has been substantial improvement in the health awareness of the slum dwellers of Mumbai with regards to HIV/AIDS and Diabetes ...|$|E
