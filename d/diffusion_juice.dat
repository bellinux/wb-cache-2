A by-product (concentrate) of ultrafiltration contains {{a large amount of}} sucrose, but due to its properties, it is difficult to manage. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of the temperature used during drying of <b>diffusion</b> <b>juice</b> concentrates on the content of certain components and characteristics of resultant preparations. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>juice</b> obtained from one of the Polish sugar plants was subjected to ultrafiltration and the obtained concentrates were dried in a spray dryer. In the dried samples, the following parameters were analyzed: dry mass, sucrose, total ash, protein, crude fiber and color. It has been declared that the degree of concentration and drying temperature influenced the chemical composition and the properties of the dehydrated <b>diffusion</b> <b>juice</b> concentrates. An increase in drying temperature was accompanied by the increased content of dry mass, protein, ash and fiber content in the preparations. The greater the degree of juice concentration, the greater was the content of dry mass, ash, and fiber. Inversely, the greater the degree of juice concentration, the lower the content of sucrose. The brightest color of the dehydrated product was observed at the drying temperature of 200 °C. Spray-drying may be used for waste management after the <b>diffusion</b> <b>juice</b> membrane filtration, and the resultant preparations might be used in the production of feedstuff or food industry in general e. g. as sucrose source, in fermentation processes or in microorganisms propagation...|$|E

40|$|Sugar, {{with good}} taste and high caloric, {{is one of}} the most popular human food. Consumers sugar must be sure that the sugar under normal {{conditions}} of use is of high quality and is not harmful to the health of the product. One reason for the decline in the quality of sugar is bacterial contamination. This is because the sugar industry products are good targets for the development of different groups of microorganisms, e. g., Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringes, Leuconostoc dextranicum, Torula alba, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Sarcina lutea and others. These organisms are affected with beets, and then with sugar beet chips and <b>diffusion</b> <b>juice</b> fall into the processing line of sugar production. Their number in the <b>diffusion</b> <b>juice</b> varies and depends on many facto rs such as the quality of raw materials, the quality of cleaning beet root colonization of transporter-washing and the supply of water to the diffusion process, the temperature of the diffusion and others. In the diffusion unit has the most favorable conditions for the development of micro-organisms. Some of them, especially resistant bacteria and thermophilic bacteria or their spores, forming a capsule which protects against external influences occur in the final product sugar. When injected into the fresh crop of product (juice, syrup), they begin to multiply rapidly, causing difficulties in the process. The higher seeding beet microorganisms, the more they decompose and emit sucrose metabolism byproducts. To reduce the negative impact of microbiological and reduce losses from decomposition of sucrose conducted research on the possibility of using chlorine-containing substances in the sugar industry.

40|$|Summary. Application of slanted {{diffusers}} {{is accompanied}} with irregular heating of juice- and chips mixture {{in the unit}} length, which reduces the degree of extraction of sucrose from chips and microorganisms intensive growth inside the apparatuses, increases the sucrose loss during the extraction {{and the time of}} the whole process. A method for preprocessing of beet chips prior to extraction with hot solutions of chemical agents was suggested. It was experimentally found out that the best quality indicators are inherent to the juice obtained from chips treated with a solution of 0. 05 % aluminum sulfate or with 0. 10 % bleach solution. Thermal processing of beet chips with the solutions of Al 2 (SO 4) 3 with a concentration of 0. 05 % and bleach with a concentration of 0. 10 % results in a gradual beet chips uniform heating and denaturation of the proteins, which increases the mass transfer coefficient of sugarbeet tissue, increasing its permeability. Beet chips surface washing aluminum sulfate solution reduces the solubility of the protein and pectin substances, increasing the strength and elasticity of beet chips. pH of the medium is stabilized, which reduces the transition of non-sugars from beet chips into the <b>diffusion</b> <b>juice</b> in the process of sucrose extraction. Combination of thermal and chemical treatment allows to stabilize the colloids of sugarbeet tissue and to heat beet chips to the optimum temperature of the diffusion process of 70 - 72 °C before entering the diffusion apparatus and to improve its structural and mechanical properties. The use of preliminary heat treatment of beet chips: improves the efficiency of diffusion processes; blocks the transition of substances of protein-pectin complex of beet chips into the raw juice, whereby their content in the <b>diffusion</b> <b>juice</b> is reduced; reduces the color of purified juice by 15. 1 %, the content of calcium salts by 31. 3 % in comparison with the standard method; -improves the purity of the purified juice by 1. 2 %.

In-vitro INFOGEST oral-gastric digestion protocol was performed for steamed and fried sweet potatoes cubes (5 × 5 mm 2). Solid loss, ß-carotene loss and hardness changes were measured after 8 digestion times (0 to 240 min). Softening half time (t 1 / 2) during digestion was estimated using the Weibull model. Light and scanning electronic microscopy were used to study the change in microstructure after digestion. The effective diffusivity of gastric juice into cylindrical steamed and fried sweet potatoes (2 cm diameter, 2. 5 cm length) was determined using the Fick's second law.

Main liming process preceded progressive preliming, not only where the epimerization faster but less stable, and the decomposition of fructose in the composition of the reducing substances to produce reactive products influencing the alkalinity of the solution and the surface state of microparticles of calcium hydroxide. The presence on the surface OH-groups and the appearance of tumors in the working environment, having in their structures group (= CO), (= O), (- СОН) contributes to the appearance of induced hydrogen bonds and partial reduction of the specific surface of the mass transfer between the solid particles and the components of the solution.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Methodology for {{characterization}} of the phenolic profile of apple, pear and grape juice was developed. It utilized High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for separation of individual phenolic compounds and Diode Array Detection for recording the Ultra-violet (UV) spectrum of chromatographic peaks. The high resolution achieved {{and the ability of}} recording more than one wavelength simultaneously, allowed for quantitation of phenolic acids (cinnamics and benzoics), flavonol and dihydrochalcone glycosides, arbutin and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with minimum sample preparation. Quantitation of procyanidins, however, required preliminary isolation and analysis in a separate run. Procyanidin isolation based on Sephadex IH- 20 resulted in high recoveries and degree of reproducibility. The methodology was applied to study the influence of variety, post-harvest storage, SO₂, initial high temperature short time (HTST) heat treatment, enzymatic clarification, fining, bottling, concentration and storage on the phenolic composition of apple, pear and grape juice. Processing with SO₂ inhibited extensive phenolic oxidation during pulping and resulted in increased phenolic yields. Initial HIST treatment protected phenolics extracted in the juioe from degradation during processing. Cinnamic hydrolysis occurred during enzymatic clarification. The hydrolytic activity was removed with fining or bottling. There was no appcirent reduction of phenolics with fining. Procyanidins were sensitive to the heat applied during bottling and concentration. Storage of juice concentrates for nine months at 25 °C resulted in formation of HMF, considerable degradation of cinnamics and dihydrochaloones and total loss of procyanidins and flavonols.

In the case of a thaw roots that have been defrosted unsuitable for processing. Beet and products of its processing is a good object for the development of microorganisms. Permanent microflora of sugar production are: Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringes, Leuconostoc dextranicum, Torula alba, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Sarcina lutea and other kinds of microorganisms, leading to a problem processing of beet root and reduced quality of sugar. The most dangerous is the slimy bacteriosis is a bacterial disease beet caused by heterofermentative cocci of Leuconostoc (Leuconostoc mesenteroides, L. dextranicum). Product of the vital activity of microorganisms is dextran, which is synthesized from sucrose as a result of dextrany or mucous fermentation and leads to significant technological problems in processing of infected beet. Improving the efficiency of sugar production is connected with decrease in loss of quality of raw material preparation, storing and processing of sugar beet.
