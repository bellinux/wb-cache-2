25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the <b>elastic</b> <b>range</b> when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E
6000|$|... (M140) My {{readers have}} had {{opportunity}} enough of judging Mr. Gladstone’s {{estimate of the}} Queen’s shrewdness, simplicity, high manners. Above all, he constantly said how warmly he recognised her sincerity, frankness, straight-forwardness, and love of truth. On the other side, his own eager mobility, versatility, and wide <b>elastic</b> <b>range</b> was {{not likely to be}} to the taste of a personage with a singular fixity of nature. Then the Queen was by the necessity of her station a politician, as was Elizabeth or George III., although oddly enough she had a bitter dislike of what she thought the madness of “women’s rights.” As politician, she often took views that were not shared either by the constituencies or by the ministers whom the constituencies imposed upon her. The Queen in truth excellently represented and incorporated in her proper person one whole set of those qualities in our national character, on which the power of her realm had been built up. Mr. Gladstone stood for a different and in some aspects and on some occasions almost an antagonistic set of national qualities. The Queen, according to those who knew her well,(276) dreaded what in the eighteenth century they called enthusiasm: she dreaded or disdained it in religion, and in politics almost more. Yet her Englishmen are full of capacity for enthusiasm, and the Scots for whom she had such cordial affection have enthusiasm in measure fuller still. Unhappily, in the case of Ireland that occupied so much of Mr. Gladstone’s life, her sympathies with his long and vigorous endeavour notoriously stood at zero. The Queen’s loyalty to the constitution and to ministers in office was unquestioned, but she was not well placed, nor was she perhaps by character well fitted, to gauge the fluctuating movements of an age of change, as it was the duty of her statesmen to gauge and plumb them. If a cabinet with the confidence of the House of Commons decides upon a policy, it must obviously be a premier’s duty to persist, and in that duty Mr. Gladstone was resolute. If he had been otherwise, he knew that he would be falling short in loyalty to the country, and to its chief magistrate most of all.|$|E

40|$|The {{difficult}} current environmental situation, {{caused by}} construction industry residues containing ceramic materials, {{could be improved}} by using these materials as recycled aggregates in mortars, with their processing causing a reduction in their use in landfill, contributing to recycling and also minimizing the consumption of virgin materials. Although some research is currently being carried out into recycled mortars, {{little is known about}} their stress-strain (s-e); therefore, this work will provide the experimental results obtained from recycled mortars with recycled ceramic aggregates (with contents of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 50 % and 100 %), such as the density and compression strength, as well as the s-e curves representative of their behavior. The values obtained from the analytical process of the results in order to finally obtain, through numerical analysis, the equations to predict their behavior (related to their recycled content) are those of: s (<b>elastic</b> <b>ranges</b> and failure maximum), e (<b>elastic</b> <b>ranges</b> and failure maximum), and Resilience and Toughness. At the end of the investigation, it is established that mortars with recycled ceramic aggregate contents of up to 20 % could be assimilated just like mortars with the usual aggregates, and the obtained prediction equations could be used in cases of similar applications.

The marine platform carbonates and <b>elastics</b> <b>range</b> {{in age from}} early Cambrian to early Triassic. Progressive alternating field and/or thermal demagnetization analyses reveal predominantly single component magnetizations, sometimes of both normal and reverse polarity. These magnetizations, isolated in 457 of the 549 samples studied, typically have directions in geographic coordinates coincident with late Mesozoic to Recent fields. A secondary origin for the magnetizations is supported by negative fold tests in several units. A lower Carboniferous and possibly a lower Triassic limestone may have escaped the pervasive remagnetization; if the remanences isolated are indeed prefolding, a large counterclockwise tectonic rotation of the Nanjing area is implied by comparison with available Carboniferous and Triassic paleopoles reported from elsewhere in South China.

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} BLP {{approach}} to the demand for ready-to-eat cereals (RTECs) at the supermarket-chain level in Boston using IRI monthly data. The Random Coefficient Model is used to estimate the demand for 37 brands of RTECs at the leading supermarkets in the Boston area. The empirical results provide a wealth of consumer behavior information, including own- and cross-price elasticites for 37 brands of RTECs at four leading supermarkets in Boston. The demand for RTECs is generally price <b>elastic</b> (<b>ranging</b> between - 3 and - 8). Consumers respond positively and strongly to promotion, negatively and strongly to price, calories and fiber, and weakly to sugar content. Income has a strong interactive effect with product characteristics and thus is a useful variable for market segmentation. In comparison, the results with the more commonly used Logit model indicate significantly lower price elasticities, provide a limited window on consumer behavior, and yield predicted brand and supermarket market shares that are quite divergent from observed values.

5000|$|Many {{materials}} like {{metals and}} ceramics (but not rubbers and plastics) {{are assumed to}} be perfectly elastic when their yield strength is not approached during impact. The impact energy is theoretically stored only in the spring-effect of elastic compression and results in e = 1. But this applies only at velocities less than about 0.1 m/s to 1 m/s. The <b>elastic</b> <b>range</b> can be exceeded at higher velocities because all the kinetic energy is concentrated at the point of impact. Specifically, the yield strength is usually exceeded in part of the contact area, losing energy to plastic deformation by not remaining in the elastic region. To account for this, the following estimates the COR by estimating the percent of the initial impact energy that did not get lost to plastic deformation. Approximately, it divides how easy a volume of the material can store energy in compression (...) by how well it can stay in the <b>elastic</b> <b>range</b> (...) : ...|$|E

50|$|Solids {{are often}} modeled as linear springs because under {{the action of}} a force they {{contract}} or elongate, and when the force is lifted, they return to their original lengths, like a spring.
