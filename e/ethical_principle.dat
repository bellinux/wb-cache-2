25|$|A modern {{audience}} might admire Batty’s will to {{flee the}} confinements of slavery and perhaps sympathize with his existential struggle to live. Initially, however, his desire to live is subsumed by his desire for power to extend his life. Why? In Heidegger’s view, because death inevitably limits the number of choices we have, freedom is earned by properly concentrating on death. Thoughts of mortality give us a motive for taking life seriously. Batty’s status as a slave identifies him as an object, but his will to power casts him as an agent and subject in the Nietzschean sense. His physical and psychological courage to rebel is developed as an <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> in which he revolts against a social order that has conspired against him at the genetic, cultural, and political levels. In Heidegger’s view, Batty’s willingness to defy social conformity allows for him to authentically pursue the meaning of his existence beyond his programming as a soldier. Confronting his makers becomes part of his quest, but killing them marks his failure to transcend his own nature.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1960s, {{corporate}} {{social responsibility}} has attracted attention from businesses and stakeholders in regard to its benefits and what it is. Corporate social responsibility has been defined differently by different writers {{based on what they}} perceive about the concept. Having learnt from the devastating effects of corporate social irresponsibility, companies are focusing on the impacts of their operations not only on profits but the society and environment at large. Therefore, {{corporate social responsibility}} refers to [...] "the <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> that an organization [...] should be responsible for how its behaviour might affect society and the environment". [...] From 1960, [...] "corporate social responsibility" [...] has remained a term used indiscriminately by many to cover legal and moral responsibility more narrowly construed.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} reasons experimenters decide to self-test, but amongst the most {{fundamental}} is the <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> that the experimenter should not subject {{the participants in the}} experiment to any procedure they would not be willing to undertake themselves. [...] This idea was first codified in the Nuremberg Code in 1947, which was a result of the trials of Nazi doctors at the Nuremberg trials accused of murdering and torturing victims in valueless experiments. [...] Several of these doctors were hanged. [...] Point five of the Nuremberg Code requires that no experiment should be conducted that is dangerous to the subjects unless the experimenters themselves also take part. [...] The Nuremberg Code has influenced medical experiment codes of practice around the world, as has the exposure of experiments that have since failed to follow it such as the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment.|$|E
2500|$|Already in the {{earliest}} Vedic texts, Ṛta as an <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> is linked {{with the notion of}} cosmic retribution. A central concept of the Ṛgveda is that created beings fulfil their true natures when they follow the path set for them by the ordinances of Ṛta, and failing to follow those ordinances was thought to be responsible for the appearance of various forms of calamity and suffering. Committing one's actions to the governance of Ṛta, referred to as its [...] "Dharma", was therefore understood as imperative in ensuring one's own well-being. In this vein, the individual who follows the ordinances of nature can be described as one who acts according to the [...] "Dharma of Ṛta". Dharma, then, was originally conceived of as a [...] "finite or particularized manifestation of Ṛta inasmuch as it represents that aspect of the universal Order which specifically concerns the mundane natural, religious, social and moral spheres as expressed in ritualistic regulations, public laws, moral principles and laws of nature".|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I want to {{consider}} not only <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in disasters, but the relationships between ethics in disasters and ethics in normal situations. To begin with, I define the concept of 'disaster', and make definite the meaning of 'in disaster'. In this paper, I use the period of 'in disaster' as {{the period of the}} impact of the disaster and of emergency phase. <b>Ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in that period are different from those of normal situations; however, as far as I know, I can find only a few papers that deal with the nature of <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in disasters directly. Fortunately, there are a lot of literatures dealing with 'triage' from an ethical viewpoint. Therefore, I will take the approach of, first, examining the <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in triage, and then, on the basis of it, considering the nature of <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in disasters. Here, I stated several ethically important points; such as triage in medical settings is utilitarian but doesn't presuppose the good of the community; <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in disasters are based on the primitive response to the requirement of self-preservation; in a disaster we are permitted to give priority to saving our life; at the base of ordinary ethics there is the factor of self-preservation; even in a disaster, ordinary <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> work secondarily; the situation of disaster is, in some aspects, similar to the state of nature or state of war in social contract theory...|$|R

2500|$|The {{fourth group}} is the [...] "no children" [...] group. Rainey sees couples in this group as believing they are within their Biblical rights to define their lives around non-natal concerns. While not their main {{emphasis}} on the subject, Protestant authors such as Samuel Owen and James B. Jordan support this as an acceptable option, but only when a higher <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> intervenes to make child bearing imprudent, such as health concerns or a calling to serve orphans or as missionaries in a dangerous location, etc. A small activist group, the Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree, argues their position, [...] "Jesus loved children but chose to never have any, {{so that he could}} devote his life to telling the Good News." [...] Jordan also maintains that modern birth control methods, as well as Natural Family Planning, are acceptable tools of prudent family planning. Jordan also strongly supports the option for couples to have very large families, while Owen believes that non-use of birth control in any form should be normative. Rainey sees infertile couples as falling into this group apart from their choice in the matter. Sterilized couples may as well. According to Southern Baptist R. Albert Mohler, Jr., [...] "Couples are not given the option of chosen childlessness in the biblical revelation".|$|E
2500|$|The two Natures {{and the two}} Reasons imply two societies. Edmund is the New Man, {{a member}} of an age of competition, suspicion, glory, in {{contrast}} with the older society which has come down from the Middle Ages, with its belief in co-operation, reasonable decency, and respect for the whole as greater than the part. King Lear is thus an allegory. The older society, that of the medieval vision, with its doting king, falls into error, and is threatened by the new Machiavellianism; it is regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in the king's rejected daughter. Cordelia, in the allegorical scheme, is threefold: a person; an <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> (love); and a community. Nevertheless, Shakespeare's understanding of the New Man is so extensive as to amount almost to sympathy. Edmund is the last great expression in Shakespeare of that side of Renaissance individualism – the energy, the emancipation, the courage – which has made a positive contribution to the heritage of the West. [...] "He embodies something vital which a final synthesis must reaffirm. But he makes an absolute claim which Shakespeare will not support. It is right for man to feel, as Edmund does, that society exists for man, not man for society. It is not right to assert the kind of man Edmund would erect to this supremacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{issue that}} can lead {{researchers}} not to take part is whether the researcher would stand to gain any benefit from {{taking part in the}} experiment. [...] It is an <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> that volunteers must stand to gain some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting. [...] Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition. [...] If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally. [...] For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an AIDS vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit. [...] Against that, the early stages of testing a new drug are usually focused merely on the safety of the substance, rather than any benefits it may have. [...] Healthy individuals are required for this stage, not volunteers suffering from the target condition, so if the researcher is healthy, he or she is a potential candidate for testing. [...] An issue peculiar to AIDS vaccine research is that the test will leave HIV antibodies in the volunteers blood, causing the person to show HIV positive when tested even if they have never been in contact with an HIV carrier. [...] This could cause a number of social problems for the volunteers (including any self-testers) such as issues with life insurance.|$|E

60|$|Everybody hates house agents just as {{everybody}} loves sailors. It {{is no doubt}} a very wicked and unjust hatred, but the business of a novelist is not <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> but facts. Everybody hates house agents because they have everybody at a disadvantage. All other callings have {{a certain amount of}} give and take; the house agent simply takes. All other callings want you; your solicitor is afraid you may change him, your doctor cannot go too far, your novelist--if only you knew it--is mutely abject towards your unspoken wishes--and as for your tradespeople, milkmen will fight outside your front door for you, and green-grocers call in tears if you discard them suddenly; but who ever heard of a house agent struggling to serve anyone? You want to get a house; you go to him, you dishevelled and angry from travel, anxious, enquiring; he calm, clean, inactive, reticent, quietly doing nothing. You beg him to reduce rents, whitewash ceilings, produce other houses, combine the summer house of No. 6 with the conservatory of No. 4--much he cares! You want to dispose of a house; then he is just the same, serene, indifferent--on one occasion I remember he was picking his teeth all the time he answered me. Competition is a mockery among house agents, they are all alike, you cannot wound them by going to the opposite office, you cannot dismiss them, you can at most dismiss yourself. They are invulnerably placed behind mahogany and brass, too far usually even for a sudden swift lunge with an umbrella, and to throw away the keys they lend you instead of returning them is larceny and punishable as such.|$|E
6000|$|My {{previous}} {{education had}} been, {{in a certain}} sense, already a course of Benthamism. The Benthamic standard of [...] "the greatest happiness" [...] was that which I had always been taught to apply; I was even familiar with an abstract discussion of it, forming an episode in an unpublished dialogue on Government, written by my father on the Platonic model. Yet in the first pages of Bentham it burst upon me with all the force of novelty. What thus impressed me was the chapter in which Bentham passed judgment on the common modes of reasoning in morals and legislation, deduced from phrases like [...] "law of nature," [...] "right reason," [...] "the moral sense," [...] "natural rectitude," [...] and the like, and characterized them as dogmatism in disguise, imposing its sentiments upon others under cover of sounding expressions which convey no reason for the sentiment, but set up the sentiment as its own reason. It had not struck me before, that Bentham's principle {{put an end to}} all this. The feeling rushed upon me, that all previous moralists were superseded, and that here indeed was the commencement of a new era in thought. This impression was strengthened by the manner in which Bentham put into scientific form the application of the happiness principle to the morality of actions, by analysing the various classes and orders of their consequences. But what struck me at that time most of all, was the Classification of Offences, which is much more clear, compact, and imposing in Dumont's rédaction than in the original work of Bentham from which it was taken. Logic and the dialectics of Plato, which had formed so large a part of my previous training, had given me a strong relish for accurate classification. This taste had been strengthened and enlightened by the study of botany, on the principles of what is called the Natural Method, which I had taken up with great zeal, though only as an amusement, during my stay in France; and when I found scientific classification applied to the great and complex subject of Punishable Acts, under the guidance of the <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> of Pleasurable and Painful Consequences, followed out in the method of detail introduced into these subjects by Bentham, I felt taken up to an eminence from which I could survey a vast mental domain, and see stretching out into the distance intellectual results beyond all computation. As I proceeded further, there seemed to be added to this intellectual clearness, the most inspiring prospects of practical improvement in human affairs. To Bentham's general view of the construction of a body of law I was not altogether a stranger, having read with attention that admirable compendium, my father's article on Jurisprudence: but I had read it with little profit, and scarcely any interest, no doubt from its extremely general and abstract character, and also because it concerned the form more than the substance of the corpus juris, the logic rather than the ethics of law. But Bentham's subject was Legislation, of which Jurisprudence is only the formal part: and at every page he seemed to open a clearer and broader conception of what human opinions and institutions ought to be, how they might be made what they ought to be, and how far removed from it they now are. When I laid down the last volume of the Traité, I had become a different being. The [...] "principle of utility," [...] understood as Bentham understood it, and applied {{in the manner in which}} he applied it through these three volumes, fell exactly into its place as the keystone which held together the detached and fragmentary component parts of my knowledge and beliefs. It gave unity to my conceptions of things. I now had opinions; a creed, a doctrine, a philosophy; in one among the best senses of the word, a religion; the inculcation and diffusion of which could be made the principal outward purpose of a life. And I had a grand conception laid before me of changes to be effected in the condition of mankind through that doctrine. The Traité de Legislation wound up with what was to me a most impressive picture of human life as it would be made by such opinions and such laws as were recommended in the treatise. The anticipations of practicable improvement were studiously moderate, deprecating and discountenancing as reveries of vague enthusiasm many things which will one day seem so natural to human beings, that injustice will probably be done to those who once thought them chimerical. But, in my state of mind, this appearance of superiority to illusion added to the effect which Bentham's doctrines produced on me, by heightening the impression of mental power, and the vista of improvement which he did open was sufficiently large and brilliant to light up my life, as well as to give a definite shape to my aspirations.|$|E
