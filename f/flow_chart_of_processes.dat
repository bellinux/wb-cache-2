40|$|The {{existence}} of zircon (ZrSiO 4) {{in the nature}} is mostly associated {{with some of the}} valuable oxide compounds (VOC), such as TiO 2 and rare earth oxides (REO). The {{existence of}} natural minerals in Indonesia containing zirconium (Zr) and REO lies in 13 regions, ranging from Aceh to West Papua province. Based on those aforementioned aspects, the goal of this research is to conduct the study of integrated technology of local zircon sand processing containing TiO 2 and REO. The study was conducted by analyzing the content of VOC in zircon sand samples from the areas of Landak and Tumbang Titi West Kalimantan and Bangka by using XRF. Based on the content of VOC in this zircon sand, it can be predicted that the zircon sand from the area of Landak and Tumbang Titi West Kalimantan and Bangka contains mineral zircon (ZrSiO 4), ilmenite (FeTiO 3), monazite (LREE, Th) PO 4, and xenotime (HREE, Th) PO 4.

Food production is the main issue in. every country {{of the world and}} establishing safety food production trough food chain(from raw materials to the final product) is a big challenge for food producers. Food production has many hazards with different nature, like: economical, political and environmental nature. Food safety systems, particularly HACCP system has been united, estimated and controlled every risky step in food production, from the beginning to the final product. It means from farm to fork. That is the main reason why the HACCP system has to be used like appropriate food safety system in EU countries. NASSR (Hazard analysis and critical control points) is a modern way to produce safety food according to EU legislative. NASSR system is preventive system witch includes identification, determination, estimation and monitoring of critical control point in food processing. This process has to be provided step by step in each suspect area of food processing. There are many biological, chemical and physical hazards in food processing and appropriate preventive measures have to be propose for safety food production.

40|$|Rare earth element and yttrium (REEY) {{signatures}} in hydrothermal gangue carbonates {{are among}} the most widely used proxies for studying hydrothermal mineralization. The observed patterns essentially provide information on REEY fractionating processes operating along the trajectory of the hydro-thermal fluid. This study adopts a source-sink approach to synthesize the current understanding of REEY mass transfer in aqueous hydrothermal fluids. REEY are initially inherited from the primary fluid reservoirs, i. e., seawater or magmatic fluids. REEY are then selectively added or removed by mineral breakdown reactions, wall-rock sorption and Rayleigh fractionation of saturated mineral phases along the fluid’s trajectory. Simultaneously, complexation with fluorine and chlorine selectively maintains LREE in the fluid, while comple-xation with carbonates or hydroxides preferentially maintains HREE in the fluid. Finally, the REEY are redistributed between coprecipitating mineral phases and stable complexes at the mineralization site. The observed pattern shapes result from superposition <b>of</b> these <b>processes,</b> summarized in a <b>flow</b> <b>chart.</b> All <b>of</b> these <b>processes</b> should be considered, taking into account constraints provided by other methods. status: publishe...|$|R

The survey of the current stage of the solved problems presents fundamental concepts of reliability engineering and the most common models of the program of reliability. Qualitative as well as quantitative reliability symbols and the most used methods of reliability analysis are defined here. The original survey of the current status of the issues to be solved is followed with a specification of procedures and means for composing the proposal of the system for the selection of reliability analysis methods. It is followed with general principles for the selection of reliability analysis methods and a description of a created general <b>process</b> <b>of</b> systematic selection of the reliability analysis methods, including criteria <b>of</b> decision-making <b>process,</b> which are used by this system. In frame of these principles the correlation of the methods of reliability analysis and a description, which includes necessary steps <b>of</b> this <b>process,</b> are also given.

European food composition database organizations reached consensus on the EuroFIR quality framework and started implementation. Peer reviews of the European compiler organizations were organized to evaluate the quality framework, focusing on what was achieved and on improvements needed.

Aims: To search for literature investigating the use of FCC {{as a model of}} care in cystic fibrosis units for children under 13 years. Methods: A comprehensive search of the following databases was conducted: Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO. Using the PRISMA <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> and <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> the United Kingdom Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, we selected relevant studies.

We decided to use this as a scoping study. Findings: One hundred and twenty-one studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria for types of studies about cystic fibrosis, but none were about FCC. Discussion: This brief report illustrates the need for research into the application of FCC as a way of caring for children and families where {{one or more of the}} children have cystic fibrosis.

40|$|Despite several {{developments}} in logistics that strive to decrease costs, tendencies {{can be found}} for increased logistical costs (Pewe, 2011, p. 17). Some factors causing increased system complexity are increased selection and faster market movements. The Warehouse Department at Carlsberg Sverige in Falkenberg has been chosen to be studied regarding continuous quality improvements. Carlsberg Sverige implemented an automated inventory system and automated order-picking system in 2012 - 2013, which has had about 40 % increase of stock keeping units (SKUs) since the investments. Since {{the implementation of the}} automation Carlsberg Sverige has encountered challenges with other quality of goods. The system has become more sensitive and it has become more important to eliminate deviation. The study aimed to develop a way for long-term reduction or elimination of quality errors that result in negative effects to the system. A specific area investigated was regarding both effect of the organization in a holistic perspective and on a level of detail of the analyzed area. The study did not include quality of beverages, but only external quality problems of goods, such as faulty stacking of packages or plastic wrapping hanging outside of the goods. An exploratory study was conducted with predominantly quantitative data collection methods. Initially a current state mapping was made, a <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> was created through interviews and observations of employees. Critical activities / situations were identified in the <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> and three areas were determined for further investigation regarding quality errors. Observations were carried out where all occurred abnormalities were registered. The results were analyzed and a focus area determined for continued deeper examination. A final model was created with the influence of theories and collected data from the case study. The examined focus area was part of the fully automated warehouse. Adaptation to the new automation was still under investigation and a need for more clarity in the continuous quality improvements. From the observations, it was revealed that in approximately 70 % of the observing time in the focus area, there was an error in the area affected system. Registered errors were categorized into ten groups, seven groups were included in the research scope. Out of the seven categories there were two significance regarding amount of repetitions of registered errors; unreadable label was measured 30 times, and plastic wrapping outside goods was discovered 12 times during 7 hours of measurement. Significance regarding average duration was discovered for; system errors of labels and wood detected by sensors on conveyors. Detected errors with significance were further analyzed with fishbone diagrams to find root-causes. Several common causes were discovered in the fishbone diagrams, for instance regarding inadequate methods and measurements. The discoveries functioned as basis for the final model that consists of: Key Performance Indexes (KPI's), a <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> <b>of</b> affecting <b>processes,</b> daily whiteboard meetings, improved communication channels and a <b>process</b> for implementation <b>of</b> routines. The model developed was to fit this case study, which represents; a complex system with lots of shift work, both manual and automated <b>processes</b> and handling <b>of</b> beverage goods.
