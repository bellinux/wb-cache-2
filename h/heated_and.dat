5|$|At the {{opposite}} side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing magnetotail, which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of Saturn. The structure of Jupiter's magnetotail is similar to Earth's. It consists of two lobes (blue areas in the figure), with the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter, and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it. The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail current sheet (orange layer in the middle). Like Earth's, the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere, where it is <b>heated</b> <b>and</b> forms the radiation belts at distances closer than 10RJ from Jupiter.|$|E

In order to analyze how <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> {{mass transfer}} in a thermal environment, <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer simulation is needed. However, it is too much time-consuming to obtain numerical solutions to <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer equations.

The nVidia Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming model provides a straightforward means of describing inherently parallel computations.

Our experimental results clearly show that GPU can accurately perform <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer simulation.

Therefore, the GPU is a good approach to accelerate the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer simulation...|$|R

5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be <b>heated</b> <b>and</b> the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E

40|$|Radiative <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling provide {{primary source}} and {{ultimate}} sink of energy driving lower planetary atmospheres.

5|$|Chelsea have long-standing rivalries with North London clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. A strong {{rivalry with}} Leeds United {{dates back to}} several <b>heated</b> <b>and</b> {{controversial}} matches in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the 1970 FA Cup Final. More recently a rivalry with Liverpool has grown following repeated clashes in cup competitions. Chelsea's fellow West London sides Brentford, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers are generally not considered major rivals, as matches have only taken place intermittently due to the clubs often being in separate divisions. A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com found that Chelsea fans consider their main rivalries to be with (in order): Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. In the same survey, fans of six clubs (Arsenal, Fulham, Leeds United, QPR, Tottenham and West Ham United) named Chelsea {{as one of their}} three main rivals. In a 2008 poll conducted by the Football Fans Census, Chelsea fans named Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United as their most disliked clubs.

5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became <b>heated,</b> <b>and</b> a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, <b>heated</b> <b>and</b> hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond.

The container was <b>heated</b> <b>and</b> the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center {{to the ends of the}} tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} efficiency of humidification in available <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchanger models under conditions of varying tidal volume, respiratory rate, and flow rate. INTRODUCTION: Inspired gases are routinely preconditioned by <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers to provide a <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> water content similar to that provided normally by the nose and upper airways. The absolute humidity of air retrieved from {{and returned to the}} ventilated patient is an important measurable outcome of the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers' humidifying performance. METHODS: Eight different <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers were studied using a respiratory system analog. The system included a heated chamber (acrylic glass, maintained at 37 °C), a preserved swine lung, a hygrometer, circuitry and a ventilator. Humidity and temperature levels were measured using eight distinct interposed <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers given different tidal volumes, respiratory frequencies and flow-rate conditions. Recovery of absolute humidity (%RAH) was calculated for each setting. RESULTS: Increasing tidal volumes led to a reduction in %RAH for all <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers while no significant effect was demonstrated in the context of varying respiratory rate or inspiratory flow. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers are more efficient when used with low tidal volume ventilation. The roles of flow and respiratory rate were of lesser importance, suggesting that their adjustment has a less significant effect on the performance of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers...|$|R
