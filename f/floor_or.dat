5|$|In 2000, glacier caves were {{discovered}} on the then-smooth glacier surface. Many of these glacier caves were {{big enough to}} explore, like the glacier caves on the summit of Mount Rainier. Most of the glacier caves were located near the 1980s lava dome, where hot steam and volcanic gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> lava dome melted holes in the young glacial ice. About 7,900 feet or 2.4km of underground caves and passageways in the glacier were mapped and studied.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} purpose {{of much of}} Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era {{before the advent of}} the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a <b>floor,</b> <b>or</b> (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants.|$|E
5|$|A real {{physical}} tessellation is a tiling made {{of materials}} such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art {{such as in the}} decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.|$|E
5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under the stairs, and among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus (commonly {{known as}} the grey milkcap) is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae, first {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries. It produces moderately sized and brittle mushrooms, which grow on the forest <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> on rotting wood. The flattened-convex cap can vary in shape, sometimes forming {{the shape of a}} wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured gills, which produce white milk. The spore print is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, acrid taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. L.vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours birch. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Most {{buildings}} in Bath {{are made from}} the local, golden-coloured Bath Stone, and many date from the 18th and 19th century. The dominant style of architecture in Central Bath is Georgian; this style evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular in the early 18th century. Many of the prominent architects of the day were employed {{in the development of}} the city. The original purpose of much of Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era before the advent of the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a <b>floor,</b> <b>or</b> (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants. The masons Reeves of Bath were prominent in the city from the 1770s to 1860s.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, {{and they decided to}} abandon it. The {{remaining}} supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> poles.|$|E
5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest <b>floor,</b> <b>or</b> it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E
5|$|The late 18th {{century was}} a period of change in the {{interior}} design of English country houses. The Baroque concept of the principal <b>floor,</b> <b>or</b> piano nobile, with a large bedroom suite known as the state apartments, was gradually abandoned in favour of smaller, more private bedrooms on the upper floors. The principal floor became a series of reception rooms, each with a designated purpose, creating separate withdrawing, dining, music, and ballrooms. In the late-18th century, it became common to arrange reception and public rooms on a lower floor, with bedrooms and more private rooms above. West Wycombe perfectly reflects this arrangement.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} the boy throughout the game. As {{is typical of}} most two-dimensional platform games, the boy can run left or right, jump, climb onto short ledges or up and down ladders and ropes, and push or pull objects. Limbo is presented through dark, greyscale graphics and with minimalist ambient sounds, creating an eerie, haunting environment. The dark visuals also hide numerous environmental and physical hazards, such as deadly bear traps on the forest <b>floor,</b> <b>or</b> lethal monsters hiding in the shadows, such as a giant spider. Among the hazards are glowing worms, which attach themselves to the boy's head and force him to travel in only one direction until they are killed.|$|E
5|$|Before the Tang Dynasty (618907 AD), the {{predominant}} sitting {{positions in the}} Han Chinese culture and neighboring cultures such as the Japanese Culture, Korean Culture, Turkic Culture in Central Asia and Tai Kadai Cultures to the southwest were the seiza and lotus position on the <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> sitting mats. The earliest images of chairs in China are from sixth-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs {{at that time was}} rare. It was not until the twelfth century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Nestorian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is not common to sit at floor level.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, {{opposition}} MP Gurmant Grewal accused Dosanjh and the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Tim Murphy, {{of attempting}} to bribe him with an ambassadorship and a senate seat for his wife, Nina Grewal, if he would cross the <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> abstain from a crucial upcoming vote. Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh, Grewal, and Murphy. Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering the tapes to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet. Audio analysis concluded that the tapes were altered and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not pursue any criminal investigations. Nevertheless, fellow MP John Reynolds {{filed a complaint with}} the Law Society of British Columbia accusing Dosanjh of violating the Criminal Code and the society's Professional Conduct Handbook. The Law Society reviewed the affair and concluded that Grewal had attempted to elicit rewards for his compliance but cleared Dosanjh and Murphy of misconduct charges.|$|E

5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean <b>floor,</b> <b>or</b> below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E
5|$|Within the interior, {{the upper}} and middle floors are State floors; they are in turn divided into several {{reception}} rooms, throne rooms and galleries complete with royal portraits of every Chakri Monarchs (including Second King Pinklao) and their consorts. More specifically, to the east gallery are Buddhist Images and other religious images, while to the west are reception rooms for State guests and other foreign dignitaries. In {{other parts of the}} throne hall there are also libraries and rooms where the ashes of Kings (Rama IV to Rama VIII) and their Queens are housed. Many of the European-made chandeliers inside the Hall initially belonged to Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse; however they proved too big for his own residence and he eventually gave them to King Chulalongkron as gifts. The throne hall was also the first structure in Thailand in which electricity was installed, at the insistence of Prince Devavongse Varopakar. The lower <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> ground floor is reserved for servants and the Royal Guards. Currently there is a museum displaying old weapons.|$|E
