5|$|Ferugliotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals from the Campanian and/or Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, around 70 million years ago) of Argentina {{in the family}} Ferugliotheriidae. It {{contains}} a single species, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, which was first <b>described</b> <b>in</b> 1986. Originally interpreted {{as a member of}} Multituberculata, an extinct group of small, rodent-like mammals, {{on the basis of a}} single brachydont (low-crowned) molar, it was recognized as related to the hypsodont (high-crowned) Sudamericidae after the discovery of additional material in the early 1990s. After a jaw of the sudamericid Sudamerica was <b>described</b> <b>in</b> 1999, these animals (collectively known as Gondwanatheria) were no longer considered to be multituberculates and a few fossils that were previously considered to be Ferugliotherium were assigned to unspecified multituberculates instead. Since 2005, a relationship between gondwanatheres and multituberculates has again received support. A closely related animal, Trapalcotherium, was <b>described</b> <b>in</b> 2009 on the basis of a single tooth.|$|E

5|$|Modified bases {{also occur}} in DNA. The {{first of these}} {{recognised}} was 5-methylcytosine which {{was found in the}} genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1925. The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present in DNA in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was <b>described</b> <b>in</b> 1975. 7-methylguanine was <b>described</b> <b>in</b> 1976. N4-methylcytosine in DNA was <b>described</b> <b>in</b> 1983. In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the Rhizobium phages RL38JI and N17. α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the Delftia phage ΦW-14 and the Bacillus phage SP10. α-glutamythymidine is found in the Bacillus phage SP01 and 5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the Bacillus phage SP15.|$|E
