In the 1890s he became mistakenly convinced that Ellis and Trego counties in central Kansas contained mineral <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin,</b> zinc, and gold. In 1899 his son Charles K. Holliday founded Smoky Hill City, Kansas near the supposed mineral deposits.|$|E
25|$|Originally a village, Ipoh {{began to}} grow rapidly in the 1880s after huge <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> were {{discovered}} within its vicinity. By 1895, {{it was the second}} largest town within the Federated Malay States, which also consisted of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang. Ipoh was declared a city in 1988. However, following the depletion of its tin deposits and the collapse of tin prices in the 1970s, the city suffered decades of decline and neglect.|$|E
25|$|Perak is a {{state on}} the western shore of the Malay Peninsula. In the 18th and 19th centuries it was {{discovered}} to be rich in tin, with the richest alluvial <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in the world. Europe {{at the same time}} was undergoing an industrial revolution and this created a huge demand for tin. The British as well as the Dutch were active in the states, each seeking to monopolise production of tin and other commodities. However, the political atmosphere in Perak was sufficiently volatile to raise the cost of tin mining operations. For instance, in 1818 Siam ordered Kedah to attack Perak. The lack of security in Perak forced the British to protect Perak in 1826.|$|E

25|$|Selangor just to {{the south}} of Perak also had {{considerable}} <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> around Hulu Selangor on the north, Hulu Klang in the central area and Lukut near Negeri Sembilan to the south. Around 1840, under the leadership of Raja Jumaat from Riau, tin mining became a huge enterprise. His effort soon was rewarded by Sultan Muhammad of Selangor; Raja Jumaat was appointed as Lukut's administrator in 1846. By the 1850s the area {{emerged as one of the}} most modern settlements on the Malay Peninsula apart from the Straits Settlements. At one point, there were no less than 20,000 labourers, most of them ethnic Chinese imported from China. He died in 1864 and his death created a leadership vacuum. Slowly, Lukut slid backward and was forgotten.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{attestation}} {{of human}} presence in Galicia {{has been found}} in the Eirós Cave, in the municipality of Triacastela, which has preserved animal remains and Neanderthal stone objects from the Middle Paleolithic. The earliest culture to have left significant architectural traces is the Megalithic culture, which expanded along the western European coasts during the Neolithic and Calcolithic eras. Thousands of Megalithic tumuli are distributed throughout the country, but mostly along the coastal areas. Within each tumulus is a stone burial chamber known locally as anta (dolmen), frequently preceded by a corridor. Galicia was later influenced by the Bell Beaker culture. Its rich mineral <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> and gold {{led to the development of}} Bronze Age metallurgy, and to the commerce of bronze and gold items all along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe. A shared elite culture evolved in this region during the Atlantic Bronze Age.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the tin mines on Dartmoor are located in granite country rock {{and most of the}} lodes trend ENE–WSW and are of limited length, though there are exceptions. In the underground workings, the tin ore, cassiterite, was usually found in association with large amounts of tourmaline, and in central Dartmoor with much specular haematite. In {{the southern part of the}} moor, the cassiterite was usually found in relatively large grains, but the lodes were of very variable quality. These factors, combined with the fact that none of the underground workings was found to be profitable at depth, are typical of the deepest zone of tin mineralisation. The once very extensive alluvial <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> ore, that were the first deposits to be mined, also point to the vast quantity of ore that once existed in lodes that have been eroded from above the granite since it was emplaced in the Carboniferous period.|$|E

30|$|The {{multilayer}} antimony-doped {{tin dioxide}} coating {{was obtained by}} cathodic deposition of multilayer metal-hydroxide coating with near 100 -nm thickness layers on the alloy underlayer accompanied by the anodic oxidation of this coating. The potential regions <b>of</b> deposition <b>of</b> <b>tin,</b> antimony, tin-antimony alloy, and mixture of this metals and their hydroxides in the pyrophosphate-tartrate electrolyte were revealed by the cyclic voltammetric method. The possibility of oxidation <b>of</b> cathodic <b>deposit</b> consisting <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> and Sn(II) hydroxide compounds to the hydrated tin dioxide in the same electrolyte was demonstrated.|$|R
30|$|The {{height and}} {{area of the}} second peak {{increase}} with increasing <b>of</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>deposited</b> <b>tin.</b> At this peak, tin is dissolved in the form <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> pyrophosphate complexes, {{in which it is}} in the oxidation level of + 2. After tin deposition at the limiting current (cathodic border of the range of potential scan is − 1.2 V), the shoulder appears on the downward branch of the peak. It is associated apparently with the formation of Sn(II) compounds passivating the surface. At the more positive potentials, the third peak appears on the anodic branch of the CVA curve. According to E-pH diagram at 6.5, only Sn(IV) compounds are produced at the potential range of the third peak [28]. At this peak, the cathodic <b>deposit</b> consisting <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> and its hydroxide oxidizes with formation of Sn(IV) compounds. Both soluble tin pyrophosphate complexes (with <b>tin</b> oxidation level <b>of</b> + 4) and insoluble compounds including tin dioxide can be produced depending on the composition and pH of the electrolyte.|$|R
2500|$|The state's {{official}} name is Perak Darul Ridzuan. Perak means silver in Malay, {{which is probably}} derived from the silvery colour of tin. In the 1890s, Perak, with the richest alluvial <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> {{in the world was}} one of the jewels in the crown of the British Empire. However, some say the name comes from the [...] "glimmer of fish in the water" [...] that sparkled like silver. Darul Ridzuan is the state's Arabic honorific, and can mean either [...] "land" [...] or [...] "abode" [...] of grace.|$|E

50|$|On 4 December 1871 Smith {{discovered}} a large <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> oxide near {{the summit of}} Mount Bischoff. His specimens when smelted yielded the first tin found in Tasmania, but {{it took some time}} for the importance of the find to be realised. In August 1872 Smith took a small party with him to the field and in 1873 several tons of ore were sent to Melbourne. In that year the mine was visited by William Ritchie, a solicitor at Launceston, and with his help the 'Mount Bischoff Tin-mining Company' was floated with 12,000 shares of £5 each. Of these 4400 were reserved for Smith who also received £1500 in cash. One expert who visited the mine at this time pronounced it to be the richest tin-mine in the world. The company, however, had many difficulties, one being that the bush track to the coast for many months of the year was almost impassable.|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical {{degradation}} {{resistance of}} carbon-supported Pt and TiN (Pt/TiN/C) cathode catalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells prepared using the polygonal barrel-sputtering method was investigated. The {{characterization of the}} prepared carbon-supported TiN (TiN/C) samples showed that TiN nanoparticles were uniformly deposited on the surfaces of the carbon particles. Subsequently, Pt/TiN/C catalysts were prepared by sputtering Pt on the TiN/C samples. The change in electrochemical surface areas (ESAs) of the obtained samples was evaluated by successive potential cycling. As compared with the carbon-supported Pt catalyst, the Pt/TiN/C catalyst with the amount <b>of</b> <b>TiN</b> <b>deposited</b> <b>of</b> 10 wt. % showed smaller ESA reduction after 100 th potential cycling. The effects <b>of</b> <b>TiN</b> on the ESA reduction became greater by increasing the amount <b>of</b> <b>deposited</b> <b>TiN</b> from 10 to 24 wt. %, although the ESA absolute values decreased. These results demonstrate that TiN deposition is useful to prevent ESAs from reduction and improve the durability of PEFCs...|$|R
