On 27 August 2014, the National Assembly's leadership, {{in response to a}} request from the government, decided to allow the arrest of Amadou, who was not present, in connection with an investigation into an <b>illegal</b> <b>network</b> <b>trafficking</b> infants from Nigeria. One of his wives had already been arrested. Within hours of the decision, Amadou fled to Burkina Faso. He had denounced the investigation, and his supporters argued that constitutionally he could only be arrested if his parliamentary immunity was removed through a vote of the National Assembly as a whole.|$|R
40|$|Forensic image {{recognition}} tools {{are used by}} law enforcement agencies {{all over the world}} to automatically detect illegal images on confiscated equipment. This detection is commonly done with the help of a strictly confidential database consisting of hash values of known illegal images. To detect and mitigate the distribution of illegal images, for instance in <b>network</b> <b>traffic</b> of companies or Internet service providers, it is desirable to outsource the recognition of illegal images to these companies. However, law enforcement agencies want to keep their hash databases secret at all costs as an unwanted release may result in misuse which could ultimately render these databases useless. We present SOFIR, a tool for the Secure Outsourcing of Forensic Image Recognition allowing companies and law enforcement agencies to jointly detect <b>illegal</b> <b>network</b> <b>traffic</b> at its source, thus facilitating immediate regulatory actions. SOFIR cryptographically hides the hash database from the involved companies. At fixed intervals, SOFIR sends out an encrypted report to the law enforcement agency that only contains the number of found illegal images in the given interval, while otherwise keeping the company’s legal <b>network</b> <b>traffic</b> private. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and practicality of our approach in the real-world...|$|R

40|$|<b>Illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> {{of women}} {{is a result of}} their disadvantageous {{position}} in the society that is often reflected in increasing preference for son and neglect for daughters. Multiple reports point to India as country confronted with both higher levels of <b>illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> of girls and abnormal child sex ratios in favor of boys. In this paper we examine if a skewed sex ratio and shortage of girls is associated with their <b>illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> in India. Using panel data of 29 Indian states from 1980 - 2011, we find that 100 unit increase in child sex ratio is associated with 0. 635 % increase in <b>illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> of girls. We find the association to be heterogeneous by female empowerment, crime against women and party rule in the state. We find that association between child sex ratio and <b>illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> of girls is stronger and larger in magnitude in states with greater female empowerment. Overall, it appears that the results are driven by both greater reporting and greater incidence of <b>illegal</b> girls <b>trafficking.</b> Contrary to popular belief, the results do not vary differentially by states with larger share of schedule tribe population or states bordering Nepal and Bangladesh. Our results survive variety of robustness checks...|$|R

40|$|The <b>illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> {{of waste}} {{has become one}} of the fastest growing areas of crime and one of the most lucrative {{industries}} among organized criminal activities, which has infiltrated both the Italian urban and hazardous waste management cycle. In this study, we aim to investigate the determinants of the organized activities for the <b>illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> of waste (art. 260 of the Environmental Code) using waste, economic, and enforcement data in a panel analysis over the period 2002 - 2013. Our main findings reveal that in most of the Italian regions enforcement activities do not exert significant deterrence on criminal behaviors; a negative relationship between enforcement and <b>illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> of waste can be identified only for very high levels of enforcement efforts. Moreover, we find that the major determinants of the <b>illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> of waste rate differ between northern-central and southern regions, confirming the existence of a regional dualism. In particular, while in the North-Centre area the crime rate is positively related to level of education and negatively to the adoption of environmentally sound policies, in southern regions the organized activities for the <b>illegal</b> <b>trafficking</b> are negatively related to the education attainment and positively to the endowment of waste management plants...|$|R
