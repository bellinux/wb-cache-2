5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation.|$|E
5|$|If the {{variance}} in the number of offspring <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift ({{the variance}} effective population size), genetic drift is a less powerful force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.|$|E
5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{total of}} 14 species of {{amphibians}} in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, of which 11 breed in the watershed. These species consist of 6 salamanders, 6 frogs, one newt, and one toad. There are seven species of reptiles in the watershed, of which five breed there. Five of these species are snakes and two are turtles. The biodiversity of birds in the watershed <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> that of amphibians or reptiles; there are approximately one hundred different species of birds in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. A total of 29 mammals have been observed in the creek's watershed, including three species of bats, two species of mice, and two species of foxes.|$|E
5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E

25|$|Denser {{stars with}} higher surface gravity exhibit greater {{pressure}} broadening of spectral lines. The gravity, {{and hence the}} pressure, {{on the surface of}} a giant star is much lower than for a dwarf star because the radius of the giant <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> a dwarf of similar mass. Therefore, differences in the spectrum can be interpreted as luminosity effects and a luminosity class can be assigned purely from examination of the spectrum.|$|E

25|$|Far field methods achieve longer ranges, often {{multiple}} kilometer ranges, {{where the}} distance <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> {{the diameter of}} the device(s). The main reason for longer ranges with radio wave and optical devices is the fact that electromagnetic radiation in the far-field can be made to match the shape of the receiving area (using high directivity antennas or well-collimated laser beams). The maximum directivity for antennas is physically limited by diffraction.|$|E

Apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit, few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> for a prograde orbit. This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude.|$|E

The problems involve not only whether a particular sermon or treatise is to be judged authentic or pseudonymous, but also, given the large number of manuscripts and the fragmentary condition of many of them, whether it is even possible to establish the text for some of the pieces accepted as genuine. Eckhart's sermons are versions written down by others from memory or from notes, meaning that the possibility for error <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> for the carefully written Latin treatises.|$|R

Stapp reached a speed of , which broke the land speed record and made him the fastest man on earth. Stapp believed that the tolerance of humans to acceleration {{had not yet been}} reached in tests.

25|$|In water, staying afloat is {{possible}} using buoyancy. If an animal's body is less dense than water, it can stay afloat. This requires little energy {{to maintain a}} vertical position, but requires more energy for locomotion in the horizontal plane compared to less buoyant animals. The drag encountered in water <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> in air. Morphology is therefore important for efficient locomotion, which is in most cases essential for basic functions such as catching prey. A fusiform, torpedo-like body form is seen in many aquatic animals, though the mechanisms they use for locomotion are diverse.|$|E
