40|$|Federal {{income support}} {{programs}} provide producers {{with only a}} limited degree of income protection {{in the event of}} a widespread crop failure. As an alternative to supplemental disaster assistance, we propose a modification of the deficiency payments program in which a producer's payment would be based on the difference between a target revenue and the average revenue in the producer's region. A regional target revenue progam would provide improved individual income protection without promoting moral hazard and would limit regional revenue shortfalls, thereby eliminating the demand for supplemental disaster assistance and reducing government costs. Key words: deficiency <b>payments,</b> <b>disaster</b> assistance, revenue insurance, risk and uncertainty. Much of the debate surrounding the 1990 farm bill focused on the best means of providing pro-ducers with income protection {{in the event of a}} widespread crop failure. The debate is not new. Prior to 1980, the U. S. Department of Agricul-ture (USDA) provided disaster assistance mainly through direct cash payments. Because of strong criticism that the <b>disaster</b> <b>payment</b> program was too expensive, restrictive in scope, and encour-aged production in high-risk areas, Congress en-acted the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 to replace the <b>disaster</b> <b>payment</b> program with crop insurance as the primary means of providing catastrophic ncome protection to farmers. The federal crop insurance program, how-ever, has failed to perform as expected. A 1 -though the 1980 act authorized the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to subsidize producer premium payments and to expand coverage, participation in the program between 1980 and 1 1988 never exceeded 25 % of eligible acreage. Adverse selection and moral hazard problems also seriously undermined the actuarial perfor-mance of the program and led to large govem-ment outlays (Chambers, Nelson and Loehman, Skees and Reed). 2 Most significantly, however, the federal crop insurance progam failed to eliminate federal disaster assistance.

50|$|The Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-86, {{also known}} as the 1973 U.S. Farm Bill) was the 4-year farm bill that adopted target prices and {{deficiency}} payments as a tool that would support farm income but reduce forfeitures to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) of surplus stocks. (Target prices were eliminated by the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127), but restored by the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1104).) It reduced payment limitations to $20,000 (from $55,000 set in 1970) for all program crops. The Act might be considered the first omnibus farm bill because it went beyond simply authorizing farm commodity programs. It authorized <b>disaster</b> <b>payments</b> and disaster reserve inventories; created the Rural Environmental Conservation Program; amended the Food Stamp Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-525), authorized the use of commodities for feeding low income mothers and young children (the origin of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program; and amended the Rural Development Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-419).|$|E
50|$|The Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, Title I, {{modified}} the federal crop insurance program, {{beginning with the}} 1995 crops. It authorized a new catastrophic (CAT) coverage level available to farmers. The premium on this level of coverage (crop losses in excess of 50% receiving a payment of 60% (now, 55%) of the market price of the insured crop) is 100% subsidized by the government, but requires a farmer to pay a $50 per crop per county administrative fee (since raised to $100 per crop). The Act allows farmers to purchase additional insurance coverage providing higher yield or price protection levels, with the premium on this buy-up coverage partially subsidized by the government. The Act also created the Noninsured Assistance Program (NAP), a permanent <b>disaster</b> <b>payments</b> program for crops not covered by crop insurance. The 1994 Act amended {{and in many cases}} suppressed major portions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-365) which serves as the authorizing statute for the federal crop insurance program. The 1980 Act expanded the scope of the crop insurance program and permitted USDA to subsidize farmer premium payments. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-224) made subsequent enhancements and reforms to the crop insurance program.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of government-provided crop {{insurance}} on farm failure rates. By exploiting random variation in weather and the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, which mandated crop insurance coverage for the first time, I employ two natural experiments that identify the causal effect of disaster relief on farm failure rates. I examine the survival smoothing contribution of crop insurance {{by looking at the}} relative effect of disaster relief across two regimes, pre- and post- 1994. Prior to 1994 ad hoc, ex post <b>disaster</b> <b>payments</b> were the primary form of disaster relief. Shortly after the 1994 Act virtually all disaster relief came through crop insurance indemnities. I find that disaster relief in the form of ad hoc <b>disaster</b> <b>payments</b> slightly reduces the average farm failure rate, while average farm failure rates increase under the crop insurance regime. The relative effect suggests that farm failure rates increase by 1. 7 percentage points (about 30 -percent) under the crop insurance regime.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{unintended}} consequences of government policy, specifically policy meant to benefit agricultural producers. The first chapter asks how agricultural subsidies affect farmland rental rates. Chapter two examines the relative effects of ad hoc <b>disaster</b> <b>payments</b> and crop insurance, focusing on the potential to smooth income shocks, and the final chapter studies the targeting efficiency of the Conservation Reserve Program. Chapter one exploits exogenous variation in agricultural subsidies to measure the effects on farmland rental rates. The primary finding is that landlords capture one-fifth of the marginal subsidy dollar per acre. This finding stands {{in contrast to the}} standard assumption that landlords immediately capture the entire subsidy. There is some evidence that the share of the subsidy captured by landlords increases as the farmland rental market becomes more competitive. The analysis also indicates that the lower effective price of land induces tenants to rent more land such that they gain roughly $ 1 per dollar of subsidy. Taken together, the results suggest that agricultural subsidies benefit farmers, as well as individuals that own agricultural land. Chapter two exploits random weather variation and exogenous variation in crop insurance take-up in order to investigate the relative effect of two forms of government-provided disaster relief on farm failure rates. (cont.) I find that disaster relief in the form of ad hoc <b>disaster</b> <b>payments</b> slightly reduces the average farm failure rate, while average farm failure rates increase under a crop insurance regime. The relative effect suggests that farm failure rates increase by 1. 7 percentage points (about 30 -percent) under the crop insurance regime.

These findings suggest that government-provided crop insurance {{plays an important role in}} farmer risk management.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of conservation tillage {{practices such as}} ridge till, mulch till, or no-till {{has been shown to}} reduce soil erosion. An additional benefit of these conservation practices is that they also increase soil moisture.

Given the large amount of money spent by the USDA on crop insurance indemnity and ad-hoc <b>disaster</b> relief <b>payments,</b> practices that reduce the risk of drought to the farmer should be strongly encouraged.
