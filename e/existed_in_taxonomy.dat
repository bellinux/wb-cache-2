40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of African Clarias was reviewed. It was emphasized that much confusion still <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> this <b>taxonomy.</b> The {{major sources of}} this confusion were outlined. There are now only about 33 valid species of the 122 original species so far described in Africa. The implications of {{the present state of}} African Clarias taxonomy for the field worker were highlighted. In particular the need for the field worker to be an informed amateur taxonomist in addition to the possession of a good knowledge of the biology of his fish was emphasized. The connection between this and a successful Clarias culture was pointed ou...|$|R
50|$|The {{idea of a}} clade did not <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> pre-Darwinian Linnaean <b>taxonomy,</b> {{which was}} based by {{necessity}} only on internal or external morphological similarities between organisms - although as it happens, many of the better known animal groups in Linnaeus' original Systema Naturae (notably among the vertebrate groups) do represent clades. The phenomenon of convergent evolution is, however, responsible for many cases where there are misleading similarities in the morphology of groups that evolved from different lineages.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a novel knowledge-based {{word sense disambiguation}} method that determines the sense of an ambiguous word in biomedical text using semantic similarity or relatedness measures. These measures quantify the degree of similarity between concepts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The objective of this work {{was to develop a}} method that can disambiguate terms in biomedical text by exploiting similarity information extracted from the UMLS and to evaluate the efficacy of information content-based semantic similarity measures, which augment path-based information with probabilities derived from biomedical corpora. We show that information content-based measures obtain a higher disambiguation accuracy than path-based measures because they weight the path based on where it <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> the <b>taxonomy</b> coupled with the probability of the concepts occurring in a corpus of text...|$|R

The interest here is to classify objects into one of many existing classes {{and is based on}} measurements taken on a set of characteristics (called variables). Hence classification is a multivariate problem which can be divided into two broad categories.  We have multiple measurements data from a number of individuals belonging to known groups. Also we have data collected on individuals whose group membership is not known and is to be determined using the measurements made on them. This problem in statistical terminology comes under Discriminant Analysis.  Another type is the case when the groups are them selves unknown and a primary purpose of the analysis is to find groups so that those belonging to same group are similar than those belonging to different groups. This in statistics come under the heading of cluster analysis or pattern recognition...|$|R
40|$|As an open {{standard}} for electronic communication {{of business and}} financial data, XBRL {{has the potential of}} improving the efficiency of the business data supply chain. A number of jurisdictions have developed different XBRL taxonomies as their data standards. Semantic heterogeneity <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> these <b>taxonomies,</b> the corresponding instances, and the internal systems that store the original data. Consequently, there are still substantial difficulties in creating and using XBRL instances that involve multiple taxonomies. To fully realize the potential benefits of XBRL, we have to develop technologies to reconcile semantic heterogeneity and enable interoperability of various parts of the supply chain. In this paper, we analyze the XBRL standard and use examples of different taxonomies to illustrate the interoperability challenge. We also propose a technical solution that incorporates schema matching and context mediation techniques to improve the efficiency of the production and consumption of XBRL data. XBRL, semantic data integration,, context mediation, ontology,, schema matching,...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacterial blooms are {{potential}} health hazards {{due to the}} ability of these organisms to produce toxins. Current cyanobacterial taxonomy does not provide an unequivocal system for the identification of toxigenic and bloom-forming Mycrocystis strains. The ambiguities that <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> cyanobacterial <b>taxonomy</b> are due to the expressed variability, minor morphological and developmental characteristics used for identification and classification purposes. Depending on the taxonomic parameters used for classification, which differs in their emphasis on cell size, shape, buoyancy, and toxicity, different generic assignments can be made. In this study, PCR-based molecular tools (e. g. PCR-RFLPs, AFLPs) were applied to determine the diversity of different strains of Microcystis. One of the goals was to obtain an insight into the toxicity of bloom forming strains especially for the early detection of toxicity. Many strains were analysed and characterised at low cell numbers using PCR amplification of the mcyb gene. In order to link the identification of strains with toxicity, the mcyb gene was used following restriction digestion of the particular gene sequence...|$|R

[28] are marked with 2) and 3), respectively. For instance, Schneier’s taxonomy [23] can be criticized {{for not being able}} to cover login data, connection data, extended profile data, ratings/interests, network data, contextual data, disseminated data, and private communication data. The work presented by Årnes et al. [29] improves on this but still does not feature any equivalents for login data, disseminated data, and private communication data. The taxonomy of Beye et al. [28] has shortcomings related to its insufficient definitions of login credentials as well as behavioral information and, additionally, is missing an equivalent for application data. Although it is possible to map the data types related to 1 : n communication and private communication into the categories proposed by Beye et al. [28], a lot of privacy-relevant information is lost when treating all of them simply under the general term Messages.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{comparing}} {{some small}} Ethiopian Bufo with the descriptions, types and {{other examples of}} numerous forms from East and Central African countries I became {{very much aware of}} the confusion that <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> the <b>taxonomy</b> and of the need for a revision of this group of dwarf toads. Most of the earless East African toads have received little or no attention since Loveridge's papers in the 1930 s and a bewildering assortment of characters of doubtful taxonomic value have been used. Two of the most misleading terms applied to these small toads are "tympanum hidden" and "paratoid obscure". Often preservation alone has rendered the outline of the tympanic annulus and the paratoid obscure or invisible and only dissection reveals the true extent of the development of the characters; yet in the past dissection has rarely if ever been carried out. Arising from this investigation the following taxonomie changes have been made: Bufo mocquardi Angel = Bufo loennbergi Andersson Bufo loennberginairobiensis Loveridge = Bufo loennbergi Andersson Bufo taitanus nyikae Loveridge = Bufo loennbergi Andersson Bufo taitanus uzunguensis Loveridge = Bufo uzunguensis Loveridge Bufo ushoranus Loveridge = Bufo taitanus Peters Bufo katanganus Loveridge = Bufo taitanus Peters Bufo ushoranus; Schmidt & Inger = Mertensophryne schmidti spec. nov. The following abbreviations are used in this paper: A National Museum, Nairob...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{synonyms}} {{in other}} contexts, <b>in</b> <b>taxonomy</b> a synonym is not interchangeable {{with the name}} of which it is a synonym. <b>In</b> <b>taxonomy,</b> synonyms are not equals, but have a different status. For any taxon with a particular circumscription, position, and rank, only one scientific name is considered to be the correct one at any given time (this correct name is to be determined by applying the relevant code of nomenclature). A synonym cannot <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> isolation: it is always an alternative to a different scientific name. Given that the correct name of a taxon depends on the taxonomic viewpoint used (resulting in a particular circumscription, position and rank) a name that is one taxonomist's synonym may be another taxonomist's correct name (and vice versa).|$|R
40|$|Undertaking {{a review}} of {{literature}} is an essentialtask of any research project. In earlier work we developed acritic taxonomy based on a traditional review of critic literature. The development of the proposed critic taxonomy is to supportcritic developers in identifying, categorizing, developing anddeploying critiquing tools in various domains. Critiquing tools(or known as critiquing systems) are about providing proactiveguidelines or recommendations for improvement to designs,code, models, and other digital artifacts. However, a sufficientempirical evidence to detail that the groups defined in the critictaxonomy have a strong dependency has not been performed inthe earlier research work. Thus, this paper aims to propose anempirical evidence approach to investigate and assess thedependency that might <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> the critic <b>taxonomy.</b> Asystematic literature review (SLR) is selected in order toprovide the best available evidence to answer the dependency ofgroups defined in the proposed critic taxonomy. This paperpresents the process of systematic review to obtain relevant andreliable critics literature in software engineering.
