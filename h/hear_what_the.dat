25|$|Another {{example of}} {{filibuster}} in Canada federally came in early 2014 when NDP MP and Deputy Leader David Christopherson filibustered the government's bill C-23, the Fair Elections Act at the Procedure and House Affairs Committee. His filibuster lasted several meetings {{the last of}} which he spoke for over 8 hours and was done to support his own motion to hold cross country hearings on the bill so MPs could <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Canadian public thought of the bill. In the end, given that the Conservative government had a majority at committee, his motion was defeated and the bill passed although with some significant amendments.|$|E
500|$|The vote {{results in}} a special June {{election}} were overwhelming. It was the largest turnout in any special election {{in the history of}} Dade County. Voters supported repealing the gay rights ordinance by a margin of more than two to one. Bryant danced a jig when the response was announced, and told reporters [...] "All America and all the world will <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> people have said, and with God's continued help, we will prevail in our fight to repeal similar laws throughout the nation which attempt to legitimize a life style that is both perverse and dangerous". National Gay Task Force (NGTF) co-director Jean O'Leary said that the result was [...] "all the evidence anyone could need of the extent and virulence of prejudice against lesbians and gay men in our society".|$|E

The song samples elements of [...] "Pony" [...] (1996), as performed by Ginuwine and written by Elgin [...] "Ginuwine" [...] Lumpkin, Stephen Garrett and Timothy [...] "Timbaland" [...] Mosley. In an interview with MTV News Ginuwine stated: [...] "You know what? My management told me she wanted to use it, and Rihanna, I'm a fan of hers and I love what she's doing. You got to embrace it! You can't be a stickler... especially when an artist like Rihanna wants to use it".

500|$|The {{original}} opening couch gag shows a pastiche of {{the cover}} collage from The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was first used {{earlier in the season}} for [...] "Bart After Dark". Otherwise, the episode refers to other TV shows, including the syndicated couch gag featuring the Flintstone family, recycled from the season four episode [...] "Kamp Krusty", to mark The Simpsons surpassing The Flintstones as the longest-running animated series. Roy calls Homer and Marge Mr. and Mrs. S, which echoes Fonzie calling the Cunninghams [...] "Mr. and Mrs. C" [...] on Happy Days. Later, he decides to move in with [...] "two sexy ladies", recalling Jack Tripper in Three's Company. Homer hiding in the closet to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> network executives were planning to do with Poochie is a reference to Jay Leno reportedly eavesdropping on a conversation between NBC executives on whether he or David Letterman would replace Johnny Carson as the host of The Tonight Show.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Hibbert {{introduces}} a frail Ben Matlock {{to a crowd}} of excited seniors at the Grand Opening of the Center for Geriatric Medicine. After seeing his idol mobbed to the ground by fans, Grampa becomes aware of his mortality and gives the family their inheritances early. He leaves the family a box of old silver dollars that they decide to spend at the mall right away. At the mall, Lisa sees the new talking Malibu Stacy doll in a toy store. Throughout the trip home, Grampa constantly tells stories and spouts useless advice, making the family shun him. Back home, Lisa is anxious to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> talking Malibu Stacy has to say, but is disappointed with her sexist phrases (such as [...] "Don't ask me, I'm just a girl" [...] and [...] "Thinking too much gives you wrinkles"). Lisa is angry {{that no one else}} can see the ridiculousness of the doll. She and Grampa sit at the kitchen table, bemoaning how they are treated because of their age while both of them decide to change, Grampa to get a job, and Lisa to find Malibu Stacy's creator, Stacy Lovell.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Multiple {{consoles}} can be {{used for}} different applications in a single sound reinforcement system. [...] The Front of House (FOH) mixing console must be located where the operator can see the action on stage and hear the output of the loudspeaker system. [...] Some venues with permanently installed systems such as religious facilities and theaters place the mixing console within an enclosed booth, but this approach is more common for broadcast and recording applications. [...] This is far less common in live sound reproduction, since the engineer performs best when he can <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> audience hears.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{prosecutor}} wanted more from Hood and Washington, he pressed them further, and allegedly started {{to offer the}} two men cash for their support in bringing justice to the Charlotte Three for their presumed role in the burning of Lazy B Stables.

2500|$|For their 1978 {{follow-up}} album, Brakara, Prima Vera {{decided to}} include [...] "Arne Belinda" [...] anyway, by slightly altering the song's melody so that Erik Bye {{could no longer}} be credited as composer. This move gave Prima Vera lots of publicity ahead of the release, and with rumors of Bye going to court to have the album stopped, people flocked to the music stores to secure a copy before the album was withdrawn from the market, and to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fuss was all about. As a result, Brakara sold [...] copies in Norway, went platinum, and {{reached the top of the}} album chart, where it remained in the top five for 13 weeks. The rumored lawsuit from Erik Bye never came, but in his 2004 autobiography Falsk credits the [...] "Arne Belinda" [...] debacle as the single-biggest reason Brakara topped the charts, claiming this was [...] "the kind of publicity you couldn't buy with all the money in the world", and helped make Prima Vera a national phenomenon.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908 the Swiss {{mountain}} dog appeared for {{the first}} time in public. At a show in Langenthal, Switzerland, Franz Schertenleib [...] a breeder of the Berner [...] showed an extraordinarily strong, short-haired Berner Sennenhund. He had seen this dog and bought him as an oddity. He was eager to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Langenthal judge, Professor Heim, would say about this short-haired Berner. Bello vom Schlossgut was beautifully marked, [...] high, sturdy, and with attractive colors. Heim's first look saw the possibility of a new breed of Sennenhunde. He remembered having seen similar dogs in the 1860s in various parts of Switzerland. He said to Schertenleib, [...] "The dog belongs in a different category; he is too gorgeous and thoroughbred to push him aside as a poor example of a Berner. He is an example of the old-time, almost extinct, butcher dog." [...] Heim wrote in his judge’s notes: [...] "Bello is a marvelous, old Sennen (Butcher) hund of the large, almost extinct breed. Had he been entered under [...] "other breeds" [...] I would have recognized him as grossen Sennenhund and awarded him first prize with pleasure. Since he was entered among the Durrbachs, I cannot give this interesting dog more than second prize. This dog is out of place here." ...|$|E
