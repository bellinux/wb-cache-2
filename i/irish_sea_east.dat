40|$|The mid Carboniferous Quebradas Formation of the ‘South Portuguese Zone’ (SPZ) {{comprises}} 80 m of post-mature black mudrocks {{with a mean}} TOC of 2. 5 %. Lithostratigraphic {{units of}} similar facies and age such as the Holywell Shale, the Edale Shale and the Bowland Shale are important HC source rocks in the UK, having sourced a considerable proportion of the hydrocarbons in the East <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea,</b> <b>East</b> Midlands and Formby oilfields respectively. The kerogen content of the Quebradas Formation is mixed but slightly more oil-prone in its lower part. At outcrop, it is strongly post-mature with vitrinite reflectance (Rr) ca. 4 %. Illite crystallinity results from the Quebradas Formation and associated units suggest lower maturity than vitrinite reflectance. Analysis of the optic fabric of very thin coal lenses within the Brejeira Formation which overlies the Quebradas Formation suggests that peak temperatures were attained before the Variscan (late Carboniferous – early Permian) deformation. Triassic rocks unconformably overlying the Carboniferous sequence are much less mature, with Rr ca. 1. 2 %. Although the the Quebradas Fm has no HC source potential onshore due to its high maturity, Carboniferous rocks offshore may not have experienced the same extreme thermal history as the SPZ...|$|E
40|$|The {{report is}} based on work {{conducted}} in a workshop that was held in Brest, France on 13 – 16 October 2015, and describes the preparatory work {{in response to the}} EC longterm management plans for western EU waters (ICES Subareas V to X). Specifically Art. 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1380 / 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, which requires a multiannual plan including quantifiable target. In this context ICES was requested to provide plausible values around FMSY for some stocks inhabiting western EU waters. Estimates of reference points Blim, Bpa, Flim and Fpa are provided for the stocks considered, and the FMSY ranges [Flower, Fupper] are estimated by ICES to be precautionary, and deliver no more than 5 % reduction in long-term yield compared with MSY. The report provides information on the following stocks: •	Black-bellied anglerfish (Lophius budegassa) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	White-bellied anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	Blue ling (Molva dypterygia) in Subdivision Vb, and Subareas VI and VII •	Cod (Gadus morhua) in Divisions VIIe-k (Celtic Sea cod), Division VIIa (Irish Seand Division VIa (West of Scotland) •	Sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in Divisions IVbc, VIIa, and VIId–h (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, English Channel, and southern North Sea) •	Greenland halibut in Subareas V, VI, XII and XIV •	Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in Divisions VIIb,c,e-k and Division VIb (Rockall) •	Hake (Merluccius merluccius) in Division IIIa, Subareas IV, VI and VII and Divisions VIIIa,b,d (Northern stock) and in Division VIIIc and IXa (Southern stock) •	Megrim (Lepidorhombus spp) in Divisions IVa and VIa •	Four-spot megrim (Lepidorhombus boscii) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	Megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in Division VIIe (Western Channel) •	Sole (Solea solea) in Divisions VIIIa,b (Bay of Biscay), Divisions VIIf,g (Celtic Sea, Division VIIe (Western Channel) and Division VIIa (Irish Sea) •	Whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in Division VIIe-k, Division VIIa (Irish Sea) and Division VIa (West of Scotland) •	Nephrops in Division VIa (North Minch, FU 11), Division VIa (South Minch, FU 12),Division VIa (Firth of Clyde + Sound of Jura, FU 13, Division VIIa (<b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>East,</b> FU 14), Division VIIa (Irish Sea West, FU 15), Division VIIb,c,j,k (Porcupine Bank, FU 16), Division VIIb (Aran Grounds, FU 17), Division VIIa,g,j (Southeast and West of IRL, FU 19) and the Smalls (FU 22) For stocks where ICES advice is given based on the MSY approach, ICES has developed an advice rule (AR) based on the FMSY fishing mortality reference point, that provides the exploitation rate to give catch advice, and a biomass reference point MSY Btrigge r which is used to linearly reduce F if the biomass in the TAC year is predicted to be lower than this reference value (ICES, 2015).

50|$|Dublin Bay (Cuan Bhaile Átha Cliath) is a C-shaped inlet of the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> on the <b>east</b> {{coast of}} Ireland. The bay is about 10 {{kilometres}} wide along its north-south base, and 7 km in length to its apex at {{the centre of}} the city of Dublin; stretching from Howth Head in the north to Dalkey Point in the south. North Bull Island is situated in the northwest part of the bay, where one of two major inshore sand banks lay, and features a 5 km long sandy beach, Dollymount Strand, fronting an internationally recognised wildfowl reserve. Many of the rivers of Dublin reach the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> at Dublin Bay: the River Liffey, with the River Dodder flow received less than 1 km inland, River Tolka, and various smaller rivers and streams.The metropolitan area of the city of Dublin surrounds three sides of the bay (the north, west, and south), while the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> lies to the east.

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{movement of}} Celtic Sea juvenile Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) {{during the first}} year of life into the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> results in two stocks of herring living together on <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> nursery grounds: the resident autumn-spawned juveniles that originate in the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea,</b> and the winter-spawned juveniles that hatch in the Celtic Sea and drift into the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> as larvae. Measurements of otolith increment width can be used to distinguish between the fast-growing winter-spawned and the slow-growing autumn-spawned stocks, but this method can be time-consuming. Otolith shape analysis is investigated as an alternative method for discriminating between seasonal spawning stocks. Juvenile herring collected from nursery grounds in the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> in 2006 were classified as autumn- or winter-spawned using increment width measurements.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> is eutrophic is addressed by reviewing the evidence for anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, elevated phytoplankton production and biomass and undesirable disturbance {{in the context of the}} EU and OSPAR definitions of eutrophication. Winter concentrations of dissolved available inorganic phosphate (DAIP), nitrogen (DAIN as nitrate and nitrite) and silicate (Si) in coastal waters and concentrations of DAIP and Si in offshore waters of the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> are elevated relative to winter Celtic Sea shelf break concentrations (0. 5 μM DAIP, 7. 7 μM DAIN and 2. 7 μM Si). Significant, negative nutrient salinity relationships and analysis of the Isle of Man nutrient time-series indicate that the elevated <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> levels of DAIP and DAIN are the result of anthropogenic enrichment with highest concentrations (≈ 2. 0 μM DAIP, 30 μM DAIN and 17 μM Si) measured in near shore eastern <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> waters. Summer levels of phytoplankton chlorophyll (Chl) range from < 0. 1 to 11. 4 mg m− 3 (mean: 3. 4 mg m− 3) and from < 0. 1 to 16. 4 mg m− 3 (mean: 2. 2 mg m− 3) in coastal and offshore waters of the western <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea,</b> respectively. Offshore eastern <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> summer chlorophyll levels range from 0. 3 to 3. 8 mg m− 3 (mean: 1. 8 mg m− 3). Higher levels of spring (up to 43. 9 mg m− 3) and summer (up to 22. 7 mg m− 3) biomass in Liverpool Bay are attributed to nutrient enrichment. Estimates of spring and summer production in different regions of the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> are ≤ 194 g C m− 2. The absence of: (a) oxygen depletion in near shore and open waters of the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> (except the seasonally isolated western <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> bottom water); (b) trends in the frequency of Phaeocystis spp. blooms and occurrence of toxin producing algae; and (c) changes in the dominant life form of pelagic primary producers, point to a lack of undesirable disturbance and hence argue against anthropogenic eutrophication in the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea.</b> This conclusion is discussed in the context of future trends in anthropogenic nutrient inputs...|$|R
