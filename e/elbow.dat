5|$|On April 8, 2015, Nathan {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to a strained right <b>elbow.</b> During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured his <b>elbow</b> after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing tears in his ulnar collateral ligament of the <b>elbow</b> and his pronator teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, but he was not planning to retire yet.|$|E

5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and {{her right arm}} became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her <b>elbow</b> to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an <b>elbow</b> reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the <b>elbow.</b> Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe {{grew up in}} South Australia, {{and studied}} at St Peter's College, Adelaide in his youth. There he earned the {{attention}} of cricket watchers for his skill and his suspect action. Halcombe was suspected of throwing, meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player straightens his arm {{in the process of}} delivering the ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of his <b>elbow</b> in delivering the ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George Giffen. To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and <b>elbow</b> were encased in splints, so that he could not move his <b>elbow</b> position. He delivered balls at varying speeds, and the experts failed to detect an illegal action.|$|E

BACKGROUND Injection <b>elbows,</b> designed and tested to IEEE ™ 386, IEEE 592, and ANSI C 119. 4, utilized to supply fluid under low, unsustained pressure have evolved slowly {{over the last two}} decades. The very first injection <b>elbows</b> were created by Bertini and an associate at Dow Corning in 1986. These first injection <b>elbows</b> were crude tools, which were modifications of standard capacitive test point <b>elbows.</b> A hole was drilled and tapped through the capacitive test point and a nylon interface was threaded into the hole. When the injection period was complete, typically about 60 - 120 days after it wa...|$|R

40|$|Site {{inspections}} of Hot Reheat Piping system have indentifed cracking {{at a number}} locations at butt welds between pipe runs and <b>elbows.</b> Furthermore,it was discovered that pipe runs are instaled with wall thickness of SCH 60 (ANSI/ASME code[3]),and <b>elbows</b> with wall thickness of SCH 30 what is not according to design documentation. This wall thickness discrepancy creates a stress enhancement at the connections between <b>elbows</b> and piping runs. Also,because the <b>elbows</b> are more flexible,there could be a propensity for a creep strains to be concentrated in the <b>elbows</b> as the piping system stresses will be relaxed at these lower strength <b>elbows</b> rather than being distributed throughout the main piping runs.

40|$|Classical {{theoretical}} {{treatments for}} diffusional deposition of particles in tube flow describe the losses within straight tubes. The plumbing in many systems of practical interest, notably aerosol instruments, consists of short segments of tubing connected by <b>elbows,</b> bends, and other disturbances. To understand the particle losses in such systems, particle losses in tube flows containing bends and <b>elbows</b> {{has been studied}} for Reynolds numbers ranging from 80 to 950. Monodisperse aerosol of 5 – 15 nm diameter particles passed through individual bends or <b>elbows,</b> and {{through a number of}} bends or <b>elbows</b> in series. The results show that the effect of bends and <b>elbows</b> on particle diffusion loss is significant. For a flow configuration with four <b>elbows</b> in series, the penetration efficiency drops as much as 44 % when compared to a straight tube with the same length. For Reynolds number smaller than 250, the enhancement of diffusion losses due to bends and <b>elbows</b> is sensitive to both the relative orientations of the bends and <b>elbows</b> and the lengths of straight tubing between them. Because of this sensitivity, direct calibration or simulation is required to assess nanoparticle penetration efficiencies for any flow system containing bends or <b>elbows</b> at low Reynolds number. When the Reynolds number exceeds 250, the enhancement is insensitive to the actual flow configurations. Experimental results are presented, which may be useful for design of aerosol flow systems at Reynolds number larger than 250...|$|R
