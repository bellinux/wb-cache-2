50|$|In finance, an <b>exotic</b> <b>option</b> is {{an option}} which has {{features}} making it more complex than commonly traded vanilla options. Like the more general exotic derivatives they may have several triggers relating to determination of payoff. An <b>exotic</b> <b>option</b> may also include non-standard underlying instrument, developed for a particular client or for a particular market. Exotic options are more complex than options that trade on an exchange, and are generally traded over the counter (OTC).|$|E

40|$|International audienceTailor-made to fit investors' {{specific}} needs, <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> {{are more}} efficient than traditional ones {{to the extent that}} they allow a better risk reallocation between economic agents. However, due to the increasing complexity of <b>exotic</b> <b>options,</b> it is necessary to have a well specified classification structure for these products for better use and control. This article proposes a new approach to classify and design <b>exotic</b> <b>options.</b> Using traditional option characteristics as benchmark, options are classified according to their associated degrees of exoticism, which depend on the violation of any combinations of 5 traditional option characteristics. Accordingly, options are classified in the same group if they do not meet the same traditional conditions. In our methodology, 64 most frequently traded <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> can be classified and 26 new <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> can be created. This would help regulators and small investors to have a better understanding on complicated <b>exotic</b> <b>options,</b> so that they can assess precisely the riskiness related to these products...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There are {{no known}} exact {{formulas}} for the valuation {{of a number}} of <b>exotic</b> <b>options,</b> and this is particularly true for options under discrete monitoring and for American style options. Therefore, one usually recourses to a Monte Carlo Simulation approach, amongst other numerical methods, to estimate the value of these options. The problem which then arises with this method is one of variance reduction. Control variates are often used, and we present some results concerning these control variables, for the valuation of Asian and lookback options. An inequality on functions of correlations useful for comparing estimators in variance reduction procedures is also provided. 1. The problem of <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> valuations There are two main types of options. Standard European or American put and call options are referred to as vanilla options. These are exchange traded options and their payoffs depend on the price of the underlying asset at exercise time only. Contrary to these, there are derivatives with more complicated payoffs and which are referred to as <b>exotic</b> <b>options.</b> Most <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> trade in over-thecounte...|$|R
50|$|A cliquet option or ratchet {{option is}} an <b>exotic</b> <b>option</b> {{consisting}} {{of a series of}} consecutive forward start options. The first is active immediately. The second becomes active when the first expires, etc. Each option is struck at-the-money when it becomes active.|$|E
50|$|A double digital {{option is}} similar to the <b>exotic</b> <b>option</b> with a few exceptions. for {{instance}} a double digital option has two strike prices that is the expected price during the trade season. The option has two types of strikes namely the lower and the upper strikes.|$|E

"Local volatility" [...] {{is thus a}} {{term used}} in {{quantitative}} finance to denote the set of diffusion coefficients, , {{that are consistent with}} market prices for all options on a given underlying.

40|$|Purpose of the article: „Exotic options“ {{are those}} sorts of {{optional}} instruments that, {{in terms of their}} properties, overtake restrictions of standard, so called „Plain Vanilla“ options, which means that they show „exotic properties“. With regard {{to the fact that they}} are stipulated, their versatility is practically unlimited, therefore their unanimous classification does not exist. The objective of this article is to outline suitable criteria for their basic division and, consequently, to create suitable method of system classification of <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> in accordance with their characteristic specific properties. Methodology/methods: Proposed classification of <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> is based on detailed analysis of their individual categories and on specification of their specific characteristic properties. Pursuant to knowledge, acquired in this way, they are systemized into individual groups and sub-groups. Scientific aim: This is an individual and therefore brand new way of possible systemization of <b>exotic</b> <b>options.</b> It is a multi-level open system, enabling to embody de facto all exotic optional instruments, including possible future ones. Findings: Pursuant to performed analysis of specific properties of individual kinds of <b>exotic</b> <b>options,</b> all evaluated optional instruments were divided into five theoretically defined basic groups and subsequently specified in details in accordance with their specific characteristics. Conclusions: Performed analysis proved that many various sorts of <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> are being used in financial markets. Whereas they are more and more often used for creating various sorts of synthetic investment instruments (so called “structured products”), it seems to be clear that their number will be growing. It was proved though that criteria enabling their systemization can be defined. In the case given, these criteria are specific optional properties that enable creating comprehensive, open, multi-level system for <b>exotic</b> <b>options,</b> the presentation of which is the content of this article...|$|R

40|$|A key {{question}} in option pricing concerns how to incorporate {{information about the}} prices of existing, liquidly traded options into the prices of <b>exotic</b> <b>options.</b> Rather than trying to calibrate market prices to models, an alternative approach is to construct model-free bounds {{on the price of}} <b>exotic</b> <b>options.</b> These bounds are derived from arbitrages that may be constructed using relatively simple trading strategies in vanilla options, and their simplicity means that the bounds are generally valid for a wide class of models. This article discusses the construction of arbitrage bounds for a variety of classes of <b>exotic</b> <b>options,</b> and describes different techniques and approaches to the construction of such bounds. Particular examples include model-free bounds on the price of one-touch options, and pricing barrier options under the assumption of put–call symmetry...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{instruments}} {{traded in}} the markets and investors’ situation in such markets are {{getting more and more}} complex. This leads to more complex derivative structures used for hedging that are harder to analyze and which risk is harder managed. Because of the complexity of these instruments, the basic characteristics of many <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> may sometimes be not clearly understood. Most scientific studies have been focused on developing models for pricing various types of <b>exotic</b> <b>options,</b> {{but it is important to}} study their unique characteristics and to understand them correctly in order to use them in proper market situations. The paper examines main aspects of options, emphasizing the variety of <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> and their place in financial markets and risk management process. As the exact valuation of <b>exotic</b> <b>options</b> is quite difficult, the article deals with the theoretical and practical aspects of pricing of chooser options that suggest a broad range of usage and application in different market conditions. The calculations made in the article showed that the price of the chooser is closely correlated with the choice time and low correlated with its strike price. So the first mentioned factor should be taken into consideration when making appropriate hedging and investing decisions...|$|R
