40|$|The main {{question}} asked {{of the work}} described in this thesis was howthe sawing of logs into sawn timber can be performed more efficientlywith respect to the choice of raw material, volume and value yield in thesawing and in the grading of the sawn timber produced. The development of industrial computed tomography scanning providesinformation about the external and internal properties of a sawlogat production speed. This opens up new possibilities of controlling theflow of raw material early {{in the process and}} of optimizing the breakdownof each sawlog. Another use of industrial computed tomography scanningis for predicting the strength of sawn timber better than is possible withcurrent visual and machine strength grading equipment. A more traditional way of increasing sawmill profitability is by increasingthe volume of sawn timber. One way of doing this is by reducing thesaw blade thickness which results in less sawdust. With the use of thinnersaw blades however there is a risk that the saw blades become misalignedwhich in turn leads to saw mismatch, an unevenness seen on the surfaceof the sawn timber. In this work, attempts were made to automaticallymeasure and monitor saw mismatch in a sawmill during ongoing production. It is also possible for a sawmill to increase its profitability by measuresnot related to the sawing process. One such example is customer adaptationwhen delivering the sawn timber. Different customers use the sawntimber for different purposes and consequently have different requirements,which is why the sawn timber produced is graded and sorted before it isdelivered to the customer. In this work, an alternative method for gradingsawn timber more efficiently using a multivariate method was developedand evaluated. The following results have been obtained:Log breakdowns of 716 Scots pine logs and 750 Norway spruce logsthat had been scanned using computed tomography were simulated andthe rotational position of each log was optimized. The results showedan average relative value increase of 16 % for appearance graded sawntimber compared to the conventional horns down position. When simulating log breakdowns of 677 Norway spruce logs with respect to visuallystrength graded sawn timber, an average relative value increase of 11 %was obtained. The effect that errors in knot detection algorithms had ona breakdown optimization was also analysed when optimizing breakdownof 57 Norway spruce sawlogs. The results showed that errors in the knotdiameter had the most severe impact on the average relative value increaseof a log rotation optimization, followed by errors in the <b>dead</b> <b>knot</b> border. The smallest effect was observed in the case of errors in rotational positionof the knots. Computed tomography scanning can also be used in a sawmill for log sorting in relation to different end-uses of the sawn timber. A simulationsoftware for cross-cutting optimization based on computed tomographydata was developed and it was shown that there was a reasonable correlationbetween these results and the results of an industrial system. Sincethe developed software can be combined with log breakdown simulationsbased on computed tomography data, it is evident that computed tomographycan be used to identify logs that would result in a poor volume yieldin the subsequent cross-cut optimization. Destructive bending strength tests were performed on 113 pieces of Norway spruce sawn timber. Multivariate models for predicting the bending strength of the sawn timber were created using computed tomography data of the sawlogs from which the sawn timber originated. The results showed that computed tomography scanning of logs produced prediction models of bending strength with a higher accuracy than discrete X-rayscanning. The main advantage was the detailed knot information {{that could be used in}} the prediction models. A method to measure saw mismatch automatically in a sawmill basedon laser triangulation was developed and the measurements were well correlatedwith manual measurements of saw mismatch. When laser triangulationwas used to measure saw mismatch in a sawmill, a distinguishabletrend of increasing magnitude and frequency of saw mismatch was observed. Finally, ways in which the sawn timber in a sawmill could be gradedand sorted more efficiently was investigated. It was found that by using agrading method based on multivariate techniques it is possible to increasethe proportion of higher sawn timber grades by up to 10 percentage points,which may increase sawmill profitability.

30|$|Knowledge of the {{occurrence}} of sound and <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> {{on the surface of}} sugi is important for the classification and application of the material. This study examined a color vision system for detecting sound and <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> on sugi. The system can be conceptually divided into three components: a CCD-camera scanning system, an image-segmenting module, and a rule-based defect identifying module. The results showed that the potential defect regions could be located by Otsu’s threshold algorithm in conjunction with t-test analysis. The accuracies of locating sound <b>knots</b> and <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> were 92.6 % and 97.1 %, respectively. The rule-based approach was used to identify sound and <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> and the identifying accuracies for sound <b>knots</b> and <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> were 92.0 % and 94.1 %, respectively. The overall detection accuracy of the system was 87.6 %. The results indicated that the rule-based color vision system is an efficient means of detecting sound <b>knots</b> and <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> on sugi.|$|R
30|$|A {{possible}} explanation for the negative correlation between potential log yield gain and site index is that a slow growing tree results in a shorter distance between whorls and a shorter sound knot length [28 – 30], also resulting in lower yield when the sawing is uncontrolled, and therefore a higher potential for optimization. The impact of knot size was probably small in this study, since <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> were not allowed at all, while sound knots had a rather generous size limit of 50  mm.|$|R

In other words, the process parameters used in this study are based on a real case and a real product, in this case legs for wood cabinets made of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). In this product, <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> and large fresh knots are unwanted, something which affects the quality specifications used.|$|R

A further aim was to investigate claims that <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> and the twisting of the heartwood cause, quality problems in the but of the small-size pine. The theoretical framework of the study details the whole manufacturing process from raw material to the finished article; the description of the qualities of raw material, the sawing and drying processes as well as the making of the glueboard. The solve {{the research}} problem the following figures were calculated: amount of small-size pines, the yield and quality of sawn timber which can be used for making glueboard as well as the variables which affect the various stages of the process. The results show that about half of the timber from the thinning process was suitable material for sawing. The most common problem with the unsuitable timber was form defects of the stem. The average usage ratio of sawing was 2, 31 k-m 3 /m 3. 87, 97 % of the sawn timber could be used for the production of glueboard. The unsuitability of sawn timber for making glueboard was mainly caused by breakage and the twisting of the heartwood. <b>Dead</b> <b>knots</b> were small and did not effect the quality of the but of the small-size pine. It can therefore be concluded that small-size pine is suitable raw material for glueboard...|$|R
30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that the potential yield increase when using CT scanning to control a sawing process, {{with the aim of}} making a crosscut furniture product with rather high demands on <b>dead</b> <b>knots,</b> can be more than 11  % points in the crosscutting operation and more than 4  % points when viewing the process as a whole. This increase is compared to sawing the logs horns down and centered. It corresponds to a relative yield increase of 17 and 18  %, respectively. Logs with a high yield potential are characterized by a high age and slow growth, while the opposite can be said for logs with a small yield potential.|$|R
30|$|The {{inherent}} {{variability of}} wood material together with sub-optimization in production processes {{means that a}} lot of potential value is lost. Computed tomography scanning together with simulation models of the production processes could remedy this, and ensure optimization of the entire production process. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate if such methods can be used to optimize the sawing position of logs in a production process including further processing, in this case crosscutting to make a furniture product with strict quality requirements on <b>dead</b> <b>knots.</b> This was done on 47 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) logs. The results show a potential yield increase of more than 11  % points in the crosscutting operation and more than 4  % points when viewing the process as a whole, compared to sawing the logs horns down and centered.|$|R

3000|$|By contrast, {{there were}} {{considerable}} discrepancies between the boards {{in the analysis}} and validation samples {{in the case of}} log-sector class 2. As Fig.  8 a shows, a three-cluster solution was distinct for the validation sample as well and therefore deriving the same number of groups for the validation sample as for the analysis sample did not conflict with a feasible interpretation of the cluster tree. However, the visual impression of the derived board compositions markedly differed for two of the three groups. While a group comprising only clear or near knot-free boards was established for the validation sample as well, a good separation between boards with large sound knots and boards with smaller <b>dead</b> <b>knots</b> was not accomplished. As compositions 2 and 3 in Fig.  8 b illustrate, boards with predominantly large sound knots and boards with black knots were mixed in those groups with some near clear boards distributed over both.|$|R
30|$|The logs {{with the}} highest {{potential}} yield gain could be found among the logs with a low yield when sawing horns down and centered. This indicates that the largest possibilities for optimization lie {{in this type of}} logs. The (negative) correlation between log yield and potential yield gain for all logs was not high enough to draw any definite conclusions, even if it is significant at the 0.05 probability level, but it points in the same direction. The same is true for log age, which had a positive and significant correlation to potential log yield gain. This is reasonable since the product in question had strict rules for <b>dead</b> <b>knots,</b> something which is found more frequently in older trees than in younger ones. This results in a low yield when not controlling the process with full information on knots, which means increased possibility to optimize the process when such information is available. The latter is the case when a CT scanner is used to scan logs and detect knots inside them.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the variation in selected technical properties of mature (age> 60 years) birch stems in southern and central Finland. Technical properties were defi ned as the natural external characteristics that cause differences in the usability of a certain section of stem in the mechanical wood industry, saw milling in particular. On mineral soils, birch stems in mixed stands were slightly larger than those in pure birch stands. On peatlands, however, birch stems in pure stands were larger than those in mixed stands. The average stem form of silver birch was straighter than that of white birch. Small-sized log sections of white birch, as well as those of codominant silver birch, typically contain many <b>dead</b> <b>knots.</b> On mineral soils, coniferous admixture had a positive effect on self-pruning of white birch. Self-pruning of silver birch was as good in pure birch stands as in mixed stands of spruce and birch. Occurrence of decay did not differ signifi cantly between the two birch species. Not only silver birch, due to the growth and yield of the stand, but also vigorous and good-quality white birch, because of the possibility to provide high-quality logs, can be maintained profi tably as an admixture in coniferous forests until fi nal cutting...|$|R

40|$|The {{classification}} of round wood {{depends on the}} defects and other morphological features of a tree trunk. Various tree species growing on different forest sites and in different conditions eventually present a wood quality influenced by said factors. The objective {{of this paper was}} to find out: 1) the distribution of round wood qua-lity classes of beech in three different site conditions and 2) the frequency of the defects influencing timber grading. The research was carried out on 15 different sample plots of three site quality classes, on which 1389 beech logs were classified according to the existing grading scheme. The most common timber quality (by vo-lume) was WC 0 and then in decreasing order: WD, WB 0 and WA 0, in proportions of: 15 : 10 : 4 : 1. This order was the same for the assortments obtained from the trees in all the analysed site quality classes. The most frequent defects influencing wood quality were knots, among which sound knots were in the majority. The proportion of the appearance of knots was 7 : 3 : 2 for sound <b>knots,</b> unsound and <b>dead</b> <b>knots,</b> as well as covered knots, respectively.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the content of catechin in normal and traumatic structures of beechwood by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Two discs were sawn from each of six harvested trees. The first disc was taken from the lower, wounded part and the second one from the upper part of each stem. Discs containing the bases of living and dead branches were taken from the crown. Samples of wound-wood, reaction zones, sapwood, as well as living and <b>dead</b> <b>knots,</b> were sampled from discs. Samples were milled and then extracted sequentially by cyclohexane and methanol/water in a Soxhlet apparatus. A method for the separation of catechins from extracts was developed for the present chromatographic investigation. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences in total or hydrophilic extractives, nor in the content of catechin among the investigated trees. The content of hydrophilic extractives and catechin were significantly different among the investigated categories of wood tissues. Wound-wood and knot extracts contained the highest amount of this flava- 3 -ol. Reaction zones contained higher amounts of catechin than discolored wood, but less than sapwood. The extracts of discolored wood showed the lowest amounts of catechin. Sapwood samples that originated from wounded discs exhibited significantly higher contents of catechin than normal sapwood from upper discs. Accumulation of bioactive compound catechin in wound-wood, sapwood and knots is considered to be {{an important part of the}} survival strategy of living trees...|$|R
30|$|Recoveries from {{individual}} stems were variable. The most important determinants of log value were log size, which affected timber recovery; pruning quality, which governed {{the volume of}} clear wood; the proportion of heartwood, (valued for durability and appearance); {{and to a lesser}} extent, mid-stem branch vitality. High incidence of <b>dead</b> (bark-encased) <b>knots</b> in most of the unpruned logs contributed to the poor timber grade recovery results. Other defects (insect tunnels, rot and traumatic resin pockets) were associated with a 7 % reduction in financial value. Accurate prediction of the pattern of distribution of heartwood inside a redwood log could {{play a major role in}} maximising the value of recovered timber.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} this {{preliminary}} study on {{a small sample of}} trees indicate that the value recovery from individual logs was highly variable. The most important factors determining economic value of redwood trees are: log size (SED); pruning (pruned log PLI); and heartwood content. The amount of rot and insect damage (permitted only in merchantable timber grades) affects the financial value both pruned and unpruned logs (7 % in this case). Decrease in financial value due to the presence of <b>dead</b> branches (decayed <b>knots)</b> was less obvious than expected.|$|R

Brashing {{the second and third}} logs resulted in a substantial shift in volumes of sawn timber calculated on a stand area basis from the four lowest value grades (Construction Common, Construction Heart, Merchantable Common and Merchantable Heart) to four highest value grades (Heart B, B Common, Clear Common or Clear All Heart) (33 % of all pieces, Table  7). Approximately 10 % of boards were re-graded to Clear All Heart and Clear Common, the greatest shift being from Merchantable and Construction to B grades.|$|R

40|$|Knot-related defects are {{the major}} cause of timber quality degradation, and {{diminishing}} this kind of defects {{is an important issue}} in forest management. For the purpose of clear-wood production, knot attributes and branch occlusion of Betula alnoides under natural pruning were investigated in a 14 -year-old experimental plantation with five planting densities ranging from 500 to 3333 stems per hectare in southern China, and a total of 1325 occluded branches from 30 trees were sampled and dissected. The mean occluded branch diameter (OBD), radius of knots and branch insertion angle (IA) decreased significantly with increasing planting density. Planting with high stocking density significantly reduced the frequency of thick occluded branches (diameter ≥ 20 mm) while increasing the frequency of small ones (diameter < 10 mm). Branch occlusion time (OT) also tended to increase with decreasing planting density. The results of generalized linear mixed models showed that OBD was the major factor influencing OT, radius of <b>dead</b> portion of <b>knot</b> (RDP), total radius of knot (TRK) and IA. In addition, OT was positively correlated with RDP but negatively correlated with stem diameter growth rate during branch occlusion (SDGR).

40|$|Abstract. The {{shape and}} {{structure}} of branches attached internally to the stem (knots) for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees were modeled. Data on knot shape {{were obtained from the}} dissection of branches taken from 34 22 -yr-old sample trees growing under ten different initial spacings. A total of 341 branches located below the live crown were dissected in the radial/tangential plane. Afterward, a procedure was implemented to reconstruct the branch diameter perpendicular to the branch pith. This information was used to develop a model for representing knot shape, which assumed that the live portion of a knot can be modeled with a one-parameter equation and the dead portion by assuming a cylindrical shape. To study the variability in shape of individual knots (live portion), the model was fitted to 218 branch profiles using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling techniques. A graphical analysis indicated that the random-effects parameter was related to branch diameter. Thus, branch diameter was included as a predictor variable to reduce between-individual variability in knot shape. Reconstructed knots with smaller diameters were more cylindrical; those with larger diameters were more parabolic or conical in shape. Analytical ex-pressions were derived for estimating the volume of knots (live/dead portions) for three types of branch conditions on simulated trees: 1) live branches; 2) nonoccluded dead branches; and 3) occluded <b>dead</b> branches. The <b>knot</b> model assumes a substantial simplification of branch morphology, but should be useful for representing knots as 3 -D entities in the stems of loblolly pine trees...|$|R
