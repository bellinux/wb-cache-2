5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the 2005–06 season there were some roster changes. Two of the team's top players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon, had to report for compulsory military service. Starting goaltender, Kim Sung-Bae, retired after the previous season. Even though they were missing these players they were noted for having more players with more than 10 goals and 10 assists than in the previous season. With the departure of Song offensive output dropped slightly, the team's top offensive player finished 7th overall in <b>goals</b> <b>with</b> 21. However Martinec won the assists race with 53 and the overall points total with 71. The team shared top spot in the short-handed <b>goals</b> <b>with</b> 2 other teams, scoring 10 {{over the course of the}} season. With a further shortened season of only 34 games the team finished in 5th place and faced the other Korean team, Kangwon Land in the quarter finals. During the regular season Kangwon won 6 of 7 meetings, and the quarter finals were no different. Kangwon swept Halla in 3 games, the final game ending in 3–2 with a last minute desperate bid by Halla to tie the game.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown that {{attention}} is allocated to events relevant to the current goal of a person. Until now, research has focused on the implementation of a single goal leaving open the question of how attention is allocated when multiple goals are activated. We examined whether the allocation of spatial attention is affected by the prioritizing of one goal over another. The results of two dot probe studies showed that attention is oriented to stimuli relevant to a <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> high value when simultaneously presented with stimuli relevant to a <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> low value (Experiment 1) and to stimuli relevant to a <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> high expectancy of success that were simultaneously presented with stimuli relevant to a <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> low expectancy of success (Experiment 2). These findings demonstrate that the allocation of spatial attention is dependent on the motivational strength of goal pursuit...|$|R
