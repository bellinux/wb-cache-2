40|$|A {{measurement}} system for high precision determination of O 2 /N 2 ratios in air samples using an open split inlet system and mass spectrometric detection is described. A major {{advantage of the}} system is the low consumption of sample gas (about 2 ml STP per minute). The open split system is made from fused silica capillaries moving alternately within a glass tube thereby providing the function of a <b>Changeover</b> <b>Valve</b> commonly used in stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry for high precision comparison of the isotopic composition of two clean gases. Long term precision of the measurements, comparing hour averages are close to 2 per meg. Storage of air samples in glass flasks has been improved considerably by replacing the soft polymer O-ring with a lathe machined PCTFE seal. In one liter flasks air samples kept at 2 Bar (abs.) do not alter their O 2 /N 2 ratio by more than 7 per meg in 100 days. An effort to calibrate O 2 /N 2 ratio measurements across laboratories has been made using high pressure tanks. The original values of the tanks (measured by R. Keeling, SIO) were reproduced within an error of 1 % of the assigned difference...|$|R
30|$|The {{emission}} of air pollutants from ships of large size {{is a key}} factor in air quality state in the surrounding areas to ports. The work proposes a methodology for assessing the environmental impact of maritime traffic on air quality of port areas, evaluating the production and the dispersion of air pollutants produced by marine engines of large size during the approach phase to the port. According to current regulations, different scenarios have been analyzed, taking into account the possibility of <b>fuel</b> <b>changeover,</b> from heavy <b>fuel</b> oil (HFO) to marine gas oil (MGO), approaching the port. Emissions during the switch from HFO to MGO have been characterized. The analysis takes into account the most frequent routes of ships moving towards and away from the port. Different scenarios of pollutant emission from ships arriving and departing have been considered, evaluating in particular the effect on the coastal zone adjacent to the port. The results are represented graphically and provide valuable insights into the impact of marine traffic on air quality. Such information may be seen as useful tools for the improvement of maritime legislation on emissions.|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon {{emissions}} {{from a single}} cylinder Ricardo Hydra research engine have been analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for two isotopically labelled cyclohexane fuels: (1) an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and cyclohexane-d 1 - 2, and (2) cyclohexane-l,l, 3, 3 -d 4. Isotopic distributions of cyclohexane, cyclohexene, benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene and propylene within the exhaust gases {{have been used to}} investigate possible mechanistic pathways in the formation of these emission species. Results from the first fuel show that the exhaust cyclohexane consists entirely of unburnt fuel with a [C 6 D 1, 2]/[C 6 H 12] ratio of 1. 4, which indicates the presence of a kinetic isotope effect in the consumption of cyclohexane. The isotopic distributions within the other species are indicative of intramolecular decomposition pathways from the cyclohexyl radical. The exhaust benzene appears to be formed by successive dehydrogenations from cyclohexyl rather than by build up from smaller molecular weight species, 1, 3 -Butadiene is formed by β-scission of hexenyl species, whilst propylene is formed through an intramolecular rearrangement, probably involving a methylcyclopentyl intermediate. The second fuel shows that intramolecular hydrogen migration in the cyclohexyl radical is of minimal significance prior to its decomposition to cyclohexene. The isotopic distribution within the observed benzene, however, indicates partial scrambling prior to formation. A preliminary experiment using toluene-d 8 fuel indicates that the conditioning fuel or its breakdown products {{may play a role in}} the formation of exhaust hydrocarbons, particularly in samples taken shortly after the <b>fuel</b> <b>changeover,</b> but that the lubricating oil plays no significant role in the formation of these products...|$|R
40|$|Stockholm {{is one of}} {{the core}} {{demonstration}} cities in the EU-funded project for zero emission urban bus systems (ZeEUS). The city has ambitious environmental plans for sustainable public transportation for the coming decades. Stockholm’s environmental objectives for 2030 are: All fleets to be running on 100 % renewable fuel (already achieving in 2020) Reducing 75 % of particles and NOx based on 2009 Reducing 35 % of the energy usage per passenger/km in public transport  based on 2007 As it is apparent, Stockholm city council does not call for any particular technology in achieving the abovementioned environmental goals. Today, {{a large proportion of the}} bus fleet in Stockholm are running on either biogas or bio-diesel (Olsson, 2015; Olsson et al., 2015). However, achieving the other two set of goals i. e. reducing NOx/PMs and decreasing energy intensity rather require hybridization or electrification of the bus fleet on top of the renewable <b>fuel</b> <b>changeover</b> strategy over the long run. Thus, participation in the ZeEUS project is seen as the first step towards implementation of hybrid/electric vehicles in the city bus operations in real life conditions. According to ZeEUS website: “The demo wishes to prove that this system can be an important factor in the future public transport systems in the EU without big changes in the infrastructure. In the long term, the ZeEUS project will give important contribution to the cities strategic plans regarding electric buses and demo aims to continue operating after the project lifetime for a demo operational span of 8 - 12 years. ” (ZeEUS, 2016) [...] Miljöbuss project, VINNOVA 2015 - 0353...|$|R
40|$|For {{predictive}} maintenance of circuit breakers, {{a number of}} variables {{must be considered in}} order to assess the genuine working condition of a circuit breaker [CB]. This thesis selects vibration signatures obtained on the operating mechanisms and arcing chambers as a source of monitoring breaker conditions. The task of analyzing the behavior of a circuit breaker is perennial and difficult but the thesis has an attempt to tackle this problem. Experiments have been devised to monitor CBs; however, these have limitations details of which will be discussed. For example, each circuit breaker has its own unique vibration signature and the shape of the vibration may be different even though breakers confront similar problems. CBs have decades-long service life spans and failure rates are relatively low. Those that fail are not necessarily saved and there have been relatively few samples to base evidence upon. There are different vibration analysis algorithms available including Dynamic Time Warping [DTW], Resolution Ratio [RR], Discrete Envelope Statistics [DES], event time extraction, Chi-square based shape methods, and fractal theory. Some of these algorithms are based on acoustic properties of materials and rely on assessing extracted time component and the frequency components are extracted. This research applies multi-resolution analysis [MRA] to decomposed signals to in order to assess different sub-wave levels so that wave features may be captured and modeled. There are many ways to analyze the waves. This thesis uses optimizing fuzzy rules with genetic algorithm [GA] as the proposed method. The simuation part of the thesis uses spring performance {{as an example of how}} vibration signature analysis may be implemented. Spring vibrations are evaluated by two classification algorithms: Dynamic Time Warping [DTW] and multi-resolution analysis [MRA] with optimizing fuzzy rules with genetic algorithm [GA]. The first method is competent to identify the faulty cases from the normal ones by looking at the deviation of the vibration signature frequency content. In contrast, it is not capable to identify the degree of how bad it performs from looking at the frequency variation. For the second method, it is capable of not only classifying the abnormal cases from the normal cases, but also distinguishing the vibration signatures into different category so that the spring condition can be retrieved immediately. Fuzzy rules is capable of classify a new case to a category and genetic algorithm is an effective tool to minimize the applicable fuzzy rules. The accuracy of the identification is very satisfactory, which is over 90 %. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is very useful for asset management purpose of breaker since the lifespan of the spring is known. Diagnostic technicians are able to make decision on the replacement scheme of the spring. There are some areas that this research uncovered that suggests further study is mandated. For example, there are other parameters that can be monitored and compared other than spring constant such as valve position in trip coil and close coil, acceleration parameter in <b>changeover</b> <b>valves,</b> damping in hydraulic cylinders and mechanical linkages, gas pressure in primary contacts and breaker resistance in line system...|$|R
