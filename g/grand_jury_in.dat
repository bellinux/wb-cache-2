5|$|After {{he testified}} before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> New York, he was indicted on perjury charges. Although Spivey was not convicted {{when the case}} went to trial in 1953, he was {{prevented}} from competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) afterward. Spivey instead played professionally for various minor league teams. In 10 Eastern Basketball League (EBL) seasons, his teams won three championships. Spivey retired in 1968 and became a businessman, working in sales and operating restaurants. Upset by the accusations against him in the early 1950s, he was reclusive in his final years.|$|E
5|$|Four {{months after}} his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted along with former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman on October 28, 2005, by a federal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, obstruction of justice, racketeering, and bribery. Although the new charges were filed {{a month before the}} previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorneys accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy pleaded not guilty to all charges, but was convicted along with Siegelman in June 2006.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this honors thesis is to give an {{analysis}} of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> system <b>in</b> the United States today. In order to do so it is necessary to begin with the inception and history of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> system <b>in</b> England and how it subsequently came about in the United States. Then I will give a timeline of the progression of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> system <b>in</b> the U. S and any reforms or changes that have been made. After that I will talk about four other countries, England, Canada, Ireland, and France, all of which once had a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> system but have since abolished it. I will then lay out the main arguments of both proponents of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> system <b>in</b> the U. S. and critics of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> system. Finally, I will analyze two recent <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings that received national and international attention, the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases...|$|R

This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs {{during a time when}} there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet, and legitimate supplements.|$|E
5|$|During Col. William Stacy's post-war life, {{he was a}} pioneer, {{helping to}} {{establish}} Marietta, Ohio as the first permanent American settlement of the new United States in the Northwest Territory. He {{was active in the}} Marietta pioneer community, and served as foreman of the first <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> <b>in</b> the Northwest Territory, an event establishing the rule of law in the territory. At the age of 56, he ice skated thirty miles up a frozen river, warning two of his sons of a possible Indian attack, which occurred several days later as the Big Bottom massacre and {{marked the beginning of the}} Northwest Indian War.|$|E
5|$|In October 1988, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, {{together}} with eight associates (including Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman and weapons smuggler {{believed to have}} been involved with her husband's regime), were indicted by a federal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> Manhattan on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice. Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple's defense team was led by criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence. Actor George Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator, testified at trial under a grant of immunity, acknowledging that he had received a $5.5-million loan from an associate of hers. In July 1990, following a three-month trial, she was acquitted of all charges. By that time, Ferdinand had died in exile in Hawaii on 28 September 1989.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> existed <b>in</b> New South Wales for a {{short period}} in the 1820s. [...] The New South Wales Act 1823 (UK) enabled the {{establishment}} of Quarter Sessions, as a subsidiary court structure below that of the Supreme Court. Francis Forbes, Chief Justice, reasoned that this entailed the creation of Quarter Sessions as they existed in England. Thus, inadvertently, trial by jury and indictment by <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> were introduced, but only for these subsidiary courts. <b>Grand</b> <b>Juries</b> met <b>in</b> Sydney, Parramatta, Windsor and other places. This democratic method of trial proved very popular, but was resented by conservatives. Eventually, conservative elements in the colony were successful in having these innovations suppressed by the Australian Courts Act 1828 (UK). George Forbes, a member of the Legislative Council, unsuccessfully moved for the reintroduction of <b>Grand</b> <b>Juries</b> <b>in</b> 1858, but this was thwarted by the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice.|$|R
5|$|On March 11, 1994 FBI agents {{executed}} {{a search warrant}} to confiscate records from the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals {{as part of an}} ongoing investigation. Weeks later, federal agents investigating ghost payrolling subpoenaed financial records regarding several past and current employees of the Board, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The US Treasury Department investigated the IDOT contracts with Berrios and Panayotovich, and a federal grand jury subpoenaed the contracts. A federal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> Chicago subpoenaed records documenting the recipients of tuition waivers to state universities request by three current and two former state legislators, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The scholarship program, begun in 1905, allowed each state legislator to waive the tuition and fees of any of the state's 12 public universities, for any two students who live within the legislator's district, without regard to academic achievement or financial need. No charges were filed against anyone in the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals. The Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals was reconstituted and renamed the Cook County Board of Review in 1998.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 2005, {{four months}} after his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted by a federal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, obstruction of justice, racketeering, and bribery of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman. Prosecutors claimed that Scrushy had agreed to pay over $500,000 of Siegelman's debt, which he accumulated during a failed attempt to bring a state lottery to Alabama, {{in exchange for a}} seat on the Certificates of Need Review Board. The board serves the state by reviewing hospitals and approving their construction. Although the new charges were filed a month before the previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorney's accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy and Siegleman pleaded not guilty to all charges, but they were both convicted following a trial that lasted approximately six weeks. Scrushy was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, and mail fraud, while Siegelman was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice.|$|E
5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Coryat a {{traveller}} {{and writer}} of the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean age was born in Crewkerne around 1577. Mathematician John Caswell was also born here. A later traveller Colonel Joshua Fry {{was born in the}} town in 1699 before becoming a surveyor, adventurer, mapmaker, soldier, and member of the House of Burgesses, the legislature of the colony of Virginia. Another Englishman from Crewkerne who emigrated to the American Colonies was William Phelps who was born around 1599 and became {{one of the founders of}} both Dorchester, Massachusetts and Windsor, Connecticut, foreman of the first <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> New England, served most of his life in early colonial government, and played a key role in establishing the first democratic town government in the American colonies. Ralph Reader CBE an actor, theatrical producer and songwriter, best known for staging the original Gang Show, a Variety show for members of the Scouting Movement, was born in Crewkerne in 1903. The cricketer Michael Barnwell was born in the town in 1943.|$|E
5|$|William Stacy was a {{prominent}} and {{active member of the}} pioneer settlement of Marietta. He superintended the construction of a stockade known as Picketed Point to protect the settlers from Indians, he was an officer in the militia, and he was an officer on the first board of police. Additionally, he served as an officer of the township of Marietta, and he owned one of two hand mills in the settlement. William Stacy {{was a member of the}} Society of the Cincinnati and an original member of the American Union Lodge No. 1 (Freemasons) at Marietta; the name of this lodge was reportedly suggested by Benjamin Franklin, and the seal engraved by Paul Revere. Stacy was honored with the position of foreman of the first <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> <b>in</b> the Northwest Territory. This was an important event, as this court was the first establishment of civil and criminal law in the pioneer country.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of witches and demonic forces {{was taken for}} granted by the American colonists—witchcraft was considered {{the work of the}} Devil. Colonists believed that witches could be identified by their strange behavior. As early as 1626, nineteen years after the founding of the Jamestown colony, a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> Virginia sat to consider whether Goodwife Joan Wright was a witch—she had supposedly predicted the deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife. No record of the outcome is extant. Nevertheless, Virginia did not experience events of mass hysteria such as the Salem, Massachusetts witch trials in 1692–1693, in which 19people were executed on allegations of sorcery, some years before the first accusations against Sherwood. Ecclesiastical influence in the courtroom was much less a factor in Virginia, where the clergy rarely participated in witchcraft trials, than in New England, where ministers took an active part. People's fears of witchcraft in Virginia were not based on their religious beliefs as much as they were rooted in folklore, although the two often intermingled. New England's Puritans had settled in towns, and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions. There were few such towns in Virginia, where the population mostly lived on farms and plantations, connected by water transport and scattered over a large area.|$|E
