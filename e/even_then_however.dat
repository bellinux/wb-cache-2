25|$|In Morocco, where king Mohammed VI is also Amir al-Muminin (Commander of the Faithful), the {{authorities}} {{have tried to}} organize the field by creating a scholars' council (conseil des oulémas) composed of Muslim scholars (ulama), {{which is the only}} one allowed to issue fatāwā. In this case, a national theocracy could in fact compel intra-national compliance with the fatwā, since a central authority is the source. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>however,</b> the issue would not necessarily be religiously binding for the residents of that nation. For, the state may have the power to put a fatwā in effect, {{but that does not mean}} that the fatwā is to be religiously accepted by all. For instance, if a state fatwā council made abortion acceptable in the first trimester without any medical reason, that would have direct impact on official procedures in hospitals and courts in that country. Yet, this would not mean that the Muslims in that nation has to agree with that fatwā, or that the fatwā is religiously binding for them.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in almost}} all cases we are {{involved}} in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. <b>Even</b> <b>then</b> <b>however,</b> it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).|$|E
500|$|<b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>however,</b> some partisans {{remained}} in the countryside, {{unwilling or unable to}} rejoin the community; they became known as the cursed soldiers. Stanisław Marchewka [...] "Ryba" [...] was killed in 1957, and the last AK partisan, Józef Franczak [...] "Lalek," [...] was killed in 1963– almost 2 decades after World War II had ended. It was only four years later, in 1967, that Adam Boryczka, a soldier of AK {{and a member of the}} elite, Britain-trained Cichociemny ("Silent Unseen") intelligence and support group, was released from prison. Until the end of the People's Republic of Poland, Home Army soldiers remained under investigation by the secret police, and it was only in 1989, after the fall of communism, that the sentences of Home Army soldiers were finally declared null and void by Polish courts.|$|E

50|$|Armstrong's first {{experience}} teaching phonetics was in summer 1917, in Daniel Jones's summer course for missionaries to learn phonetics; <b>even</b> before <b>then,</b> <b>however,</b> Jones {{had planned to}} give Armstrong a full-time position at the University College Phonetics Department. Those plans were temporarily put on hold when London County Council decided against a budgetary increase for the department in October, but in November 1917, Jones nominated Armstrong to receive a temporary, part-time lectureship, which she started in February 1918. She {{was finally able to}} work full-time {{at the start of the}} 1918-1919 academic year, becoming the Phonetics Department's first full-time assistant. She became lecturer in 1920, senior lecturer in 1921, and reader in 1937. Her promotion to readership was announced in The Times and The Universities Review. Armstrong also occasionally taught at the School of Oriental Studies. When Jones had to take a leave of absence the first nine months of 1920, Armstrong became acting head of the department in his stead. During this time, she interviewed and admitted students into the department. Other positions she held at University College were Chairman of the Refectory Committee and Secretary of the Women Staff Common Room. Learned societies Armstrong belonged to included the International Phonetic Association, the Modern Language Association, and the International Congress of Phonetic Sciences.|$|R

In the latter capacity, Hazlitt notes his one {{positive}} accomplishment. While as a satirist he is [...] "violent ... abrupt [...] unmanly" [...] (he had ridiculed a woman whose writing he disliked by pointing to her as hobbling on crutches), [...] "as an editor of old authors, Mr. Gifford is entitled to considerable praise for the pains he has taken in revising the text, and for some improvements he has introduced into it." [...] <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>however,</b> [...] "he had better have spared the notes, in which, though he has detected the blunders of previous commentators, he has exposed his own narrowness of feeling more.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{research}} on credit risk modelling has mainly focused on default probabilities. Recovery rates are usually modelled independently, quite {{often they are}} <b>even</b> assumed constant. <b>Then,</b> <b>however,</b> the structural connection between recovery rates and default probabilities is lost and the tails of the loss distribution can be underestimated considerably. The problem of underestimating tail losses becomes even more severe, when calibration issues are taken into account. To demonstrate this we choose a Merton-type structural model as our reference system. Diffusion and jump-diffusion are considered as underlying processes. We run Monte Carlo simulations of this model and calibrate different recovery models to the simulation data. For simplicity, we take the default probabilities directly from the simulation data. We compare a reduced-form model for recoveries with a constant recovery approach. In addition, we consider a functional dependence between recovery rates and default probabilities. This dependence can be derived analytically for the diffusion case. We find that the constant recovery approach drastically and systematically underestimates {{the tail of the}} loss distribution. The reduced-form recovery model shows better results, when all simulation data is used for calibration. However, if we restrict the simulation data used for calibration, the results for the reduced-form model deteriorate. We find the most reliable and stable results, when we make use of the functional dependence between recovery rates and default probabilities. ...|$|R

60|$|The worst apprehensions felt by {{the doctor}} for the patient were soon realized. The fever flew to his brain. For nearly six weeks he lay prostrate, {{at the mercy of}} death; now raging with the wild {{strength}} of delirium, and now sunk in the speechless, motionless, sleepless exhaustion which was his only repose. At last; the blessed day came when he enjoyed his first sleep, and when the doctor began, for the first time, to talk of the future with hope. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>however,</b> the same terrible peculiarity marked his light dreams which had previously shown itself in his fierce delirium. From the faintly uttered, broken phrases which dropped from him when he slept, as from the wild words which burst from him when his senses were deranged, the one sad discovery inevitably resulted--that his mind was still haunted, day and night, hour after hour, by the figure in the yellow mask.|$|E
60|$|Restored to vigour in a moment, I {{ran over}} the few {{remaining}} mounds of decreasing size, and found myself on the level land beyond. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>however,</b> the prospect was not inviting.

Places of waste and desolation, where the space is required for the ultimate agglomeration of all that is noxious, and the ground is so poor as to create no desire of occupancy even in the lowest squatter. With eyes accustomed to the gloom of the evening, and away now from the shadows of those dreadful dustheaps, I could see much more easily than I could a little while ago. It might have been, of course, that the glare in the sky of the lights of Paris, though the city was some miles away, was reflected here. Howsoever it was, I saw well enough to take bearings for certainly some little distance around me.|$|E
6000|$|One of my war time reminiscences {{comprises}} the quiet side {{scene of a}} visit I made to the First Regiment U. S. Color'd Troops, at their encampment, and {{on the occasion of}} their first paying off, July 11, 1863. Though there is now no difference of opinion worth mentioning, there was a powerful opposition to enlisting blacks during the earlier years of the secession war. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>however,</b> they had their champions. [...] "That the color'd race," [...] said a good authority, [...] "is capable of military training and efficiency, is demonstrated by the testimony of numberless witnesses, and by the eagerness display'd in the raising, organizing, and drilling of African troops. Few white regiments make a better appearance on parade than the First and Second Louisiana Native Guards. The same remark is true of other color'd regiments. At Milliken's Bend, at Vicksburg, at Port Hudson, on Morris Island, and wherever tested, they have exhibited determin'd bravery, and compell'd the plaudits alike of the thoughtful and thoughtless soldiery. During the siege of Port Hudson the question was often ask'd those who beheld their resolute charges, how the 'niggers' behav'd under fire; and without exception the answer was complimentary to them. 'O, tip-top!' 'first-rate!' 'bully!' were the usual replies. But I did not start out to argue the case--only to give my reminiscence literally, as jotted on the spot at the time." ...|$|E

Of course, while they were very little, they played with girls; and after they began to be big boys, eleven or twelve years old, they began to pay girls some attention; but for the rest they simply left them out of the question, except at parties, when the games obliged them to take some notice of the girls. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>however,</b> it was not good form for a boy to be greatly {{interested}} in them; and he had to conceal any little fancy he had about this girl or that unless he wanted to be considered soft by the other fellows.

On the other hand, a boy was bound to defend them against anything that he thought slighting or insulting; and you did not have to verify the fact that anything had been said or done; you merely had to hear that it had.|$|E

Almost in the mouth of the estuary, we passed the cruiser, and a little after the poor SARAH with her prize crew; and these were both sights to make us tremble. The Bermudan seemed a very safe place to be in, and our bold stroke to have been fortunately played, when we were thus reminded of the case of our companions.

But she no sooner became conscious of these things than her imagination was hushed with horror at the idea of taking advantage of the little girl--it was of this she would have accused herself--and of exhaling into that air where he might still have a subtle sense for it any breath of her charmed state.

But she said no other word; she only kissed Pansy once again.
