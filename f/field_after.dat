5|$|Because Tech {{committed}} a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the touchdown, NC State {{was able to}} acquire good field position during the kickoff return, starting their drive at their 44-yard line. On the second play of the drive, Erik Kramer completed an 18-yard pass to Nasrallah Worthen, driving State into the Tech side of the <b>field.</b> <b>After</b> a short play, Kramer again completed a long pass, this time to Bobby Crumpler for 24yards. Now inside the Tech red zone, Kramer was tackled for a big loss, losing some of the yardage that he had gained with the previous play. NC State was unable to pick up another first down and sent in Mike Cofer to attempt a 33-yard kick, which was successfully completed. The field goal regained NC State a 2422 lead.|$|E

In 1935, Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly explored the idea of a permanent fair in the park. The state passed a bill creating the Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority and allowed construction of Meigs <b>Field,</b> <b>after</b> Northerly Island lost out as the site for the United Nations. In 1948, Burnham Park hosted the Chicago Railroad Fair, proving the location's viability for conventions, which eventually led to the construction of the first McCormick Place in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Louisville's {{second drive}} {{of the game}} was much quicker than the Cardinals' first.

Louisville was helped throughout the drive by repeated Virginia Tech personal foul penalties. Tech players committed three separate 15-yard personal fouls during the drive, one of which came after Louisville's successful extra point kick when cornerback Jimmy Williams bumped a game official. Williams was ejected from the game for the contact and {{was removed from the}} <b>field</b> <b>after</b> watching the next series from the sidelines. The touchdown and extra point extended Louisville's first-quarter lead to 14–3.|$|E
5|$|On offense, the Hokies largely kept up {{with the}} Jayhawks, despite a losing effort. The two-quarterback system that had been heavily {{promoted}} heading into the game was largely abandoned {{in the first quarter}} after freshman Tyrod Taylor was sacked on his first twoplays and threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown during his second time on the <b>field.</b> <b>After</b> those two abortive first-quarter appearances, and a single play {{at the beginning of the}} second quarter, Taylor did not re-enter the game until a single play halfway through the fourth quarter. With Taylor largely removed from the game, junior Sean Glennon was left to fill the gaps. Glennon had a solid, if unspectacular, game, completing 13of his 28passes for 160yards and a touchdown. Glennon did struggle at times against the Jayhawks' defense, however, throwing two interceptions that resulted in 10Kansas points.|$|E
