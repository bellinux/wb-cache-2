6000|$|I {{left him}} to his lunch, and strolled westward, musing on the time when I should have {{answered}} that question of his about Christmas, or any other question, off-hand.

500|$|In 1880 Shaw began {{attending}} {{meetings of}} the Zetetical Society, whose objective was to [...] "search for truth in all matters affecting {{the interests of the}} human race". Here he met Sidney Webb, a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament, the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship.

6000|$|... "I thought," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> {{about my}} father's money affairs, for he always spoke most openly about them to me, {{and he never}} let drop a word as to the {{mortgage}} or as to any difficulty {{in which he had}} involved himself, or any investment he had thought of making; and I am, therefore, entirely at a loss to understand how he could have required such a sum of money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{where did}} you learn that?" [...] said Jasper, [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> a-most <b>everything</b> about the Company; but I must confess <b>I</b> never <b>knew</b> that about Prince Rupert before." ...|$|R

5000|$|That movie {{touched the}} core of my being. Never have I felt so close to a {{character}} as I felt to Bonnie. She was a yearning, edgy, ambitious southern girl who {{wanted to get out}} of wherever she was. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> about wanting to get out, and the getting out doesn't come easy. But with Bonnie there was a real tragic irony. She got out only to see that she was heading nowhere and that the end was death. Faye Dunaway ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I {{heard them}} {{coming through the}} mangroves, and an oar strike on a gunwale, and Miss Lackland laugh, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> was all right. We pulled on board without a shot being fired. And, by God! she had made the books come true, for there was old Kina-Kina himself being hoisted over the rail, {{shivering}} and chattering like an ape. The rest was easy. Kina-Kina's word was law, and he was scared to death. And we kept him on board issuing proclamations {{all the time we}} were in Poonga-Poonga.|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't understand----" [...] he began, {{and broke}} off. She was facing him demurely but exultantly, {{challenging}} him, he could see, {{to read her}} now.

6000|$|... "I don't think I shall send Mrs. Vavasour any more, Miss Clara. There is no use {{running up}} a long bill when I do no good; and, what is more, suspect that I can do none, poor lady."

Had hoped!--why should I not still hope? For aught <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> might yet be well. Marie might have escaped the slaughter as I had done, and if so, after all our troubles perchance many years of life and happiness awaited us. Only it seemed too good to be true.|$|R
