A statistical model was developed to provide a representation of the number as well as types of failures occur during software testing and verification.

The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) Office of Research sponsored research to develop systematic, risk-based methods to improve various aspects of TS requirements. A handbook of methods summarizing such risk-based approaches has been completed in 1994. It is expected that this handbook will provide valuable input to NRC`s present work in developing guidance for using PRA in risk-informed regulation.

Plastic design method is implemented to exactly evaluate the details of connections and members to reach the intended yield mechanism and behavior.

It is noteworthy that in PBPD method, the drift control and the selection of yield mechanism are initially assumed in the design process.

For the borehole records, the detailed multi-geotechnical profiles with a depth of 1  m are classified according to the widely used Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) to correlate nonlinear geotechnical dynamic characteristics, such as the standard penetration test (SPT) N-value with each geo-layer.
