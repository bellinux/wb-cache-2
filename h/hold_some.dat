5|$|In March 1862, a {{contract}} was placed with Laird & Son Co. by Captain James D. Bulloch, a naval {{agent for the}} Confederate States of America, for two double-turreted warships designed for ramming attacks {{at a cost of}} £93,750 each, exclusive of armament and ammunition. They were intended, together with other warships, to break the Federal blockade of Confederate coastal cities and to <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> Northern cities for ransom.|$|E
5|$|The lagoons {{behind the}} shingle beach at Salthouse and Cley are salty {{due to the}} {{percolation}} of seawater through the bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> rare and threatened invertebrates including the starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, and lagoon cockle. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the water beetle yellow pogonus, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
5|$|Union troops {{continued}} {{to organize and}} train at military camps in the city, as battles in Kentucky and Tennessee caused major changes to Indianapolis. After the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the Union began to collect {{a large number of}} Confederate prisoners of war for transport to the North. Governor Morton volunteered to <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> of the prisoners at Indianapolis. Designated as one of four northern prisoner-of-war camps, Camp Morton was converted into one of the Union's largest prisons for captured Confederate soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the {{percolation}} of seawater through the shingle bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, the mysid shrimps Paramysis nouveli and Neomysis integer, lagoon cockle, the bug Orthotylus rubidus and spire snail. Little whirlpool ramshorn snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion ephippium and Tachys scutellaris. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the Pogonus species, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
5|$|The first Trades Union Congress {{was held}} in Manchester in 1868, and as of 2015 trade union {{membership}} in Northern England remained higher than in Southern England, although it is lower than in the other Home Nations. Since the Thatcher era, the Conservative Party have since struggled to gain support in the area. Today, Northern England is generally described as a stronghold of the Labour Party – although the Conservatives <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> rural seats, they have almost no urban seats and as of the 2016 local elections there are no Conservative councillors on Liverpool City Council, Manchester City Council, Newcastle City Council or Sheffield City Council. Historically the region was also a heartland for the Liberals, and between the 1980s and the 2010s their successors in the Liberal Democrats benefitted from Conservative unpopularity by positioning themselves as the centrist alternative to Labour in the North.|$|E

25|$|Synthetic zeolites <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> key {{advantages}} over their natural analogues. The synthetic materials are manufactured in a uniform, phase-pure state. It {{is also possible}} to produce zeolite structures that do not appear in nature. Zeolite A is a well-known example.

25|$|In the United States, for example, {{most major}} {{holidays}} now {{are represented by}} rationalized, secularized figures which serve as a corporate totem. In more traditional environments, gifts are more often hand-crafted works which <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> symbolic meaning. This qualitative value of gifts diminishes in rationalized societies, where individuals often offer hints or speak directly about what present {{they are interested in}} receiving. In these societies, the value of a gift {{is more likely to be}} weighed by objective measures (i.e. monetary value) than subjective (i.e. symbolism).|$|E

25|$|Norwich University Corps of Cadets rank {{insignia}} follows West Point {{with the}} use of chevrons to show all cadet ranks in lieu of chevrons, disks & lozenges. As of the 2010 academic year, the rank structure has changed. Juniors and seniors are no longer permitted the rank of sergeant, but rather default to the rank of private if they hold no responsibilities in the Corps of Cadets. Likewise, sophomores no longer default to the rank of corporal unless they <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> sort of responsibility.|$|E
25|$|A small Jewish {{community}} {{existed on}} the island of Penang. Jews first came into contact with the Malay peninsula during the 11th century when Jewish traders traded with the Kedah Sultanate and Langkasuka. Many Jews in Malaysia came from Persia. After the communist revolution in China, more Jews fled to Southeast Asia. However, the Jewish community declined, with many emigrating to countries such as Australia. Due to not having enough members to <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> Jewish rituals, the only synagogue in Penang, established in 1932, was shut down in 1976. The last burial in Penang's Jewish cemetery took pace in 1978. By the 1990s the community had disappeared, and it is now thought that there are only two Jews who hold Malaysian passports.|$|E
25|$|Undeterred by {{the fact}} that Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington refused to {{contribute}} any British soldiers, the Junta planned to launch a two-pronged offensive aimed at recapturing Madrid. They replaced Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana with Diego de Cañas y Portocarrero, Duke del Parque as commander of the troops in Galicia and Asturias. Del Parque soon massed 30,000 troops at Ciudad Rodrigo with more on the way. South of Madrid, Juan Carlos de Aréizaga assembled over 50,000 well-equipped men in the Army of La Mancha. The main efforts of Del Parque and Aréizaga would be aided by a third force that operated near Talavera de la Reina under José Miguel de la Cueva y de la Cerda, Duke of Albuquerque. The 10,000-man Talavera force was designed to <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> French units in place while the main armies thrust at Madrid.|$|E

25|$|As the {{consensus}} of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many right wing elements in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of victor's justice. They see those convicted of war crimes as , Shōwa being the name given {{to the rule of}} Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically valid, they were still just, somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.|$|E
25|$|The {{train of}} events {{set in motion}} by the {{elections}} would eventually bring about the creation of the Irish Free State as a British dominion in 1922. That state became the first internationally recognised independent Irish state in 1931, when the Statute of Westminster removed virtually all of the UK Parliament's remaining authority over the Free State and the other dominions. The Free State eventually evolved into the modern Republic of Ireland. The leaders of the Sinn Féin candidates elected in 1918, such as de Valera, Michael Collins and W. T. Cosgrave, came to dominate Irish politics. De Valera, for example, would <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> form of elected office from his first election as an MP in a by-election in 1917 until 1973. The two major parties in the Republic of Ireland today, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, are both descendants of Sinn Féin, which first enjoyed substantial electoral success in 1918.|$|E
25|$|The National Railway Museum holds a large open {{library and}} archive of railway related material. This {{includes}} an internationally significant collection of locomotive and rolling stock engineering drawings from railway works and independent manufacturing companies.

They are also sold to modellers who can use the drawing to produce accurate scale models. The library holds more than 20,000 books and 800 journals of which around 300 are active. The archive also holds a large collection of technical and test records, as well as timetables including a large number of Bradshaw timetables. The archives also <b>hold</b> <b>some</b> 1.75 million photographs covering the earliest era of photography to the modern day.
