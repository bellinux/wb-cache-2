5|$|Afforestation {{projects}} have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, sequester CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris has {{declined}} in numbers {{as a result}} of extensive habitat degradation throughout its range, including north-eastern Cambodia, the Yunnan Province of China, and Vietnam. In Yunnan province, nearly all primary evergreen forests have vanished and secondary forests have been heavily degraded; as of 2005, <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> has been reduced by 42% since the mid-1990s. The use of defoliants, such as Agent Orange, during the Vietnam War and the ongoing clearing of forests in Vietnam have resulted in a considerable loss of habitat. As of 2003, the <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> had been reduced to 30% of its original area, with only 10% of the remaining forest consisting of the closed-canopy forests preferred by the pygmy slow loris.|$|E

In 2005 12.2%, the equivalent of 11,089,000 hectares had been forested in Nigeria. Between 1990 and 2000, Nigeria lost an average of 409,700 hectares of forest every year equal to an average annual deforestation rate of 2.38%.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about sivaladapid ecology.

Flynn and Morgan interpreted I.kamlialensis as a mixed feeder. The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids may be related to a decline in <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> in Asia and to competition by immigrating colobine monkeys.|$|E

5|$|The area {{through which}} the Wheeldale {{structure}} runs is predominantly uncultivated heather moorland. Hayes believes its appearance has remained fundamentally unchanged since the Bronze Age when its <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> was removed to permit cultivation and grazing. Wheeldale Moor is poorly drained in places making it susceptible to flooding in both the ancient and modern eras. The underlying geology consists of patches of sand and gravel on top of mixed sandstone and oolitic limestone, known as Ravenscar Group strata.|$|E
5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of <b>forest</b> <b>cover.</b> For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are found}} in the west, north, and east of Madagascar, but their {{distribution}} is discontinuous. Their habitat ranges from dry deciduous forests on the western coast of the island to rainforest in the east. They are also commonly found in secondary forest, but not in areas lacking continuous <b>forest</b> <b>cover.</b> They are most common in the west of the island. Fork-marked lemurs are not found in the southern spiny forests in the dry southern part of the island, and only recently have been reported from the southeastern rainforest at Andohahela National Park, though this has not been confirmed. A team led by E.E.Louis Jr. has suggested that undescribed varieties may also exist elsewhere on the island.|$|E
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's <b>forest</b> <b>cover.</b> The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are {{endangered}} by human activity. Since {{the arrival of}} humans around 2,350years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90percent of its original forest. This forest loss is largely fueled by tavy ("fat"), a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers. Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice {{not only for its}} practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (fomba malagasy). As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 years ago. By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests. More recent contributors to the loss of <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century. According to a conservative estimate, about 40percent of the island's original <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80percent. In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.|$|E

5|$|Tripura is an agrarian {{state with}} {{more than half of the}} {{population}} dependent on agriculture and allied activities. However, due to hilly terrain and <b>forest</b> <b>cover,</b> only 27 per cent of the land is available for cultivation. Rice, the major crop of the state, is cultivated in 91 per cent of the cropped area. According to the Directorate of Economics & Statistics, Government of Tripura, in 2009–10, potato, sugarcane, mesta, pulses and jute were the other major crops cultivated in the state. Jackfruit and pineapple top the list of horticultural products. Traditionally, most of the indigenous population practised jhum method (a type of slash-and-burn) of cultivation. The number of people dependent on jhum has declined over the years.|$|E
5|$|Most of Sikkim, {{including}} Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks {{which contains}} foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides. Surface runoff of water by natural streams (jhora) and man-made drains {{has contributed to}} the risk of landslides. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga (8,598m or 28,208ft)—the world's third-highest peak—is visible {{to the west of the}} city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.|$|E
5|$|Most {{states had}} placed {{restrictions}} on fisher trapping by the 1930s, coincidental {{with the end}} of the logging boom. A combination of forest regrowth in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became reestablished, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels. In Washington State, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.|$|E

5|$|When {{the last}} glacial period ended, the hunter gatherers of the Palaeolithic period {{followed}} the animal herds {{across the land}} between continental Europe and Britain. Then, as conditions continued to improve and vegetation became more able to support a greater diversity of animals, the annual range of seasonal movement by Mesolithic communities decreased, and people became more fixed to particular localities. Until about 6,000BC, Mesolithic people appear to have exploited their environment as they found it. As communities came {{to rely on a}} smaller territorial range and as population levels increased, attempts began to be made to modify or control the natural world. In the Great Wold Valley, pollen samples of Mesolithic date indicate that the <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> in the area was being disturbed and altered by man, and that open grasslands were being created.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 mule deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Of 21 grizzlies that were radio-collared and had home ranges where the fires happened, only one was {{believed to have been}} lost. Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas the following year, feeding on the proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all the dead wood. Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s, but the decline became more obvious after the fires. Unlike elk, which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses, moose {{are more likely to be}} browsers, consuming primarily woody food sources, particularly willow and subalpine fir, which were temporarily reduced by the fires. All ungulates experienced a high initial mortality the winter after the fires, but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than the fires themselves. However, moose populations, unlike other ungulates, have not rebounded in subsequent years. Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape, but also because of the reduction in <b>forest</b> <b>cover,</b> allowing would-be predators less difficulty in spotting them.|$|E
5|$|During the Tauca phase, {{water levels}} in Laguna Miscanti {{were higher than}} today; shorelines formed from an event in Ch'iyar Quta lake; saline lakes formed in the Lipez area, and water levels rose in the Guayatayoc-Salinas Grandes basin and lakes at Uturuncu and Lazufre. Some Atacama Altiplano lake levels {{increased}} by , and evidence exists at the Quebrada Mani archeological site for a higher water supply 16,400–13,700 years ago. During the Tauca, greater flow occurred in rivers in the Atacama region; more precipitation fell in the Rio Salado valley; the excavation of the Colca Canyon may have been aided by an increased water supply, and glaciers advanced in the Cordillera de Cochabamba. A moraine formed at Hualca Hualca; the Choqueyapu II glacier in the Eastern Cordillera advanced; moraines formed from glacial advances in Argentina (including the Sierra de Santa Victoria); basal sliding glaciers formed at Sajama; landslide activity in northwestern Argentina decreased; the climate grew wetter over the southern Amazon; flooding in the Río Paraguay-Parana basin and precipitation and <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> in Pampa del Tamarugal increased; erosion occurred along the Pilcomayo, {{and an increase in}} Pacific plankton was probably linked to increased runoff (and an increased nutrient supply) from the Andes. A glacial advance in central Chile around 15,000 years ago, also associated with increased precipitation and the Lake Tauca period, was probably triggered by tropical circulation changes.|$|E
