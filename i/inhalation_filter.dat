40|$|The {{amount of}} {{budesonide}} suspension actually delivered to six subjects (aged 4 - 30 months) by a jet nebuliser and spacer system (System 22) was determined. Two nebulisations were performed in each subject using a filter at the exhalation outlet of the inhalation chamber. An <b>inhalation</b> <b>filter</b> was additionally attached between the facemask and the spacer {{in the first}} test. The drug was inhaled during the second test. The nebuliser equipment was washed with ethanol {{and the amount of}} drug deposited was determined. The amount of budesonide deposited in the exhalation filter increased when the <b>inhalation</b> <b>filter</b> was omitted. Only 14 % of the nominal dose (500 micrograms) of budesonide was found in the <b>inhalation</b> <b>filter,</b> increasing from nine to 19 % with increasing age. Approximately 75 % of the nominal dose was found in the nebuliser equipment. These findings must be considered when deciding the nominal dose of budesonide suspension to be given to infants and toddlers...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in exhaled air {{has been reported}} to be elevated in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but results are inconsistent and difficult to reproduce. As H 2 O 2 occurs in ambient air, we examined its association with exhaled H 2 O 2 in human subjects. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of 12 COPD patients and nine healthy control subjects was collected either with an <b>inhalation</b> <b>filter</b> (efficiency 81 %) or without. Ambient air condensate (AAC) was collected in parallel and samples were analysed for H 2 O 2. Additionally, ambient H 2 O 2 was recorded by an atmospheric measuring device (online fluorometric measurement). H 2 O 2 concentration in AAC was significantly higher (p< 0. 001) than in EBC. AAC variations were concordant with the data from the atmospheric measuring instrument. In both subjects' groups, the <b>inhalation</b> <b>filter</b> reduced H 2 O 2 values (p< 0. 01). Despite generally low levels in exhaled air, analysis by a mathematical model revealed a contribution from endogenous H 2 O 2 production. The low H 2 O 2 levels in exhaled air are explained by the reconditioning of H 2 O 2 -containing inhaled air in the airways. Inhaled H 2 O 2 may be one factor in the heterogeneity and limited reproducibility of study results. A valid determination of endogenous H 2 O 2 production requires inhalation filters...|$|E
40|$|Objectives  Non-invasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) with nebulised bronchodilators helps {{some patients}} to maintain effective ventilation. However, {{the position of}} the nebuliser in the ventilation circuit may affect lung delivery. Methods  We placed the nebuliser proximal (A) and distal (B) to a breathing simulator in a standard NIV circuit with inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) pressures of 20 and 5 cm H 2 O, 1 : 3 I : E ratio, 15 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 500 ml. Five milligrams of terbutaline solution was nebulised using an Aeroneb Pro (AERO) and a Sidestream (SIDE) nebuliser. The fate of the nebulised dose was determined and the aerodynamic droplet characteristics were measured using a cooled Next Generation Impactor. Key findings  More terbutaline was entrained on the <b>inhalation</b> <b>filter</b> in position A than in position B (P < 0. 001) for both nebulisers. These amounts were greater (P < 0. 001) for AERO than SIDE due to a smaller (P < 0. 001) residual volume. The mean (SD) fine particle doses for AEROA, AEROB, SIDEA and SIDEB were 1. 31 (0. 2), 1. 13 (0. 14), 0. 56 (0. 03) and 0. 39 (0. 13) mg. These amounts from AEROA were significantly greater (P < 0. 001) than those of the other three methods. Conclusions  The results highlight the differences between nebulisers and the influence on the placement of the nebuliser in the NIV circuit...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the lack}} of evidence, many reports exist which have implied that smokers inhale low-yield {{cigarette}} smoke more deeply than that of high-yield cigarettes. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of short-term switching between smoker’s own brand and test cigarettes with different smoke yields on puffing topography, respiratory parameters and biomarkers of exposure. Participants were randomly assigned to smoke either a Test Cigarette-High Tar (TCH), for two days, and then switched to a Test Cigarette-Low Tar (TCL), for two days or the reverse order (n 10 each sequence). Puffing topography (CReSS microdevice), respiratory parameters (inductive plethysmography) and biomarkers of exposure (BOE, urinary nicotine equivalents – NE and blood carboxyhemoglobin – COHb) were measured at baseline and on days 2 and 4. The average puffs per cigarette, puff volume and puff durations were statistically significantly lower, and inter-puff interval was significantly longer for the TCH compared to the TCL groups. Respiratory parameters were not statistically significantly different between the TCH and TCL groups. Post-baseline NE and COHb were statistically significantly lower in the TCL compared to the TCH groups. Under the conditions of this study, we found no indication of changes in respiratory parameters, particularly inhalation time and volume, between study participants smoking lower versus higher yield cigarettes. Likewise, the BOE provides no indication of deeper inhalation when smoking low- versus high-yield cigarettes. These findings are consistent with the published literature indicating smoking low-yield cigarettes does not increase the depth of inhalation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{literature}} lacks {{comparative data}} on nebulizer aerosol delivered via mask versus T-piece, to spontaneously breathing pediatric subjects. PURPOSE: To compare total inhaled drug mass delivered via standard pediatric aerosol mask versus via T-piece, with increasing distance. METHODS: We used {{a sample of}} 5 nebulizers, operated under manufacturers ’ conditions, with a standard pediatric aerosol mask and with a T-piece capped at one end, at 0 cm, 1 cm, and 2 cm from an <b>inhalation</b> <b>filter</b> placed at the inlet of a pediatric test lung. Inhaled drug mass was analyzed with spectrophotometry. Aerosol particle size was measured separately from the breathing simulations, using a laser particle sizer to determine fine-particle mass (particles < 4. 7 m) and fine-particle fraction as percent of total mass. The fine-particle fraction was used to estimate the fine-particle mass. RESULTS: The mean SD values for inhaled drug mass {{as a percentage of}} nominal dose, at 0 cm, 1 cm, and 2 cm, with the mask were 2. 88 0. 79 %, 1. 61 0. 65 %, and 1. 3 0. 42 %, respectively, and with the T-piece were 4. 14 1. 37 %, 3. 77 1. 04 %, and 3. 47 0. 64 %, respectively. There was a statistically greater inhaled drug mass with T-piece than with mask, overall (p< 0. 01), and a significant decrease with mask or T-piece as distance increased (p < 0. 01). The difference between mask and T-piece for inhaled drug mass at 2 cm was statistically significant (p < 0. 018). The mean SD values for fine-particle mass estimated as a per-centage of total drug mass at 0, 1, and 2 cm, with the mask were 1. 39 0. 36 %, 0. 78 0. 29 %, and 0. 64 0. 20 %, respectively, and with the T-piece were 2. 1 0. 63 %, 1. 84 0. 45 %, and 1. 71 0. 27 %, respec-tively.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{a method}} to detect divers in harbour environments usingpassive acoustic detection. The goal was to achieve as high detection as possiblewithout having too high false alarm rate. A short execution time was also desirable. By using the characteristic of an <b>inhalation</b> a band-pass <b>filter</b> {{was applied to the}} signalto improve the signal to noise ratio. After the filtering an energy estimation of thesignal was made. This energy estimation was later used in a frequency analysis, whichcould tell us if there were enough energy in the frequencies that correspond to adivers breathing frequency. If this energy exceeds a threshold the detector decidesthat there is a diver in the water. To get an acceptable amount of false alarms, thethreshold was set so that the energy of the breathing frequencies had to exceed 5 % ofthe energy in the frequencies above the breathing frequencies. Using this method onour data we found that the detector succeeded in finding the diver and didn’t give usany false alarms...|$|R
40|$|Welding generates complex metal aerosols, {{inhalation}} {{of which}} is linked to adverse health effects among welders. An important health concern of welding fume (WF) exposure is neurological dysfunction akin to Parkinson's disease (PD). Some applications in manufacturing industry employ a variant welding technology known as "weld-bonding" that utilizes resistance spot welding, in combination with adhesives, for metal-to-metal welding. The presence of adhesives raises additional concerns about worker exposure to potentially toxic components like Methyl Methacrylate, Bisphenol A and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we investigated the potential neurotoxicological effects of exposure to welding aerosols generated during weld-bonding. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed (2522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 mg/m 23 targeted concentration; 422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 h/day 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 03032 ̆ 01422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 03013 days) by whole-body <b>inhalation</b> to <b>filtered</b> air or aerosols generated by either weld-bonding with sparking (high metal, low VOCs; HM) or without sparking (low metal; high VOCs; LM). Fumes generated under these conditions exhibited complex aerosols that contained both metal oxide particulates and VOCs. LM aerosols contained a greater fraction of VOCs than HM, which comprised largely metal particulates of ultrafine morphology. Short-term exposure to LM aerosols caused distinct changes in the levels of the neurotransmitters, dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5 -HT), in various brain areas examined. LM aerosols also specifically decreased the mRNA expression of the olfactory marker protein (Omp) and tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) in the olfactory bulb. Consistent with the decrease in Th, LM also reduced the expression of dopamine transporter (Slc 6 a 3; Dat), as well as, dopamine D 2 receptor (Drd 2) in the olfactory bulb. In contrast, HM aerosols induced the expression of Th and dopamine D 5 receptor (Drd 5) mRNAs, elicited neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier-related changes in the olfactory bulb, but did not alter the expression of Omp. Our findings divulge the differential effects of LM and HM aerosols {{in the brain and}} suggest that exposure to weld-bonding aerosols can potentially elicit neurotoxicity following a short-term exposure. However, further investigations are warranted to determine if the aerosols generated by weld-bonding can contribute to persistent long-term neurological deficits and/or neurodegeneration.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the efficacy of using a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaning system, a demistifier, to reduce the potential risk of fugitive aerosol contact in health care personnel working with patients inhaling nebulized liposomal encapsulated SLIT (Sustained-release Lipid <b>Inhalation</b> Targeting) Cisplatin. <b>Filters</b> were used to sample platinum in the air outside the tent and from the tent's exhaust stream. Air collection was performed under three conditions: (1) during patient dosing (14 h of air collection); (2) immediately after the patient has left the demistifier tent (4 h of air collection); and (3) when 7 mL of drug product was nebulized to dryness in the tent without a patient being present. Filters were collected, and placed in an extraction solvent. Subsequently, the solvent was assayed for platinum content by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Platinum levels in the extraction solvent were indistinguishable from the blank controls for all conditions. Measured levels were below workplace exposure limits established for cisplatin by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (i. e., 2 ng. (L(1)). In addition, the demistifier was able to effectively capture aerosolized SLIT Cisplatin following nebulization of 7 mL of drug product to dryness in the tent. The demistifier tent is effective at containing any nebulized liposomal encapsulated cisplatin during patient treatment. Importantly, because the tent's HEPA filtration system is effective at removing any nebulized liposomal cisplatin, the exhausted air, which is free of platinum, can be returned into the room with no additional ventilation precaution...|$|R
40|$|Bac k g r o u n d: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 71 million American {{adults and}} remains {{the leading cause}} of death in the United States and Europe. Despite studies that suggest that the {{development}} of CVD may be linked to intrauterine growth or early events in childhood, little direct experimental evidence supports the notion. Objective: We investigated whether exposure to cigarette smoke in utero alters the risk of developing CVD later in life. Met h o d s: We exposed B 6 C 3 F 1 mice (via whole-body <b>inhalation)</b> to either <b>filtered</b> air or mainstream cigarette smoke (MCS, at a particle concentration of 15 mg/m 3) from gestational day 4 to parturition. Adult offspring were fed a normal chow diet or switched to a high-fat diet 2 weeks before sacrifice. We measured dam and offspring body weight, plasma lipid parameters, lipoprotein subclass particle numbers and sizes, and total antioxidant capacities. Res u l t s: Adult female mice prenatally exposed to MCS demonstrated significantly higher body weight and levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein than did their air-exposed counterparts. When fed a high-fat diet for 2 weeks, males, but not females, exposed prenatally to MCS gained substantially more weight and exhibited dramatic alterations in total cholesterol and HDL levels compared with their air-exposed counterparts. Con c l u s i o n s: These data provide, for the first time, direct experimental evidence supporting the notion that prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke affects offspring weight gain and induces a lipid profile that could alter the offspring’s risk of developing CVD later in life. Key w o r d s: cardiovascular disease, cigarette smoke, dyslipidemia, fetal basis of adult disease, fetal insult, prenatal exposure, weight gain.
