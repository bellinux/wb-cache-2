Two scheduling models, the base model and the stochastic optimization model, are developed by integrating mathematical programming and data mining. A migrated particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed for solving the two scheduling models. The solution computed by this algorithm determines the operational status and control settings of a wind turbine. The cost of operating a wind farm according to the solutions of both scheduling models closely matches the cost computed based on a schedule under a perfect information scenario. The computational results provide insights into the management and operation of wind farms.

40|$|Aim: to {{determine}} whether a program of optimization polypharmacy regimens by a multidisciplinary medical team would improve medication regimens appropriateness. Methods: Selection of 16 stamps each with a different patient with his combination of chronic diseases and his medication regimen from a database of general practice observatory. Analysis medication regimens by a pharmacologists team using an electronic thesaurus (Vidal), then optimization medication regimens by a multidisciplinaryteam with six doctors and one pharmacologist in two times : an individual assessment of appropriateness with the MAI (Medication appropriateness <b>index)</b> <b>grid,</b> then a meeting expert group for proposals of medication regimen changes. Results: Among 11 stamps considered during review meeting, number of prescribed drugs was reduced 29 %. This reduction is linked to stop prescription in 2 / 3 of cases (with a median reduction of 3 drugs per prescription). The effect of optimization is an improvement of 46 % on drug-disease interactions and an improvement of 66 % on drug-drug interactions. The 4 main causes of inappropriate prescribing (11 proposed) are : therapeutic indication, effectiveness, dosage and distribution over 24 hours. Conclusion: This is an experimental study on real prescriptions from general practice, whose objective was to show the theoretical possibility of improving polypharmacy regimens. The limitations of this work are the incompleteness of medical records suggested to experts, the absence of prescriber’s arguments and the amount of work necessary for experts to get this result.

40|$|One of {{the major}} cost {{barriers}} for the commercialization of low-temperature fuel cells is the rapid degradation of the nanocatalyst particles in the cathode. Much effort has been spent on ex-situ studies of nanocatalysts after aging in a membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA). In such experiments, the MEA needs to be sectioned for transmission electron microscopy observation. Therefore, the evolution of particle degradation cannot be obtained, and thus {{it is difficult to}} unscramble the respective coarsening contributions of coalescence and Ostwald ripening. In addition, 2 -D images are often misleading as one cannot tell how the nanocatalyst particles are distributed on 3 -D carbon supports. Here, we present a new approach in which one can identify hundreds of nanoparticles in 3 -D with one-to-one correspondence before and after electrochemical aging 1. This enables study of the coarsening evolution of particles by tracking location changes on support surfaces, observing particle volume changes, and directly visualizing coalescence events. It allows us to answer questions such as how did the particles loose surface area, how did they move, was there a particle-support interaction, etc. This novel approach in characterization is enabled by performing electrochemical experiments directly on a TEM support grid. A carbon-coated gold <b>index</b> <b>grid</b> was used as the working electrode in a three-electrode electrochemical cell (Figure 1 a-b).

40|$|A {{predictive}} Fasciola hepatica model, {{based on}} the growing degree day-water budget (GDD-WB) concept and the known biological requirements of the parasite, was developed within a geographical information system (GIS) in Colombia. Climate-based forecast index (CFI) values were calculated and represented in a national-scale, climate grid (18 x 18 km) using ArcGIS 9. 3. A mask overlay was used to exclude unsuitable areas where mean annual temperature exceeded 25 °C, the upper threshold for development and propagation of the F. hepatica life cycle. The model was then validated and further developed by studies limited to one department in northwest Colombia. F. hepatica prevalence data was obtained from a 2008 - 2010 survey in 10 municipalities of 6, 016 dairy cattle at 673 herd study sites, for which global positioning system coordinates were recorded. The CFI map results were compared to F. hepatica environmental risk models for the survey data points that had over 5 % prevalence (231 of the 673 sites) at the 1 km 2 scale using two independent approaches: (i) a GIS map query based on satellite data parameters including elevation, enhanced vegetation index and land surface temperature day-night difference; and (ii) an ecological niche model (MaxEnt), for which geographic point coordinates of F. hepatica survey farms were used with BioClim data as environmental variables to develop a probability map.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} a solution qualification procedure that allows to estimate the order of convergence of a numerical solution. While this procedure can give a correct result when it is applied to a manufactured solution, some unexpected results are observed when it {{is applied to the}} backward facing step test case. While a second order accuracy is obtained with the Cartesian grid as expected, the order of accuracy obtained with the multi-block structured grid set is about 1. 4. As this multi-block grid is nearly orthogonal, and the grid density is fine enough (up to 200 000 grid nodes), we would also expect a second order convergence. Another unexpected result is that in some region for some quantity, results obtained with these two grid sets do not overlap. We continue the investigation on this issue during the work prepared for this workshop. In order to confirm or infirm these findings, the same exercises are repeated with OpenFoam. 2 Uncertainty Estimation Procedure The solution qualification procedure was proposed by the author in the second Lisbon workshop [1] and was slightly revised later [2]. For completeness, it is repeated here. To evaluate the uncertainty for a local quantity, we first determine the L 1 norm error for this quantity using the Grid Convergence Index approach. This can be done as fol-lows. First, we choose a target region which can be a simple rectangular domain inside the computational domain. Then we build a test grid in the target region. A uniform Cartesian grid is sufficient for this purpose. Next, we interpolate the solution from all grids to the test grid. In the present study, a 4 th order accurate interpolation method using a least squares approach is employed. This interpolated solution will be noted as φk where k is the grid <b>index,</b> <b>grid</b> 1 being the finest one.

According to our hybrid caching strategy, the results of the most frequently accessed queries are maintained in a static cache of fixed size, which is completely rebuilt at fixed time intervals. Only the queries that cannot be satisfied by the static cache compete for the use of a dynamic cache. Our hybrid cache represents an effective and fast way to address both recency, and frequency of occurrences criteria. While the static cache maintains results of queries that are globally frequent, a simple and fast policy like LRU, which only takes into account query reference recency,could be adopted for the dynamic cache. This novel representation and the associated creation algorithm result in more effective EVRs of window queries.
