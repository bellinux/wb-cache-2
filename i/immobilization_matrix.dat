40|$|A novel {{bioreactor}} with immobilization matrices {{was constructed}} to study physiological differences between immobilized and free cells and {{to compare the}} fermentation behavior of the immobilized-cell system {{with that of a}} free-cell system. Although the yeast sample released from the <b>immobilization</b> <b>matrix</b> (immobilized cells) showed relatively low activity of glucose utilization according to the acidification power test, fermentation in the immobilized-cell system was completed 20 hr earlier than in the free-cell system. In addition, flavor-active compounds, such as fusel alcohols and esters, were produced at higher levels (23 % more fusel alcohols and 22 % more esters) in the immobilized-cell system compared with the free-cell system. Whole-cell immobilization induced a reduction of cellular fatty acid contents, as well as an increase of fatty acid saturation percentages. These alterations of cellular fatty acid compositions in the immobilized cells had negative effects on cellular metabolic activities and stress resistance. It is suggested that cell attachment on solid surfaces, mass transfer limitations within the <b>immobilization</b> <b>matrix,</b> or both are responsible for the modifications of cellular fatty acid contents in the immobilized yeast. status: publishe...|$|E

Following review, four glass systems were selected for preliminary investigation: borosilicate, lanthanide borosilicate, aluminosilicate and phosphate glasses. A broad survey of glass properties was completed in order to allow meaningful evaluation, e. g. glass formulation, waste loading, chemical durability, thermal properties, and viscosity. The program was divided into two parts, with silicate and phosphate glasses being investigated by Nexia Solutions and the Immobilisation Science Laboratory (ISL) at the University of Sheffield respectively. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nanoporous alumina is {{a rather}} newly {{characterized}} material that so far has found limited use {{in the construction of}} bioreactors. The material has many advantages compared to conventional <b>immobilization</b> <b>matrices.</b> I have investigated its use in flow-through bioreactors. The rigidity and porous structure of the material makes it an excellent choice for multienzyme reactor construction. The total activity in a reactor is easily controlled by the number of membranes since the porosity makes the material less prone to increase flow system pressure. This bioreactor is suitable for characterization of new enzymes since the amount of immobilized enzyme is standardized and the enzyme may be reused many times. We designed a simple stepwise technique for covalent <b>immobilization</b> on this <b>matrix</b> in a monolayer to minimize mass transfer effects in the reactor function. The kinetic parameters for ten different substrates were investigated for immobilized alcohol oxidase and, as a second step, a two-step reactor was also designed by addition of horseradish peroxidase. This bienzymatic reactor was, in turn, employed for measuring injected alcohol concentrations. The use of the matrix for substrate specificity screening was proven for two new epsilon-class glutathione transferases from Drosophila melanogaster. Immobilized trypsin showed a substantially prolonged lifetime and its potential use as an on-line digestion unit for peptide mass fingerprinting was also demonstrated. Finally, I investigated the immobilization of the model enzyme lactate dehydrogenase by adsorption mediated by metal ion chelation similar to IMAC. Regeneration was here possible multiple times without loss of capacity. In conclusion, immobilization of enzymes on nanoporous alumina is a convenient way to characterize, stabilize and reuse enzymes...|$|R
40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{raised the}} need for the {{technical}} community to be concerned with the disposition of excess nuclear weapon material. The plutonium will either be converted into mixed-oxide fuel for use in nuclear reactors or immobilized in glass or ceramic waste forms and placed in a repository. The stability and behavior of plutonium in the ceramic materials as well as the phase behavior and stability of the ceramic material in the environment is not well established. In order to provide technically sound solutions to these issues, thermodynamic data are essential in developing an understanding of the chemistry and phase equilibria of the actinide-bearing mineral waste form materials proposed as <b>immobilization</b> <b>matrices.</b> Mineral materials of interest include zircon, zirconolite, and pyrochlore. High temperature solution calorimetry {{is one of the most}} powerful techniques, sometimes the only technique, for providing the fundamental thermodynamic data needed to establish optimum material fabrication parameters, and more importantly understand and predict the behavior of the mineral materials in the environment. The purpose of this project is to experimentally determine the enthalpy of formation of actinide orthosilicates, the enthalpies of formation of actinide substituted zirconolite and pyrochlore, and develop an understanding of the bonding characteristics and stabilities of these materials...|$|R
