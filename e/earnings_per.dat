A compilation of surveys examining the stated financial goals of companies over the century found the following: companies strove to maximize {{market share in}} the late 1960s; <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> share in the mid-1970s; return on equity in the early 1980s; and cash flow and share prices in present day. Other surveys found that organizations' preferences for evaluating performance related to capital expenditures have shifted dramatically over time. For instance, in 1959, 13% of firms focused on internal rates of return while 86% of firms did so in 1988. In addition, the percentage of firms utilizing accounting measures decreased from 50% in 1959 to 12% in 1988. One potential reason that dominating performance measures change over time is that as organizations replace old measures when they discover their limitations.|$|E
