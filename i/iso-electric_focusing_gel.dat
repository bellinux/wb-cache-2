40|$|Abstract. A new apolipoprotein E (apo E) phe-notype {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in a Finnish hypertri-glyceridemic subject (R. M.). At {{the time of this}} study, R. M. 's plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels were 1, 021 and 230 mg/dl, respectively. The subject's apo E isoelectric focusing pattern was characterized by two major bands, one in the E 3 position and the other in the El position. Normally the El position is occupied by sialyl-ated derivatives of apo E 4, E 3, or E 2. The El band of subject R. M. is not a sialylated form, however, because it was not affected by neuraminidase digestion. The iden-tity ofthe El variant as a genetically determined structure was established by amino acid and partial sequence anal-yses, confirming that the variant {{is an example of a}} pre-viously uncharacterized apo E phenotype, E 3 / 1. Both cysteamine modification and amino acid analysis dem-onstrated that this variant contains two cysteine residues per mole. Sequence analysis of two cyanogen bromide fragments and one tryptic fragment of the apo E 3 / 1 showed that it differs from E 2 (Arg, 58 [...] Cys) at residue 127, where an aspartic acid residue is substituted for gly-cine.

This study {{compared}} DNA based SSR markers {{with total}} seed protein markers, {{used to evaluate}} genetic diversity of sunflower. The multiplex-ability, cost effectiveness and applicability of microsatellites as molecular markers for a genetic diversity study were investigated and evaluated based on pedigree data of the sunflower germplasm. A solution for oil and fat interference in ultrathin <b>iso-electric</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>gels</b> was investigated, {{in order to make}} imaging and interpretation easier and clearer. Total protein analysis was utilized for the determination of genetic diversity on the same inbred material used for the DNA analysis. Finally a correlation is made between the data obtained on DNA vs Protein compared with phenotype and expected pedigree data. A set of 73 SSR markers with known mapped positions were utilized to determine genetic similarity in a group of sunflower inbred lines. Cluster analysis of genetic similarity revealed an excellent correlation with the breeding background and source information obtained from breeders on all inbred lines used in this study. Cluster analysis gave a clear differentiation between B and R-lines, showing clearly defined heterotic groups of the proprietary set of inbred lines. The most outstanding single-locus SSR markers in the set used for this study were identified and used as a core set. Multiplex assays were designed and optimized for the most cost and time effective method for rapid variety identification. The selected markers produced robust PCR products, amplified a single locus each, were polymorphic among the elite inbred lines and supplied a good, genome-wide framework of completely co-dominant, single-locus DNA markers for molecular breeding. The use of a fluorescent-tailed primer technique resulted in a considerable cost saving. Furthermore, the SSR markers can be multiplexed through optimization, in order to avoid undesirable primer-primer interactions and non-specific amplification. First stage <b>iso-electric</b> <b>focusing</b> of total protein extracts were used to analyze sunflower looking at genetic purity and genetic variety verification on diverse sunflower germplasm. Severe visual interference was visible on most seed storage protein extracts of sunflower. This interference was visible as a distortion in the gel matrix on the anodal end of the gel, and caused important proteins to denature in the presence of heightened field strength and the absence of a uniform matrix. Adjustment of the extraction solutions removed this interference. Total protein profiles were generated with the use ultrathin layer <b>iso-electric</b> <b>focusing</b> (UTLIEF) to assess the level of genetic diversity on the same set of sunflower lines used for the SSR analysis. Finally, the genetic diversity of the sunflower germplasm was analysed by comparing proteomic, genomic and pedigree data from the same germplasm. A total of 295 alleles were amplified with a set of 73 SSR markers with known mapped positions. These were utilized to determine the genetic relatedness of a group of B-lines and R-lines of sunflower. In parallel, a total of 68 protein bands were visualized using protein samples of two types of seed storage proteins derived from exactly the same sunflower lines. Cluster analysis clearly differentiated between the B-lines and R-lines, identifying defined heterotic groups of this proprietary set of lines.

40|$|Summary Recent {{reports have}} {{suggested}} {{the presence of}} oestrogen receptors (ER) in pancreatic carcinoma. Therefore the tumour may be sensitive to hormone manipulation therapy. We examined 23 biopsies of human pancreatic carcinoma tissue {{for the presence of}} ER. The tissue was assayed by two methods: <b>Iso-electric</b> <b>focusing</b> (IEF) and ER-ICA an immunocytochemical assay. All biopsies were tested with ER-ICA and ten by IEF. Each biopsy was assessed histologically for tumour content and 20 contained adenocarcinoma. None of the samples of pancreatic carcinoma were positive for ER using the ER-ICA, and none demonstrated the binding peak typical of ER in the IEF assay. These results suggest that in pancreatic carcinoma oestrogen receptor is either absent (or at very low levels), or of a different type to that found in breast and uterine tissue. On theoretical grounds at least, this must raise questions as to the oestrogen sensitivity of pancreatic cancer. There is a body of evidence to suggest that oestrogens are important in the normal functioning of the pancreas (Grossman et al., 1969; Sandberg & Rosenthal, 1979), and are implicated as a factor in pancreatic disease (Davidoff et al., 1973; Glueck et al., 1972; Greenberger et al., 1966). There i...|$|R
40|$|Journal articleThe {{development}} of nerve guidance conduits is constantly evolving {{as the need}} arises for therapies for spinal cord injury. In addition to providing a path for regrowing axons to reconnect with their appropriate targets, the structural and biochemical cues provided by these conduits should be permissive for directional neurite outgrowth and be protective against inhibition {{in the vicinity of}} the injury site. Here, we adapted the use of <b>iso-electric</b> <b>focusing</b> to drive the alignment of supramolecular fibrils into self-assembled collagen hydrogels ([similar] 300 Âµm diameter), and tested those hydrogels for the ability to direct and enhance the migration of neurites. Structural characterization revealed anisotropic alignment of nanofibrillar aggregates ([similar] 20 nm diameter), arranged in micron-scale bundles ([similar] 1 to 2 Âµm diameter) similar to the hierarchical size scales observed in native tissues. Neurite outgrowth extended bidirectionally along the axes of aligned hydrogels. Furthermore, it was shown that, as opposed to poly-D-lysine, neurite outgrowth on aligned hydrogels is not inhibited in the presence of myelin-associated glycoprotein (p > 0. 05). These results highlight for the first time a structural and biochemical role for iso-electrically aligned collagen hydrogels in controlling neuronal growth, and indicate that the short-term signaling associated with these hydrogels can be used in adjunct therapy following injury to the spinal cord...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} techniques for {{assessment of the}} intrathecal humoral immune response in human African trypanosomiasis were compared, and their diagnostic potential for detection of the meningo-encephalitic stage of the disease was evaluated. Total and trypanosome specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM intrathecal synthesis were studied in paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples of 38 trypanosomiasis patients and in three controls using Reiber's formulae. The presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal IgG and of trypanosome-specific antibodies was determined using <b>iso-electric</b> <b>focusing</b> followed by immunoblotting and antigen-driven immunoblots. The intrathecal IgG fraction (16 % positive) and oligoclonal IgG detection (24 % positive) were insensitive for detection of an intrathecal humoral immune response. Trypanosome-specific IgG synthesis, reflected by the IgG antibody index (AI) (26 % positive), was confirmed {{by the presence of}} oligoclonal specific IgG (47 % positive), but the latter was more sensitive. Although the detection technique failed for oligoclonal IgM, the intrathecal IgM fraction (42 % positive) and the IgM AI (32 % positive) indicated that the meningo-encephalitic stage of the disease is characterized by a dominant intrathecal IgM response, which was higher than the IgG response. The highest combination of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the meningo-encephalitic stage of trypanosomiasis was observed for quantitative IgM determinations...|$|R
