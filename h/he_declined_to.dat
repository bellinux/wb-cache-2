5|$|According to James, Anne {{wrote to}} him in 1696 {{requesting}} his permission to succeed William, and thereafter promising to restore the Crown to James's line at a convenient opportunity; <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> give his consent. She was probably trying to ensure her own succession by attempting to prevent a direct claim by James.|$|E
5|$|Although the Texas Legislature {{typically}} meets {{once every}} two years, a fire destroyed the state capitol building in November 1881, and Ross was called to serve in a special session in April 1882. The session agreed {{to build a new}} capitol building. Near the end of the special session, the Senate passed a reapportionment bill, which reduced Ross's four-year term to only two years. <b>He</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> run again.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, Wałęsa {{was awarded}} the Nobel Peace Prize. Since then he has {{received}} more than 30 state decorations and more than 50 awards from 30 countries, including Order of the Bath (UK), Order of Merit (Germany), Legion of Honour (France) and European Human Rights Prize (EU 1989). In 2011, <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> accept the Lithuanian highest order, citing his displeasure at Lithuania's policy towards the Polish diaspora. In 2008, he established the Lech Wałęsa Award.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) {{announced}} it would reduce the wages of all workers by ten percent. One hundred miles would constitute a day's work, and crews would not receive allowances for time spent on delays at stations. Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> meet.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} as governor, Brown again {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican Walter Evans. He would later claim that he had only run {{in order to improve}} Democratic voter turnout for William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential bid. Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating convention, Brown was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial nominee, but <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> become a candidate. When the convention began, he was mentioned as a candidate for convention chairman, but he also refused to serve in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Feynman sought medical {{treatment}} for abdominal pains and {{was diagnosed with}} liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer. Surgeons removed a tumor {{the size of a}} football that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February3, 1988. A ruptured duodenal ulcer caused kidney failure, and <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> undergo the dialysis that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Watched over by his wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine, he died on February15, 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore {{campaigned for}} Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he {{supported}} President George H. W. Bush for reelection {{and was an}} outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that he maintains some Republican ideologies.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan won the pro–am Pink Ribbon {{tournament in}} July 2015, {{defeating}} Darryn Walker 4–2 in the final, but took a hiatus from the professional tour for almost eight months. <b>He</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> defend his Champion of Champions and UK Championship titles, stating {{that he was}} suffering from debilitating insomnia, but he made his debut providing in-studio expert analysis during the UK Championship, alongside Jimmy White. He returned to professional competition in the qualifying rounds for the German Masters in December 2015, defeating Hamza Akbar 5–1 in the first round, but losing 3–5 to Stuart Carrington in the second round.|$|E

5|$|On November 1, 1946, Vermont Governor Mortimer R. Proctor {{appointed}} Flanders to the U.S. Senate as a Republican {{to complete}} the term of Republican Senator Warren Austin. Austin had just been appointed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman as Ambassador to the United Nations. Flanders's appointment gave him seniority over the freshman Senators who would be elected four days later on November 5. Flanders ran for the office then, as well, and was elected to a full term. He was overwhelmingly reelected in 1952. <b>He</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> seek a third term in 1958.|$|E
5|$|One proof Bicentennial coin {{in silver}} clad and lacking a mint mark, {{similar to the}} dollar in the {{prototype}} set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the Woodward & Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for Coin World, spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. <b>He</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and lost to the numismatic community. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to run for President in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily favored {{to run in the}} Senate special election the following year or for Governor in 2014, though <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> do either. He instead moved to New Hampshire and ran for the Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate races to women.|$|E

5|$|The {{violence}} turned {{public opinion}} against Dow, {{and he was}} denounced in newspapers across the nation. He was tried for violation of the prohibition law; the prosecutor was former U.S. Attorney General Nathan Clifford, a longtime Dow opponent, and the defense attorney was a fellow founder of the Maine Temperance Society, future senator William P. Fessenden. Dow was acquitted, but his opponents convinced the coroner to impanel a jury that pronounced the protester's death a homicide. He was ultimately acquitted of that charge, but his popularity had suffered and <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> run for re-election as mayor.|$|E
5|$|To {{instruct}} new Pakistani {{students in}} the methods of archaeology, in early 1950 Wheeler ran a training excavation at Mohenjo-daro; there, he was joined by the British student Leslie Alcock, who spoke both Punjabi and Urdu and who was appointed a site supervisor by Wheeler. This excavation {{proved to be the}} only one for which Wheeler would not write and publish a full excavation report. Instead, he made reference to its findings in his book The Indus Civilization, published as part of the series The Cambridge History of India. His relationship with the Pakistani government had become strained, and so <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> return to work for them for a third year.|$|E
5|$|While the {{previous}} two films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe, Goldfinger was chosen by Eon for the third film, with the American cinema market in mind. Because Terence Young was refused {{a share of the}} profits, <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> direct Goldfinger and worked on The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders instead, although he had done some pre-production work before he left. In his place, Eon turned to Guy Hamilton to direct; he was keen to inject elements of humour into the series, have more gadgets and build bigger and more elegant sets.|$|E

5|$|Before casting Keira Knightley as Gretta, Carney {{considered}} {{casting a}} pop singer such as Adele {{in the main}} role, {{as well as a}} number of other actresses including Scarlett Johansson, who was at one point attached to the project. Knightley, who had never sung professionally before, prepared for the role by training with a vocal coach and learning how to play a guitar. Mark Ruffalo was Carney's first choice for the role of Dan, and agreed to star in the film after Carney sent him the first draft of the screenplay. Singer Adam Levine was also the only person Carney considered casting as Dave, and won the role after talking with Carney over Skype and recording some dialogue as an audition; <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> be paid for appearing in the film. Although he had had minor acting parts on television before, Begin Again marked his first role in a film. Carney approached James Corden to appear in the film after admiring Corden's performance in the lead role in a Broadway production of One Man, Two Guvnors.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was born}} near Lexington, Kentucky to a {{prominent}} local family. After non-combat service during the Mexican–American War, {{he was elected}} as a Democrat to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1849, where he took a states' rights position against interference with slavery. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1850, he allied with Stephen A. Douglas {{in support of the}} Kansas–Nebraska Act. After reapportionment in 1854 made his re-election unlikely, <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> run for another term. He was nominated for vice-president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention to balance a ticket headed by James Buchanan. The Democrats won the election, but Breckinridge had little influence with Buchanan and, as presiding officer of the Senate, could not express his opinions in debates. In 1859, he was elected to succeed Senator John J. Crittenden at the end of Crittenden's term in 1861. As vice president, Breckinridge joined Buchanan in supporting the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas, which led to a split in the Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{continued}} {{to defy the}} Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine in that state. Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination {{by a vote of}} 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but <b>he</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E
