50|$|The theorized {{causes of}} angel wing are genetics, the {{excessive}} intake of carbohydrates and proteins, together with insufficient intake of vitamin E, low dietary calcium and manganese deficiency. Angel wing is occasionally observed in waterfowl residing near humans, (including domestic fowl), and the disease {{can sometimes be}} observed in areas where geese or ducks are excessively fed bread. Other examples are not fed bread at all. Duck seed is an alternative for <b>duck</b> <b>feeders.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst {{others have}} {{specially}} adapted brushy tongues {{and in many}} cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some <b>ducks</b> are filter <b>feeders.</b> Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.|$|R
