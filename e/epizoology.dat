[...] Considerable effort has been expended to understand the transmission and <b>epizoology</b> of megalocytiviruses {{because of the economic}} importance of commercial fisheries and aquaculture operations. Interestingly, iridoviral epizootics do not correlate well with commercial food fish trade routes, with the notable exception of larval fish trade in Korea and Japan.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>epizoology,</b> an {{epizootic}} (from Greek: epi- upon + zoon animal) is {{a disease}} event in a nonhuman animal population, analogous to an epidemic in humans. An epizootic may be: restricted to a specific locale (an [...] "outbreak"), general (an [...] "epizootic") or widespread ("panzootic"). High population density is a major contributing factor to epizootics. Aquaculture is an industry sometimes plagued by disease {{because of the large}} number of fish confined to a small area.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between animal rabies and postexposure treatment (PET) in Ontario by examining the introduction of human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) in 1980 and the initiation of an oral rabies vaccination program for wildlife in 1989. Introducing HDCV led to an immediate doubling of treatments. Both animal rabies and human treatments declined rapidly after the vaccination program was introduced, but human treatments have leveled off at approximately 1, 000 per year. J urisdictions across North America have identified animal rabies as a serious public health concern (1, 2) because the epidemiology of human rabies closely follows the <b>epizoology</b> of animal rabies (3). Recent studies have examined {{the relationship between}} animal rabies and postexposure treatment (PET) for reasons of surveillance, economic impact, epidemiology...|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} in the number of human isolates of Salmonella virchow phage type (PT) 26 in England and Wales during 1994 was investigated. A national case control study was conducted which included 88 cases and 182 controls. The cases were mostly young adults (median age 26) and 13 (15 %) were admitted to hospital. Acquisition of S. virchow PT 26 was associated with the consumption of any chicken (OR 2. 5, CI 1. 1 - 5. 8), of chicken curry from restaurants and take aways (OR 2. 9, CI 1. 4 - 6. 1), and of some other diverse types of pre-prepared chicken (OR 3. 8, CI 1. 9 - 7. 6). Halal chicken was associated (P = 0. 006) with illness in a subset. There were negative associations with contact with animals (OR 0. 47, CI 0. 23 - 0. 95) and with the consumption of chicken cooked whole (OR 0. 37, CI 0. 21 - 0. 66). The {{increase in}} S. virchow PT 26 may be due to changing <b>epizoology</b> and may be an indicator of what will become the dominant salmonella strain in poultry in future years. The increasing incidence of S. virchow PT 26 is of particular concern because of its association with more invasive disease in humans...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is endemic in {{the tropics}} and neotropics. It {{is often referred to}} as a group of diseases because of the varied spectrum of clinical manifestations, which range from small cutaneous nodules to gross mucosal tissue destruction. Cutaneous leishmaniasis can be caused by several Leishmania spp and is transmitted to human beings and animals by sandflies. Despite its increasing worldwide incidence, but because it is rarely fatal, cutaneous leishmaniasis has become one of the so-called neglected diseases, with little interest by financial donors, public-health authorities, and professionals to implement activities to research, prevent, or control the disease. In endemic countries, diagnosis is often made clinically and, if possible, by microscopic examination of lesion biopsy smears to visually confirm leishmania parasites as the cause. The use of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques that allow for species identification is usually restricted to research or clinical settings in non-endemic countries. The mainstays of cutaneous leishmaniasis treatment are pentavalent antimonials, with new oral and topical treatment alternatives only becoming available within the past few years; a vaccine currently does not exist. Disease prevention and control are difficult because of the complexity of cutaneous leishmaniasis <b>epizoology,</b> and the few options available for effective vector control...|$|E
40|$|We investigated	hantaviruses	in	rodents	in	the	south-ern Amazon	Basin	of	Peru	and	 identified	an	Andes	virus variant from	 Neacomys spinosus	 mice. This	 finding	 ex-tends the	known	range	of	this	virus	in	South	America	and the range	 of	 recognized	 hantaviruses	 in	 Peru. Further studies of	 the	 <b>epizoology</b>	 of	 hantaviruses	 in	 this	 {{region are}} warranted. Hantaviruses are enveloped, tripartite, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses {{belonging}} to the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. More than 15 hantavi-ruses have been recognized in the Americas, most in South America (1). Hantaviruses are maintained in rodents and shrews, usually with a tight pairing between the specific virus and host species. On the American continents, hanta-viruses can evoke a severe acute disease known as hanta-virus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), which carries typical case-fatality rates of 35 %– 40 %, depending on the particu-lar virus (1). Hantavirus host–reservoir pairs continue to be discovered, and details of hantavirus epidemiology and the risk for transmission of hantaviruses to humans con-tinue to emerge. Data on hantaviruses in Peru are sparse and confined to the Loreto Region in the northern Amazon Basin (Figure 1), where a 1996 study of rodents showed a 20 % prevalence of IgG to hantaviruses and the identification of a Rio Ma-moré–like hantavirus from Oligoryzomys microtis rodents (2). The IgG prevalence in humans in Loreto tested during 2007 – 2010 was low (1. 7 %) (3). Nevertheless, 4 cases (3 fatal) of human hantavirus infection were reported in 2011 in this region, 2 from Rio Mamoré and 2 from Seoul virus (4, 5). To expand the knowledge base on hantaviruses in Peru, we conducted an investigation of rodents in a previ-ously unexplored area of Peru’s southern Amazon Basin...|$|E
