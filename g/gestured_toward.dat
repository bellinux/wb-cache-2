40|$|This study {{examined}} the use of sensory modalities relative to a partner’s behavior in gesture sequences during captive chimpanzee play at the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute. We hypothesized that chimpanzees would use visual <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> attentive recipients and auditory/tactile <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> inattentive recipients. We also hypothesized that gesture sequences would be more prevalent toward unresponsive rather than responsive recipients. The chimpanzees used significantly more auditory/tactile rather than visual gestures first in sequences with both attentive and inattentive recipients. They rarely used visual <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> inattentive recipients. Auditory/tactile gestures were effective with and used with both attentive and inattentive recipients. Recipients responded significantly more to single gestures than to first gestures in sequences. Sequences often indicated that recipients {{did not respond to}} initial gestures, whereas effective single gestures made more gestures unnecessary. The chimpanzees thus gestured appropriately relative to a recipient’s behavior and modified their interactions according to contextual social cues...|$|R

Under Jackson's guidance, and with O'Neal and Bryant leading the way, the Lakers won three straight championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. [...] The Lakers' title in 2000 came against the Indiana Pacers who were coached by Celtic legend Larry Bird. Paul Pierce's nickname, [...] "The Truth", was accorded to him by Shaquille O'Neal after a 112-107 Lakers' victory over the Celtics on March 13, 2001 in which Pierce scored 42 points on 13 of 19 shooting. [...] O'Neal pulled a Boston reporter over and <b>gestured</b> <b>toward</b> his notepad. [...] "Take this down", said O'Neal. [...] "My name is Shaquille O'Neal and Paul Pierce is the expletive truth. Quote me on that and don't take nothing out. I knew he could play, but I didn't know he could play like this.

However, the Celtics eventually fell in six games to the New Jersey Nets in that year's Eastern Conference Finals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story is}} told in first person, by a narrator who, it soon becomes clear, is Satan.

The two people recognize Satan for who he is; Satan is troubled by their calm certitude, and asks about the elaborate machine that he sees inside their dome.

Also present {{was a friend of}} Mamet and Mosher’s named Christ Nogulich, the director of food and beverage at the hotel. After twenty minutes of disbelief-suspending manipulations, Jay spread the deck face up on the bar counter and asked Nogulich to concentrate on a specific card but not to reveal it. Jay then assembled the deck face down, shuffled, cut it into two piles, and asked Nogulich to point to one of the piles and name his card. “Three of clubs,” Nogulich said, and he was then instructed to turn over the top card. He turned over the three of clubs. Mosher, in what could be interpreted as a passive-aggressive act, quietly announced, “Ricky, you know, I also concentrated on a card.” After an interval of silence, Jay said, “That’s interesting, Gregory, but I only do this for one person at a time.” Mosher persisted: “Well, Ricky, I really was thinking of a card.” Jay paused, frowned, stared at Mosher, and said, “This is a distinct change of procedure.” A longer pause. “All right—what was the card?” “Two of spades.” Jay nodded, and <b>gestured</b> <b>toward</b> the other pile, and Mosher turned over its top card. The deuce of spades. A small riot ensued.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} poems which explore the relationship between the imagination and that mysterious thing we call reality. They engage with the Emmanuel Kant 2 ̆ 7 s notion of the dichotomy between subject and object; thus, one of the central concerns of the project is whether the object can ever be understood by a subject, whose mind imposes its categories and other forms of mediation upon whatever it perceives. The poems also engage with Wallace Stevens 2 ̆ 7 notion of a 2 ̆ 2 Supreme Fiction, 2 ̆ 2 as the only means left to us, however imperfect it may be, with which we might approach the 2 ̆ 2 original idea 2 ̆ 2 that all other perceptions of reality only approximate. In the absence of the certainty of an interrogated reality, negative space, that which cannot be perceived by the senses, is explored, proposed, <b>gestured</b> <b>toward.</b> That genius behind the infinity of the world...|$|E
