500|$|Due to {{the success}} of [...] "Give it Away", the band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would {{ultimately}} be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially [...] "mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people... <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'" [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magiks second single. By January 1992, [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|During a Hurricanes' {{residency}} at Butlins, Lennon and McCartney {{drove from}} Liverpool to Skegness, on 15 August 1962, to ask Starr {{to join the}} Beatles. Shortly before, Starr had agreed to join Kingsize Taylor in Hamburg, as Taylor was offering £20 a week (equivalent to £ in [...] ), but Lennon and McCartney offered £25 a week (equivalent to £ in [...] ), which Starr accepted. Lennon and McCartney offered Storm to swap drummers (with Best replacing Starr) but Best rejected the idea. According to Epstein in his autobiography, Storm was, [...] "One of the liveliest and most likable young men on the scene ... was very annoyed when Ringo left and he complained to me. <b>I</b> <b>apologized,</b> and Rory, with immense good humor said, 'Okay. Forget it. The {{best of luck to}} the lot of you'". The Hurricanes then became known for having a succession of drummers, including Gibson Kemp, Brian Johnson, John Morrison, Keef Hartley (August 1963), Ian Broad and Trevor Morais, who all stayed with the group for a short period before leaving.|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} off Blood Sugar Sex Magik was [...] "Give It Away", which reached {{number one on}} the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in late 1991. The band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] being as successful, but {{understood}} the potential commercial viability. Warner Bros. Records sent representatives to a Chili Peppers concert to determine which song should be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue and the entire audience began singing the song instead. Kiedis was initially [...] "mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single'." [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] became the album's second single in March 1992; upon release, journalist Jeff Apter noted that it [...] "was the bona fide, across-all-formats radio hit that the band had been working towards for seven years." [...] It spent twenty-six cumulative weeks on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number two, being one of the several songs stuck behind Kris Kross' 8-week reign of [...] "Jump". The single has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.|$|E

[...] "I take my hat off to you. <b>I</b> <b>apologize.</b> <b>I</b> admire your taste in skirts, an' {{take it from me}} that's a compliment; but I did'nt know who you was. If I'd knowed you was Bill Roberts there wouldn't been a peep from my fly-trap. D'ye get me? <b>I</b> <b>apologize.</b> Will you shake hands?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Byrd {{later called}} joining the KKK [...] "the {{greatest}} mistake I ever made." [...] In 1997, {{he told an}} interviewer he would encourage young people {{to become involved in}} politics but also warned, [...] "Be sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that albatross around your neck. Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena." [...] In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he [...] "was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision—a jejune and immature outlook—seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions." [...] Byrd also said in 2005, [...] "I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> a thousand times... and I don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ou {{know that}} Berio used The Raw and the Cooked in his Sinfonia. A {{part of the}} text is recited, {{accompanied}} by the music. I admit that I did not grasp {{the reason for this}} choice. During an interview a musicologist asked me about it, and I answered that the book had just come out and the composer had probably used it because it was at hand. Now, a few months ago Berio, whom I don't know, sent me a very disgruntled letter. He had read the interview, several years after the fact, and assured me that the movement of this symphony offered the musical counterpart of the mythical transformation I was revealing. He included a book by a musicologist [...] who had demonstrated the fact. <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> for the misunderstanding, which was, I said, the result of my lack of musical training, but I'm still baffled.|$|E
2500|$|While {{giving a}} {{teleconference}} interview with NBA.com, Nocioni {{spoke about the}} hard fouls and his suspension, [...] "First, the one with Wade was completely my fault. It was a bad reaction on my part. If I had received any penalties because of it, {{it would be a}} fair sanction, but it was not given. However, the sanction set after the game against the Pistons is totally unfair. I see it as a totally real play taken out of context in the game — absolutely nothing happened. It was an accidental blow. Without purposely trying to, I hit him. <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> on the court. I also asked Carlos Delfino to give my apologies to him, so I don't understand why there is a sanction for something totally normal in a game." [...] In Nocioni's first NBA playoff game, he scored 25 points and grabbed 18 rebounds while playing all 48minutes. Due to his outstanding play, the sold-out United Center crowd in Chicago chanted his name. This game solidified Nocioni's status as a Chicago favorite.|$|E

I smile when I'm happy, I smile when I'm faced with a very absurd situation...and if I {{offended}} certain people, <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> to them. It's more of an expression maybe of exasperation rather than anything and again, <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> if <b>I</b> offended certain people, who misunderstood (my) facial expression." ...|$|R
5000|$|Other South Carolina Republicans {{were quick}} to {{distance}} themselves from Knotts and called for an apology. Knotts later issued a statement, saying, [...] "Since my intended humorous context was lost in translation, <b>I</b> <b>apologize.</b> <b>I</b> still believe Ms Haley is pretending to be someone she is not, much as Obama did, but <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> to both for an unintended slur." [...] Haley campaign manager Tim Pearson called Knotts [...] "an embarrassment to our state and to the Republican Party." ...|$|R

60|$|I couldn't {{make it all}} out--that is, the details--but I got {{the general}} idea; and enough of it, too, to be ashamed. It was not fair to spring those nineteenth century {{technicalities}} upon the untutored infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she couldn't get their drift; {{and when she was}} making the honest best drive at it she could, too, and no fault of hers that she couldn't fetch the home plate; and so <b>I</b> <b>apologized.</b> Then we meandered pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse together, and better friends than ever.|$|E
60|$|Our portier {{here is a}} tall, slim Dutchman (most Dutchmen are {{tall and}} slim), {{and in spite of}} the waning season he treats me as if I were multitude, {{while at the same time}} he uses me with the {{distinction}} due the last of his guests. Twenty times in as many hours he wishes me good-day, putting his hand to his cap for the purpose; and to oblige me he wears silver braid instead of gilt on his cap and coat. <b>I</b> <b>apologized</b> yesterday for troubling him so often for stamps, and said that I supposed he was much more bothered in the season.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>apologized,</b> I {{am afraid}} I blushed; for I {{detected}} Anneke looking at me, as I thought, with some little concern, {{as if she}} pitied my awkward country embarrassment. As for Bulstrode, I did not understand him at that time; it exceeding my observation to be certain whether he considered me of sufficient importance or not, to feel any concern on my account, in his very obvious suit with Anneke. Nevertheless, as he treated me with cordiality and respect, while he dealt with me so frankly, there was not room to take offence. Of course, I turned and walked back with the party, after had properly saluted the ladies and Mr. Harris.|$|E
