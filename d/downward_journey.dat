Arrived at the bottom, you find yourself in a rotunda corresponding to that you entered from the street, a round room, with marble floor, fifty feet in diameter. There are alcoves near the walls in which are all sorts of contrivances to get your money, from Egyptian necromancers and fortune-tellers to dancing monkeys. The room is lighted with gas, and is brilliant.Now look into the Thames Tunnel before you. It consists of two beautiful Arches, extending to the opposite side of the river. These Arches contain each a roadsted, fourteen feet wide and twenty-two feet high, and pathways for pedestrians, three feet wide. The Tunnel appears to be well ventilated, as the air seemed neither damp nor close. The partition between these Arches, running the whole length of the Tunnel, is cut into transverse arches, leading through from one roadsted to the other. There may be fifty of them in all, and these are finished into fancy and toy shops in the richest manner - with polished marble counters, tapestry linings gilded shelves, and mirrors that make everything appear double. Ladies, in fashionable dresses and with smiling faces, wait within and allow no gentleman to pass without giving him an opportunity to purchase some pretty thing to carry home as a remembrancer of the Thames Tunnel.

40|$|Growth of the United States air {{transportation}} system is currently facing two major barriers: energy and congestion. While {{the price of}} fuel has gone up by approximately {{an order of magnitude}} in the last 10 years, there is no assurance that fuel will continue to be available at the levels desired by the airlines. At the same time, lack of capacity at the major airports is causing delays to increase, both in number and duration. Both of these factors are causing the price of {{air transportation}} to reverse a 40 -year-old trend and to increase in real terms, negating gains in aircraft productivity and engine efficiency. These considerations have led some observers of the aviation scene to conclude that the air travel mode is reaching maturity, although various regulatory, economic, and technological options have been suggested which offer incremental improvements to the existing system. For substantial growth to continue, however, major structural changes may be necessary. One imaginative and radical departure is the Aerial Relay System (Albert C. Kyser, "The Aerial Relay System: An Energy Efficient Solution to the Airport Congestion Problem," NASA Technical Memorandum 80208, January 1980). Briefly, in the Aerial Relay System a series of "liners", made up of "line modules", continuously cruise over the United States at a set altitude and on a predetermined schedule. These liners are met by a fleet of "feeders" carrying aloft passengers bound for cities along the liners' routes and accepting passengers destined for their own base. The basic elements of the system are shown in Figure I. A fully-developed Relay system could provide frequent non-stop service between practically any two cities in the United States. The advantages of the Relay system are many. The elements of the system can be tailored for their own function leading to efficiency of operation: the liners for cruise conditions, the feeders optimized for short-haul takeoff and climb. But the basic attraction lies in the Relay system's ability to unload the major hubs' airports by utilizing secondary (or satellite) airports and smaller city airports for the feeder's operations; since one of the major functions of airports, especially those at large hubs, is the interchange of connecting passengers between airplanes, this transfer is now performed onboard the liners. The feeder from a smaller city or secondary airport takes up passengers bound for many destinations downstream (and accepts diverse passengers for the <b>downward</b> <b>journey),</b> bypassing the hub and relieving the hub of these operations. The Relay system would thus supplement and not replace the existing airline networks; the hub-to-hub origin-destination traffic could continue to be served by dedicated aircraft at the major airports. Alternatively, the Relay system could serve as the major link between large hubs while utilizing satellite airports and thus relieving the major airports of this type of traffic. Thus the Aerial Relay System has intrinsic appeal, as it could both relieve congestion and decrease energy consumption of the air mode. Clearly, substantial engineering and design work is required before the system can be implemented. However, some questions regarding the fundamental mathematical network properties of the Relay system can be addressed to insure that no basic drawbacks to the general concept exist.

40|$|Introduction: The {{growth of}} air {{travel in the}} United States during the last 40 years has been caused by a fusion of {{technology}} and economics. Aircraft design improvements, resulting-in higher speed and larger size, have increased the efficiency and productivity of airplanes. Airlines have passed on these savings to the public through ever-lower ticket prices. At the same time, the U. S. economy has had substantial growth in per capita GNP (and per capita disposable income), thus compounding the consumer's ability to purchase travel. One million passengers flew in the U. S. in 1938; 240 million flew in 1978. As travel grew, the infrastructure grew with it. Old airports expanded and new airfields and terminals were built; the {{air traffic control system}} was modernized {{to keep pace with the}} jets; airlines took advantage of the computer and communications explosions and adapted them to their own needs. But eventually air travel created its own set of problems. Increased operations of jets caused the once-curious and proud residents near airports to clamor for relief from incessant noise. Improved engines and a leveling of operations due to the introduction of wide-body aircraft have abated complaints somewhat, but any plans for airport expansion are automatically resisted. Similarly, unless airports are placed far away from population areas (Kansas City, Mirabelle, Fort Worth-Dallas) and contain sufficient acreage to effectively hide the noise within the airport boundaries, they will not be built. Thus, capacity at large hubs is running out and no relief seems possible through airport expansion due to political and environmental reasons. With rapidly rising fuel costs, congestion at airports is also diminishing the productivity gains of fuel-efficient aircraft and causing the price of air travel to increase. Future technological innovations (metering and spacing of aircraft, wake vortex reduction, etc.) promise to increase airport capacity. However, the gambit of substituting ever larger aircraft for smaller ones will eventually transfer the congestion to the ground side of the airport (already Los Angeles International Airport prefers to have a wide-body operation replaced by a narrow-body - 2 - because of access problems). Thus, if the system of air transportation remains as currently constituted, further growth in air travel will be stymied by a combination of energy (costs and availability) and congestion (air and land) in the not-too-distant future. Such considerations have led some observers of the aviation scene to conclude that the air transportation mode is simply maturing, just as other transportation modes have in the past. Other analysts, more optimistically, note that some fundamental changes to the existing system of transporting people and cargo by air could allow growth to continue. One of the more imaginative and radical departures is the Aerial Relay System (Kyser, 1979). Briefly, in the Aerial Relay System a series of "liners", made up of "liner modules", continuously cruise over the United States at a set altitude and on a predetermined schedule. These liners are met by a fleet of "feeders" carrying aloft passengers bound for cities along the liners' routes and accepting passengers destined for their own base. The basic elements of the system are shown in Figure 1. A fully-developed Relay system could provide frequent non-stop service between practically any two cities in the United States. The advantages of the Relay system are many. The elements of the system can be tailored for their own function leading to efficiency of operation: the liners for cruise conditions; the feeders optimized for short haul take-off and climb. But the basic attraction lies in the Relay system's ability to unload the major hubs' airports by utilizing secondary (or satellite) airports and smaller city airports for the feeders' operations; since one of the major functions of airports, especially those at large hubs, is the interchange of connecting passengers between airplanes, this transfer is now performed onboard the liners. The feeder from a smaller city or secondary airport takes up passengers bound for many destinations downstream (and accepts diverse passengers for the <b>downward</b> <b>journey)</b> bypassing the hub and relieving the hub of these operations. The Relay system would thus supplement and not replace the existing airline networks; the hub-to-hub origin-destination (O-D) traffic could continue to be served by dedicated aircraft at the major airports. Alternatively, the Relay system could serve as the major O-D link between large hubs while utilizing satellite airports and thus relieving the major airports of this type of traffic. Thus the Aerial Relay System has intrinsic appeal, as it could both relieve congestion and decrease energy consumption while allowing continued growth by the air mode. Clearly, substantial engineering and design work is required before the system can be implemented. However, some questions regarding its operational feasibility can be addressed to insure that there are no fundamental drawbacks to the general concept. The scheduling of liners, i. e. the ability to calculate their position during the course of the day, and the estimation of the passenger flow in response to this service, is one such consideration. This report describes an interactive computer scheduling model to perform these functions for the Aerial Relay System.

40|$|Optical {{images of}} astronomical objects viewed through {{ground-based}} telescopes are blurred by the atmosphere. The atmosphere is turbulent {{and as a}} consequence the density of air is not evenly distributed. This results in random, time-varying variations in refractive index. The wave-fronts passing through the atmosphere become aberrated, degrading the quality of the images. One solution is to include an adaptive optics system in the telescope. The system estimates the aberration of the wave-fronts and compensates the wave-front in real time using a corrector element, typically a deformable mirror. An important problem is how to estimate the aberrations optimally using only a small amount of light. This procedure is called wave-front sensing and is the subject of the research of this thesis. For turbulence with Kolmogorov statistics, the wave-front slope contains 87 % of the energy of the aberrations. Hence, it is crucial to estimate the slope accurately. The displacement of an image is directly proportional to the wave-front slope and is used to estimate the slope. The conventional way of measuring the average slope of the wave-front in a Shack-Hartmann sensor is from the centroid of the image at the focal plane. It is demonstrated that using the centroid estimator produces an estimate with infinite variance. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is a theoretical lower bound for the variance of an unbiased estimator. The variance of the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate for the displacement of a diffraction-limited image approaches the CRLB using {{a relatively small number of}} photons. The ML estimator is extended to the case where the image is randomly blurred by atmospheric turbulence. It is found that the variance of the error of the slope estimator can be improved significantly at low turbulence levels by using the ML estimator instead of the centroid. Curvature sensors use two defocused images to estimate the wave-front aberrations. It is shown using the CRLB that the focal plane is the optimal plane to measure the slope and the error using defocused images is quantified. The effect of using broadband light on the accuracy of the slope estimate is also investigated. When using laser guide stars, it is not possible to estimate the slope of the wave-front directly from the image because the beam is displaced on both the upward and <b>downward</b> <b>journey.</b> However, the displacement is a weak function of wavelength due to dispersion. In theory, the difference in wave-front slope as a function of wavelength is proportional to the absolute slope. Centering algorithms were implemented on experimental data taken at the Observatoire de Lyon to confirm this relationship. There is strong evidence pointing to a linear relationship between two pairs of differential tilt measurements, but not between the differential and the absolute tilt. However, the data appears to have been affected by a systematic experimental error and a new experiment is needed. Phase retrieval is a non-linear technique used to recover the phase in the Fourier domain using intensity measurements at the image plane and additional constraints. A method is described to solve the phase retrieval problem using linear iterations near the solution, which provides both analytical insight into phase retrieval and numerical results. The algorithm finds the maximum a posteriori estimate of the phase using prior information about the statistics of the noise and the phase and converges well in practice. When phase retrieval is performed on data from subdivided apertures, there is a loss of information regarding the relative piston terms of the subapertures and this error is quantified. It is found that there is a smaller wavefront error when estimating the phase from a full aperture than from a subdivided aperture. Using a combination of intensity measurements from a full and a subdivided aperture is shown to result in a small improvement at very high photon levels only. Curvature sensors measure the wave-front aberrations via a linear relationship between the curvature of the wave-front and the intensity difference between two defocused images. In practice, their performance is limited by their non-linear behaviour, which is characterised by solving simultaneously the irradiance transport equation and the accompanying wave-front transport equation. It is shown how the presence of non-linear geometric terms limits the accuracy of the sensor and how diffraction effects limit the spatial resolution. The effect of photon noise on the sensor is also quantified. A novel technique for deriving wave-front aberrations from two defocused intensity measurements is derived. The intensity defines a probability density function and the method is based on the evolution of the cumulative density function of the intensity. In one dimension, the problem is easily solved using histogram specification with a linear relationship between the wave-front slope and the difference in the abscissas of the histograms. This method is insensitive to scintillation. In two dimensions, the procedure requires the use of the Radon transform. Simulation results demonstrate that very good reconstructions can be attained down to 100 photons in each detector...|$|E
