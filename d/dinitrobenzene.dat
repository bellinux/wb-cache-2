In 1875, he entered the University of Leiden, and in 1883, while acting as assistant to Professor Franchimont, he produced his dissertation and obtained his doctorate.

40|$|Kinetic and {{equilibrium}} {{data for}} the reactions of some aromatic nitro compounds with nucleophiles have been investigated using various spectrophotometric techniques (UV/visible, stopped-flow and temperature jump) and nmr spectroscopy. Kinetic and equilibrium data are reported {{for the formation of}} 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 adducts in aqueous solutions from 1, 3, 5 -trinitrobenzene (TNB) and 2, 4, 6 -trinitro- toluene (TNT) with thiolate ions derived from thioglycolic acid, thiomalic acid and glutathione. The results are used to determine intrinsic reactivities, kg, for the thiolate ions in adduct-forming reactions at the nitro-aromatic ring. The values for the three thiolate ions are all ca. 5 x 10 (^ 4) and are considerably higher than comparable values, calculated from literature data, for the sulphite ion (500) and the hydroxide ion (10). Kinetic and equilibrium data are reported for the reactions in water of ethane- thiolate, thioglycolate and thiomalate ions with l-X- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenes (X=H, SEt, OEt and Cl). The thiolate ions show strong kinetic preference for attack at unsubstituted ring positions. However, the isomeric 1 : 1 adducts have similar thermodynamic stabilities. This is in marked contrast with the corresponding reactions of alkoxides. 1 : 2 adducts are formed by thiolate attack at two unsubstituted ring positions. A 1 : 3 adduct has been identified by reaction of ethanethiolate ions with TNB and the kinetic data recorded. (^ 1) H nmr measurements in DMSO have been used to examine the structures of intermediates and reaction products; they show the irreversible displacement of nitro groups by thiolate ions. The initial reaction of l-X- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenes (X=H, CI, CH(_ 3)) in methanol with the anions of dimethylmalonate, ethylcyanoacetate and a selection of substituted phenylacetonitriles yield Ïƒ-adducts by carbanion attack at un substituted ring positions. With ethylcyanoacetate there was evidence for the ionisation of the remaining exocychc hydrogen and this process is increasingly favoured as the X-substituent becomes more electron-withdrawing (CI > H > CH(_ 3)). An acidity function approach is used to determine the equilibrium acidities of the substituted phenylacetonitriles in methanol. The data are well correlated with a- values (7 points) and the plot is used to estimate the acidities of three further phenylacetonitriles. However, the equilibrium acidity of 4 -nitrophenyl- acetonitrile is shown to be anomalous. For the most strongly basic anions, derived from the most weakly acidic phenylacetonitriles, reaction with TNB was found to proceed at or near the diffusion controlled limit. The kinetic and equilibrium data are used to determine values of intrinsic rate constants, ko, for reaction at an unsubstituted position of the trinitro-aromatic ring. The values are dimethyl malonate (200), ethylcvanoacetate (200), 4 -nitrophenylacetonitrile (280), 4 -cyano- phenylacetonitrile (10 (^ 3)) and 2 -cyanophenylacetonitrile (l 0 (^ 3)). Kinetic and equilibrium measurements are reported for the reactions of l-X- 2, 4 - <b>dinitrobenzenes</b> (X=F, Br) with hydroxide ions in 80 / 20 (v/v) DMSO/H(_ 2) O. The results provide evidence for two types of steric effects: (i) increasing size of the halogen results in disruption of the planarity of the nitrogroups giving a general decrease in reactivity at both unsubstituted and halogen-substituted positions and (ii) unfavourable steric and electrostatic repulsions between entering and leaving groups. Hydrogen exchange experiments were carried out with l-fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitro- benzene and OD(^-) in [(^ 2) H(_ 6) ]-DMSO/D(_ 2) O. The results show that there is slightly more hydrogen exchange at the 3 -position of the substituted product (the phenoxide) than there is at the 3 -position of the unreacted starting material. However, these observations do not necessarily require the formation of an intermediate on the pathway to Ïƒ-adduct formation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe carbon-bonded gas-phase Meisenheimer {{complex of}} 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and the nitromethyl carbanion CH 2 NO 2 âˆ’ (m/z 60) is {{generated}} {{for the first}} time by chemical ionization using nitromethane as the reagent gas. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the Meisenheimer complex furnishes deprotonated TNT, a result of the higher gas-phase acidity of TNT than nitromethane. The formation of Meisenheimer complexes with CH 2 NO 2 âˆ’ in the gas phase is selective to highly electron-deficient compounds such as <b>dinitrobenzene</b> and trinitrobenzene and does not occur with organic molecules with lower electron-affinity such as methanol, methylamine, propionaldehyde, acetone, ethyl acetate, chloroform, toluene, m-methoxytoluene, and even nitrobenzene and p-fluoronitrobenzene. As such, the reaction allows selective detection of TNT in mixtures. Meisenheimer complexes between CH 2 NO 2 âˆ’ and the three <b>dinitrobenzene</b> isomers display distinctive fragmentations. The oxygen-bonded Ïƒ-complex of TNT with the deprotonated hemiacetal anion CH 3 OCH 2 Oâˆ’ (m/z 61), represents a different type of Meisenheimer complex. It displays characteristic fragmentation involving loss of HNO 2 upon CID. The combination of a selective ion/molecule reaction (Meisenheimer complex formation) followed by a characteristic CID process provides a second novel and highly selective approach to the detection of TNT and closely related compounds in mixtures. The assay is readily implemented using neutral loss scans in a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.

Vehicle- or DNFB-sensitized mice were monitored for clinical symptoms and inflammation 72 h after <b>dinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid challenge. DNFB-sensitized mice developed diarrheic stool, increased colonic vascular permeability, hypertrophy of colonic lymphoid follicles (colonic patches), and showed cellular infiltration at the microscopic level. Increased numbers of mast cells were found in the colon of DNFB-sensitized mice located in and around colonic patches associated with elevated levels of mouse mast cell protease- 1 in plasma indicating mast cell activation. Colonic patches of DNFB mice, stimulated in vitro with stem cell factor indicated that an increase in TNF- ï¿½ levels in the colon is mainly mast cell originated.
