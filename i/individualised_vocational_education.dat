The problem {{of the study was to}} identify the role of <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> in economic development as perceived by <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> plan writers and representatives from commerce and industry. A total of 219 <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> plan writers, 200 <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> advisory committee members, and 200 chamber of commerce members in the northern 24 county area of Illinois were surveyed. The five components of the role of <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> in economic development were identified in order of importance by the three groups as follows: (1) career development, (2) basic employment skill development, (3) upgrading and retraining, (4) customized training and (5) community service. A significant number of <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> plan writers see the role of <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> in economic development as being primarily basic skill development and career development. The economic development components of upgrading and retraining, customized training and community service were not perceived as being as important by the <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> plan writers. The advisory council members also perceive the role of <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> in economic development as primarily belonging to the concepts within the two component areas of basic employment skill development and career development. However, the chamber of commerce members, while agreeing that the same two components are important, also include upgrading and retraining as being the role of <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> in economic development.
