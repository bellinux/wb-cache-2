During the action, described by the official history as a [...] "riot of destruction", King set on fire a hangar housing four or five German planes. He also, according to No.2 Squadron pilot Charles Copp, <b>flew</b> <b>down</b> Haubourdin's main street, waving as he went, his reason being that [...] "the girls in that village {{must have had a}} heck of a time with all that bombing and must have been terribly scared so I thought I'd cheer them up a bit". By this time the Lille sector was largely clear of German fighters. The official history recorded that on 25August, [...] "King went out alone as far as Don railway station, bombed it, machine-gunned a train, and returned among the low clouds—all without seeing any enemy". [...] The only contact around this time was on 30August, when King, Thomas Baker and another pilot shot down two DFWs near Laventie. [...] On 1September, King destroyed an observation balloon over Aubers Ridge. Three days later he shot down an LVG after attacking a train near Lille with Cobby. He was recommended for the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 8September. The award, promulgated in The London Gazette on 3December, cited his [...] "gallant and valuable service in bombing and attacking with machine gun fire enemy billets, trains, troops etc", during which [...] "he ensure success by descending to low altitudes, disregarding personal danger". On 16September, following a lull in aerial combat in the region, King destroyed a Fokker biplane over Lille. Around this time he was promoted to captain and flight commander. He took over [...] "A" [...] Flight from Cobby, who had been posted to England. By the end of September, King's tally was eighteen.
