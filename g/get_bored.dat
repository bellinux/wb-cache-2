5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not <b>get</b> <b>bored,</b> and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E

25|$|Home {{education}} or homeschooling, in Australia {{is much the}} same as elsewhere. Some reasons as to why people choose to homeschool is because it's a lifestyle choice, some people choose to home educate so that they can travel and spend quality time with their kids.

The option of simply not diving is not a practical solution, as the diver is then almost permanently prevented from pursuing the interest. Diving with buddies who <b>get</b> <b>bored</b> or tired quickly also {{does not lead to}} enhanced enjoyment for either party. When the underwater activity is of interest only to one person, diving solo is the only option that allows the activity to be undertaken.|$|E
25|$|According to Kilroy's father, {{the purpose}} of these summer {{activities}} is to keep the youth distracted when they are not in school so they do not <b>get</b> <b>bored</b> and think about consuming drugs. On September 1999, the foundation signed an agreement with the U.S. Federal government to receive ten yearly grants of $100,000. By the tenth year, the government intended to stop the funding and expect the foundation to be self-supporting. However, Kilroy's parents stated that the yearly expenses exceeded $160,000 and that they would need {{to find new ways to}} make up the deficit. The Mark Kilroy Foundation was one of the five non-profit organizations in the Galveston County that receives proceeds from a bingo place in La Marque, Texas. They also receive proceeds from sales of the book Sacrifice, written by Kilroy's father and Bob Stewart in 1990.|$|E

500|$|The {{season finale}} {{of the second}} season {{introduced}} the parallel universe to viewers. Fringes producers debated over {{how much of this}} universe to depict in the third season, but ultimately decided that showing the doppelgangers would [...] "fit more into our own character’s lives and show different aspects of their personalities". As a result, Fringe began its third season by alternating between episodes, with each depicting one universe. The Fox network was initially resistant to this design, as executives were [...] "really concerned that if the episodes didn't have [...] Walter or Peter in them, it wouldn’t feel like our show anymore." [...] Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman explained that the series had to constantly evolve, [...] "otherwise we’ll <b>get</b> <b>bored,</b> the cast will <b>get</b> <b>bored,</b> the audience will get bored"; after the first several episodes of the season, Fox agreed it was a positive change.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Pinkner and J. H.

Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would really appreciate a mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike a show like Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll <b>get</b> <b>bored,</b> the cast will <b>get</b> <b>bored,</b> the audience will get bored". After the first three episodes, both Fox and Warner Bros. became more favorable to the storyline.|$|E

[...] Network Ten branded Paul a high flying business man who enjoyed womanising until he met Gail Lewis (Fiona Corke).

The writer added Paul was committing dodgy deals and deceiving his neighbours in a bid for revenge. The character despises pity, has a damaged personality and can never be faithful to a romantic partner.

However, she believed that Azazel having a family was an unnecessary parallel with the Winchesters that [...] "doesn't quite make sense". After viewing the episode, Brian Tallerico of UGO gave his opinion that the series should follow Buffy the Vampire Slayer format of having a different recurring villain each season.

In 2008, due to her character's HIV scare, Metcalfe feared she was to going to be fired from the serial and had to seek reassurance from the producer that her fears were unfounded. In 2011 Metcalfe stated her plans {{to stay with the}} serial indefinitely, saying, [...] "I never <b>get</b> <b>bored</b> or lose interest" [...] with her storylines and scripts. In 2012, Kirkwood said that due to Metcalfe being the first actress he cast in Hollyoaks he was [...] "so chuffed that she's becoming a real star".

500|$|Using two {{digital video}} (DV) cameras, Bartley and ÓBriain shot over 200 hours of {{material}} on 300 DV tapes. They intended that editing take ten weeks; instead, it took six months. Rod Stoneman, BSÉ's CEO at the time, described {{the amount of}} footage compared to the film's final length as [...] "exceptional". The 200:1 ratio was far above the norm for most documentaries, which usually have a ratio of 10:1 or 15:1. When the filmmakers returned to Ireland, they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish. Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba, El juego de Cuba, so they hired its editor, Ángel Hernández Zoido. Zoido approached the film {{as if it were}} entertainment, feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not <b>get</b> <b>bored.</b> He tackled each scene the same way. After watching the rushes with Bartley and ÓBriain, Zoido asked them, [...] "What do we want to tell in this scene?" [...] He focused on two factors: how much information would be necessary to drive the plot, and provide an emotional core. Preferring to work alone, Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite. After Zoido completed the scene, the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{various aspects of}} gameplay, {{although}} the difficulty and overuse of the puzzle genre were negative factors. Andy Dyer from Mega acknowledged that the game had a simple concept and also observed {{that it did not}} provide enough of a challenge. Lucas Thomas of IGN enjoyed the game's array of puzzles and recognised that its design was intended to encourage two-player competition. Reviewing the Mega Drive version, Damien McFerran of NintendoLife similarly echoed Thomas' opinion of the game's intention to encourage two-player competition, and also noted that it provided a [...] "decent" [...] challenge despite opining that a single player could <b>get</b> <b>bored</b> easily. In contrast, Andrew Webster of Gamezebo criticised the high level of difficulty and the game's general accessibility due to its [...] "ancient" [...] password save system. Aaron Thomas of GameSpot found the game difficult to recommend due to the availability of free Puyo Puyo clones on the PC, but commended its basic mechanics, wide range of game modes, and gradually increasing difficulty. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed labelled the game as a [...] "fairly unapologetic reskin" [...] of Puyo Puyo and thought that Sega decided to [...] "shoehorn" [...] the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise in order to enhance their sales, although Reed admitted the gameplay was solid and addictive. A reviewer from Jeuxvideo.com questioned the game's originality, saying that [...] "stacking beans to make them disappear is not a new concept" [...] but would still satisfy fans of the genre. Amanda Tipping from Computer and Video Games thought that the game was as addictive and as puzzling as the Tetris series, and also preferred the game's colourful visuals as opposed to Tetris.|$|E
500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly rated [...] "Irresistible" [...] a B+, {{saying it was}} based on [...] "an unsettling concept to begin with" [...] that was reinforced by [...] "Chinlund's skin-crawling one-man show". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode A, praising the acting, particularly of Chinlund as Pfaster, and describing it as [...] "legitimately scary, a sign of a show that was pushing itself in new and interesting directions". The only criticism was for the scenes where Scully hallucinates Pfaster shapeshifting as [...] "pretty silly, almost feeling like an attempt to make sure something vaguely paranormal is in the episode so the fans don't <b>get</b> <b>bored</b> with what is ultimately a very good episode". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+ grade. Writing for Den of Geek, Nina Sordi ranked [...] "Irresistible" [...] the sixth best X-Files episode, saying that [...] "excluding CSM and his cronies, Pfaster has got to be the most disturbing villain that our favorite agents have encountered". Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named it the [...] "finest" [...] stand-alone episode of the second season, describing it as [...] "a genuinely creepy 45-minute horror movie". Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Pfaster among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, and IGN's Christine Seghers ranked Chinlund the seventh best guest star {{in the history of the}} show, considering that [...] "what makes him all the more frightening is how downright passive and polite he is up until the moment he's going to kill; the perfect camouflage for a modern-day monster."

500|$|Chris Turner's book [...] {{describes}} the Movementarians as {{a cross between}} the Church of Scientology and Raëlism, with lesser influences from Sun Myung Moon and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.

The book refers to a [...] "Cult of Pop", which it describes as [...] "a fast growing mutation ersatz religion that has filled the gaping hole in the West's social fabric where organized religion used to be". Martin Hunt of FACTnet notes several similarities between the Movementarians and the Church of Scientology. [...] "The Leader" [...] physically resembles L. Ron Hubbard; the Movementarians' [...] "trillion year labor contract" [...] alludes to the (Scientology) Sea Org's billion year contract; and both groups make extensive use of litigation. The A.V. Club analyzes the episode in a piece called [...] "Springfield joins a cult", comparing the Movementarians' plans to travel to [...] "Blisstonia" [...] to Heaven's Gate's promises of bliss after traveling to the comet Hale–Bopp. However, it also notes that [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] is a commentary on organized religion in general, quoting Bart as saying, [...] "Church, cult, cult, church. So we <b>get</b> <b>bored</b> someplace else every Sunday." [...] Planet Simpson discusses The Simpsons approach to deprogramming in the episode, noting groundskeeper Willie's conversion to the philosophy of the Movementarians after learning about it while attempting to deprogram Homer.
