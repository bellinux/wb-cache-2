When eyeblinks are detected, the eyeblink waveform is also acquired from {{a change in the}} <b>eye</b> <b>aperture</b> area of the subject by giving a sound signal. We compared voluntary and spontaneous blink parameters obtained by experiments, and we found that the trends of the subjects for important feature parameters could be sorted into three types. As a result, the realization of automatic discrimination of voluntary and spontaneous eye blinking can be expected...|$|E
40|$|Assessing an animal’s neuro-physiological and {{behavioral}} reaction to external stimuli simultaneously, continuously, and non-invasively {{is a major}} aim of applied animal welfare research to interpret a situation from the animal’s perspective. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess responses of large animals (sheep) to 3 model situations with positive, intermediate and negative emotional valence. The following reactions of up to 19 sheep were recorded: brain activity using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, facial expressions (ear postures and <b>eye</b> <b>aperture),</b> electrocardiogram, respiration rate, and electro-dermal activity. All variables were successfully recorded in the sheep and are promising to assess stress and well-being in sheep and potentially other large animals. The combination of several methods resulted in a comprehensive picture of the animals ’ reactions to environmental stimuli, initiating innovative animal research that combines neuroimaging, physiological monitoring {{and behavioral}} observations.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of continuous, natural signing is very challenging {{due to the}} multimodal nature of the visual cues (fingers, lips, facial expressions, body pose, etc.), as well as technical limitations such as spatial and temporal resolution and unreliable depth cues. On the other hand, signing gestures {{are designed to be}} robustly discernible. We therefore argue in favor of an integrative approach to sign language recognition that aims to extract sufficient aggregate information for robust sign language recognition, even if many of the individual cues are unreliable. Our strategy to implement such an integrated system currently rests on two modules, for which we will show initial results. The first module uses active appearance models for detailed face tracking, allowing the quantification of facial expressions such as mouth and <b>eye</b> <b>aperture</b> and eyebrow raise. The second module is dedicated to hand tracking using color and appearance. A third module will be concerned with tracking upper-body articulated pose, linking the face to the hands for increased overall robustness. 1...|$|E

Several conceptually {{different types of}} laughter were proposed in the historic literature, but only four types were represented in visual and verbal illustrations by four or more historic illustrators (joyful, intense, schadenfreude laughter, grinning). Study 1 examined the encoding of facial features in 18 illustrations by the Facial Action Coding System and study 2 investigated the decoding by laypeople. Illustrations of laughter involving a Duchenne Display (DD) were perceived as joyful irrespective of their initial classification. In intense laughter, {{the intensity of the}} zygomatic major muscle predicted the perception of intensity, but not the proposed changes in the upper face. In fact, "frowning" seemed to be antagonistic to the perception of joy. Schadenfreude and grinning did not have high recognition rates. Going along with the idea that schadenfreude is either a blend of a positive and negative emotion, or solely joy with attempts of masking it, it may entail additional features beyond the DD.

40|$|Positive {{emotional}} {{states have}} been recently studied in farm animals. We investigated the perception of thirty-eight Romane ewes submitted {{to the presence of}} a familiar observer (H) and brushing by a familiar observer (B). Sheep belonged to two genetic lines, more (R+) and less (R-) reactive to temporary social separation. Body postures, head orientation, ear changes and postures, <b>eye</b> <b>aperture,</b> tail moves and ingestion were assessed. Data were analyzed using generalized linear models, considering generalized estimating equations and potential intra-animal correlation. The effects of treatment, genetic line and phase (2. 5 min pre-, 3. 0 min during and 2. 5 min post-treatment) were included in the models, in addition to their interactions. Significant treatment and phase interactions were observed for most indicators (P< 0. 05). It was noted that H ewes tended to show less body posture changes in the pre-treatment phase (0. 50 ± 0. 23) than B ewes (2. 06 ± 0. 78), whereas during the treatment, the opposite was observed (P< 0. 05). During the treatment, H ewes showed higher number of head orientation changes (14. 08 ± 2. 32) than B sheep (2. 71 ± 1. 28) (P< 0. 01), suggesting that B sheep were more relaxed during brushing. In addition, for R+ ewes, H sheep showed more head orientation changes (16. 25 ± 2. 44) than B sheep (7. 07 ± 1. 31) (P< 0. 01). During the treatment, a higher number of ear changes was found for the H group (P< 0. 01), and R+ ewes showed higher number of ear changes (10. 83 ± 1. 06) than R- ewes (7. 68 ± 0. 87) (P< 0. 05). Higher proportion of raised up or asymmetrical ear posture was noted pre- (0. 73 ± 0. 05) than during the treatments (0. 53 ± 0. 06), in which the horizontal ear was performed for longer (P< 0. 05). Among R+ sheep, H sheep showed raised up or asymmetrical ear postures for longer (0. 63 ± 0. 06) than B sheep (0. 45 ± 0. 05) (P< 0. 05). It was also found that H ewes had lower proportion of closed or half-closed eyes (0. 15 ± 0. 04) than B ewes during brushing (0. 53 ± 0. 06) (P< 0. 01), supporting the fact that brushed sheep experienced a relaxing state. In addition, overall, R+ sheep showed closed or half-closed eyes for longer (0. 25 ± 0. 04) in comparison with R- sheep (0. 13 ± 0. 03) (P< 0. 01). Brushed ewes also wagged their tails for longer that non-brushed sheep mainly during (B: 0. 16 ± 0. 05; H: 0. 01 ± 0. 003) and after the treatments (0. 02 ± 0. 009; 0. 007 ± 0. 002) (P< 0. 01). Among R+ sheep, B ewes spent more time ruminating (0. 48 ± 0. 08) than H ewes (0. 12 ± 0. 06) (P< 0. 01). All the behavioral indicators strongly suggest that both treatments induced a relaxing state in sheep, especially during brushing.

Experiments were conducted on letter visual acuity (7 participants), grating resolution (8 participants), and grating contrast sensitivity (1 participant). Results: For letter acuity, mean loss in vision in water, compared to corrected vision in air, varied between 1. 1 log minutes of arc resolution (logMAR) for a 1 mm aperture to 2. 2 logMAR for a 7 mm aperture.

40|$|Natural {{compound}} eyes combine small eye volumes {{with a large}} {{field of}} view {{at the cost of}} comparatively low spatial resolution. For small invertebrates such as flies or moths, compound eyes are the perfectly adapted solution to obtaining sufficient visual information about their environment without overloading their brains with the necessary image processing. However, to date little effort has been made to adopt this principle in optics. Classical imaging always had its archetype in natural single <b>aperture</b> <b>eyes</b> which, for example, human vision is based on. But a high-resolution image is not always required. Often the focus is on very compact, robust and cheap vision systems. The main question is consequently: what is the better approach for extremely miniaturized imaging systems-just scaling of classical lens designs or being inspired by alternative imaging principles evolved by nature in the case of small insects? In this paper, it is shown that such optical systems can be achieved using state-of-the-art micro-optics technology. This enables the generation of highly precise and uniform microlens arrays and their accurate alignment to the subsequent optics-, spacing- and optoelectronics structures. The results are thin, simple and monolithic imaging devices with a high accuracy of photolithography. Two different artificial compound eye concepts for compact vision systems have been investigated in detail: the artificial apposition compound eye and the cluster eye. Novel optical design methods and characterization tools were developed to allow the layout and experimental testing of the planar micro-optical imaging systems, which were fabricated for the first time by micro-optics technology. The artificial apposition compound eye can be considered as a simple imaging optical sensor while the cluster eye is capable of becoming a valid alternative to classical bulk objectives but is much more complex than the first system...|$|R
