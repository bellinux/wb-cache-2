5|$|More than anything, {{they just}} made me laugh. I couldn't believe I'd walked into this situation. You didn't care {{if they were in}} time with the dance steps or whether one was {{overweight}} or one wasn't as good as the others. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India covered the song on her album, Dicen Que Soy which {{was produced by}} Sergio George and released as the album's first single. It was picked by George for India to cover as he felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> women could relate to. India's version was included on the soundtrack for The 24 Hour Woman.|$|E
5|$|Isabel Macedo {{had played}} several villains, {{including}} in Floricienta, {{and took the}} Patricia Longo-Jimena Benitez role because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> she had not done before. Although Patricia's past identity as Jimena {{was intended to be}} a secret for only ten episodes, Macedo insisted that the mystery should be maintained for a longer time. She read about victims of school bullying to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series, becoming emotionally attached to her character.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to have wept {{as we have}} wept, [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to {{have done}} as we have done, [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to have watched when all men slept, [...] And seen the stars which never see the sun.|$|R

6000|$|To {{have known}} the things that from the weak are furled, [...] Perilous ancient passions, strange and high; [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to <b>be</b> wiser than the world, [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to <b>be</b> older than the sky.|$|R
5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|Henrik {{is married}} to Johanna Sedin; they have two sons: Valter, {{who was born in}} 2006 in Vancouver and Harry, who was born on 12 May 2010. They live {{together}} in the city's Yaletown neighbourhood, and return to Sweden during the off-season. In March 2010, Henrik and Johanna made a joint $1.5million donation, with Daniel and his wife Marinette, to the BC Children's Hospital's $200 million project for a new building; the two families requested that it be put towards a pediatric intensive-care unit and a diagnostic imaging area. Henrik commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> {{he and his wife had}} wanted to do since Valter was born.|$|E
5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E

Who would not rather see a poor idiot happy in the sunlight, than a wise man pining in a darkened jail! ...|$|R

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> {{we wanted}} to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's {{character}} to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E

25|$|During the 1969 Formula One season, Enzo Ferrari {{set about}} wisely {{spending}} his new-found wealth to revive his struggling team; though Ferrari did compete in Formula One in 1969, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a throwaway season while {{the team was}} restructured. Amon continued to drive an older model and Pedro Rodríguez replaced Ickx; {{at the end of}} the year Amon left the team.|$|E

25|$|To {{all those}} engrossed in the close-quarter melee <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a {{surprise}} to find that when all the players climbed back to their feet Campese {{was not at the}} bottom of the pile, winded and wounded. In fact, Campese was touching down for a try. As Ryan loomed, Campese had stolen in, stolen away the ball and simply sprinted off in glorious isolation down the left hand touchline while the England B attack continued without the ball.|$|E

25|$|Pierce {{went on to}} {{help the}} team to the playoffs that season, with nearly 200 more fans in the seats per game on average in {{comparison}} to the two years prior. With a record of 22-26-2-0, Pierce and the Centennials knew the rebuild would take some time but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> the organization knew patience would pay off for. The 2010-11 season would bring similar fortunes to Merritt, with a record of 22-31-6-1, but the upswing was clearly underway with a flock of young players on that seasons roster.|$|E

25|$|Victory went to Schumacher at {{the wheel}} of a Ferrari in appalling conditions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a farce, for in {{addition}} to the pit lane confusion, he was penalised 10sec for passing another racer under a yellow flag. The stewards failed to inform the teams of their decision in the proper manner so Schumacher took his stop go penalty in the pits, after the race was over! McLaren appealed to the FIA, but the appeal was rejected and the results were confirmed, with Häkkinen second in the McLaren and Eddie Irvine third in the second Ferrari.|$|E
25|$|The Russian abacus {{was brought}} to France around 1820 by the {{mathematician}} Jean-Victor Poncelet, who served in Napoleon's army and had been {{a prisoner of war}} in Russia. The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> new. Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid. The Turks and the Armenian people also used abaci similar to the Russian schoty. It was named a coulba by the Turks and a choreb by the Armenians.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} 600 years, Sicily was a {{province}} of the Roman Republic and later Empire. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a rural backwater, important chiefly for its grain fields, which were a mainstay of the food supply {{for the city of}} Rome until the annexation of Egypt after the Battle of Actium largely did away with that role. The empire made little effort to Romanize the region, which remained largely Greek. One notable event of this period was the notorious misgovernment of Verres, as recorded by Cicero in 70 BC in his oration, In Verrem. Another was the Sicilian revolt under Sextus Pompeius, which liberated the island from Roman rule for a brief period.|$|E

25|$|Mauricio Soler came {{free from}} the peloton before the first climb {{of the day and}} took full points {{available}} to him, taking the lead outright in the King of the Mountains from Rasmussen. He and Carlos Sastre, for whom <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a surprise {{that he was able to}} get away from the peloton easily as he was 5th in the GC at the beginning of the day, worked together to stay away as long as possible. They wound up being caught with 11 kilometers left to race by a group containing Rasmussen, Alberto Contador, Levi Leipheimer, and numerous domestiques from their teams. Rasmussen came clear of this group on the way up the Aubisque to win the stage. It was thought at the time that this all but cinched his victory in the Tour, since only flat stages and an individual time trial remained, and that even a relatively weak time trialist like Rasmussen was unlikely to lose three to five minutes.|$|E
25|$|On the December 11, 1995 {{episode of}} Monday Nitro, Orndorff confronted Brian Pillman after Pillman made {{derogatory}} comments about Orndorff. After telling Flair and Anderson {{how much he}} respected them, Orndorff told Pillman {{that he could have}} been a Horseman and the only reason Pillman was a Horseman was because he turned it down. Anderson and Flair tried to calm Orndorff down but Orndorff lost his temper and attacked Pillman. Pillman, Flair, and Anderson attacked Orndorff and then Arn Anderson and Ric Flair delivered a spike piledriver to Orndorff on the arena floor during the attack. WCW later explained that Orndorff had been seriously hurt in the attack and that his career was over. In actuality, Orndorff was forced to retire due to his previous injuries in the WWF, with the entire right side of his body beginning to atrophy (eventually causing his arm and leg muscles to shrink). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> he had worked through as best he could {{but by the end of}} 1995 he was forced to retire and started to work as a trainer and a road agent for WCW. At the 2000 Fall Brawl, in a match between The Filthy Animals and The Natural Born Thrillers, Orndorff suffered a neck injury after delivering a piledriver. The referee, Charles Robinson stopped the match as a result.|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} hundred actors auditioned for the role, but only ten were taken seriously by the producers. Known actors such as Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees for the role as Agent Doggett.

In an interview with, Chris Carter said [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that we all talked about, but I wrote his voice.
