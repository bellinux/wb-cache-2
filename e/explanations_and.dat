5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 27 chapters, with a prelude, coda, {{bibliography}} and index. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks. It is written {{from the point of}} view of a science journalist with <b>explanations</b> <b>and</b> testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.|$|E
5|$|Willard Spiegelman, in {{his study}} of Romantic poetry, {{suggests}} that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator's reluctance to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation. Some critics provide other <b>explanations,</b> <b>and</b> William Ober claims that Keats's description of indolence may have arisen from the use of opium.|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community {{and much of the}} general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing <b>explanations</b> <b>and</b> {{it was not until the}} emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{they play}} their {{favorite}} game, Eels and Escalators. Patrick always gets escalators but SpongeBob always gets eels. Eventually, he loses {{the game and}} accidentally utters the swear word. Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him, inadvertently getting Patrick to say the word in the process. When SpongeBob bursts {{through the front door}} and tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish <b>explanations,</b> <b>and</b> takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them paint the Krusty Krab as punishment.|$|E
5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of <b>explanations</b> <b>and</b> elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E

5|$|While {{the doctor}} {{talks with the}} police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, and has been slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. Génessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his <b>explanations)</b> <b>and</b> returns to his lab, where an {{abandoned}} German Shepherd he'd only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit—maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring {{his face in the}} process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, walks slowly into the woods outside Génessier's house with one of the freed doves on her hand.|$|E

25|$|Greek-Catholics use the Propaganda edition {{and have}} a {{compendium}} (mikron euchologion) containing only the Liturgies, Apostles and Gospels, baptism, marriage, unction, and confession (Rome, 1872).

25|$|Creation science {{violates the}} {{principle}} of parsimony: Parsimony favours those explanations which rely on the fewest assumptions.

25|$|In {{developing}} the common law, academic writings have always {{played an important}} part, both to collect overarching principles from dispersed case law, and to argue for change.
