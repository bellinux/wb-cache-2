5|$|Ilokelesia was {{originally}} {{described as a}} sister group to Abelisauroidea. However, Sereno tentatively places it closer to Abelisaurus than to noasaurids, a result which agrees with several other recent analyses. If a stem-based <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> used, Ilokelesia and Rugops are therefore basal abelisaurids. However, as they are more basal than Abelisaurus, they are outside of Abelisauridae if the node-based <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> adopted. Ekrixinatosaurus was also published in 2004, {{so it was not}} included in Sereno's analysis. However, an independent analysis, performed by Jorge Calvo and colleagues, shows it to be an abelisaurid.|$|E
5|$|The above <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> {{extended}} to directed graphs. Then, for a homomorphism f : G → H, (f(u),f(v)) is an arc (directed edge) of H whenever (u,v) is an arc of G.|$|E
5|$|The axioms may be {{weakened}} {{to assert}} only {{the existence of}} a left identity and left inverses. Both can be shown to be actually two-sided, so the resulting <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to the one given above.|$|E
30|$|This <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> {{given by}} Sims in [1]. The next <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> stated by Dalby [5].|$|R
30|$|All the <b>definitions</b> <b>were</b> analysed. If the <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> {{given in}} free text, the major themes were extracted. Themes were then grouped on similarity, for example, volume and size were merged into one theme. For various reasons a few <b>definitions</b> <b>were</b> discarded, as {{discussed}} in the “Big data definitions” section.|$|R
30|$|Two {{important}} <b>definitions</b> <b>are</b> {{presented in}} this section. These <b>definitions</b> <b>are</b> then {{used to analyze the}} best cases for time and space.|$|R
5|$|The integers, {{together}} with the operation +, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following abstract <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> developed.|$|E
5|$|A broad {{operational}} <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes used}} {{to encompass the}} complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene {{is defined as a}} union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> {{that to be}} a Cockney, one had to be born {{within the}} sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but {{it is unlikely that the}} bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{announcement of}} The Open Source <b>Definition</b> <b>was</b> made on February 9, 1998 on Slashdot and elsewhere; the <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> given in Linux Gazette on February 10, 1998.|$|R
50|$|The 1985 WHO AIDS {{surveillance}} case <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> heavily criticised, {{for both}} medical and political reasons. The 1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 1994 {{to incorporate the}} statement that HIV testing should be done. However, if testing was unavailable, then the Bangui <b>definition</b> should <b>be</b> used.|$|R
50|$|The most limited <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> the {{official}} {{one of the}} Soviet Union, which defined Middle Asia as consisting solely of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. This <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> also often used outside the USSR during this period.|$|R
5|$|Despite the IAU's declaration, {{a number}} of critics remain unconvinced. The <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> seen by some as {{arbitrary}} and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.|$|E
5|$|Ignosticism is {{the view}} that a {{coherent}} definition of a deity must be put forward before {{the question of the}} existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> not coherent, the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.|$|E
5|$|There {{is another}} {{concrete}} definition of evenness: if {{the objects in}} a set can be placed into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects is even. This <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to the first one. Again, zero is even because the empty set {{can be divided into}} two groups of zero items each.|$|E
25|$|The above <b>definitions</b> <b>are</b> {{inadequate}} for many technical applications. In fact, the <b>definitions</b> above <b>are</b> specializations {{of the following}} definitions.|$|R
40|$|Consideration {{of three}} {{alternate}} definitions of cross-polarization {{known to the}} author. The three <b>definitions</b> <b>are</b> expressed precisely {{in terms of the}} same antenna pattern coordinate system, and the relative merits of the various <b>definitions</b> <b>are</b> discussed. One of the <b>definitions</b> <b>is</b> shown to be the proper choice for describing source current polarizations, another is suitable for relating source current distributions to secondary patterns, and the third is the best choice for describing antenna patterns...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{alternative}} definitions of CTOD. The two most common <b>definitions,</b> CTOD <b>is</b> the displacement at the original crack tip and the 90 degree intercept. The latter <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> suggested by Rice and is commonly used to infer CTOD in finite element models of such. Note that these two <b>definitions</b> <b>are</b> equivalent if the crack tip blunts in a semicircle.|$|R
5|$|A 2003 {{attempt by}} Christopher Brochu {{included}} Albertosaurus, Alectrosaurus, Alioramus, Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus in the definition. Holtz redefined the clade in 2004 {{to use all}} of the above as specifiers except for Alioramus and Alectrosaurus, which his analysis could not place with certainty. However, in the same paper, Holtz also provided a completely different definition, including all theropods more closely related to Tyrannosaurus than to Eotyrannus. The most recent <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> that of Sereno in 2005, which defined Tyrannosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is {{domiciled}} in Malaysia or Singapore. Though this <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> not according to ancestry lineage, it is however correct {{in the sense of}} social behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E

30|$|The primary {{outcome was}} {{development}} of ARDS during the hospital stay. ARDS was defined {{according to the}} Berlin definition [18]. The Berlin <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> retrospectively applied to the data, as this <b>definition</b> <b>was</b> not yet published {{at the time of}} the data collection.|$|R
5|$|Instead {{of solving}} {{for the two}} hyperbolas, Newton {{constructs}} their directrix lines instead. For any hyperbola, the ratio of distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle {{can be defined as}} the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E
5|$|MSE {{provides}} real-time protection, constantly monitoring {{activities on}} the computer and scanning new files as they are downloaded or created. It disables detected threats and prompts for user input {{on how to deal}} with them. If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected threats are handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, by default, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, originally Microsoft SpyNet), a web-based service. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased virus definition, the new <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> downloaded to remove the threat.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} a {{practical}} realization based upon this <b>definition</b> <b>is</b> that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E

40|$|Hume {{presents}} two {{definitions of}} cause in his Enquiry which correspond to his two definitions in his Treatise. The {{first of the}} <b>definitions</b> <b>is</b> ontological {{and the second is}} psychological; indeed, the <b>definitions</b> <b>are</b> extensionally and intensionally distinct. The critical mistake of the skeptical interpretation is the assumption that the two <b>definitions</b> <b>are</b> equivalent, and the critical mistake of the necessitarian is the assumption an association of ideas can be had from one experiment. This paper attempts to clarify Hume's finally considered position of causality...|$|R
