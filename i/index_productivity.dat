From the result of analysis and discussion showed that the role of internal auditor was not optimal yet all this time, especially for the audit of the human resources which was had the company whereas internal auditor has important role. Therefore, the internal auditor position must be able to keep indepedency level in auditing process. This condition was not found in Modjopanggoong Sugar Mill Tulungagung because the internal auditor position was not in direct reponsibility to the managing director. Then, the productivity of total employees beetwen target and production realization which was not realized was 0, 4 % in 2006, the <b>index</b> <b>productivity</b> was 0, 4 % in 2006.

We use a non-parametric approach that enables changes in productivity to be broken down into variations in efficiency and technical change.

This increase in productivity is mainly due to technical progress. We also analyse the determinants of efficiency and, unlike other papers, the technical change, finding that the greater the degree of autonomy and financial independence, the higher the efficiency levels and technical change.

The rationale of this methodology {{is to consider}} the features of technology appropriately by excluding a spurious technical regress based on the macroeconomic perspective. In order to consider this condition and to develop {{an alternative}} index, a directional distance function {{and the concept of}} the successive sequential production possibility set are combined. With this combination, the conventional Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index is modified to give the alternative sequential environmentally sensitive productivity index. This proposed index is employed in measuring productivity growth and its decomposed components of OECD countries for the period 1970 - 2003. We distinguish two main empirical findings. First, even though the components of the conventional Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index and the proposed index are different, the developments of productivity are similar.

DEA was originally introduced by Charnes et al. [J. Oper. Res. 2 (1978) 429] is a linear programming method for assessing the efficiency and productivity of DMUs. Over the last two decades, DEA has gained considerable attention as a managerial tool for measuring performance of organisations and it has widely been used for assessing the efficiency of public and private sectors such as banks, airlines, hospitals, universities and manufactures. As a result, new applications with more variables and more complicated models are being introduced.
