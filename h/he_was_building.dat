25|$|Initially, {{as shown}} by his choice of taking his seat in uniform, Hopkinson was {{particularly}} active on military matters, calling for 'democracy under discipline' and a recognition that democratic forces were present when reconstructing the Army. He {{was a member of}} the House of Commons Army Committee in 1919, and the following year criticised the actions of Brigadier-General Dyer in the Amritsar massacre following the official report into it.

25|$|Wilson seems {{from his}} diary {{not to have}} {{particularly}} welcomed the suggestion that he become CIGS. When told by Milner of rumours {{that he was to}} be given Robertson’s job he said that he preferred to be given ever more power at Versailles where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>building</b> up a prestigious post for himself, with Robertson reduced “from the position of a Master to that of a servant”. Milner told Wilson (10 February) that Lloyd George wanted to move Robertson to Versailles. Ironically, if he became CIGS he wanted Robertson (whom he thought would refuse) or whoever else replaced him at Versailles to report to himself. There was talk of the government falling, Rawlinson writing to H.A.Gwynne (14 February 1918) that the best solution was to give Robertson a powerful role at Versailles and have Wilson as a weak CIGS in London “where he {{will not be able to}} do much mischief – especially if Squiff replaced LG as PM”.|$|E
25|$|Beaumarchais' {{problems}} were eased {{when he was}} appointed to teach Louis XV's four daughters the harp. His role soon grew and he became a musical advisor for the royal family. In 1759, Caron met Joseph Paris Duverney, an older and wealthy entrepreneur. Beaumarchais assisted him in gaining the King's approval for the new military academy <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>building,</b> the École Royale Militaire, and in turn Duverney promised to help make him rich. The two became very close friends and collaborated on many business ventures. Assisted by Duverney, Beaumarchais acquired the title of Secretary-Councillor to the King in 1760–61, thereby gaining access to French nobility. This {{was followed by the}} purchase in 1763 of a second title, the office of Lieutenant General of Hunting, a position which oversaw the royal parks. Around this time, he became engaged to Pauline Le Breton, who came from a plantation-owning family from Saint-Domingue, but broke it off when he discovered she was not as wealthy as he had been led to believe.|$|E

[...] Like most of the big studios in the 1960s, MGM was struggling and Kerkorian said his new president would bring the company roaring back to its former glory. Instead, Aubrey largely liquidated the company as Kerkorian transformed it into a hospitality company with the MGM Grand Hotel <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>building.</b> [...] "We've been using old-fashioned methods here," [...] Aubrey said at the time. In 1986, he said the company was [...] "total disarray. Until you were in a position to lift up the rug, {{there was no way to}} know how much disarray.

Zimmerman was immediately put in charge of designing all-new sets for the Klingon Bird of Prey bridge, the Enterprises bridge, elevator shafts and bowels, and Nimbus III interiors. At one point, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>building</b> five sets at once. Art department head Michael Okuda created LCARS backlit controls on the Klingon ship and Enterprise. The corridors for the Enterprise were the same as those used in the Next Generation television series. The bridge set alone cost $250,000. The Nimbus III city of Paradise {{was one of the last}} locations to be designed and created, because its design relied on what exterior location and terrain was used. Zimmerman created a sketch of the town's layout over three days, drawing inspiration from a circular Moroccan fortress. Creation of the city cost $500,000 and took five weeks of construction in [...] heat.|$|E
500|$|On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons {{appeared}} {{naked in}} his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him.

Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family {{back into the living room}} and demanded they strip naked together.

500|$|Mardas {{gave the}} Beatles regular reports of his progress, {{but when they}} {{required}} their new studio in January 1969, during the Get Back project that became Let It Be, they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track tape deck (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks), no soundproofing, no talkback (intercom) system, and not even a patch bay to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls. The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude mixing console which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin's assistant, Dave Harries) like [...] "bits of wood and an old oscilloscope". The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was [...] "chaos", {{and that they had}} to [...] "rip it all out and start again," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest disaster of all time." [...] Harrison's suspicions of Mardas' competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with a clipboard, and considered the possibility that Mardas had [...] "just read the latest version of Science Weekly, and used its ideas". Mardas later stated that he had never been in the basement of Savile Row, as the studio equipment <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>building</b> was being tested in Apple Electronics, at Boston Place, Marylebone.|$|E
