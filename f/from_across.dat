5|$|Childe {{continued}} {{writing and}} publishing books on archaeology, {{beginning with a}} series of works following on from The Dawn of European Civilisation and The Aryans by compiling and synthesising data <b>from</b> <b>across</b> Europe. First was The Most Ancient Near East (1928), which assembled information <b>from</b> <b>across</b> Mesopotamia and India, setting a background from which the spread of farming and other technologies into Europe could be understood. This was followed by The Danube in Prehistory (1929) which examined the archaeology along the Danube river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the Near East from Europe; Childe believed that it was via the Danube that new technologies travelled westward in prehistory. The book introduced the concept of an archaeological culture to Britain from Germany, revolutionising the theoretical approach of British archaeology.|$|E
