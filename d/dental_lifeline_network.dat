We select electric power supply systems, gas supply systems, and water supply systems distributed in Tokyo metropolitan area for analysis, and these related facilities and structural components are modeled as network nodes and links taking into account their functional interdependency. To reveal the trend of network system reliability and analyze its variation, numerical simulation by using network parameters of average degree k, characteristic path length L, clustering coefficient C, relative size of the largest cluster S, average size of the isolated clusters s and accessibility ratio Ra, is carried out for the cases that the nodes exposed to a high seismic hazard are affected in entire interactive <b>lifeline</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

To repair remote mountainous {{transportation}} <b>lifeline</b> <b>networks</b> destructed {{by major}} natural disasters, a best repair algorithm developed from augmented variational method (AVM) is presented. By constructing a residual network {{of the original}} network, augmenting a given feasible flow along the augmented path and introducing pre-flow push algorithm, the optimal evacuation way in the remaining paths is amended and found out. Finally, the calculating process of pre-flow push algorithm was illustrated through a case study.

40|$|The {{following}} research {{is in keeping}} with the current international and national trend to establish effective facility management plans, based on antagonistic notions of maximal production and minimal risks. The application of this approach to <b>lifeline</b> <b>networks</b> is complex, considering that the failure of these networks can cause extensive consequences for populations and upon socio-economic activities. Effectively, <b>lifeline</b> <b>networks</b> are generally strongly interrelated, which favours the propagation of vulnerabilities from one network to another through cascading effects. A methodology has been developed in order to define, characterise and assess the transfer of vulnerability between <b>lifeline</b> <b>networks.</b> The methodology is based on three specific steps. We first perform an exhaustive assessment of the initial vulnerability and characterise its potential consequences. We then transfer these potential consequences to the other networks through cascading effects. Finally, the transferred consequences are defined as vulnerabilities. Such a methodology, which relies on a complete assessment of consequences, can only be carried out via consequence studies, rather than the usual scenario approaches, in order to evaluate all possible situations. We will present the three main steps of this methodology, which is currently centred on the precise definition of the links that bond the various networks. The consequence studies that we recommend will then be explained, followed by the presentation of a case study of a hydroelectric power generation network and a power transportation network. This example will allow us to validate the preceding concepts. lifeline network; cascading effects; evaluation; risk assessment; risk communication...|$|R
40|$|The {{failure event}} of a {{structure}} or <b>lifeline</b> <b>network</b> is often described by a complex logical function of multiple component failure events.

40|$|Abstract: A {{conventional}} {{approach to}} model the regional economic impacts of a catastrophic disaster has been to employ the results from an engineering model, such as <b>lifeline</b> <b>network</b> model, in an economic model, for example input-output framework or computable general equilibrium model. However, due to the differences in modeling scheme between economic and engineering models, this type of data feed creates problems regarding sensitivity and dynamics of the impacts. In this paper, Sequential Interindustry Model (SIM) is used to disaggregate the process of production chronology to become {{more sensitive to the}} changes/damages of economic activities under a disaster situation. SIM is particularly useful to simulate the dynamic processes of impact propagation and of structural changes after a catastrophic disaster.

These factors are conveniently used to compare effectivity of several alternatives of earthquake disaster countermeasures.

The MSR method is applied to a bridge transportation network, a highway bridge structural system, and truss structures. The method is further developed to achieve improved efficiency using the first- or second-order reliability method; and to evaluate the sensitivity of the system failure probability with respect to parameters that affect the statistical dependence between the components. These further developments are demonstrated by risk assessment of progressive failures of a generalized Daniels system structure and by finite element system reliability analysis of a bridge pylon system. This study also aims at developing new methods for stochastic damage detection of pipeline networks based on the MSR method. The methods allow for efficient uncertainty quantification of system quantities such as network flow measures and for updating the component damage probabilities based on post-disaster observations on network performance. The accuracy and efficiency of these methods are demonstrated by a water pipeline network with 15 pipes that is subjected to an earthquake event. The sequential compounding method (SCM) is also developed to compute the probability of a general system event described in terms of a multivariate normal distribution. The merit of the SCM is its superior efficiency compared to existing system reliability methods including the MSR method. The accuracy and efficiency of the SCM is tested by a wide range of numerical examples including large systems consisting of 1, 000 components.

Still, to the authors knowledge there has been no attempt to incorporate both engineering and economic linkages across all infrastructure types in an economy. The assumption that all indirect economic effects can be modelled through financial transactions within the standard I-O table is erroneous, and will lead to incorrect loss estimation. This is because it does not account for the physical interdependencies across different sectors of the economy. The total economic effect will be a combination of physical and economic effects at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels (where tertiary effects are defined as the impacts on the economy caused by physical cascade effects outside the affected area).|$|R

For this reason, models of interdependent systems under a wide range of adverse events are emerging; nevertheless, {{it is not easy to}} assess the intensity of coupling across systems to make these models represent their actual behavior. Besides, this paper performs a systematic quantification of spatial interdependencies across multiple <b>lifeline</b> <b>networks,</b> including power, water, fixed telephone and internet systems, as representatives of modern smart infrastructures. The analysis expands a Kriging Aided Spatial Correlation Algorithm (KASCA) at the local scale that quantifies lifeline coupling strengths and provides a more explicit and reproducible formulation of the spatial approach. This is achieved by performing sensitivity analyses to best estimate the interdependence strengths across networks subjected to earthquakes across geographies that match predictions to field observations and local field features. The improved spatial analysis is applied for the first time to four systems in the context of the 2010 Mw 8. 8 Chile Earthquake using utility restoration data sets and the results are compared with previous temporal and spatial analyses for subsets of the systems. Spatially varying coupling strengths resulting from this analysis are communicated via local correlation maps and synthesized into global correlation plots, which can point out interdependence directionality and length of coupling influence across lifeline systems.

Consequently, the demandof replace aging specialized switching system by using cost effective COTS (Commercialoff-the-shelf) such as Intel Architecture computer, is so high. However, it is difficult to satisfythe requirements of the switching system by just applying COTS system. Especially,availability and real time capability are missing on COTS system. In this paper, I propose the approaches that improve availability and real time capabilityof COTS system, using Intel x 86 - 64 CPU SMP machine and Linux, in order to satisfyrequirements of the switching system. First, I propose the live patching approach that enables dynamic modification of processand kernel without restarting. The proposed approach enables to fix the software withoutrestarting, within deadline, and without disrupting real time service. Then I propose the priority control of disk IO that reduces the maximum response timeof high-priority write system call. The adoption of COTS components causes the callprocessing to record transaction log to hard disk drive, and that recording increase in theservice response time.

40|$|The structure, interdependence, and {{fragility}} of systems ranging from power-grids and transportation to ecology, climate, biology and even human {{communities and the}} Internet have been examined through network science. While response to perturbations has been quantified, recovery strategies for perturbed networks have usually been either discussed conceptually or through anecdotal case studies. Here we develop a network science based quantitative framework for measuring, comparing and interpreting hazard responses as well as recovery strategies. The framework, motivated by the recently proposed temporal resilience paradigm, is demonstrated with the Indian Railways Network. Simulations inspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2012 North Indian blackout {{as well as a}} cyber-physical attack scenario illustrate hazard responses and effectiveness of proposed recovery strategies. Multiple metrics are used to generate various recovery strategies, which are simply sequences in which system components should be recovered after a disruption. Quantitative evaluation of these strategies suggests that faster and more efficient recovery is possible through network centrality measures. Optimal recovery strategies may be different per hazard, per community within a network, and for different measures of partial recovery. In addition, topological characterization provides a means for interpreting the comparative performance of proposed recovery strategies. The methods can be directly extended to other Large-Scale Critical <b>Lifeline</b> Infrastructure <b>Networks</b> including transportation, water, energy and communications systems that are threatened by natural or human-induced hazards, including cascading failures.

40|$|Lifeline is an {{earthquake}} engineering term denoting those {{systems that are}} necessary for human life and urban contest. Those systems are commonly used to transport water, oil, natural gas and other material. Their disruption due to earthquakes can have a devastating impact on urban context both for human losses both economic stability. Therefore, due to their vulnerabilities, {{it is important to}} assess and mitigate seismic risk of lifelines since they are intricately linked with industries, communities and security they serve. The earthquake safety of lifeline systems has attracted great attention in recent years since significant amount of damage was observed during several past earthquakes. This thesis focuses on the seismic performance evaluation of gas distribution networks. The basic function of a gas system is to deliver gas from sources to costumers. A gas distribution system is essentially composed by pipelines, reduction stations, valves and demand nodes. Those systems are essentially located underground. As consequences gas networks are subjected to both transient ground deformation due to seismic waves, which is felt over a wide geographical area, and ground failure due to geotechnical hazards such as liquefaction and landslide, which determine localized ground failure. Moreover since buried pipelines systems generally cover large areas, a sophisticated hazard analysis is required. In particular the quantification of regional hazard is based on a large vector of spatially correlated ground motion intensities and requires the modeling of the joint distribution of intensity measures at all sites of interest. Dependencies among ground motion parameters at different sites imply the estimation of spatial correlation models to be used for the hazard assessment but since each component that characterizes the system may be sensitive to different ground motion parameters, the possibility of the existence of a cross-correlation between these parameters has also to be taken into account. Fragility analysis of gas systems is generally based on empirical data collected throughout past earthquakes. In the case of pipeline components, the usual practice is to evaluate the repair rate as a unit length of pipe, with respect to a parameter representative of ground shaking or ground failure. For processing facilities, that include many subcomponents, a quantitative vulnerability assessment is quite difficult. A possible approach is to consider these facilities as systems and to aggregate the fragility of each component into a global systemic vulnerability through the use of fault tree analysis. Further in order to evaluate the interaction between component response to earthquake and lifeline performance, system performance indicators provide a measure {{of the impact of the}} earthquake on the system functionality. Building on the results from past international research projects, existing tools for the vulnerability assessment, and seismic risk analysis of lifelines systems, the SYNER-G project (“Systemic Seismic Vulnerability and Risk Analysis for Buildings, <b>Lifeline</b> <b>Networks</b> and Infrastructures Safety Gain”), has been funded by the European Commission (2009 - 2012) with the aim to address criticalities. In relation of the objectives of this project, this thesis had the aim to determine methodologies for the probabilistic seismic risk analysis of gas distribution networks and to apply these methods to a real gas system. In literature, there are very few studies on seismic risk analysis of networks that take into account all the aspects of the component of risk (hazard, vulnerability and loss). Moreover there are fewer studies that try to calibrate the analysis on a real system, making the study interesting for network operators. The thesis, in fact, has achieved this goal with special emphasis to the medium and low pressure network of a real system, namely the L’Aquila gas distribution system managed by ENEL Rete Gas s. p. a., for which not only detailed information on the network were retrieved, but also data related to damages occurred on the network followed the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake. A geographic information system (GIS) database was developed containing data on system physical and operational characteristics provided by the network operator to chracterize the seismic behavior of all components. L’Aquila region has been characterized both in terms of transient ground deformation hazard and permanent ground deformation hazard. In particular European and Italian spatial correlation models have been estimated and used for the simulation of probabilistic scenarios earthquakes and the ground failure hazard has been characterized in terms of landslide potential. Probabilistic simulations have been performed to evaluate the system response in terms of performance indicators for different combinations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lifelines</b> and Transportation <b>Networks,</b> which convey food, water, fuel, energy, information, {{and other}} {{materials}} necessary for human existence and functioning, {{are among the most}} crucial development indicators for any nation. Roadways, being element of such systems, are often fundamental infrastructures to reach places struck by strong earthquakes. During earthquakes, {{there are a number of}} ways in which these systems can be affected. Besides the ground shaking hazard that causes major damage typologies, there are other earthquake related hazards that can affect the vulnerability of the system such as landslides. Vulnerability assessment is essential to the understanding of potential impacts of seismic hazards on lifelines, infrastructures and other key components of the system. The scope of the thesis is to study the vulnerability of transportation network elements with varying geometrical characteristics and configurations during earthquakes. In the present study road on embankments, cut slopes (Trenches) and retaining walls subject to different earthquake sizes each placed under three typical soil profiles corresponding to ground types C, D and E in the Eurocode 8 are considered. Unlike the many common practices which are based on either the Pseudo-static analyses approach or the Newmark’s sliding block procedures, in the current study vulnerability in terms of fragility functions are evaluated using 2 D dynamic analyses implemented in FEM-PLAXIS program. The effects from ground conditions and geometric features of the system components are evaluated and finally a relationship between the input ground motion (as PGA) and the resulting damages (as PGD) from the dynamic analyses results are formulated. Fragility curves, which the express the probability of reaching or exceeding different levels of damages for a given level of ground motion, are developed as a function of PGA unlike the standard fragility curves which are based on PGD values. The initiation is that the PGA is more commonly known parameters for earthquake than the PGD. </p...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the MIAVITA project is to develop a conceptual frame for the risk assessment of inhabited areas exposed to various volcanic hazards. The present communication aims at presenting a scenario-building tool that would take into account the succession of volcanic, seismic, gravity and hydro-geological events and, consequently, analyse the impact of such events on people, physical elements (e. g. buildings, agriculture) and various functional systems composing the exposed community. As several scenario software tools are available in the field of seismic risk, such an approach proves less straightforward in the case of volcanic risk: the main difficulty resides in the crossover of several types of geological phenomena and exposed elements, each combination of them usually relying on specific damage mechanisms. Therefore, before building a risk assessment tool, the first step comprises the careful definition of all damaging phenomena, damage mechanisms and exposed elements that may be potentially involved in a volcanic eruption. For the analysis of complex systems of components, the object-oriented paradigm is a convenient approach and enables to clearly represent the hazard phenomena and the vulnerable elements as a set of well-structured classes that are assigned specific attributes (i. e. properties) and methods (i. e. functions) : such an approach has been previously used in the frame of a seismic risk analysis (Cavalieri et al., 2012) and has been adapted to the case of volcanic, by adding new hazard classes and damage mechanism corresponding to the specificities of volcanic risk. The definition of classes of objects is then used to draw UML (Unified Modified Language) diagrams that represent the successive steps of a risk scenario computation, from the definition of the hazard phenomena to the estimation of physical and functional damage of the exposed elements. A software tool developed by Cavalieri et al. (2012) in the frame of the SYNER-G FP 7 project has been used as the "core engine" for the MIAVITA scenario-builder tool: the changes that were implemented enable to compute the impact of several volcanic events {{on a wide range of}} exposed elements (e. g. buildings, <b>lifelines,</b> road <b>network,</b> cultivated areas, emergency centres [...] .). A non-negligible feature relies also in the ability to build a scenario composed from different successive volcanic events (e. g. tephra fall, pyroclastic density current, debris flow, lahar [...] .), thus adding a temporal dimension in the computation. A few probable scenarios have been elicited for the Mount Cameroun area and they were implemented in the risk assessment tool in order to get a robust and quantitative estimation of the impacts of different volcanic events. Using sets of fragility curves previously compiled by Jenkins & Spence (2009), the software tool yields probabilistic results for some indicators such as the number of casualties or collapsed buildings, the area of damaged cultivated fields or the connectivity loss in the road network...|$|R
40|$|Earthquakes, weak or strong, {{represent}} {{always a}} psychological and emotional stress for people, {{but also a}} strong socio-economic impact for the affected area. The earthquake generation, the propagation of seismic waves, the seismic waves modification due to the propagation media and the interaction between seismic wave and human structures, are the main topics of different research disciplines. In the last years a wide interdisciplinary research program (physics, seismology, mathematics, geology, engineering, etc.) was world wide experienced aiming at improving the earthquake knowledge and mitigating the ground-shaking effects. The seismic risk, namely the probability of occurrence of losses, {{can be described as}} the convolution of three variables: Seismic Risk = Seismic Hazard * Vulnerability * Exposition The Seismic Hazard represents the probability for a selected strong motion parameter (Peak Ground Acceleration, Velocity, Spectral Acceleration…) to be exceeded in a given time interval at a target site. The Seismic Hazard term mainly depends on the earthquake characteristics, target site-epicenter distance and geomorphologic conditions. More generally the Seismic Hazard describes the potential for a dangerous, earthquake-related natural phenomena such as ground shaking, fault rupture, or soil liquefaction. These phenomena could result in adverse consequences to society such as the destruction of buildings or the loss of life. From the seismological point of view all new information about the incoming ground shaking or the possible future ground motion amplitude represent a contribution to the “seismic hazard mitigation”. In fact the knowledge of the expected ground acceleration is the first step for a better build design, while the knowledge of the incoming acceleration amplitude, during an earthquake occurrence, can define an alert action rather than others. The Vulnerability represents the probability that people, infrastructure and activity suffer the consequence of an earthquake. The damages can be direct as the collapse of structures or collateral as the fall of productivity due to power station injuries. The Exposition represents a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the elements exposed to seismic hazard also in terms of their geographical distribution. Seismic risk increases as earthquake-prone regions become more densely populated and urbanized. Although local planning and zoning activities can help to shape regional growth over time, additional development is generally (and understandably) promoted as a means of strengthening of local economies. The seismic hazard mitigation can be subdivided in two main time intervals: o	Pre-event o	Real-time The “pre-event” period is characterized by different methodology and actions to prevent the casualties and damages produced by an earthquake. The main goal of the pre-event action is the estimation of casualties, structural collapse or damages as consequence of an earthquake occurrence that can affect the area of interest. As it will be reported in the following chapters the seismological results of the pre-event actions like seismic hazard analysis strongly depend on the knowledge about the seismicity characteristics of the target area, seismic wave generation and propagation. The main pre-event approaches to the seismic hazard mitigation are the Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA) (Chapter 1) and the Hybrid Seismic Hazard Analysis (Chapter 2). A PSHA study for Molise region, Italy, was conducted to refining the seismic hazard characterization for identifying a set of relevant earthquakes for the engineering analysis of structures. The results of this study, in combination with an experimental structural health monitoring system, represent a real innovation for the pre-event action to minimize the casualties and the structural damages. In fact the possibility to tracking at different time scales the structural response and the evolution of damage can provide important information to support rescue operations. The methodology and the results for the PSHA analysis at Molise region are reported in the Chapter 1. The hybrid approach to seismic hazard analysis represents a combination of the main characteristic of the Deterministic Seismic Hazard Analysis (DSHA) and the probabilistic methodology. The probabilistic/deterministic approach is able to overcome the limitations of PSHA when a single causative fault and an associated maximum (credible) earthquake is considered as the threat for the site of interest and to considered the earthquake return period using the DSHA. This methodology was applied to high densely populated volcanic areas in Campania region, Italy, where the occurrence of a moderate seismic event represents a threat for the inhabitants and for the civil and/or industrial infrastructures. The hybrid approach in these high dangerous zones is considered as the first step for the hazard mitigation. The results of the analysis are reported in Chapter 2. The “real-time” phase represents the modern seismological challenge. In fact only at the present the technology allows to perform analysis on seismic signal during the earthquake occurrence. However the technological development is not enough advanced to assure to undertake always the right alert actions. The shake maps play a relevant role to reduce the earthquake damages. It was reported by Wald et al. that: “For rapid response, ShakeMap ground motion values are used for emergency response and loss estimation, assessment of damage to the <b>lifeline</b> and utility <b>networks,</b> and for providing information to the general public”. Shake maps are representations of the space distribution of the more representative parameters useful for description of the possible injuries to the infrastructures, which are the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) and the Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) and Spectral accelerations at different periods (Sa). The shake maps are a possible reference instrument for the civil protection operating units, for the army, for the Red Cross, etc. in order to assure timely and effective service on the territory. However at the present the shake maps calculated in real-time represent an approximation of the real ground motion parameters space distribution. The lack of reliability of the maps is strictly related to the lack of knowledge about the fault extension and the not well-defined source to target site distance. As discussed in the Chapter 3, a new methodology has been developed to define the dimension of the surface projection of fault plane during the earthquake to calculate a better spatial distribution of acceleration and velocity using the appropriate source to target site distance. Instruments able to recognize an earthquake, to estimate the incoming ground motion and subsequently produce an early warning signal represent a valid real-time approach to mitigate the seismic hazard. This instruments combines seismological know-out with technological aspect about for instance seismic sensors, data-loggers, computer elaboration, and so on, and usually are defined as Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWS). The EEWS represent a challenge from different point of view because different knowledge is need to perform a signal analysis in real time to assure the large and reliable possible warning time interval. At the present the time interval necessary to perform very fast-automated action such as to stop the elevators, to shut-off gas, to stop the trains, to start-up the generators, is of order of few seconds. In high densely populated or industrialized areas few seconds could be sufficient to minimized the casualties and damages, to maximize the efficiency of rescue operation and the faster return to a normal and safe condition. Chapter 4 reports a preliminary study for “EEWS-BOX” that represents a new approach for a stand-alone earthquake early warning system...|$|R
