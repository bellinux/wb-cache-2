5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} with being {{the first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of Pythagoras of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{signed by}} Congress and {{enshrined in the}} National Archives is usually regarded as the Declaration of Independence, but historian Julian P. Boyd argued that the Declaration, like Magna Carta, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> document. Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts, as well. The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by John Dunlap of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in The National Archives in England in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} characteristics {{seen in the}} breed are currently in flux, so there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> breed phenotype, though {{many members of the}} breed closely resemble the Mérens. Enthusiasts are breeding for a rustic mountain horse, of medium size, with good gaits and good temperament. Some members of the breed closely resemble Iberian horses such as the Andalusian horse. The official breed standard calls for a moderately long neck and long, sloped shoulder, broad back, rounded croup and muscular legs. Some members of the breed are branded on the left hindquarter. Because of its relative rarity and physical similarities, the Castillonnais is commonly confused with the Mérens.|$|E
25|$|Just as the {{minority}} Quranists <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> community, the ahadith-believers or hadithists <b>are</b> also <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> community. Hadithists simply share the feature that, {{in addition to}} Quran, they incorporate belief and practice of ahadith—not necessarily the same hadith collection.|$|R
25|$|Dung beetles <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> taxonomic group; dung feeding {{is found}} {{in a number of}} {{families}} of beetles, so the behaviour cannot be assumed to have evolved only once.|$|R
50|$|Groups A and B {{took place}} in Equatorial Guinea, while Groups C and D were held in Gabon. Notably, there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> goalless draw during the group stage.|$|R
5|$|The Presidency of the Council <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> post, but {{is held by}} {{a member}} state's government. Every six months the {{presidency}} rotates between the states, in an order predefined by the Council's members, allowing each state to preside over the body. From 2007, every three member states co-operate for their combined eighteen months on a common agenda, although only one formally holds the presidency for the normal six-month period. For example, the President {{for the second half}} of 2007, Portugal, was the second in a trio of states alongside Germany and Slovenia with whom Portugal had been co-operating. The Council meets in various configurations (as outlined below) so its membership changes depending upon the issue. The person chairing the Council will always be the member from the state holding the Presidency. A delegate from the following Presidency also assists the presiding member and may take over work if requested. The exception however is the foreign affairs council, which has been chaired by the High Representative since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} not entirely clear, but {{is thought to be}} multifactorial. It has even been {{suggested}} that aphthous stomatitis <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction is thought {{to be the result of}} a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved, secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E
25|$|Thus, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{statement}} {{but instead}} a schema, {{with a separate}} statement for each natural number n.|$|E
25|$|In {{applying}} the word stauros to the crossbeam, these writers {{indicate that the}} complete structure on which Jesus died <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> upright post but formed what is normally called a cross.|$|R
25|$|The Old San Antonio Road <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> road, but <b>a</b> {{network of}} trails with {{different}} routes at different times. The trail's path was dictated by things {{as diverse as}} weather and native american threats.|$|R
2500|$|... : [...] "here <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> order, or appeal, or {{suggestion}} about evacuation from Palestine {{from any}} Arab radio station, {{inside or outside}} Palestine, in 1948," [...] and that to the contrary (Arab) broadcasts gave flat orders to civilians to stay put.|$|R
25|$|Because utilitarianism <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> theory but {{a cluster}} of related {{theories}} {{that have been developed}} over two hundred years, criticisms can be made for different reasons and have different targets.|$|E
25|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> entity, {{but rather a}} collection {{of different types of}} tumours, each derived from the various parts of the nephron (epithelium or renal tubules) and possessing distinct genetic characteristics, histological features, and, to some extent, clinical phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|Brentjes {{argues that}} there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{cultural}} element of central Asian, eastern European, or Caucasian {{origin in the}} Mitannian area; he also associates with an Indo-Aryan presence the peacock motif found in the Middle East from before 1600 BCE and quite likely from before 2100 BCE.|$|E
50|$|During his tenure, PAF flew maximum with least {{accidents}} due to {{his emphasis}} on flight safety. In 2010, there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> accident despite extensive operational exercises, overseas deployments and maximum flying, making 2010 an accident-free {{year for the first}} time in history of PAF.|$|R
30|$|There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> even <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Chinese {{overseas}} student.|$|R
50|$|From 1809 to 1830 eight {{different}} provinces produced their own independent constitutions so there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> unified constitution {{in the country}} of Colombia. The Constitution of the Free State of Socorro in 1810 was the first of these. It was simultaneously federalist, democratic, liberal and catholic.|$|R
25|$|Italy's {{police force}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> unit but rather {{is made up}} of {{multiple}} organisations, some national and others local or regional bodies. All police come under the Ministry of the Interior, apart from the carabinieri, which come under the Ministry of Defence in certain matters.|$|E
25|$|Kenshō <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> experience, but {{refers to}} {{a whole series of}} realizations from a beginner's shallow glimpse of the nature of mind, up to a vision of {{emptiness}} equivalent to the 'Path of Seeing' or to Buddhahood itself. In all of these, the same 'thing' is known, but in different degrees of clarity and profundity.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{very little}} is known about the second {{question}} of classifying the smooth structures on a smoothable 4-manifold; in fact, there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> smoothable 4-manifold where the answer is known. Donaldson showed that there are some simply connected compact 4-manifolds, such as Dolgachev surfaces, with a countably infinite number of different smooth structures. There are an uncountable number of different smooth structures on R4; see exotic R4.|$|E
30|$|There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> even <b>a</b> <b>single</b> person {{inside the}} house.|$|R
50|$|Barangay 9, San Lucas: Also {{known as}} Cabugnayan and Capitacan. During {{the early part}} of the 18th century, areas of San Nicolas were still {{wilderness}} and there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> road leading to this place. Unfriendly Tinggians and Igorots lived in these places and people in the poblacion avoided them.|$|R
5|$|Swete {{examined}} {{only the}} text of the Old Testament. According to him the original order of the Old Testament cannot be reconstructed; the scribe who converted the manuscript into a palimpsest used the leaves for his new text without regard to their original arrangement. The original manuscript <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> volume.|$|R
25|$|Genetics and the Origin of Species has {{two main}} points to make. The {{first is that}} {{speciation}} is a genuine problem that must {{be explained by the}} theory of evolution. In nature, there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> population of organisms separated from each other by small variations. Instead, the natural world is divided into species, each with its own limited range of variability. The second point is that all the variations {{can be explained by the}} principles of genetics.|$|E
25|$|Although Savarkar is {{regarded}} as a Hindu Nationalist, he professed atheism (nastika) and therefore did not belong to any orthodox school of Hindu faith. It should however, be noted that atheism within Hinduism is different from it's Western counterpart. Many Hindus do not profess belief in deities or a God, as it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> religion, but a collection of many diverse philosophies and faiths. Savarkar still had spirituality, and a mystical view of life, and gave great importance to mythology and symbolism.|$|E
25|$|All six workers' clubs of {{this period}} differ in shape, size, and {{functional}} set. Melnikov's clients (the unions) were not competent in exact functions of these buildings, thus each Melnikov draft is also a functional program with different balance between main hall and other space. The club, according to Melnikov, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> fixed theater hall, but a flexible system of different halls that may be united into a single, large volume when necessary. His larger main halls {{can be divided into}} three (Rusakov Club) or two (Svoboda Club) independent halls.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "fish" [...] {{describes}} any non-tetrapod chordate, (i.e., {{an animal}} with a backbone), that has gills throughout life and has limbs, if any, {{in the shape}} of fins. Unlike groupings such as birds or mammals, fish <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> clade but <b>a</b> paraphyletic collection of taxa, including jawless, cartilaginous and skeletal types.|$|R
5|$|In 1985 Derek Briggs and Whittington {{published}} {{a description of}} Anomalocaris, also from the Burgess Shale. Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström suggested that the two animals were related, as they shared lateral flaps with gills, stalked eyes and other features; and he classified them as primitive arthropods, although he considered that arthropods <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> phylum.|$|R
5|$|The building's name {{is based}} on its {{similarity}} to the cross-section of a strawberry viewed from above. When Strawberry Panic! was initially created, the three schools were arranged in a triangle, with the Strawberry Dorms in the center, and the dormitory <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> building but three separate dormitories also arranged in a triangle around a central courtyard.|$|R
25|$|However, the Chronicle <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{document}} but the {{end result}} of combining several sources over a period of time. The annals for the 5th century in the Chronicle were put into their current form during the 9th century, probably during the reign of Alfred the Great. The sources are obscure for the fifth century annals; however, an analysis of the text demonstrates some poetic conventions, so it is probable that they were derived from an oral tradition such as sagas in the form of epic poems.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} administration, Lagos <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{municipality}} and therefore has no overall city administration. The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprises 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas, which together comprise Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall {{government for the}} metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi and Victoria Island {{as well as some}} mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas (most notably Lagos Island LGA, Lagos Mainland LGA and Eti-Osa LGA).|$|E
25|$|Other animals {{may have}} organs that are {{analogous}} to tongues, {{such as a}} butterfly's proboscis or a radula on a mollusc, {{but these are not}} homologous with the tongues found in vertebrates, and often have little resemblance in function. For example, butterflies do not lick with their proboscides; they suck through them, and the proboscis <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> organ, but two jaws held together to form a tube. Many species of fish have small folds at the base of their mouths that might informally be called tongues, but they lack a muscular structure like the true tongues found in most tetrapods.|$|E
30|$|Mezuk et al. (2012 b) {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} the constructs of depression and frailty based on data from the fourth wave, spanning 2004 – 2005, of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study, by conducting a confirmatory latent class analysis, and suggested that depression and frailty are inter-related concepts but constitute separate symptoms that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> construct.|$|R
50|$|During the Thirty Years War 1618-1648, Aßmannshardt was devastated. Most of the {{inhabitants}} died of war, plague and starvation. The village itself was burnt down. In order to repopulate the village, settlers from the Alps were introduced, mostly from Montafon and Vorarlberg. In 1662, there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> inhabitant who had either been born or {{brought up in the}} village.|$|R
30|$|There <b>is</b> almost <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{category}} {{in which there}} is a chance to win a gold medal.|$|R
