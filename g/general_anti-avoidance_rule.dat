40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the proposition that}} <b>general</b> <b>anti-avoidance</b> <b>rules</b> achieve their purpose better when drafted in broad terms.

40|$|The {{avoidance}} of income tax is {{a practice that}} is common in tax systems across the whole world. As Jensen notes, '[n]othing is certain but death and taxes? Not true. If taxes are certain, then so too are tax avoidance, tax evasion, and governmental efforts to contain the avoidance and evasion'. Being an inevitable concomitant of tax, tax avoidance, if left unchecked, can result in the substantial erosion of tax bases. A common way of controlling tax avoidance is introducing legislation that regulates the limits of permissible tax avoidance and targets impermissible tax avoidance. This legislation {{comes in the form}} of <b>general</b> <b>anti-avoidance</b> <b>rules</b> (GAARs) or specific <b>anti-avoidance</b> <b>rules.</b> The term GAAR means that the rule is broad and is a weapon against all forms of impermissible tax avoidance, which differentiates it from specific <b>anti-avoidance</b> <b>rules,</b> which are only applicable to specific forms of impermissible tax avoidance. In countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom (up until July 2013 when a GAAR was introduced) and the Netherlands (where both a GAAR and judicial doctrines are in place), reliance is placed on judicially created doctrines against impermissible tax avoidance.

40|$|The United Kingdom is {{undergoing}} a significant review of the law relating to tax avoidance. In December 2010, the UK Government appointed Graham Aaronson QC, supported by a Study Group to consider and report on the need for, and possible shape of, a <b>general</b> <b>anti-avoidance</b> <b>rule</b> (GAAR) in the UK.

The analysis therein suggests that these tools may be successful to a degree, but may never cover all possible scenarios. Third chapter elaborates on judicial doctrines and <b>General</b> <b>Anti-Avoidance</b> <b>Rules</b> (GAARs). These tools attempt to address tax avoidance methods not anticipated by legislature.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years, {{the world has}} {{experienced}} exponential growth in international trade and investment, {{as well as the}} number of bilateral tax treaties which now number roughly 3, 000. As the globalization of economic activity has greatly increased opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, so also has the expansion of the international tax treaty network increased opportunities for taxpayers to take advantage of domestic tax rules and bilateral tax treaties by arranging their affairs in ways that reduce taxes otherwise owing or eliminate them altogether. Regarding many of these arrangements as abusive treaty shopping, the OECD and several member jurisdictions have adopted various responses to this phenomenon, involving the interpretation of treaties as the well as the introduction and application of <b>anti-avoidance</b> <b>rules</b> in domestic law and tax treaties. This paper reviews and evaluates these responses to treaty shopping, providing a comparative examination of developments in various jurisdictions. Part II discusses the concept of treaty shopping, defining this term {{for the purposes of this}} analysis, providing a few examples for illustrative purposes, and explaining why treaty shopping is problematic on policy grounds. Part III considers interpretive responses to abusive treaty shopping, examining recent cases and commentary on the concepts of “residence” and “beneficial ownership” as well as the existence of an anti-abuse principle inherent in tax treaties and international law.

40|$|<b>General</b> <b>anti-avoidance</b> <b>rules</b> (GAARs) {{are rules}} in income tax {{legislation}} intended to curtail impermissible tax avoidance. GAARs have another critical function, namely informing taxpayers {{of the limits}} of permissible tax avoidance. A GAAR is therefore an important provision which must be effective. A study of the historical and current experience with GAARs in South Africa, Canada, and Australia, however, shows that the efficacy of GAARs is limited. The GAARs of the countries studied show some similarities but also some fundamental differences. In spite of these differences, certain common factors working against the efficacy of these GAARs can be identified. It is argued that these factors entail the inherent weakness of GAARs, controversial indicators of impermissible tax avoidance, uncertainty, the role of the judiciary, taxpayer aggression, and the limitations of the law as a weapon against impermissible tax avoidance. Admittedly, some of these limiting factors are difficult to overcome. For instance, a precise definition of impermissible tax avoidance has proved elusive and this status quo is likely to persist. Nevertheless, it is argued that these factors need to be acknowledged and addressed in order to create more effective GAARs in future. [URL] La...|$|R

It is argued that, while the SA GAAR {{may serve as}} a deterrent, it is going to have limited efficacy against impermissible tax avoidance due to the uncertainty it creates. It is argued that uncertainty will cause judicial activism to protect permissible tax avoidance, extensive and inconsistent judicial interpretation and confusion amongst taxpayers and SARS as to what constitutes permissible or impermissible tax avoidance. This thesis ends by recommending certain amendments, based on the comparative analysis, to the SA GAAR which can reduce uncertainty and thus improve it efficacy.

40|$|Taxpayer {{certainty}} is {{the most}} frequently cited argument against statutory <b>General</b> <b>Anti-Avoidance</b> <b>Rules</b> (GAARs). However the vast literature criticising statutory GAARs fails to consider the extent of taxpayer uncertainty, {{and the potential for}} taxpayer uncertainty, in jurisdictions without a statutory GAAR. This thesis examines that gap in the literature. The thesis uses inductive reasoning to suggest that there is greater taxpayer certainty where a statutory GAAR exists and is appropriately administered. Specifically, it uses a case study to demonstrate that there is greater uncertainty for taxpayers where the administration, the judiciary and the legislature may use their vast powers to address perceived avoidance. The thesis then considers the form of a statutory GAAR that may best be expected to promote taxpayer certainty. Such analysis involves a comparison of Australia's oldest statutory GAAR, Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (and its predecessor section 260), with the more recent GAARs in Australia's indirect tax legislation (GST and state stamp duty), and the GAARs of other jurisdictions, including New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. In order to promote taxpayer certainty, a uniform statutory GAAR is ultimately proposed for all Australian taxation legislation, with safeguards to ensure the appropriate administration of the uniform GAAR...|$|R
40|$|While the South African and Australian <b>general</b> <b>anti-avoidance</b> <b>rules</b> ('GAARs') {{differ in}} their {{structure}} and design, each is directed towards the same end. Although the South African GAAR was substantially amended in 2006 to address perceived inadequacies, there {{has yet to be}} any judicial consideration of the 'new' provision. While it is a highly prescriptive provision (at least in comparison with its Australian counterpart) considerable uncertainty as to its effectiveness remains, especially as an earlier attempt to remedy many of the same deficiencies in 1996 was spectacularly unsuccessful. Meanwhile, after a slow start, the jurisprudence on the Australian 1981 GAAR continues to gather momentum. Although many of the application and interpretative issues have gradually been resolved, others seem insoluble. In this paper the authors examine these two GAARs with a view to identifying if any lessons for their application and interpretation can be gathered from each other. The authors argue that, notwithstanding design differences, there are some remarkably similar issues to be resolved. Some of the Australian case law may therefore be instructive as to the approach that could be adopted in South Africa, while some of the prescriptions in the South African legislation could be of value in assisting the Australian judiciary to direct their attention to relevant considerations or, possibly more likely, could form the basis for further legislative prescriptions in the Australian GAAR...|$|R
40|$|What is Justice?" is a {{compilation}} of essays by Hans Kelsen that deal with problems of justice {{and their relationship to}} law, philosophy, and science. The broad scope and applicability of "What is Justice?" makes it a valuable source for research and writing across jurisdictions and in almost any area of law. Access to the English translation of "What is Justice?" is challenging because the book has no index. This present Index aims to provide scholars with a way in to Kelsen's work. Kelsen's tightly packed generalisations and conceptual arguments, which are intended to apply generally to all laws and legal systems, are not accessible to all readers. The Index attempts to present Kelsen's theories in a manner that enables readers to apply them to any area of law and {{to take full advantage of}} Kelsen's wisdom. The authors call their work an "index" because it most closely resembles that literary form. However, the work and its companion, "A Diachronic Index and Glossary to [Kelsen's] Pure Theory of Law?" attempt much more.
