5|$|Josephine {{grew up in}} a well-to-do and {{politically}} connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a bannister. The death was a turning point for Josephine, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Josephine also formed the <b>International</b> <b>Abolitionist</b> <b>Federation,</b> a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.|$|E

50|$|In the Napoleonic era, France {{became the}} model for the {{regulatory}} approach to prostitution. In the 20th century, however, a policy shift became apparent. Brothels became illegal in 1946, and France signed the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others in 1960. France thus became a major supporter of the <b>international</b> <b>abolitionist</b> movement for the eradication of prostitution (see #Abolitionism in France).|$|R

50|$|The English feminist Josephine Butler (1828-1906), {{who came}} from a family {{involved}} in the abolition of slavery, believed that forced vaginal examination of women suspected of prostitution violated their basic legal rights. She argued that women lacked sexual autonomy because they were excluded from higher education, professional training, and paid employment and therefore {{had to choose between}} marriage or prostitution. Either way, their condition was no different from that of a slave. Butler published many articles on the subject.She toured Europe in 1874 and 1875 to raise support for an <b>international</b> <b>abolitionist</b> movement.In Italy she was able to talk with Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi.|$|R

In 1915 the branch merged with the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts to form the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene (AMSH).The <b>international</b> <b>abolitionist</b> Alison Neilans (1884-1942) was the AMSH general secretary in the 1920s.The AMSH {{was a member of the}} IAF.|$|R
40|$|Starting on January 1, 2007, the Supreme People's Court {{has been}} charged with {{reviewing}} every death sentence pronounced by lower courts in the People's Republic of China. This reform, together with provisions instituted in January 2007 that address death penalty review, are dramatic moves to strengthen procedural justice in death penalty cases. There are indications that these reforms have significantly decreased the execution rate in China. The reforms are not a move toward the Chinese government's abolition of capital punishment, however. Nor are they a response to <b>international</b> <b>abolitionist</b> pressure. Rather, they reflect the current "legalization" agenda of the central government, maintaining the instrumentalist link between overarching state policy and death penalty application. This "legalization" agenda will not necessarily prompt further limitations to death penalty practice. Instead, if overall policy settings change, {{it is possible that the}} government may again privilege "campaign justice" over "procedural justice" and wind back the reforms...|$|R

50|$|During the 19th century, sexual morals became stricter, and {{a counter}} {{movement}} arose against regulated prostitution. In the beginning, this movement consisted of wealthy orthodox-Protestant Christians, but it later got support from other movements like Catholics, socialists, feminists and progressive liberals. They attacked {{the idea that}} men could not abstain from sex. Clients were viewed as low, dirty lechers, and the clients were not the young unmarried men prostitution was meant for, but were often well-off middle-aged married men. They also attacked the mandatory medical examinations, which were deemed degrading and ineffective {{to stop the spread}} of venereal diseases. Many prostitutes lived in the brothels and were bound to the madams by debts to pay off expensive working clothes. Prostitutes were often sold among madams, were subjected to fines, and could only leave the brothel under supervision. Medical expenses were added to their debt. Brothel keepers throughout Europe sold women among each other. The abolitionist movement in the Netherlands was largely connected to the <b>international</b> <b>abolitionist</b> movement. The movement slowly gained more influence, and during the last decades of the nineteenth century city governments slowly started to abolish regulated prostitution. At first, the abolitionist movement mainly targeted mandatory health checks for prostitutes, but when the movement became more successful the focus shifted towards the people who profited from prostitution. In 1911 living on the avails of prostitution and owning a brothel were prohibited by law. Prostitution itself was not prohibited.|$|R
5000|$|<b>International</b> {{death penalty}} <b>abolitionist</b> norms and trends have shaped Chinese death penalty {{practices}} significantly in recent years. Through international interventions and policies, like the European Union-led {{campaign against the}} death penalty in China since the mid-2000s, there has been an increased exchange of anti-death penalty knowledge and ideologies, dissemination of original information, and legislation geared towards scaling down the wide application of the death penalty.|$|R
40|$|The {{schooner}} Amistad’s unconvincing {{journey from}} the Spanish port of Havana, Cuba, with its cargo of 53 Africans destined for slavery in the sugar plantation of the Caribbean, form {{one of the most}} significant stories of the nineteenth century. When a violent mutiny of the slaves happened, the Africans ordered two Spanish sailors to navigate the ship toward Africa, but they, on the contrary, subverted the route and turned Amistad toward North America. The Federal Historical Records of the Amistad Case illuminate the complex position of the U. S. government regarding slavery and the <b>international</b> slave trade. <b>Abolitionists</b> recognized that the Amistad affair had the power to cause an emotional debate about slavery in the United States. It sparked a series of diplomatic manoeuvres by the Van Buren Administration, prompting the former President John Quincy Adams to go before the Supreme Court and souring diplomatic relations between the United States and Spain...|$|R

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, China {{has become}} one of the major {{countries}} from which children are adopted overseas. This paper examines ways in which globalization has contributed to the development of international adoption from China and explores cultural and historical attitudes to population growth, child abandonment and adoption. How China's social, economic and welfare policies have affected adoption policies and practices are discussed, with reference to ethnographic fieldwork undertaken by the authors between 2001 and 2007. Interviews and group discussions were conducted with UK, Chinese and American adoptive parents, directors of social welfare institutes, Chinese welfare officials and staff of non-government organizations working in the area of adoption and fostering in China. While globalization has affected, and continues to affect inter-country adoption, its influence in China is analysed using Masson's value positions on <b>international</b> adoption – <b>abolitionists,</b> promoters and pragmatists. China's pragmatic approach to international adoption is considered in relation to policies that reflect the best interests of children in China and overseas...|$|R
40|$|As we {{approach}} the fifteenth anniversary of the United Nations Trafficking Protocol, we can discern several phases of its diffusion, materialisation and interpretation in domestic criminal law regimes across the world. Although not exclusively preoccupied with sex work and sex trafficking anymore, {{the fact remains that}} the inordinate attention on trafficking in Western industrialised economies is disproportionate to the extent of the problem. Only 7 % of the world’s 20. 9 million forced labourers are in developed economies while 56 % are in Asia Pacific. Yet in BRIC countries like India, with a substantial majority of the world’s trafficked victims and where 90 % of all trafficking is domestic, trafficking has gained policy resonance only relatively recently. Even as India remains an active site for sexual humanitarianism with <b>international</b> and local <b>abolitionist</b> groups actively targeting sex workers, the article argues that less developed countries like India can {{play a crucial role in}} reorienting international anti-trafficking law and policy. Towards that goal, this article offers India’s bonded, contract and migrant labour laws as a robust labour law model against trafficking in contrast to the criminal justice model propagated by the Trafficking Protocol worldwide...|$|R
