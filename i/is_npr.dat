40|$|AbstractTranscriptional {{reprogramming}} {{is critical}} for plant disease resistance responses; its global control is not well understood. Salicylic acid (SA) can induce plant defense gene expression and a long-lasting disease resistance state called systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Plant-specific “Whirly” DNA binding proteins were previously implicated in defense gene regulation. We demonstrate that the potato StWhy 1 protein is a transcriptional activator of genes containing the PBF 2 binding PB promoter element. DNA binding activity of AtWhy 1, the Arabidopsis StWhy 1 ortholog, is induced by SA and is required for both SA-dependent disease resistance and SA-induced expression of an SAR response gene. AtWhy 1 is required for both full basal and specific disease resistance responses. The transcription factor-associated protein NPR 1 is also required for SAR. Surprisingly, AtWhy 1 activation by SA <b>is</b> <b>NPR</b> 1 independent, suggesting that AtWhy 1 {{works in conjunction with}} NPR 1 to transduce the SA signal. Our analysis of AtWhy 1 adds a critical component to the SA-dependent plant disease resistance response...|$|E
40|$|Cross talk between {{salicylic}} acid (SA) – and jasmonic acid (JA) –dependent defense signaling {{has been well}} documented in plants, but how this cross talk is executed and the components involved remain to be elucidated. We demonstrate that the plant-specific transcription factor WRKY 70 is a common component in SA- and JA-mediated signal pathways. Expression of WRKY 70 is activated by SA and repressed by JA. The early induction of WRKY 70 by SA <b>is</b> <b>NPR</b> 1 -independent, but functional NPR 1 is required for full-scale induction. Epistasis analysis suggested that WRKY 70 is downstream of NPR 1 in an SA-dependent signal pathway. Modulation of WRKY 70 transcript levels by constitutive overexpression increases resistance to virulent pathogens and results in constitutive expression of SA-induced pathogenesis-related genes. Conversely, antisense suppression of WRKY 70 activates JA-responsive/COI 1 -dependent genes. The effect of WRKY 70 is not caused by subsequent changes in SA or JA levels. We suggest that WRKY 70 acts as an activator of SA-induced genes and a repressor of JA-responsive genes, integrating signals from these mutually antagonistic pathways...|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{acquired}} resistance (SAR) is an inducible defense {{response that}} protects plants against {{a broad spectrum}} of pathogens. A central regulator of SAR in Arabidopsis <b>is</b> <b>NPR</b> 1 (nonexpresser of pathogenesis-related genes). In rice, overexpression of Arabidopsis NPR 1 enhances plant resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. This report demonstrates that overexpression of (At) NPR 1 in rice also triggers a lesion-mimic/cell death (LMD) phenotype. The LMD phenotype is environmentally regulated and heritable. In addition, the development of lesions and death correlates with the expression of rice defense genes and the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Application of the salicylic acid (SA) analog, benzo(1, 2, 3) thiadiazole- 7 -carbothioc acid S-methyl ester (BTH), potentiates this phenotype Endogenous SA levels are reduced in rice overexpressing (At) NPR 1 when compared with wildtype plants, supporting the idea that (At) NPR 1 may perceive and modulate the accumulation of SA. The association of (At) NPR 1 expression in rice with the development of an LMD phenotype suggests that (At) NPR 1 has multiple roles in plant stress responses that may affect its efficacy as a transgenic tool for engineering broad-spectrum resistance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Local {{infection}} with necrotizing pathogens induces whole plant immunity to secondary challenge. Pathogenesis-related genes are induced {{in parallel with}} this systemic acquired resistance response and thought to be co-regulated. The hypothesis of co-regulation has been challenged by induction of Arabidopsis PR- 1 but not systemic acquired resistance in npr 1 mutant plants responding to Pseudomonas syringae carrying the avirulence gene avrRpt 2. However, experiments with ndr 1 mutant plants have revealed major differences between avirulence genes. The ndr 1 - 1 mutation prevents hypersensitive cell death, systemic acquired resistance and PR- 1 induction elicited by bacteria carrying avrRpt 2. This mutation does not prevent these responses to bacteria carrying avrB. Results Systemic acquired resistance, PR- 1 induction and PR- 5 induction were assessed in comparisons of npr 1 - 2 and ndr 1 - 1 mutant plants, double mutant plants, and wild-type plants. Systemic acquired resistance was displayed by all four plant lines in response to Pseudomonas syringae bacteria carrying avrB. PR- 1 induction was partially impaired by either single mutation in response to either bacterial strain, but only fully impaired in the double mutant in response to avrRpt 2. PR- 5 induction was not fully impaired {{in any of the}} mutants in response to either avirulence gene. Conclusion Two pathways act additively, rather than in an obligatorily synergistic fashion, to induce systemic acquired resistance, PR- 1 and PR- 5. One of these pathways <b>is</b> <b>NPR</b> 1 -independent and depends on signals associated with hypersensitive cell death. The other pathway is dependent on salicylic acid accumulation and acts through NPR 1. At least two other pathways also contribute additively to PR- 5 induction. </p...|$|E
40|$|Peroxisomes are {{subcellular}} organelles, traditionally {{known to}} be involved in processes like photorespiration, fatty acid β-oxidation, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Proteome analysis of plant peroxisomes and targeting signal prediction methods are important tools to identify novel peroxisomal proteins. In the present study the accuracy of newly developed methods to predict peroxisome targeting signals type 1 (PTS 1) in plant proteins was investigated by in vivo subcellular targeting analyses. Upon application of these prediction methods to the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, 392 gene models were predicted to possess functional PTS 1 domains, several proteins of which were validated as peroxisomal and numerous novel PTS 1 tripeptides were identified. Furthermore, several detoxification-related enzymes and defense-related Arabidopsis proteins were detected by proteome analyses and PTS 1 prediction methods that were potentially targeted to peroxisomes. Two enzymes of the ascorbate-glutathione (ASC-GSH) cycle, glutathione reductase 1 (GR 1) and dehydroascorbate reductase 1 (DHAR 1), and five glutathione-S transferases (GSTs) had been detected by proteome analysis in leaf peroxisomes. In vivo subcellular localization targeting analyses of the present study verified peroxisomal targeting for GR 1 and the protein was found to carry a functional novel PTS 1 (TNL>). By contrast, the four GSTs remained cytosolic in the chosen orientation {{in the back of the}} reporter protein. New fragmented evidence has been emerging in the literature for an important role of plant peroxisomes in innate immunity. In the present study sixteen defense-related Arabidopsis proteins were experimentally investigated for protein targeting to peroxisomes by in vivo subcellular localization. The proteins of interest included several yet unknown homologs of Arabidopsis NDR 1 and tobacco HIN 1, the so-called NDR 1 /HIN 1 like (NHL) proteins. In vivo subcellular localization was primarily investigated for three NHL family members (NHL 4, NHL 6 and NHL 25). Peroxisome targeting was verified for NHL 4 with strong indications also for NHL 6 and NHL 25 in being located in peroxisomes. AtIAN 12 is a homolog of AIG 1 /AtIAN 8 and had been identified by Arabidopsis leaf peroxisome proteomics. In vivo subcellular localization experiments demonstrated that AtIAN 12 protein is targeted to peroxisomes and indicated that the targeting pathway involves posttranslational protein modification by isoprenylation. Taken together, the data indicate for the first time that one NDR 1 /HIN 1 homolog (NHL 4) and AtIAN homolog (AtIAN 12) are peroxisome associated. Preliminary gene expression analyses indicated that three NHL genes and three AtIAN genes are induced by a bacterial pathogen (Pst DC 3000), while NHL 6, NHL 25, and AtIAN 8 are induced by an avirulent Pst DC 3000 strain (carrying the effector avrRpt 2). Out of the six NHL and AtIAN genes, only NHL 6 appeared to be induced in wt Col- 0 plants by the bacterial elicitor (flg 22), but remained unaffected in Arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation in the flagellin receptor gene FLS 2. The data suggested that NHL 6 is involved in basal PAMP triggered immunity (PTI). Furthermore, NHL 6 transcripts accumulated similarily in both wt plants and npr 1 mutant plants after flg 22 treatment, which indicates that NHL 6 induction <b>is</b> <b>NPR</b> 1 -independent. Functional studies were initiated through the isolation of homozygous mutants, amiRNA lines and overexpresser lines for selected NHL and AtIAN genes. In homozygous mutants (three nhl mutants and ian 11), differences in bacterial proliferation were observed compared to wt plants upon infection with the avirulent bacterium Pst DC 3000 (avrRpt 2). Overall, the identification of several defense-related proteins in peroxisomes together with preliminary functional data on NHL proteins opens new perspectives to important, multi-layered peroxisome functions in plant innate immunity...|$|E
