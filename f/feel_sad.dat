5|$|Ending A: The group {{arrive in}} the Promised Land and Legna prepares to enact the prophecy, but Nowe instead chooses {{to find a new}} Goddess. Legna calls the Holy Dragons to battle, but Seere leads an army of Golems against them. With {{everything}} seeming lost, Manah and Nowe share a final kiss, which triggers Nowe's transformation into the New Breed. Nowe and Legna do battle, and Legna is killed. Eris then reveals that she is to become the new Goddess. Eris is initiated, and although the world is restored, Nowe and Manah <b>feel</b> <b>sad</b> that no other solution could be found.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that during the hunt only {{those people who have}} been {{selected}} by the spirit of the sea could kill the whale. The hunter has to please the killed whale: it must be treated as a guest. Just like a polite host does not leave a recently arrived dear guest alone, thus similarly, the killed whale should not be left alone by the host (i.e. by the hunter who has killed it). Like a guest, it should not get hurt or <b>feel</b> <b>sad.</b> It must be entertained (e.g. by drum music, good foods). On the next whale migration (whales migrate twice a year, in spring to the north and in the autumn back), the previously killed whale is sent off back to the sea {{in the course of a}} farewell ritual. If the killed whale was pleased to (during its being a guest for a half year), then it can be hoped that it will return later, too: thus, also the future whale hunts will succeed.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for the documentary Comedy Connections, Renwick says that killing off the protagonist [...] "seemed {{to be the most}} natural and logical and appropriate end for the character in a show where we had tried to reflect the truthfulness of real life." [...] Victor's demise had been announced in the press in the summer preceding the broadcast. In {{an interview}} with The Sun, Wilson said [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>sad,</b> of course, but it's the right time. To keep doing it would have got dull".|$|E

500|$|Bathurst and Thomas express {{contrasting}} {{views on}} the significance of Stroma's abandonment. Thomas regards it as a tragedy: [...] "Of all the out-of-the-way places I have known, this was the saddest. It seemed as though its life had been ended {{in a fit of}} pique." [...] To Bathurst, however, [...] "it is tempting to see Stroma's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure, a collective death... But Stroma does not <b>feel</b> <b>sad.</b> True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or wondering how many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot. But that isn't the whole story. What is interesting about Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment, but the tale of its past." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{account in}} this series is [...] "Ivan Turbincă", whose protagonist, a Russian serviceman, is shown rebelling against Heaven and Hell, and {{ultimately}} accomplishing the human ideal of cheating Death. The plot retells a theme present in both Romanian tradition and Ukrainian folklore, while, according to researcher of children's literature Muguraș Constantinescu, the main character is similar to German tradition's Till Eulenspiegel. In {{the beginning of the}} account, God rewards the soldier's exemplary charity by granting him a pouch (turbincă), which can miraculously trap anything in existence. In order to circumvent the laws of nature, Ivan subsequently makes use of both his magical item and his innate shrewdness. In one such episode, pretending not to understand the proper position of bodies inside a coffin, he tricks impatient Death into taking his place, and traps her inside. Eventually, he is allowed to keep his life, but is promised an eternity of old age, which he ingeniously counterbalances by attending an endless succession of wedding parties, and therefore never having to <b>feel</b> <b>sad.</b>|$|E
500|$|Receiving empathically, in NVC, {{involves}} [...] "connection with what's {{alive in}} the other person and what would make life wonderful for them... It's not {{an understanding of the}} head where we just mentally understand what another person says... Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that's {{alive in the}}m... It doesn't mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we <b>feel</b> <b>sad</b> that another person is upset. It doesn't mean we have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you're mentally trying to understand the other person, you're not present with them." [...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, enjoyed the episode, commenting: [...] "A case perhaps of life {{reflecting}} art as guest star Helen Hunt is now married to Hank Azaria, who is, of course, Moe, which is rather nice as you can't help but <b>feel</b> <b>sad</b> that, {{by the end of}} this rather clever and charming episode, Moe has been unlucky in love once more." [...] In a 2006 article in USA Today, [...] "Dumbbell Indemnity" [...] was highlighted among the six best episodes of The Simpsons season 9, along with [...] "Trash of the Titans", [...] "The Last Temptation of Krust", [...] "The Cartridge Family", [...] "The Joy of Sect", and [...] "Das Bus". IGN ranked Hail to the Chimp, the film Homer goes to see in the episode, as the seventh best fictional film within another work. Show runner Mike Scully greatly enjoyed the scene where Homer attempts to escape Moe's car when it is going down the cliff, and has said that it is one of his favorite scenes from the show.|$|E
500|$|In New York City, Bella Abzug, who had {{introduced}} the first gay {{civil rights bill}} in U.S. Congress in 1974, was awoken at 2 am by {{people in the street}} chanting her name. [...] "It was hard not to <b>feel</b> <b>sad</b> for this crowd", Abzug said of the several hundred people below her window. She was optimistic, telling them the defeat would develop a maturity and determination in gay activism. About the same time that evening, about 3,000 gay men and lesbians spontaneously gathered in what had become the largest gay neighborhood in the United States—Castro Street in San Francisco—furious at the loss in Dade County. The crowd marched around the Castro District, chanting [...] "We Are Your Children!" [...] pulling people out of gay bars to cheers. Local gay activist and future supervisor Harvey Milk led marchers through a [...] course through the city, careful not to stop for too long lest rioting began. He addressed the crowd with a bullhorn: [...] "This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force". The day after the vote, Jean O'Leary and NGTF co-director Bruce Voeller said Bryant was doing [...] "an enormous favor" [...] for the gay community by focusing national media attention on discrimination against them.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that we feel like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t <b>feel</b> <b>sad,</b> then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{sociologist}} Arlie Hochschild {{provides the}} first definition of emotional labor, {{which is a}} form of emotion regulation that creates a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace. The related term emotion work (also called [...] "emotion management") refers to [...] "these same acts done in a private context", such as within the private sphere of one's home or interactions with family and friends. Hochschild identified three emotion regulation strategies: cognitive, bodily, and expressive. Within cognitive emotion work, one attempts to change images, ideas, or thoughts in hopes of changing the feelings associated with them. For example, one may associate a family picture with feeling happy and think about said picture whenever attempting to feel happy. Within bodily emotion work, one attempts to change physical symptoms {{in order to create a}} desired emotion. For example, one may attempt deep breathing in order to reduce anger. Within expressive emotion work, one attempts to change expressive gestures to change inner feelings. For example, one may attempt to smile when trying to feel happy. One becomes aware of emotion work most often when one's feelings do not fit the situation. For instance, when one does not <b>feel</b> <b>sad</b> at a funeral, one becomes acutely aware of the feelings appropriate for that situation.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{original}} album's lukewarm sales and reception, Rowland re-entered recording studios to collect new songs for a reissue of Ms. Kelly, including production by Stargate, Jeff Dawson, CKB and Mark Feist. She was {{also expected to}} record with producer Danja, but deadline pressure prevented from happening; a new track by J. R. Rotem {{did not make the}} final cut. [...] "The sales weren't as good as I wanted them to be and to be honest, I did <b>feel</b> <b>sad</b> about that for a little while", Rowland stated in 2008, still blaming the final track listing for too many midtempos and ballads. [...] "I didn't realize it while I was recording it. After it was released [...] many fans said the songs would rock if they were more upbeat." [...] Branded with the title Ms. Kelly: Diva Deluxe, the United States re-release received a digital download release only on March 25, 2008, containing seven tracks — five new songs and two remixes of songs found from the standard edition of the album. The international edition of the Ms. Kelly re-release was released physically and digitally in May 2008, retitled as Ms. Kelly: Deluxe Edition. It removed eight tracks from {{the original}} release and replaced them with six of the seven Diva Deluxe tracks, as Rowland [...] "wanted to have another view on the record and close the Ms. Kelly chapter" [...] with the re-release. Previously unreleased song [...] "Daylight", a Bobby Womack cover and collaboration with Travie McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, served as the reissue's new lead single.|$|E
