5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
25|$|The {{forest of}} Conche in Normandy {{was my first}} {{experience}} of painting with the Forestry. Then came {{the area of the}} forest of Dreux, one of the finest in France, taking up fifteen square miles of ground... Each company had a hundred and twenty horses, all half-bred Percheron types, mostly blacks and greys. A rivalry existed between the companies as to which had the best-conditioned teams. <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> pictures of these teams at work, pictures of men axing, sawing down trees...|$|E
25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E

500|$|McCartney became {{interested}} in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol and David Bowie. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, England. In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted {{in his hometown of}} Liverpool. McCartney said, [...] "I've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet". McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys.|$|E
500|$|In May 1945, the Allied forces {{questioned}} {{banker and}} art dealer Alois Miedl regarding the newly discovered Vermeer. Based on Miedl's confession, {{the painting was}} traced back to van Meegeren. On 29 May 1945, {{he was arrested and}} charged with fraud and aiding and abetting the enemy. He was remanded to Weteringschans prison as an alleged Nazi collaborator and plunderer of Dutch cultural property, threatened by the authorities with the death penalty. He labored over his predicament, but eventually confessed to forging paintings attributed to Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch. He exclaimed, [...] "The painting in Göring’s hands is not, as you assume, a Vermeer of Delft, but a Van Meegeren! <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> the picture!" [...] It took some time to verify this and he was detained for several months in the Headquarters of the Military Command at Herengracht 468 in Amsterdam. He painted his last forgery between July and December 1945 in the presence of reporters and court-appointed witnesses: Jesus among the Doctors, also called Young Christ in the Temple in the style of Vermeer. After the trial painting was finished, he was transferred to the fortress prison Blauwkapel. Van Meegeren was released from prison in January or February 1946.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Paris {{friends and}} acquaintances sent {{bouquets}} of flowers weekly for his still life paintings. He also purchased bouquets inexpensively, choosing a variety of flowers and colors for his paintings. [...] In {{a letter to his}} sister Wil he said, [...] "Last year <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> almost nothing but flowers so I could get used to colors other than grey - pink, soft or bright green, light blue, violet, yellow, glorious red." [...] That was an exaggeration, as during his time in Paris he painted 230 paintings, about 30 of which were flowers. Yet, the comment demonstrates his interest in painting flowers as a subject and to further develop his appreciation and understanding of color.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the mixed}} {{response}} to Pinkerton, Weezer {{went on a}} five-year hiatus. Cuomo enrolled at Harvard twice more and completed semesters in 1997 and 2004. During the 1997 semester, he played with a new band, Homie, in Boston. In February 1998, Cuomo disbanded Homie and moved to Los Angeles to work on new Weezer demos with Bell and Wilson, but the sessions were unproductive. In 1998 and 1999, he lived in an apartment under a freeway in Culver City, California. In an essay for Harvard, he wrote: [...] "I {{became more and more}} isolated. I unplugged my phone. <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> the walls and ceiling of my bedroom black and covered the windows with fiberglass insulation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flying aces such as Georg von Hantelmann painted their fighters {{with two}} goals: to display unit colors, {{and to show}} {{personal}} flair. Factory-applied lozenge camouflage was not seen as important. Hantelmann's Albatros D.V was decorated with a prominent death's head in white against the dark blue fuselage and red nose which indicated his unit, Jasta 15. Only the wings and rudder of his Albatros were laid with lozenge camouflage. Similarly, Ernst Udet, the second-highest scoring ace of World War <b>I,</b> <b>painted</b> his Fokker D.VII bright red with bold white stripes and large white lettering on the rudder reading [...] "Du doch nicht!!" [...] ("Definitely not you!!") His aircraft ineffectively retained its lozenge camouflage on the upper surface of the lower wing.|$|E

2500|$|Basket of Apples (F99) {{was made}} in 1885 when Van Gogh experimented with Delacroix's color theory. [...] To his brother Theo, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "There is a certain pure bright red for the apples, then some greenish things. [...] Now there are one or two apples in another color, {{in a kind of}} pink — to improve the whole. [...] The pink is the broken color, created by mixing the first red and green mentioned. [...] This is why there is a {{connection}} between the colors. [...] Then <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> a second contrast, in the back- and foreground. [...] One was given a neutral color by [...] "breaking" [...] blue with orange; the other the same neutral color, only this time changed by adding a little yellow." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1888, {{newly married}} and having moved to Manhattan [...] from her parents' home, Cotton sought {{to become a}} student of William Merritt Chase. He agreed to teach her {{and at the same}} time asked whether she would sit for a portrait. In 1908 Chase {{described}} the meeting: [...] "One morning a young lady came into my Tenth street studio, just as I was leaving for an art class in Brooklyn. She came as a pupil, but the moment she appeared before me I saw her only as a splendid model. Half way to the elevated station I stopped, hastened back, and overtook her. She consented to sit for me; and <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> that day, without an interruption, till late in the evening. The result is the Lady in Black, now hung in the Metropolitan Museum." [...] In 1889 a second Chase portrait of her, [...] "Lady in Pink," [...] was shown at the Spring Exhibition at the National Academy of Design in New York.|$|E
2500|$|The cover art {{painting}} {{is by the}} British artist Nic Dartnell. Although {{it has been said}} to be originally intended for the American group Spirit, and that the bald-headed man on the left of the cover is Spirit's drummer, Ed Cassidy, the artist denied this in an interview with Mike Goldstein of RockPoP: [...] "I'd like to take a moment and dispel a rumor that, according to Wikipedia, the image is somehow linked to the LA band Spirit. The fact is that, at the time <b>I</b> <b>painted</b> the ELP [...] "Bird", I also painted a portrait of Spirit which I sent to them in LA. A very similar bird was featured in the corner of that painting. I got a message from Spirit to say that if they had received their painting in time they would have put it on the back of Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus. I became friendly with Randy California over the years and I took the photograph that is on his 1982 12" [...] EP All Along the Watchtower. The bald image in [...] "Bird" [...] has no connection to Ed Cassidy of Spirit and doesn't look anything like him. Ed still has the Spirit portrait – so I'm told." ...|$|E
