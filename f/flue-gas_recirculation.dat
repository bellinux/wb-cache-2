Jupiter’s system uses pure oxygen as the combustion agent, excluding air and thus nitrogen, concentrating CO 2 and pollutants for efficient capture with near zero NOx production, reducing exhaust mass flow, and increasing radiant heat transfer. <b>Flue-gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> rates can be varied to add flexibility to new boiler designs using this technology.

40|$|Under {{carefully}} controlled conditions {{it has been}} shown possible to account for more than 90 percent of the input sulphur when Gas-coyne lignite was burned in a pilot-scale boiler. Under field conditions rigorous sampling techniques will therefore allow determination of the extent of sulphur neutralization from measurements of the sul-phur input and the gas-phase sulphur oxides. The experiments also confirm the applicability (for lignites) of predictions based on ash analysis. Sulphur neutralization with Utility lignite was unaffected by the use of external <b>flue-gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> as a nitric oxide control measure; the control technique produced unacceptable thermal penalties due to carbon carry-over when used in conjunction with low excess-ai...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been given to the development of low-NOx combustion technology for DME (Dimethyl Ether). The present paper describes the R&D study for water-tube boiler carried out in Kansai University and Hirakawa Guidam Co., Ltd. under the support of DME project from METI. The major problem in DME use is the difficulty in the application of premixed flame due to its low ignition temperature and rather high burning velocity. However, the previously developed tube-nested combustor, i. e. water-tubes installed in the empty furnace, becomes effective means together with the <b>flue-gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> to overcome such difficulty in achieving low-NOx combustion. This paper begins with a brief review of the R&D study of the tube-nested combustor specifically designed for city gas. Then the further development for DME-fired water-tube boiler is described...|$|E
40|$|The {{conditions}} for CO 2 reduction in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) oxy-boiler are studied, that is, operation with pure oxygen, diluted by recirculated flue gases to moderate the combustion process. Two cases are analyzed: the ready-to-convert case, a normal air-fired CFB boiler, only slightly modified {{to be operated}} with oxygen instead of air for CO 2 capture, and a more general option, an entirely new design, employing high oxygen concentration in the input to the oxy-fuel CFB boiler. It is found that at a given fuel load, the relevant parameters for maintaining the CFB performance (bed temperature and fluidization velocity) in the ready-to-convert case cannot be kept entirely equal {{to those in the}} air-fired case, and some compromise has to be found. The new-design case results in a smaller boiler than that of the comparable air-fired case, depending on the oxygen concentration and the corresponding <b>flue-gas</b> <b>recirculation.</b> This case is expected to contribute favorably to reduction of the cost of CO 2 removal...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} {{regulations on}} pollutant emission are {{the driving force}} for designers of natural-gas-fired combustion systems {{to find ways of}} controlling NOx formation. To achieve significant emissions reduction, more insight is needed into the mechanisms of NO formation. Martijn van Essen’s thesis provides insight into the effects of two NOx control strategies, <b>flue-gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> (FGR) and burner stabilization, on NO formation. Since many combustion systems operate under fuel-rich (oxygen deficient) conditions, the focus of the thesis was on fuel-rich premixed methane-air flames. The experiments were performed at reduced pressures, to facilitate the measurements of the distributions of temperature and concentrations of key species (CH, OH and NO) using the optical technique laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Towards this end, a low-pressure flame cell was constructed, and protocols for quantifying the LIF measurements were implemented. The experimental results were compared with detailed calculations based on a chemical mechanism widely used in combustion. The experimental results demonstrate that both burner stabilization and FGR are promising techniques for lowering NO emissions in fuel-rich flames. A comparison with detailed calculations allowed tracing the mechanistic origins of the observed reduction in NO formation rate. However, due to the existence of multiple formation mechanisms, more research is needed in order to improve predictive power of the flame models, particularly under very rich conditions. The quantitative results in this thesis are ideally suited for improving these model...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flue-gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> (FGR) is a {{well-known}} method used to control oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}) in industrial burner applications. Recent small- and large-scale experiments in natural-gas fired boilers have shown that introducing the recirculated flue gases with the fuel results in a much greater reduction in NO{sub x}, per unit mass of gas recirculated, in comparison to introducing the flue gases with the combustion air. That fuel injection recirculation (FIR) {{is more effective than}} windbox FGR is quite remarkable. At present, however, there is no definitive understanding of why FIR is more effective than conventional FGR. The objective of the present investigation is to ascertain whether or not chemical and/or molecular transport effects alone can explain the differences in NO{sub x} reduction observed between FIR and FGR by studying laminar diffusion flames. The purpose of studying laminar flames is to isolate chemical effects from the effects of turbulent mixing and heat transfer, which are inherent in practical boilers. The results of both the numerical simulations and the experiments suggest that, although molecular transport and chemical kinetic phenomena are affected by the location of diluent addition depending on flow conditions, the greater effectiveness of FIR over FGR in practical applications may result from differences in turbulent mixing and heat transfer. Further research is required to understand how differences in diluent-addition location affect NO{sub x} production in turbulent flames. The present study, however, provides an underlying basis for understanding how flow conditions can affect flame chemistry. 51 figs., 7 tabs...|$|E
40|$|Premixed gas flames in {{mixtures}} of CH 4, O 2, N 2 and CO 2 were studied numerically using detailed chemical and radiative emission-absorption models {{to establish the}} conditions for which radiatively-induced extinction limits may exist independent of the system dimensions. It was found that reabsorption of emitted radiation led to substantially higher burning velocities and wider extinction limits than calculations using optically-thin radiation models, particularly when CO 2, a strong absorber, {{is present in the}} unburned gas. Two heat loss mechanisms that lead to flammability limits even with reabsorption were identified. One is that for dry hydrocarbon-air mixtures, because of the differences in the absorption spectra of H 2 O and CO 2, most of the radiation from product H 2 O that is emitted in the upstream direction cannot be absorbed by the reactants. The second is that the emission spectrum of CO 2 is broader at flame temperatures than ambient temperature, thus some radiation emitted near the flame front cannot be absorbed by the reactants even when they are seeded with CO 2. Via both mechanisms some net upstream heat loss due to radiation will always occur, leading to extinction of sufficiently weak mixtures. Downstream loss has practically no influence. Comparison to experiment demonstrates the importance of reabsorption in CO 2 -diluted mixtures. It is concluded that fundamental flammability limits can exist due to radiative heat loss, but these limits are strongly dependent on the emission-absorption spectra of the reactant and product gases and their temperature dependence, and cannot be predicted using gray-gas or optically-thin model parameters. Applications to practical flames at high pressure, in large combustion chambers and with exhaust-gas or <b>flue-gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flue-gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> (FGR) is a {{well-known}} method used to control oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}) in industrial burner applications. Recent small- and large-scale experiments by Carnot (Tustin, CA) have shown that introducing the recirculated flue gases with the fuel results in a much greater reduction in NO{sub x}, per unit mass of gas recirculated, in comparison to introducing the flue gases with the combustion air. That fuel injection recirculation (FIR) {{is more effective than}} windbox FGR is quite remarkable. At present, however, there is no definitive understanding of why FIR is more effective than conventional FGR. One speculation is that introducing the diluent gases on the fuel side of the flame affects the prompt-NO mechanism causing the greater effectiveness. The objective of our research is to ascertain whether or not chemical and/or molecular transport effects alone can explain the differences in NO{sub x} reduction observed between FIR and FGR. This knowledge will aid in the rational application and optimization of FIR {{in a wide variety of}} industrial applications. A combined modeling and experimental program is in progress to achieve the research objectives. This report discusses computer modeling studies of counterflow diffusion flames employing detailed chemical kinetics for fuel (hydrogen or methane) combustion and NO{sub x} formation. These simulations allow the calculation of NO{sub x} emission indices for a wide range of conditions. Parametric studies were conducted in which the diluent was added either on the fuel or air side of the flame for a wide range of flow conditions. Preliminary results from these simulation studies indicate that a major factor in FIR effectiveness is the differential effect on flame zone residence times associated with fuel-side versus air-side dilution...|$|E

The purpose of studying laminar flames is to isolate chemical effects from the effects of turbulent mixing and heat transfer, which are inherent in practical boilers. Numerical simulations of H{sub 2 }-air and CH{sub 4 }-air counterflow diffusion flames using full kinetics were performed and NO{sub X} emission indices calculated for various conditions. Studies were conducted in which a N{sub 2 } diluent was added either on the fuel- or air-side of the flame for conditions of either fixed initial velocities or fixed fuel mass flux. Results from these simulation studies indicate that a major factor in diluent effectiveness is the differential effect on flame zone residence times associated with fuel-side verses air-side dilution. Simulations in which flow velocities were fixed as diluent was added either to the air or fuel stream showed lower NO{sub X} emissions for air-side dilution; however, if instead, fuel mass fluxes were fixed as diluent was added, which results in an increase in the velocity of the streams, fuel-side dilution was more effective.

40|$|A laboratory-scale {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} on the physical and chemical characteristics of particulate matter emissions (ashes) from pulverized coals burning in the air or in simulated oxy-fuel environments. Oxy-fuel combustion {{is a process that}} takes place in O 2 /CO 2 gases, using an air separation unit (ASU) to supply the oxygen and a <b>flue-gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> (FGR) stream to supply the carbon dioxide to the boiler. In order to investigate the effects of the background gas on the particulate matter generated by the combustion of coals of different ranks, a bituminous, a sub-bituminous, and a lignite coal were burned in an electrically heated laminar-flow drop-tube furnace (DTF) in both O 2 /N 2 and O 2 /CO 2 environments (21 % < O 2 < 60 %). A recent publication by the authors reports on the physical characteristics of the particulate matter; hence, this work focuses on the chemical composition, specifically targeting the difficult-to-capture submicrometer size (PM 1) ashes. Particulate matter was collected by a low-pressure multistage cascade impactor and was analyzed for chemical composition by Scanning Electron Microscopy−Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Selected samples were also examined by Electron Microprobe Analysis (EMA). Results showed that submicrometer (PM 1) ashes of the bituminous, the sub-bituminous, and the lignite coals contained mostly Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, K, Na, and S. Prominent components of large submicrometer particle (PM 0. 56 − 1) compositions were Si and Al (Ca in sub-bituminous), whereas small submicrometer particles (PM 0. 1 − 0. 18) were markedly enriched in S. The mass yields of elemental species found in the submicrometer-size particles from all three coals were lower when combustion occurred in CO 2, instead of N 2 background gases. The chemical composition of the PM 0. 56 − 1 subcategory was not affected by the background gas. To the contrary, the composition of the PM 0. 1 − 0. 18 subcategory was affected by replacing N 2 with CO 2, and mass fractions of i, Ca, and Al decreased whereas Na, K, and S increased. Furthermore, in PM 0. 1 − 0. 18, when the O 2 mole fraction increased in either N 2 or CO 2, the mass fractions of Si, Ca, and Al increased at the expense mostly of Na, K, and S, but also Fe {{in the case of the}} sub-bituminous coal. Experimentally derived partial pressures of the volatile suboxide SiO (PSiO) at the char surface were compared with the predictions of an ash vaporization model without and with coupling with a particle combustion model; they were found to be in the range of the model predictions...|$|E
