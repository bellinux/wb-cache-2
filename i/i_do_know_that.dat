Reuben Clark—an LDS apostle and {{a member}} of the church's First Presidency—said that [...] "You and I have heard all our lives that the time may come when the Constitution may hang by a thread.... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> whether it shall live or die is now in the balance." [...] Regarding the Constitution, Clark went on to cite its [...] "free institutions", {{separation}} of powers, and the Bill of Rights. [...] He added that [...] "if we are to live as a Church, and progress, and have the right to worship ... we must have the great guarantees that are set up by our Constitution." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Thompson, {{the head}} of the U.K. Electoral Observation Mission in the country for the election, {{described}} the situation {{on the night of the}} coup as [...] "a very large presence of the military in the streets. It did seem quite coordinated last night in terms of how the roads were shut off...Today the streets are very calm, the city is much quieter than it normally would be. People are staying home. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the army has taken control of the state media and state television, and they haven't released anything official." [...] There was speculation on Senegal's RFM radio by reporter Noah Mankali that Gomes Júnior had been assassinated by the army during the night by soldiers from the same Balanta ethnic group as Ialá Embaló.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} {{backed the}} tenth austerity package which went before Parliament on 16 July. The package {{was the first}} in a series of prior actions necessary for negotiations to open up over bailout funding worth 86billion euros. The package came in two parts, with the first being approved on 16 July, and the second on 23 July. The legislation included a rise in VAT across several goods and services, the abolition of the VAT discount for Greek islands, a corporation tax rise from 26% to 29%, a luxury tax on cars, boats and swimming pools, an end to early retirement by 2022, and an increase in the retirement age to 67. Tsakalotos said on 16 July debate, [...] "I don't know if we did the right thing, however, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we felt like we had no other choice but do what we did." [...] The contentious vote was opposed by 109 out of 201 members of the Central Committee of Syriza, and 32 Syriza MPs voted against the proposals on 16 July. It also led to a cabinet reshuffle on 17 July, but Tsakalotos retained his role as Minister of Finance.|$|E

500|$|Ted Shackelford, {{who plays}} Gary, {{described}} the love story, [...] "I can't complain. I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lumet {{died at the}} age of 86 on April 9, 2011, in his {{residence}} in Manhattan, from lymphoma. When asked in a 1997 interview about how he wanted to [...] "go out," [...] Lumet responded, [...] "I don't think about it. I'm not religious. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I don't want to take up any space. Burn me up and scatter my ashes over Katz's Delicatessen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1982 the USLP was {{sued for}} $1.5 {{million in damages}} by U.S. News & World Report when one of its {{employees}} allegedly impersonated a reporter. The magazine won an injunction against the party publications. Lyndon LaRouche, {{when asked about the}} matter, said, [...] "I don't know anything about it and I never looked into it, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the liberal press uses undercover press practices that are abhorrent and beneath description." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Susy {{was part}} of us; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she could go away; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she could go away, and take our lives with her, yet leave our dull bodies behind. And <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know</b> what she was. To me she was but {{treasure}} in the bank; the amount known, the {{need to look at}} it daily, handle it, weigh it, count it, realize it, not necessary; and now that <b>I</b> would <b>do</b> it, it is too late; they tell me it is not there, has vanished away in a night, the bank is broken, my fortune is gone, I am a pauper. How am I to comprehend this? How am I to have it? Why am I robbed, and who is benefited? ...|$|R
2500|$|Both {{before and}} during the Second World War, Borges {{regularly}} published essays attacking the Nazi police state and its racist ideology. His outrage was fueled by his deep love for German literature. In an essay published in 1937, Borges attacked the Nazi Party's use of children's books to inflame antisemitism. He wrote, [...] "I don't know if the world can do without German civilization, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> its corruption by the teachings of hatred is a crime." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 James Baldwin {{described}} {{the impact of}} Delaney on his life, saying he was [...] "the first living proof, for me, that a black man could be an artist. In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, {{he would have been}} recognised as my Master and I as his Pupil. He became, for me, an example of courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many times and I lived to see him broken but I never saw him bow." [...] He further wrote, [...] "Perhaps I should not say, flatly, what I believe – that he is a great painter – among the very greatest; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> great art can only be created out of love, and that no greater lover has ever held a brush." ...|$|E

There are literally thousands of hours of content in this game. It doesn't seem like a crazy price to me. But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are. If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a lot of really cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes on... These things are still {{going to be on the}} shelf, it's not like we're taking it away. Maybe they don't buy it day one, but maybe they buy it in February? Maybe they buy it in March? We're not going away, and obviously people want to play things the day they come out, if they possibly can, but sometimes they can't." ...|$|E

5000|$|Amy {{would later}} recall one {{rehearsal}} for a Mendelssohn concerto in 1885, when the conductor slowed the orchestra {{during the last}} movement, attempting to go easy on the teenage soloist.
