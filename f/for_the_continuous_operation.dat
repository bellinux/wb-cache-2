40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is the {{synthesis}} of fatty acid ethyl esters catalysed by a lipase from Rhizomucor miehei in an organic / aqueous biphasic system. The lipase was immobilised on several materials with different structures, like celite, porous silica and synthetic polymers (Accurel type), and by different immobilisation methods. Based on the immobilisation and the esterification yields, the adsorption on Accurel E P 700 was selected for further work. The immobilisation conditions were optimised and the thermal and operational lipase stability was evaluated. The reaction medium was optimised by using the factorial design methodology. The effect of substrates concentration, ph, temperature, agitation rate and buffer molarity on the specific activity of the free and the immobilised lipase was evaluated. The kinetic study showed that the reaction was described by a ternary complex mechanism and the determined kinetic constants were used to model {{the time course of}} reaction in the batch reactor. The bio catalytic process, using the immobilised lipase, was performed in a perforated rotating disc bioreactor.

The term ‘South African owned airlines’ refers to six South African owned registered airlines, {{and is used}} for purpose of anonymity and confidentiality. Research purpose: The main {{aim of this study}} was to examine the interplay between service quality delivery, satisfaction, loyalty programmes and passengers’ loyalty to South African owned airlines. Motivation for the study: Intended to provide insight into quality to society of airline services, the global airline industry in general and the airline industry in South Africa in particular. Research approach, design and method: A quantitative research approach was adopted, using a cross-sectional (sample survey) method. Empirical data was directly collected by the researchers from 684 passengers at O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and King Shaka International Airport in Durban using a non-probability random sampling technique. Main findings: The study’s main findings were that: (1) generally, passengers of South African owned airlines were satisfied with the airlines’ service quality and rated such satisfaction as moderate to high. (2) Only 22 % of passengers were part of a loyalty programme. However, in the South African context, loyalty programme membership is not indicative of passengers’ loyalty to airlines: 86 % of the respondents stated that they are consistently loyal to the airlines (3). There was no association between passengers’ loyalty and frequency of travel. (4) South African passengers have limited choice of airlines; therefore, loyalty and patronage does not lean towards a particular airline. Practical implications: By offering superior service quality to passengers, South African owned airlines could gain competitive advantage ongoing patronage and loyalty, thus increasing overall profitability.

40|$|Pulp fibers can be spouted in a conical vessel if {{the inlet}} Reynolds number is above a {{critical}} value which varies linearly with mass of pulp in the vessel. Continuous pulp spouting is also feasible in a wedge-like vessel within certain limits of flow rate and inlet pulp consistency. Spouting hydrodynamics and particle separation behavior in both vessels were investigated for pulp fibers and recycled pulp suspensions. The minimum spouting velocity (MSV), spouting stability {{and the pressure}} drop-flow rate relationship were determined for liquid spouting of pulp fibers and of rigid particles. Liquid spouting of rigid particles is similar to gaseous spouting; pulp spouting is different. The liquid flow field in a conical spouted bed of pulp fibers is of a jet expansion type. A model for predicting the MSV for spouting pulp fibers was developed based on visual observation of the transition of the jet flow patterns in the conical vessel. Small particles including both ink and pulp fines can be elutriated from a spouted bed of a recycled pulp suspension, with little fiber loss, in both semi-batch and continuous modes using conical and wedge-like vessels, respectively. Both processes were studied using on-line measurement of the exit particle concentration.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityThe {{objective}} of this dissertation was to develop power management systems (PMS) for sediment microbial fuel cells (SFMCs) for high power and continuous applications. The {{first part of this}} dissertation covers a new method for testing the performance of SMFCs. This device called the microbial fuel cell tester was developed to automatically test power generation of PMS. The second part focuses on a PMS capable of delivering high power in burst mode. This means that for a small amount of time a large amount of power up to 2. 5 Watts can be delivered from a SMFC only generating mW level power. The third part is aimed at developing a multi-potentiostat laboratory tool that measures the performance at fixed cell potentials of microbial fuel cells so that I can optimize them for use with the PMS. This tool is capable of controlling the anode potential or cathode potential and measuring current of six separate SMFCs simultaneously. By operating multiple potentiostats, I was able to run experiments that find ideal operating conditions for the sediment microbial fuel cells, and also I can optimize the power management system for these conditions. The fourth part of the dissertation is targeting a PMS that was able to operate a sensor continuously which was powered by an SMFC. In pervious applications involving SMFCs, the PMS operated in batch mode. In this PMS, the firmware on the submersible ultrasonic receiver (SUR) was modified for use with my PMS.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop inverse {{scattering}} algorithms towards {{the ultimate goal}} of online diagnostic methods. The aim is to detect structural changes inside power transformers and other major power grid components, like generators, shunt reactors etc. Power grid components, such as large power transformers, are not readily available from the manufacturers as standard designs. They are generally optimized for specific functions at a specific position in the power grid. Their replacement is very costly and takes a long time. Online methods for the diagnostics of adverse changes of the mechanical structure and the integrity of the dielectric insulation in power transformers and other power grid components, are therefore essential <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>operation</b> of a power grid. Efficient online diagnostic methods can provide a real-time monitoring of mechanical structures and dielectric insulation in the active parts of power grid components. Microwave scattering is a candidate that may detect these early adverse changes of the mechanical structure or the dielectric insulation. Upon early detection, proper actions to avoid failure or, if necessary, to prepare for the timely replacement of the damaged component can be taken. The existing diagnostic methods lack the ability to provide online reliable information about adverse changes inside the active parts. More details about the existing diagnostic methods, both online and offline, and their limitations {{can be found in the}} licentiate thesis preceding the present PhD thesis. We use microwave scattering together with the inverse scattering algorithms, developed in the present work, to reconstruct the shapes of adverse mechanical structure changes. We model the propagation environment as a waveguide, in which measurement data can be obtained only at two ends (ports). Since we want to detect the onset of some deformation, that only slightly alters the scattering situation (weak scattering), we have linearized the inverse problem with good results. We have calculated the scattering parameters of the waveguide in the first-order perturbation, where they have linear dependencies on the continuous deformation function. A linearized inverse problem with a weak scattering assumption typically results in an ill-conditioned linear equation system. This is handled using Tikhonov regularization, with the L-curve method for tuning regularization parameters. We show that localized one-dimensional and two-dimensional shape deformations, for rectangular and coaxial waveguide models, are efficiently reconstructed using the inverse scattering algorithms developed from the first principles, i. e. Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism. An excellent agreement is obtained between the reconstructed and actual deformation shapes for a number of studied cases. These results show that it is possible to use the inverse algorithms, developed in the present thesis, as a theoretical basis for the design of a future diagnostic device. As a part of the future work, it remains to experimentally verify the results obtained so far, as well as to further study the theoretical limitations posed by linearization (first-order perturbation theory) and by the assumption of the continuity of the metallic waveguide boundaries and their deformations.

In this study, a rigorous and general mathematical model is developed for a pharmaceutical crystallisation process under <b>continuous</b> MSMPR <b>operation.</b> In <b>the</b> proposed changeover from batch to <b>continuous</b> <b>operation,</b> concentration control (C-control), which has been well accepted in batch crystallisation operation, is further extended to facilitate the convenient design of the steady-state operating point of a continuous MSMPR crystalliser; an objective {{is to ensure that}} the start-up procedures and on-line control conditions fall within the design-space of the original batch operation. Both single-stage and cascaded two-stage MSMPR crystallisers were investigated and compared to the conventional batch operation. It was observed that despite the production of a smaller number-based mean crystal size, <b>the</b> proposed <b>continuous</b> MSMPR <b>operation</b> achieved higher production capacity with shorter mean residence time and comparable product yield to the batch operation. Lastly, the robustness of C-control strategy against uncertainties in crystallisation kinetics was also demonstrated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>continuous</b> MSMPR <b>operation...</b>|$|R
