50|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>tests</b> are {{administered}} to ensure optimal {{function of the}} ear and to observe whether or not sound stimuli is entering the ear drum and reaching the brain as should be. The most common <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> require the spoken response to words or tones. Some <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> include the whispered speech test, pure tone audiometry, the tuning fork test, speech reception and word recognition tests, otoacoustic emissions (OAE) test and auditory brainstem response (ABR) test.|$|R

25|$|Since most {{persons with}} {{tinnitus}} also have hearing loss, a pure tone <b>hearing</b> <b>test</b> {{resulting in an}} audiogram may help diagnose a cause, though some persons with tinnitus do not have hearing loss.

25|$|The {{cause of}} Ménière's disease is unclear but likely {{involves}} both genetic and environmental factors. A number of theories exist for why it occurs including constrictions in blood vessels, viral infections, and autoimmune reactions. About 10% of cases run in families. Symptoms {{are believed to}} occur {{as the result of}} increased fluid build up in the labyrinth of the inner ear. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and frequently a <b>hearing</b> <b>test.</b> Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include vestibular migraine and transient ischemic attack.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is usually}} {{described}} as a ringing noise but, in some patients, it {{takes the form of}} a high-pitched whining, electric buzzing, hissing, humming, tinging or whistling sound or as ticking, clicking, roaring, [...] "crickets" [...] or [...] "tree frogs" [...] or [...] "locusts (cicadas)", tunes, songs, beeping, sizzling, sounds that slightly resemble human voices or even a pure steady tone like that heard during a <b>hearing</b> <b>test.</b> It has also been {{described as a}} [...] "whooshing" [...] sound because of acute muscle spasms, as of wind or waves. Tinnitus can be intermittent or continuous: in the latter case, it can be the cause of great distress. In some individuals, the intensity can be changed by shoulder, head, tongue, jaw or eye movements. Most people with tinnitus have some degree of hearing loss.|$|E

40|$|SummaryHearing loss is a {{multifaceted}} condition with many etiologies, among which genetic mutation is. Therefore, {{it is important}} to connect audiological investigation to etiological diagnosis. Aimthis study aims to establish the audiological and genetic profiles of three non-syndromic children with sensorineural hearing loss. Materials and methodthree brothers aged 3, 5 and 16 were enrolled in this study. They were submitted to behavioral and electrophysiological <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> and molecular studies. Resultsthe <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> showed moderate to moderately severe bilateral symmetric sensorineural hearing loss and an accentuated descending slope. Transient and Distortion Product Otoacoustic emissions were absent in the two younger children. ABR showed a bilateral moderately severe to severe sensorineural hearing loss. P 300 showed bilateral normal latencies in the older brother. Molecular tests showed that the two younger children were heterozygote for mutation 35 delG on gene GJB 2. ConclusionThe combination of speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> and genetic analysis allows for the etiologic diagnosis of seemingly similar hearing loss cases, which however display different genetic backgrounds. Molecular studies must be comprehensive enough to avoid precipitated diagnosis which may impair genetic counseling...|$|R

50|$|An {{audiogram}} is {{the result}} of a <b>hearing</b> <b>test.</b> The most common type of <b>hearing</b> <b>test</b> is pure tone audiometry (PTA). It charts the thresholds of hearing sensitivity at a selection of standard frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz. There is also high frequency pure tone audiometry which tests frequencies from 8000-20,000 Hz. PTA can be used to differentiate between conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and mixed hearing loss. A hearing loss can be described by its degree i.e. mild, moderate, severe or profound, or by its shape i.e. high frequency or sloping, low frequency or rising, notched, U-shaped or 'cookie-bite', peaked or flat.|$|E

50|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of hearing protection devices such as earplugs and earmuffs among workers found that tailored interventions improve the average use of such devices when compared with no intervention. Tailored interventions involve the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behavior. Mixed interventions such as mailings, distribution of hearing protection devices, noise assessments, and <b>hearing</b> <b>testing</b> are also more effective in improving the use of hearing protection devices compared with <b>hearing</b> <b>testing</b> alone. Programs that increased the proportion of workers wearing hearing protection equipment did reduce overall hearing loss.|$|R
