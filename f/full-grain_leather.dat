5000|$|<b>Full-grain</b> <b>leather</b> {{refers to}} hides {{that have not}} been sanded, buffed, or snuffed (as opposed to top-grain or {{corrected}} leather) to remove imperfections (or natural marks) {{on the surface of the}} hide. The grain remains allowing the fiber strength and durability. The grain also has breathability, resulting in less moisture from prolonged contact. Rather than wearing out, it develops a patina during its expected useful lifetime. High quality leather furniture and footwear are often made from <b>full-grain</b> <b>leather.</b> Full-grain leathers are typically available in two finish types: aniline, semi-aniline.|$|E

50|$|Noted {{for their}} {{exhaustive}} quality standards, the company uses a 21-step leather tanning process (vs. industry standard ranging from 12-15 steps) where the <b>full-grain</b> <b>leather</b> is dyed through, so a surface scratch won’t reveal a lining underneath. 95% of the company's products {{are made by}} hand.|$|E
5000|$|Belting leather is a <b>full-grain</b> <b>leather</b> {{originally}} used {{in driving}} pulley belts and other machinery. It is {{found on the}} surface of briefcases, portfolios, and wallets, and can be identified by its thick, firm feel and smooth finish. Belting leather is generally a heavy-weight of full-grain, vegetable-tanned leather.|$|E
5000|$|Top-grain leather (the {{most common}} type in {{high-end}} leather products) is the second-highest quality. It has had the [...] "split" [...] layer separated away, making it thinner and more pliable than full-grain. Its surface has been sanded and a finish coat added, which produces a colder, plastic feel with less breathability, {{and it does not}} develop a natural patina. It is typically less expensive and has greater stain resistance than <b>full-grain</b> <b>leather</b> if the finish remains unbroken.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, Thanh Le, a {{chemical}} engineer with a MBA degree met Thai Nguyen, a cobbler, in Calgary. The two men shared the interest in shoe crafting {{and it was not}} long before the idea of creating custom-fit shoes that last long. The duo spent days tracking down <b>full-grain</b> <b>leather</b> in France and Italy, and especially, the 3D technology used in making orthopaedic shoes They invented a new bespoke making method [...] After continuous research, they found out that a virtual and accurate model of the foot created by a 3D scanner used in orthopaedics can be used to build custom-made shoes for individual. Although the process costs much time and effort, it ensures to make shoes that fit like a glove. Using a 3D scanner, a shoemaker can create a bespoke last based on your foot to make the footwear, which is called it ‘functional shoes’ since it will prevent bunion and callus.This new method takes only 3-4 weeks to make a pair of bespoke shoes, instead of 3-6 months in traditional bespoke making methodAt Veritas Bespoke, prices for bespoke shoes begin at US$1,400 with each added layer of customization priced separately. Apart from bespoke lines, they also have Ready-to-wear (RTW) and Made-To-Order (MTO) shoes according to customer personalization.

5000|$|The Yemenite scroll of the Torah is {{traditionally}} written on 51 lines to each column, differing from Ashkenazi and Sephardic scrolls {{that are almost}} exclusively made of 42 lines to each column. Unique to Yemenite scrolls, based on what is prescribed in their codices, is that each column concludes {{with the end of}} a particular verse and begins with {{the start of a new}} verse; never broken in the middle. Each column starts afresh, excepting in only six designated places, whose mnemonics are בי"ה שמ"ו (see infra), where the columns in these places begin in the middle of a verse. These six places (five places when בראשית of Gen. 1:1 is excluded, since it is only used to form the mnemonic) are the only exceptions to the rule, and which practice is intended to ensure uniformity and exactness in the scribal practice and layout in the Sefer Torah throughout all generations. Yemenite scrolls comprise a total of 226 columns (רכ"ו דפים), and which average width of each column is approximately four finger-breadths, usually 9.3 cm, with a space of 3.7 cm between columns. Columns containing the Prosaic Songs are considerably wider to facilitate the writing of the song in its usual format. For the Prosaic Song Ha'azinu, the first column which contains the song is made ca. 14 cm in width, while the second column that concludes the song is made ca. 14.9 cm in width. For the Prosaic Song of the Sea the column measures approximately 14 cm in width. The sheets of parchment used in making the scroll measure approximately 54.7 cm in length (from top to bottom), although varying in width, with at least three columns to each sheet. Most are made with <b>full-grain</b> <b>leather</b> (Heb. ğawīl), that is, leather where the [...] "split" [...] layer has not been removed from it. In Yemen, the custom was to treat the raw hide with a tannin-solution made from the leaves of Acacia etbaica (Arabic: qarāḍ) to ensure the leather's lasting durability. This also gave to the leather a reddish-brown luster. The sheets of parchment were traditionally sewn together with sinews (tendons) taken from the animal's loins (flanks), rather than from the animal's heels (the latter being prescribed by Maimonides).|$|E
