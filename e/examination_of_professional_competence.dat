40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} work integrated learning (WIL) {{is the development}} <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence,</b> the ability <b>of</b> students to perform in the work place. Alignment theory therefore suggests that the assessment of WIL should include an assessment of students’ demonstration <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in the workplace. The assessment <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL is, however, problematic. It may be impractical for the academic supervisor to directly assess <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> {{if there is a}} large number of students in external placements. If evidence <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> is provided by the student, the student’s ability to articulate his or her own capabilities will interfere with the validity of the assessment. If evidence <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> competency is provided by the supervisor then the assessment is heavily dependent on the individual supervisor and may be unreliable. This paper will examine the literature relating to the assessment <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL. The paper will be informed by the author’s experience in coordinating a WIL subject in an undergraduate law course. It will recommend that a mix of evidence provided by the student, the workplace supervisor and the academic supervisor should be used to assess <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to explore an ethical view <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> by {{examining}} the <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> physicians in the context of palliative care.

Virtue ethics focuses on personal qualities and moral attitudes, while the ethics of care concentrates on the way these qualities are lived out in specific care relationships.
