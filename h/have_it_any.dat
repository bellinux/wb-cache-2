500|$|Some reviewers were {{critical}} of The Astonishings concept, including Consequence of Sound, who {{described it as}} [...] "very silly", but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review. By contrast, Record Collector described the storytelling as [...] "seamless". In their write-up, RTÉ.ie advised, [...] "park the snootiness before pressing the play button because while The Astonishing makes Iron Maiden's recent 92-minute double The Book of Souls look like a Ramones record, it's great fun ... Mental elbow grease is required, and the quintet wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way." ...|$|E
500|$|Following her {{split from}} Paul, Naomi {{learned that she}} had secured her dream job in the United States. She left Erinsborough after saying goodbye to her family and friends. The storyline served as a {{permanent}} exit for Naomi, as O'Reilly {{decided to leave the}} show to pursue new career opportunities. She had been expected to take a temporary break following the birth of her first child. Of her exit, Herbison commented [...] "The Neighbours audience fell in love with Naomi instantly and we have certainly left the door wide open for her to rejoin the Cannings in the future – Sheila wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way." ...|$|E

It was given the IGN Editors' Choice Award, calling it [...] "a AAA experience that is an adrenaline rush for online fans." [...] Game Informer described Warhawk as [...] "better than they'd hoped for". GamePro stated that although Warhawk offers an intense online combat experience, being dropped immediately into the action leaves you [...] "somewhat bewildered" [...] and doesn't give you that [...] "feeling of connection" [...] to the game. GameTrailers described Warhawk as [...] "simply fun, easy to compete, but challenging to shine." [...] Adam Sessler from X-Play complimented the game's multiplayer only style saying [...] "...I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way." [...] Gaming Target selected Warhawk as one of their [...] "52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007" [...] and awarded it [...] "PlayStation 3-Exclusive Game of the Year".|$|E

500|$|On his {{reliance}} on PayPal donations, Adams {{says he is}} content since he feels that people really like his work or they would not pay. Adams said that donations remain stable except during a new version update, {{where there is a}} sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own—not being part of the gaming industry. Adams said, [...] "Barely in the black one month, a little in the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way." [...] He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a Patreon account to help fund it.|$|E

[...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

60|$|WELL, {{that was}} a hard month on us all. Poor Benny, she kept up the best she could, and me and Tom tried to keep things cheerful there at the house, but it kind of went for nothing, as you may say. It was the same up at the jail. We went up every day to see the old people, but it was awful dreary, because the old man warn't {{sleeping}} much, and was walking in his sleep considerable and so he got to looking fagged and miserable, and his mind got shaky, and we all got afraid his troubles would break him down and kill him. And whenever we tried {{to persuade him to}} feel cheerfuler, he only {{shook his head and said}} if we only knowed what it was to carry around a murderer's load in your heart we wouldn't talk that way. Tom and all of us kept telling him it WASN'T murder, but just accidental killing! but it never made any difference--it was murder, and he wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way. He actu'ly begun to come out plain and square towards trial time and acknowledge that he TRIED to kill the man. Why, {{that was a}}wful, you know. It made things seem fifty times as dreadful, and there warn't no more comfort for Aunt Sally and Benny. But he promised he wouldn't say a word about his murder when others was around, and we was glad of that.|$|E
60|$|And besides; {{the problem}} of land, at its worst, is a bye one; {{distribute}} the earth as you will, the principal question remains inexorable,--Who is to dig it? Which of us, in brief word, is to do the hard and dirty work for the rest, and for what pay? Who is to do the pleasant and clean work, and for what pay? Who is do no work, and for what pay? And there are curious moral and religious questions connected with these. How far is it lawful to suck {{a portion of the}} soul out of a great many persons, in order to put the abstracted psychical quantities together and make one very beautiful or ideal soul? If we had to deal with mere blood instead of spirit, (and the thing might literally be done--as it has been done with infants before now)--so that it were possible, by taking a certain quantity of blood from the arms of a given number of the mob, and putting it all into one person, to make a more azure-blooded gentleman of him, the thing would of course be managed; but secretly, I should conceive. But now, because it is brain and soul that we abstract, not visible blood, it can be done quite openly, and we live, we gentlemen, on delicatest prey, after the manner of weasels; that is to say, we keep a certain number of clowns digging and ditching, and generally stupefied, in order that we, being fed gratis, may have all the thinking and feeling to ourselves. Yet {{there is a great deal}} to be said for this. A highly-bred and trained English, French, Austrian, or Italian gentleman (much more a lady), is a great production,--a better production than most statues; being beautifully coloured as well as shaped, and plus all the brains; a glorious thing to look at, a wonderful thing to talk to; and you cannot <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> <b>any</b> more than a pyramid or a church, but by sacrifice of much contributed life. And it is, perhaps, better to build a beautiful human creature than a beautiful dome or steeple--and more delightful to look up reverently to a creature far above us, than to a wall; only the beautiful human creature will have some duties to do in return--duties of living belfry and rampart--of which presently.|$|E
