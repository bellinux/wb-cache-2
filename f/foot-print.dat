2500|$|The {{character}} of Ah Sin was revived for a theatrical play co-written by Harte and Twain, Ah Sin. The two writers had a rift by February 1877 just before completing a final draft. Twain {{took over the}} project and, as he wrote to William Dean Howells, he [...] "left hardly a <b>foot-print</b> of Harte in it". Harte nevertheless attended the play's opening at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. on May 7, 1877.|$|E

60|$|It had shocked him in {{his intent}} world to see the zigzagging lines of deep little <b>foot-prints</b> across his work. The child was {{infinitely}} more shocked. Her vulnerable little soul was flayed and trampled. Why were the <b>foot-prints</b> there? She had not wanted to make them. She stood dazzled with pain and shame and unreality.|$|R
60|$|Returning, we espied Babbalanja {{advancing}} in his snow-white mantle. The fiery {{tide was}} ebbing; {{and in the}} soft, moist sand, at every step, he left a lustrous <b>foot-print.</b>|$|E
60|$|Aided, in this manner, I could {{discover}} a faint <b>foot-print,</b> which might, by {{aid of the}} imagination, be thus read; though the very slight impression {{that was to be}} traced, might almost as well be supposed anything else, as it seemed to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} nothing; and had he {{spoken of}} any such thing, I must have heard it. But, never mind the story, now; you saw the <b>foot-print,</b> and knew it for my son's. Did you ask {{to be admitted to}} his prison? or was your intercourse secret?" ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>foot-prints</b> was fresh, {{and looked}} {{as if they had been}} made by a man's boot.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not long}} before he came to a number of <b>foot-prints</b> leading to a pile of bricks close to the front.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here are {{the marks}} of <b>foot-prints</b> upon the window-sill," [...] added Hamington. [...] "See, they lead toward that door yonder. Where does that door lead to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The fight must so {{have seemed}} in that fell cirque. [...] What penned them there, {{with all the}} plain to choose? [...] No <b>foot-print</b> leading to that horrid mews, [...] None out of it. Mad brewage set to work [...] Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk [...] Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it then a Narragansett that hath a foot to {{confound}} a trail?" [...] returned Eben Dudley, who {{had been}} studying the movements and attitudes of the captive with quite as much keenness, and with something more of understanding, than the leech. [...] "Brother Ring, hast ever known an Indian leave such an out-turning <b>foot-print</b> on the leaves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{of course}} I looked {{well for the}} other shoe, but didn't find it; so I came away with what I had got, takin' care to place a lump of a stone over the <b>foot-print</b> in the clay, so as to guard but not touch it,--for it wasn't the print of this shoe, sir, though {{somewhat}} like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "lonesome pine" [...] {{from which}} the story takes its name was a tall tree that stood in solitary splendor on a {{mountain}} top. The fame of the pine lured a young engineer through Kentucky to catch the trail, and when he finally climbed to its shelter he found not only the pine but the <b>foot-prints</b> of a girl. And the girl proved to be lovely, piquant, and the trail of these girlish <b>foot-prints</b> led the young engineer a madder chase than [...] "the trail of the lonesome pine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' look here," [...] said Matt, {{leading the}} girl to a sandy spot close by. They both stood transfixed and silent, for there were strange <b>foot-prints</b> on the sand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you no clue?" [...] I asked. [...] "Was {{there no}} mark of violence, no blood-stain, no <b>foot-prints,</b> nothing {{to give you}} a hint as to what kind of danger you may have to meet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it not pain to love to {{the degree}} that one might kiss the earth that {{received}} the <b>foot-print</b> of its object--and yet to meet with no encouragement from fair words, no friendly glance of the eye, nor any sign or symbol to betoken that the being one hath enshrined in his heart's core, ever thinketh of her suitor except as a reckless rover and a hair-brained adventurer?" ...|$|E
60|$|Marble assented to the {{probability}} of this conjecture, and the conversation changed. It was matter of surprise {{to us that we}} had met no traces of anything like a residence near the creek, not the smallest sign of man having been discovered by either. It was reasonable to expect that some traces of an encampment, at least, would have been found. Everybody kept a vigilant look-out at the shore as we descended the creek; but, as on the ascent, not even a <b>foot-print</b> was detected.|$|E
60|$|Curiosity induced me {{to follow}} the Indian, in order to watch his movements. Susquesus {{proceeded}} {{a short distance from}} the hut, quitting the knoll entirely, until he reached lower land, where a <b>foot-print</b> would be most likely to be visible, when he commenced a slow circuit of the place, with eyes fastened on the earth, as the nose of the hound follows the scent. I was so much interested in the Onondago's manner, as to join him, falling-in in his rear, in order not to interfere with his object.|$|E
60|$|Clarence, on this sultry August afternoon, was tensely {{occupied}} {{tracking the}} family cat across the dining-room carpet by its <b>foot-prints.</b> Glancing {{up for a}} moment, {{he caught sight of}} {{the other members of the}} family.|$|R
5|$|In 1926, Wong put {{the first}} rivet into the {{structure}} of Grauman's Chinese Theatre when she joined Norma Talmadge for its groundbreaking ceremony, although she was not invited to leave her hand- and <b>foot-prints</b> in cement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you'd better buck {{up and get}} one, if you're {{going to}} be a detective. Do you think Sherlock Holmes ever moved a step without his? Not much. Well, anyhow. Did you find any <b>foot-prints</b> or tobacco-ash?" ...|$|R
60|$|These tidings struck dismay {{into the}} camp. Captain Bonneville {{endeavored}} to reassure his men by representing {{the position of}} their encampment, and its capability of defence. He then ordered the horses to be driven in and picketed, and threw up a rough breastwork of fallen trunks of trees and the vegetable rubbish of the wilderness. Within this barrier was maintained a vigilant watch throughout the night, which passed away without alarm. At early dawn they scrutinized the surrounding plain, to discover whether any enemies had been lurking about during the night; not a <b>foot-print,</b> however, was to be discovered in the coarse gravel with which the plain was covered.|$|E
60|$|The Indians {{had retired}} on the crust of the snow, {{and with the}} thaw every <b>foot-print,</b> or sign, by which such wary foes might be traced, had vanished. It {{remained}} matter of doubt to what tribe or even to what nation, the marauders belonged. The peace of the colony {{had not yet been}} openly broken, and the inroad had been rather a violent and fierce symptom of the evils that were contemplated, than the actual commencement of the ruthless hostilities which had since ravaged the frontier. But while policy had kept the colonists quiet, private affection omitted no rational means of effecting the restoration of the sufferers, in the event of their having been spared.|$|E
6000|$|When, in August, 1855, Hawthorne went by {{invitation}} to Smithell's Hall, {{the lady of}} the manor, on his taking leave, asked him [...] "to write a ghost-story for her house;" [...] and he observes in his notes, [...] "the legend is a good one." [...] Three years afterwards, in 1858, on the eve of departure for France and Italy, he began to sketch the outline of a romance laid in England, and having for its hero an American who goes thither to assert his inherited rights in an old manor-house possessing the peculiarity of a supposed bloody <b>foot-print</b> on the threshold-stone. This sketch, which appears in the present edition as [...] "The Ancestral Footstep," [...] was in journal form, the story continuing from day to day, with the dates attached. There remains also the manuscript without elate, recently edited under the title [...] "Dr. Grimshawe's Secret," [...] which bears a resemblance to some particulars in [...] "Septimius Felton." ...|$|E
6000|$|So saying, {{this young}} soul in age's mask [...] Went {{forward with the}} Carian side by side: [...] Resuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide [...] Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands [...] Took silently their <b>foot-prints.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Nor {{can blame}} cling to thee; the snow [...] From swinish <b>foot-prints</b> takes no staining, [...] But, leaving the gross soils of earth below, [...] Its spirit mounts, the skies regaining, [...] And unresenting falls again, [...] To beautify {{the world with}} dews and rain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Throughout all eternity, {{the parts}} of the past are but parts of the future reversed. In the old <b>foot-prints,</b> up and down, you mortals go, {{eternally}} traveling your Sierras. And not more infallible the ponderings of the Calculating Machine than the deductions from the decimals of history.|$|R
60|$|This was true, too. But it did {{not follow}} that a <b>foot-print</b> was a Huron's, merely because it was Indian. Then, where were the enemy's warriors to come from, in so short a time as had intervened between the late battle and the present moment? There was little {{question}} all {{the forces of the}} French, pale-face and red-man, had been collected at Ticonderoga to meet the English; and the distance was so great as almost to render it impossible for a party to reach this spot so soon, coming from the vicinity of the fortress after the occurrence of the late events. Did not the lake interpose an obstacle, I might have inferred that parties of skirmishers would be thrown on the flanks of the advancing army, thus bringing foes within a lessened distance of us; but, there was the lake, affording a safe approach for more than thirty miles, and rendering the employment of any such skirmishers useless. All this occurred to me at the moment, and I mentioned it to my companion as an argument against his own supposition.|$|E
60|$|Mowbray, thus {{assured that}} Clara {{had been in}} this place, while her passions and fears were so much afloat as {{they must have been}} at her flight from her father's house, cast a hurried and terrified glance from the brow of the precipice into the deep stream that eddied below. It seemed to him that, in the sullen roar of the water, he heard the last groans of his sister--the foam-flakes caught his eye, as if they were a part of her garments. But a closer {{examination}} showed that there was no appearance of such a catastrophe. Descending the path {{on the other side of}} the bower, he observed a <b>foot-print</b> in a place where the clay was moist and tenacious, which, from the small size, and the shape of the shoe, it appeared to him must be a trace of her whom he sought. He hurried forward, therefore, with as much speed, as yet permitted him to look out keenly for similar impressions, of which it seemed to him he remarked several, although less perfect than the former, being much obliterated by the quantity of rain that had since fallen,--a circumstance seeming to prove that several hours had elapsed since the person had passed.|$|E

50|$|The Methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) in {{molecular}} biology binds to DNA that contains {{one or more}} symmetrically methylated CpGs. MBD has negligible non-specific affinity for unmethylated DNA. In vitro <b>foot-printing</b> with the chromosomal protein MeCP2 showed that the MBD could protect a 12 nucleotide region surrounding a methyl CpG pair.|$|R
60|$|Just in {{proportion}} as youth is more susceptible of astonishment than age, {{so was the}} surprise of those little ones immeasurably {{greater than that of}} Robinson Crusoe in similar circumstances. With awestruck faces they traced the <b>foot-prints</b> down to the water's edge. Then, for the first time, it struck Matt that he had forgotten something.|$|R
50|$|Cup-marks are {{the most}} common forms of art among the nearly 900 carvings. Other carvings include ships, animals, <b>foot-prints</b> and tribal marks (known as wasum). Different animals are depicted, such as ostriches, turtles and fish. A large number carvings {{illustrate}} boats. The boats are of different sizes and types, and some contain oars while others do not.|$|R
