40|$|Abstract — In Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, sensor nodes {{are often}} {{deployed}} in harsh environments. Routine maintenance, fault detection and correction is difficult, infrequent and expensive. Furthermore, for long-term deployments {{in excess of}} a year, a node’s limited power supply tightly constrains the amount of processing power and long-range communication available. In order to support the long-term autonomous behaviour of a WSN system, a self-diagnostic algorithm implemented on the sensor nodes is needed for sensor fault detection. This algorithm <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> robust, <b>so</b> that sensors <b>are</b> not misdiagnosed as faulty to ensure that data loss <b>is</b> kept <b>to</b> a minimum, and it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> light-weight, <b>so</b> that it can run continuously on a low power microprocessor for the full deployment period. Additionally, it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> self-adapative <b>so</b> that any long-term degradation of sensors is monitored and the self-diagnostic algorithm can continuously revise its own rules to accomodate for this degradation. This paper describes the development, testing and implementation of a heuristically determined, robust, self-diagnostic algorithm that achieves these goals...|$|R
