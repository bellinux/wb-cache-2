40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the number of thoracic, lumbar and sacral vertebrae in tridactyla through radiographic examinations associated with gross anatomy determination. For this purpose, 12 adult specimens of M. tridactyla were analyzed, assigned to the Screening Center of Wild Animals (CETAS), IBAMA-GO, {{and approved by the}} Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals (Process CEUA-UFG nr 018 / 2014). In the radiographic examinations the following numbers of thoracic (T) and lumbar (L) vertebrae were observed: 16 Tx 2 L (n= 7), 15 Tx 2 L (n= 3), and 15 Tx 3 L (n= 2). In contrast, the numbers of vertebrae identified by anatomical dissection were as follows: 16 Tx 2 L (n= 4), 15 Tx 2 L (n= 3), and 15 Tx 3 L (n= 5). This difference occurred in cases of lumbarization of thoracic vertebrae, as seen in three specimens, and was explained by changes in regional innervations identified by anatomical dissection and the presence of <b>floating</b> <b>ribs</b> (right unilateral= 1, left unilateral= 1 and bilateral= 1), which were not identified by radiographic exams. Regarding the sacral vertebrae there was no variation depending on the methods used, which allowed the identification of 4 (n= 1) or 5 (n= 11) vertebrae. Thus, we concluded that there is variation in the number of thoracic, lumbar and sacral vertebrae, in addition to lumbarization, which must be considered based on the presence of <b>floating</b> <b>ribs,</b> in this species...|$|R
50|$|The {{contents}} of the thorax include the heart and lungs and the thymus gland); the (major and minor pectoral muscles, trapezius muscles and neck muscle); internal structures such as the diaphragm, esophagus, trachea {{and a part of}} the sternum known as the xiphoid process), as well as the content of the thoracic abdomen (stomach, kidney/adrenal, pancreas, spleen, and lower oesophagus). Arteries and veins are also contained - (aorta, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and the pulmonary artery); bones (the shoulder socket containing {{the upper part of the}} humerus, the scapula, sternum, thoracic portion of the spine, collarbone, and the <b>rib</b> cage and <b>floating</b> <b>ribs).</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, most joint locks {{involving}} the wrist, elbow, shoulder or ankle are permitted {{as there is}} a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those locks are safe to use under tournament conditions. Joint locks include Armbars, Kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, Omoplata, and other shoulder locks. Also, some fighters practice moves whose sole purpose is to inflict pain upon their opponent, in the hope that they will tap out. This includes driving knuckles into pressure points, holding their opponent's head in order to tire out the neck (called the [...] "can opener" [...] or kubi-hishigi) and putting body weight on top of the sternum, <b>floating</b> <b>ribs,</b> or similarly sensitive bones. These moves are not true submission moves; they are generally only used as distractions mostly in lower levels of competition.

40|$|Whether healing or {{nonunion}} {{occurs at}} the junction between cartilage and bone was studied in an animal experimental model. The costochondral junctions of the <b>floating</b> <b>ribs</b> of rabbits were excised and the cut ends of bone and cartilage reapproximated with wire. The process of healing was then observed. Fibrocartilaginous callus formed in the first week. Beginning in the second week, this was gradually replaced by bony callus, a process which started from the medullary cavity of the bone end. The cut end of the original cartilage showed no activity. The periosteum and perichondrium became continuous at 4 weeks. The site of ossification assumed {{the appearance of the}} original costochondral junction. The gap between the original cartilage and the new cartilage disappeared when fusion occurred at 48 weeks. Osteochondral junctions at various periods after operation were subjected to disruption force until the junctions were pulled apart. The average force required to break 16 junctions was 2, 738 g, and was not related to the period of healing. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the linear}} {{extension}} of fibrosis, neither a stenotic area resection nor end-end anastomosis were feasible while {{the implementation of}} synthetic material or metallic stent was also not possible.

The lowest and highest points of the cervicothoracic curvature were at C 5 and T 2, respectively. The spinous process of the axis was the largest in the cervical group while others were sharp and pointed. The greatest diameter of the vertebral canal was at the atlas (0. 8 [*]cm) and the lowest at the caudal sacral bones (2 [*]mm). The diameter of the vertebral foramen was the largest at C 1 and the smallest at the S 4; the foramina were negligibly indistinct caudal to the sacral vertebrae. There were 13 [*]pairs of ribs. The first seven pairs were sternal, and six pairs were asternal of which the last 2 - 3 [*]pairs were <b>floating</b> <b>ribs.</b> The sternum was composed of deltoid-shaped manubrium sterni, four sternebrae, and a slender processus xiphoideus.

5000|$|In Yingyai Shenglan—a record about Zheng He's {{expedition}} (1405-1433)—Ma Huan describes that [...] "all men in Majapahit, {{from the}} king to commoners, from a boy aged three to elders, slipped pu-la-t'ou (belati {{or more precisely}} kris dagger) in their belts. The daggers are made entirely of steel with intricate motifs smoothly drawn. The handles are made of gold, rhino's horn or ivory carved with a depiction of human or demon; the carving works are exquisite and skillfully made." [...] This Chinese account also reported that public execution by stabbing using this type of dagger is common. Majapahit knows no caning for major or minor punishment. They tied the guilty men's hands {{in the back with}} rattan rope and paraded them for a few paces, and then stabbed the offender one or two times in the back on the gap between the <b>floating</b> <b>ribs,</b> which resulted in severe bleeding and instant death.Currently, the Kris of Knaud is the oldest known surviving kris in the world. Given to Charles Knaud, a Dutch physician, by Paku Alam V in the 19th century Yogyakarta in Java, the kris is on display at the Tropenmuseum, Amsterdam.The kris bears the date of 1264 Saka (which correspondends to 1342 CE) in its iron blade. Scientists suspect that due to its special features the kris might be even older, but was decorated during Majapahit period to celebrate an important event.

5000|$|The Javanese {{in the era}} of Majapahit {{are known}} to be very arrogant. Their {{principle}} of life is [...] "Adigang Adigung Adiguna" [...] (superior in power, authority, and knowledge). They are very proud {{to have been able to}} subdue and or humiliate others. According to the testimony of Antonio Pigafetta, at that time, there's no one is as arrogant exceed the Javanese. If they were walking, and there's also people from another nation who walk at a higher place, they will be ordered to get down. and if they refuse, they will be killed. That is the character of the Javanese. So in old Javanese Kawi, there's no term of [...] "kalah" [...] ("lose"). If someone at odds with others, then there is only [...] "win" [...] or [...] "dead". As Ma Huan noted, in Chao-wa (Java) if a man touches their head with his hand, or if there is a misunderstanding about money at a sale, or a battle of words when they are crazy with drunkenness, they at once pull out their knives and stab other. He who is stronger prevails. When one man is stabbed to death, if the other man runs away and conceals himself for three days before emerging, then he does not forfeit his life; but if he is seized at the very moment the stabbing, he too is instantly stabbed to death. The country has no such punishment as flogging; no whether the offence be great or small, they tie both offender’s hands behind his back with a fine rattan, and hustle him away for several paces, then they take a pu-la-t’ou and stab the offender once or twice in the small of the back or in the <b>floating</b> <b>ribs,</b> causing instant death.

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to a) {{describe}} longitudinal changes in height and body weight (BW) {{between the ages}} 70 and 95 y; b) describe secular trends in height and BW of 70 -year-olds and their relation to social and lifestyle factors; c) investigate waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) at age 70 as risk for stroke during a 15 -y follow-up; and, d) {{examine the relationship between}} 1) BMI at age 70 and 15 -y all- cause mortality, 2) the percentage of weight change from age 70 to 75 and subsequent 5 - and 10 -y mortality. The studies were performed {{within the framework of the}} gerontological and geriatric population studies in Göteborg, Sweden-the H 70 studies. In the H 70 studies, 3, 128 70 -year-olds (1, 426 males and 1, 702 females) from four cohorts participated in medical examinations during 1971 / 72 (Cohort I; 449 men and 524 women), 1976 / 77 (Cohort II; 474 men and 562 women), 1981 / 82 (Cohort III; 302 men and 317 women), and 1992 (Cohort V; 201 men and 299 women). Longitudinal changes in anthropometry were studied in Cohort-I where participants and survivors were followed from ages 70 to 95 with 11 examinations in between. Secular trends were studied in participants of all four cohorts (I, II, III and V). Morbidity (stroke) and mortality were studied in participants (2, 628) of three cohorts (I, II and III). BW and standing height were measured in the morning and were recorded to the nearest 0. 1 kg and centimeter with the subjects wearing light clothes. BMI was calculated from weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. WC was measured horizontally half-way between the lowest <b>floating</b> <b>ribs</b> and iliac crests with subjects in standing position. From ages 70 to 95, height decreased 4 and 5 cm and BW decreased 3 and 5 kg in males and females, respectively. Due to the decrease in both height and BW, BMI was less affected. Individuals of later-born cohorts were found 1 to 2 cm taller and 1. 5 to 6. 3 kg heavier than earlier-born cohorts. "Year of birth" was a positive predictor for BW (p< 0. 001) and BMI (p< 0. 001) in males, and for height (p< 0. 05) and BW (p< 0. 01) in females. Physical inactivity was a positive (p< 0. 01) and "current smoking" a negative (p< 0. 001) predictor for BMI in both sexes. "More than basic education" was a positive predictor for height (p< 0. 001) in both sexes and a negative predictor for body weight (p< 0. 01) and BMI (p< 0. 001) in females only. During the 15 -y follow-up from age 70, the adjusted relative risk (RR) for non-fatal and all strokes in males were 1. 69 (95 % CI 1. 03 - 2. 78) and 1. 62 (95 % CI 1. 06 - 2. 47), respectively, in the highest WC quartile compared to the lowest quartile. In females, an elevated RR in the highest WC quartile 1. 49 (95 % CI 1. 02 - 2. 25) for all strokes disappeared after adjustment for systolic blood pressure. In males, the adjusted RR in the highest BMI quartile for non-fatal stroke and all strokes were 1. 72 (95 % CI 1. 07 - 2. 77) and 1. 66 (95 % CI 1. 10 - 2. 51), respectively. In females, RR for any stroke across the BMI quartiles was not found to be significantly different. In both sexes, neither WC nor BMI were risks for fatal stroke. The RR for 15 -y mortality from age 70 were highest in the lowest BMI quintiles of males 1. 20 (95 % CI 0. 96 - 1. 51) and females 1. 49 (95 % CI 1. 14 - 1. 96). After exclusion of first five-years death, no excess risk were found in males for following 5 - and 10 -y mortality across the quintiles. However, a U-shaped relation was observed in females after such exclusions. A weight loss of ³ 10 % between ages 70 and 75 meant a significantly higher risk for subsequent 5 - and 10 -y mortality in both sexes. The results indicate that height and BW decreases significantly after age 70 and more prominently in females. Trends in increasing height and BW among the new generations of 70 -year-olds are partly attributable to variations in social and lifestyle factors. Both high BMI and WC are risks for stroke in elderly males. On the other hand, both low BMI and weight loss are risk for mortality in both sexes. The results might be of importance to the understanding of anthropometry and its relation to morbidity and mortality in the ageing population...|$|R
