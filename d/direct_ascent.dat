5|$|Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR): Multiple rocket {{launches}} (up to 15 in some plans) {{would carry}} {{parts of a}} <b>Direct</b> <b>Ascent</b> spacecraft and propulsion units for translunar injection (TLI). These would be assembled into a single spacecraft in Earth orbit.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft was {{intended}} to fly a <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> mission, launched by a Saturn V. Descent stages, built from either the descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module, or from the Apollo Service Module, would have reduced the spacecraft's velocity as it approached the Moon. One configuration used two Service Modules and one LEM descent stage, with the LEM descent stage performing the final landing, and then being reused for ascent from the Lunar surface and trans-Earth injection. The other configuration used three LEM descent stages, with the second being used for landing and the third for ascent and TEI. The LSRS would have landed close to the Apollo Lunar Module on the Moon, and the Apollo crew would have transferred to it by EVA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> {{can be made}} via Scot Rake or Blue Gill from Troutbeck. On the Kentmere side {{there are}} no pathed routes, but a tongue of grass {{to the north of}} the fell avoids the worst of the scree.|$|R
25|$|Grey Friar can be {{climbed from}} several locations; {{it is often}} ascended {{along with the other}} six Coniston fells and this walk is usually started at Coniston village. <b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> of the fell can be started from the Duddon valley, the top of the Wrynose Pass or Cockley Beck.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} <b>direct</b> <b>ascents</b> are also possible. Rydale can be {{followed}} to its head {{from where the}} steep {{climb out of the}} valley leads to the summit. Alternatively an approach can be made along Deepdale, skirting the worst of the bogs, and climbing onto the Hartsop Above How ridge from the lower part of Link Cove. Dovedale and Houndshope Cove provide a third possibility.|$|R
5|$|When Shea {{was hired}} by NASA, President John F. Kennedy's {{commitment}} to landing men on the Moon was still only seven months old, {{and many of the}} major decisions that shaped the Apollo program were yet to be made. Foremost among these was the mode that NASA would use to land on the Moon. When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962, most NASA engineers and managersincluding Wernher von Braun, the director of the Marshall Space Flight Centerfavored either an approach called <b>direct</b> <b>ascent,</b> where the Apollo spacecraft would land on the Moon and return to the Earth as one unit, or Earth orbit rendezvous, where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth. However, dissenters such as John Houbolt, a Langley engineer, favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky: lunar orbit rendezvous, in which two spacecraft would be used. A command/service module (CSM) would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a lunar module would land on the Moon and return to dock with the CSM in lunar orbit, then be discarded.|$|E
25|$|Some wreck diving {{involves}} {{penetration of}} the wreckage, making a <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> to the surface impossible for {{a part of the}} dive.|$|E
25|$|Early in the {{planning}} process, NASA considered three leading ideas for the Moon mission: Earth Orbit Rendezvous, <b>Direct</b> <b>Ascent,</b> and Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR). A <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> configuration would launch a larger rocket which would land directly on the lunar surface, while an Earth orbit rendezvous would launch two smaller spacecraft which would combine in Earth orbit. A LOR mission would involve a single rocket launching a single spacecraft, but {{only a small part}} of that spacecraft would land on the moon. That smaller landing module would then rendezvous with the main spacecraft, and the crew would return home.|$|E
25|$|The fell is most {{commonly}} climbed via the south east ridge, beginning at Gill Foot where the lane from Grasmere crosses Green Burn. From Steel End {{at the head}} of Thirlmere a way can be found onto the north ridge, or a longer route taken up the Wythburn valley to surmount the ridge to Calf Crag. <b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> up the eastern face from the summit of Dunmail Raise are also possible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> {{can be made}} {{if desired}} via either of the {{northern}} combs. From the shore of Buttermere a path runs up into Birkness Comb from where the northern spur can be gained. From Buttermere village the path to Bleaberry Tarn can be used, branching off to find a line around {{the eastern end of}} Chapel Crags. If climbing from Ennerdale the route up Red Pike may be used.|$|R
50|$|The fell is most {{commonly}} climbed via the south east ridge, beginning at Gill Foot where the lane from Grasmere crosses Green Burn. From Steel End {{at the head}} of Thirlmere a way can be found onto the north ridge, or a longer route taken up the Wythburn valley to surmount the ridge to Calf Crag. <b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> up the eastern face from the summit of Dunmail Raise are also possible.|$|R
25|$|Critical {{pressures}} {{may also}} be specified {{for the start of}} the dive and for turnaround where <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> is not possible or not desirable. These can be called Critical Pressure of Descent or Critical Pressure for the Dive Profile, and Critical Pressure of Exit or Critical Pressure of Turnaround.|$|E
25|$|In {{saturation}} diving all tissues {{are considered}} saturated and decompression which is {{safe for the}} slowest tissues will theoretically be safe for all faster tissues in a parallel model. <b>Direct</b> <b>ascent</b> from air saturation at approximately 7msw produces venous gas bubbles but not symptomatic DCS. Deeper saturation exposures require decompression to saturation schedules.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedures}} of cave diving {{have much in}} common with procedures used for other types of penetration diving. They differ from open water procedures mainly in the emphasis on navigation, gas management, operating in confined spaces, and that the diver is physically constrained from <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> to the surface during much of the dive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> {{can be made}} via Levers Hawse to {{the south}} or Swirl Hawse to the east. Both can be gained from Coniston and Swirl Hawse is also a {{practicable}} objective from Little Langdale. The right of way shown up the western (Duddon) side of Levers Hawse does not exist as a path on the ground. Many walkers will arrive on Swirl How via one of the surrounding fells, all four ridges carrying fair paths.|$|R
50|$|Advances {{in other}} areas were {{necessary}} before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones {{to the surface of}} the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from Earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit. Such <b>direct</b> <b>ascents</b> use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one-way trip.|$|R
50|$|The ridge is {{followed}} by a good path, and is the most usual route of ascent. Yoke and Ill Bell form the start of the popular Kentmere Horseshoe, returning ultimately down the ridge {{on the opposite side of}} Kentmere valley. The ridge is also commonly ascended from Troutbeck valley, via the Garburn Road. <b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> are also possible from the valley of Hagg Gill via the northernmost quarry, or striking up over Lead Howes from the reservoir in Kentmere.|$|R
25|$|By parking near Ashness Bridge on {{the road}} to Watendlath, access to the western side of the ridge can be gained at high level. Ashness Gill can be {{followed}} upwards through increasingly wet country until a final bee-line is made for the summit. From further up the road at the base of Reecastle Crag a more direct line is possible, or the climb can be made from Watendlath itself, first ascending High Tove via the zig-zags. The <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> noted by Wainwright from the hamlet appears to have access problems.|$|E
25|$|Dove Crag is a {{fell in the}} English Lake District. Situated in the Eastern Fells of the {{national}} park, seven kilometres south-south-west of Glenridding, it reaches a height of 792 metres (2,598 feet). The fell is often climbed {{as part of the}} Fairfield horseshoe walk but a <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> from Patterdale is required to show the fell's full potential, displaying the impressive crags just to the north east of the summit. The highest point was originally unnamed on maps, being just a minor top, but over the years the summit has adopted the name of Dove Crag by mutual accord..|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{alternatives}} are available when starting from Mungrisdale. The easiest follows a gently rising track to the depression {{at the head}} of Bannerdale, while a variation is to turn off and climb steeply up the terminal slope of The Tongue. Bullfell Beck can also be followed to give the most <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> to the summit, but the best route is perhaps to follow the east ridge over its undulating tops. From Bowscale, a little along the road to the north, the Victorian pony route to Bowscale Tarn can still be followed, continuing up a grassy rake that bisects Tarn Crag.|$|E
50|$|A longer {{route from}} the Kent valley follows the ridge that {{separates}} it from Longsleddale, taking in Kentmere Pike on the way. This may {{form part of}} the Kentmere Horseshoe walk which also includes the Ill Bell ridge. An ascent of Harter Fell may also be combined with fells such as Branstree, Mardale Ill Bell and High Street to form a high-level circuit of Mardale from the road end. Finally, <b>direct</b> <b>ascents</b> from Longsleddale can also be made up the grassy slopes above Wrengill Quarry.|$|R
5000|$|The Great Tower, a {{much more}} {{imposing}} steepening of the ridge reached after a short level section and a few easy ledges. The two <b>direct</b> <b>ascents</b> (Pigott's and Bell's routes) up {{the front of the}} Great Tower are both graded Very Difficult so these are typically avoided by taking the Eastern Traverse, a high ledge traversing to the left and through a flake tunnel before climbing [...] "tricky short walls" [...] (p106) directly {{up the side of the}} tower to a small cairn at the top.|$|R
50|$|Kentmere Pike is most {{commonly}} climbed indirectly {{as part of}} the Kentmere Horseshoe. This circuit takes in the fine ridges {{on either side of the}} valley, together with the higher fells at its head. <b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> can also be made from either flank. An ancient grooved path rises up the fellside from the end of High Lane in Kentmere, meeting the ridgetop wall to the south of the summit. From Longsleddale the walled track which leads to Gatesgarth Pass can be left just north of Steel Pike. The line of an old fence is then followed to the ridge.|$|R
25|$|The United States {{developed}} <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> anti-satellite weapons. A United States Army Nike Zeus missile {{armed with}} a nuclear warhead destroyed an orbiting satellite in May 1963. One missile from this system known as Project MUDFLAP and later as Project 505 was available for launch from 1964 until 1967. A nuclear-armed Thor anti-satellite system deployed by the United States Air Force under Program 437 eventually replaced the Project 505 Nike Zeus in 1967. The Program 437 Thor missile system remained in limited deployment until 1975. One drawback of nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapons was that they could also damage United States reconnaissance satellites. As a result, the United States anti-satellite weapons development efforts were re-directed to develop systems that did not {{require the use of}} nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> of Sgairneach Mhòr {{is not a}} {{difficult}} walk {{as the starting point}} is at the summit of the Drumochter Pass on the A9 road and has a starting altitude of 462 metres. The walk crosses the railway and ascends Coire Dhomhain on a good track on the north bank of the Allt Coire Dhomhain. After approximately two km the track is left and the burn is crossed (no bridge) to its southern bank. It is then a walk south through pathless heather to reach the eastern ridge which is followed to the summit. If the burn is in spate then an alternative is to walk higher up into Coire Dhomhain and then ascend by the steeper northern ridge.|$|E
25|$|Open {{water is}} the {{definitive}} environment for recreational diving, and in this context implies {{that there is no}} physical or physiological barrier to the diver concluding the dive at any time by a <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> to the surface, either vertically, or via a clearly visible route adequately illuminated by ambient light. Some organisations extend the scope of recreational diving to allow short decompression obligations which can be done without gas switching. Depth limitations are imposed by the certification agencies, and relate to the competency associated with the specific certification. Entry level divers may be restricted to a depth of , and mere advanced divers to 30, 40, 50 or 60m depending on the certification and agency. Junior divers may be restricted to shallower depths.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> {{are perhaps}} unusual, most walkers {{traversing}} from [...] "The Old Man" [...] to Swirl How, but perfectly possible. The easiest access is from Coniston, climbing via Levers Water to Levers Hawse. Pathless ascents of Raven Tor {{can also be}} made from either side for a wilder finish. The Walna Scar Road (Byway open to all traffic) gives access to Goat's Hawse from {{either side of the}} ridge and this is the easiest route from the Duddon. Note that a right of way shown on Ordnance Survey maps descending west from Levers Hawse to Seathwaite Tarn does not exist as a path on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>ascents</b> of Sgorr Ruadh {{are usually}} started from Achnashellach in Glen Carron, {{although}} {{it is possible to}} approach from Glen Torridon on a considerably longer and rougher route. From Achnnashellach the right of way which goes up Coire Lair to Torridon is taken for two kilometres where a cairn indicates a path bearing left which crosses the River Lair (the river often requires wading) and climbs {{to the top of the}} Bhealaich Mhoir, the pass between Sgorr Ruadh and Fuar Tholl [...] From the top of the bhealaich it is a 275-metre climb to the summit by-passing the many buttresses and gullies on the way.|$|R

25|$|Eagle Crag {{is usually}} climbed from Stonethwaite; {{it can be}} {{combined}} with the higher fells of High Raise and Ullscarf {{as well as the}} nearby Sergeant’s Crag. A <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> of the fell seems to be impossible when it is viewed from the Stonethwaite valley, with vertical walls of crags seemingly barring the way. However, a route can be found through the crags to attain the summit directly. Descents by this route are not recommended because of the dangerous crags which cannot be seen from above. An easier ascent follows the bridleway up Greenup Gill; this well-blazed trail is part of Wainwright’s Coast to Coast Walk. The route leaves the bridleway at height of 330metres and attains the fell by cutting back on itself and climbing steep grassy slopes to the summit.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 2012 Categoría Primera B season, América reached the Apertura {{championship}} against Unión Magdalena at penalty kicks, undefeated at home with one of the best performances in the history of the category. Additionally, for the first time in five appearances in the Copa Colombia, the club achieved qualification to the knockout stages, finishing top of Group E unbeaten with 22 points; they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Atlético Bucaramanga. In the second half of the season, América lost the first <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> option by does not qualify for the final of the Torneo Finalización. Already in the Final of the Year loses with Alianza Petrolera on penalties and in the Promotion Series against Cúcuta Deportivo 5–3 on aggregate, forcing it to stay for next year in the Second Division.|$|E
25|$|Loft Crag has an {{altitude}} of 2,238ft (682metres). It lies between Harrison Stickle and Pike o’ Stickle and is usually climbed in conjunction with these two peaks. The starting place for the <b>direct</b> <b>ascent</b> of the fell is The New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in Great Langdale. A path leads north-westerly across the hillside passing Dungeon Ghyll Force waterfall and going between Thorn Crag and Gimmer Crag to a col between Loft Crag and Harrison Stickle. From there it is a straightforward climb to the summit. A more circuitous ascent can be undertaken from the same starting point but taking the well trodden (and repaired) path up Stickle Ghyll to Stickle Tarn. From here the fells of Pavey Ark and Thunacar Knott can be climbed before tackling the three Langdale Pikes.|$|E
5000|$|As mentioned, the {{steepness}} of {{the southern}} slopes deter <b>direct</b> <b>ascents</b> of the mountain. It is possible to tackle the mountain from a starting point two kilometres west of the Cluanie Inn, going through the forest and ascending by a subsidiary ridge called Meall a’ Charra which joins the eastern ridge at the col with Aonach Meadhoin. The majority of visitors to the summit arrive along either the east or west ridges from the adjoining “Brothers” Munros. This traverse of all three mountains starts either at the Cluanie Inn {{to the east of}} the group, or from a parking place in Glen Shiel at grid reference [...] to the west. The starting and finishing point of this walk is several kilometres apart.|$|R
50|$|Stob Bàn {{is usually}} climbed from Glen Nevis to the north; <b>direct</b> <b>ascents</b> start at Achriabhach {{and take the}} stalkers path which ascends Coire a' Mhusgain to reach the col between Stob Bàn and Sgor an Iubhair before {{climbing}} steeply up the eastern ridge to the summit. From the same starting point {{it is also possible}} to ascend the rough and undulating north ridge; on this route there is a significant false top at a height of 900 metres which is often mistaken for the summit. Stob Bàn is also quite often climbed in conjunction with the neighbouring Munro of Mullach nan Coirean which lies three kilometres to the west. The view from the summit takes in fine views of Ben Nevis and the Aonachs.|$|R
