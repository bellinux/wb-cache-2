5|$|<b>Infrared</b> <b>light</b> is {{of lower}} energy than visible light, hence is emitted by cooler objects. As such, the {{following}} {{can be viewed}} in the infrared: cool stars (including brown dwarves), nebulae, and redshifted galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Boron-doped {{diamonds}} transmit light down to ~250nm {{and absorb}} some red and <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> (hence the blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave ultraviolet light. Apart from optical absorption, boron acceptors {{have been detected}} by electron paramagnetic resonance.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is a {{component}} of some compound semiconductors, such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and cadmium telluride, used for light detection and solar cells. HgCdTe is sensitive to <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> {{and can be used}} as an infrared detector, motion detector, or switch in remote control devices.|$|E

5|$|Other binary {{compounds}} of niobium include {{niobium nitride}} (NbN), which becomes a superconductor at low temperatures {{and is used}} in detectors for <b>infrared</b> <b>light.</b> The main niobium carbide is NbC, an extremely hard, refractory, ceramic material, commercially used in cutting tool bits.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and <b>infrared</b> <b>light,</b> and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. Such probes include effects of electric and magnetic fields, measuring response functions, transport properties and thermometry. Commonly used experimental methods include spectroscopy, with probes such as X-rays, <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> and inelastic neutron scattering; study of thermal response, such as specific heat and measuring transport via thermal and heat conduction.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the youngest galactic supernova, G1.9+0.3, occurred in the late 19th century, considerably more recently than Cassiopeia A from around 1680. Neither supernova was noted at the time. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction along the plane of the galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently to go unnoticed. The situation for Cassiopeia A is less clear. <b>Infrared</b> <b>light</b> echos have been detected showing that it was a type IIb supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at a speed of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in <b>infrared</b> <b>light.</b> Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> {{from the planet}} had been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star's constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited {{in front of the}} star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the light from the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} team {{followed up}} their initial identification of Eris with spectroscopic observations {{made at the}} 8m Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii on January 25, 2005. <b>Infrared</b> <b>light</b> from the object revealed the presence of methane ice, indicating that the surface may be {{similar to that of}} Pluto, which at the time was the only TNO known to have surface methane, and of Neptune's moon Triton, which also has methane on its surface. No surface details can be resolved from Earth or its orbit with any instrument currently available.|$|E
5|$|The arcs {{are quite}} stable structures. They were {{detected}} by ground-based stellar occultations in the 1980s, by Voyager 2 in 1989 and by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes in 1997–2005 and remained at {{approximately the same}} orbital longitudes. However some changes have been noticed. The overall brightness of arcs decreased since 1986. The Courage arc jumped forward by 8° to 294° (it probably jumped over to the next stable co-rotation resonance position) while the Liberté arc had almost disappeared by 2003. The Fraternité and Égalité (1 and 2) arcs have demonstrated irregular variations in their relative brightness. Their observed dynamics is probably related to the exchange of dust between them. Courage, a very faint arc found during the Voyager flyby, was seen to flare in brightness in 1998; {{it was back to}} its usual dimness by June 2005. Visible light observations show that the total amount of material in the arcs has remained approximately constant, but they are dimmer in the <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> wavelengths where previous observations were taken.|$|E
5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory assays using animals require {{strategies}} to avoid stress and keep animals alive {{as long as the}} test demands. Termites live in a constant dark environment in their nests, but in studies that demand video recording, termites are exposed to light. Since light is a condition opposed to what termites naturally live, it is possible that this condition might stress termites. To find how suitable are lights in video recording termites, we evaluated the effect of <b>infrared</b> <b>lights</b> and cold white light in the survival of workers of Cornitermes cumulans (Termitidae: Syntermitinae) confined in Petri dishes. We compared the survival of termites in the light treatments and termites kept in the dark. As our null hypothesis, time until death would not differ between termites exposed to cold white <b>lights,</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>lights,</b> and termites kept in the dark. We found that the survival of C. cumulans workers was not affected by light since there was no statistical difference in the mortality between the three treatments. Here we show that both <b>infrared</b> <b>lights</b> and cold white lights can be used in lab assays to video record termites, as such lights did not affect workers survival...|$|R
50|$|Zebra fish larval {{locomotor}} activity assay of transgenic fish embryos {{and individual}} larvae {{placed in a}} 96-well plate, monitored in a box and continuously illuminated by <b>infrared</b> <b>lights,</b> illuminated by white lights showed major similarities between fish circadian system and mammalian sleep/wake regulator for example.|$|R
40|$|There are {{few options}} for obtaining {{information}} on intra- and inter-species behavioural interactions between marine animals other than direct observation. Underwater video and <b>infrared</b> <b>lighting</b> {{can be used}} to overcome some of the biases and limitations associated with diver observations. We outline the assembly and application of a multi-camera underwater video system consisting largely of moderately priced components produced for the security surveillance industry. Signals from up to eight cameras on the seafloor are processed on a floating pontoon into a single video stream and transmitted to a remote monitoring station for viewing or recording. High-red and <b>infrared</b> <b>lights</b> are used for night viewing to minimise disturbance. Experiments incorporating this system have provided high-quality data on predation and behaviour of lobsters...|$|R

25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the eclipse, many {{counterfeit}} glasses were put up for sale. Effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light, but most UV and <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> as well. For visible light, the user should only be able to see the Sun, sunglint reflected off shiny metal, halogen bulbs, the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs, and similarly intense sources. Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> requires the use of spectrophotometer, which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Infrared</b> {{transmitted}} <b>light</b> {{is based}} on the fact that silicon is translucent at wavelength ≥ 1.2 µm. The equipment consists of an <b>infrared</b> lamp as <b>light</b> source and an infrared video system (compare to figure [...] "Schematic infrared transmission microscopy setup").|$|R
50|$|Other common {{accessories}} {{include the}} AN/PEQ-2, Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG), and M68 CCO. EOTech holographic weapon sights {{are part of}} the SOPMOD II package. Visible and IR (<b>infrared)</b> <b>lights</b> of various manufacturers are also commonly attached using various mounting methods. As with all versions of the M16, the M4 accepts a blank-firing attachment (BFA) for training purposes.|$|R
25|$|The {{selective}} absorption of <b>infrared</b> (IR) <b>light</b> {{by a particular}} material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integer multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of <b>infrared</b> (IR) <b>light.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the energy of each individual photon is why ultraviolet light can cause sunburn, but visible or <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> cannot. A photon of ultraviolet light will deliver a high amount of energy– enough to contribute to cellular damage such as occurs in a sunburn. A photon of <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> will deliver a lower amount of energy– only enough to warm one's skin. So, an infrared lamp can warm a large surface, perhaps large enough to keep people comfortable in a cold room, but it cannot give anyone a sunburn.|$|E
