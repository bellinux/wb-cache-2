500|$|GateKeeper has {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{from the media}} and public. Some riders complained about the shoulder restraints becoming too tight while sitting in the brake run {{at the end of}} the ride. Others praised the near-miss elements; one woman said, [...] "It feels like you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> knees chopped off and your head chopped off." [...] Many guests also praised the smoothness of the ride and how the renovated main entrance is very appealing. On GateKeeper's opening weekend, Cedar Point achieved its most successful opening weekend in the history of the park, due to the popularity of GateKeeper.|$|E

40|$|Helvetica (connotes Swiss typeface) {{has been}} used the most widely from street signs to {{government}} campaign posters since 1957. Helvetica represents a great leap forward for modernity: clean, sans-serif, optimistic. However in history, there was a movement against Helvetica among American artists and designers since David Carson and Paula Scher indicted Helvetica {{as the cause of}} Vietnam war. Paradoxically, we celebrated its 50 th birthday in 2007. Helvetica’s message it this: “you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> destination on time; your plan will not crash; your money is safe in our vault; we will not break the package; the paperwork has been filled in; everything is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be OK” (Finlo Rohrer, Helvetica At 50, BBC News Magazine 9 May 2007).

5000|$|I {{had such}} issues with that. I {{felt that it}} went way beyond what was {{necessary}} in terms of complexity, but the people that developed it felt strongly to leave a mark in the industry {{that they had the}} hardest game to play — period, bar none. That’s fine if you’re not worried about catering to a customer and making sales.Return of Werdna was the worst-selling product we ever launched. People would buy it, and it was unplayable. So they’d put it down, and word spread around. There were other hard-core players in the market that loved it. They said, [...] "Ah, why doesn’t everybody do this?" [...] Well, we don’t because you guys are a minority. If you’re a glutton for punishment, you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> pleasure somewhere else because nobody can survive catering to such a small number of people.So, it was controversial in that way. In the end, I think I was proven correct that making crazy impossible products in terms of difficulty was not the way forward.|$|R
5000|$|... "Lay Away" [...] is a 1972 funk-rock single {{released}} by The Isley Brothers on their T-Neck imprint. Released {{as the first}} record off their Brother, Brother, Brother album, the song depicted the narrator's description of how his lover's love was so special {{that he wanted to}} have for keeps just in case (hence the lyrics <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> <b>get</b> (<b>your</b> love) on a rainy day/your love is safe in my lay-away). The song took the riff of Honey Cone's [...] "Want Ads" [...] especially in the bridges. The song was significant for showcasing brother Ernie on lead guitar {{for the first time on}} an Isley Brothers record. Written and produced by elder brothers O'Kelly, Rudolph and Ronald, the song charted at number fifty-four pop and number six R&B in the spring of 1972.|$|R
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks {{about someone who}} has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very {{empowering}} towards breaking up with someone and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.", she said.

The violence she experiences from her husband is in part reflected in the violent attitude she displays towards her children as she shouts at and beats them constantly.

5000|$|Taylor Glasby of Dazed {{ranked the}} song ninth on the publication's [...] "Top ten K-Pop of 2013". He {{described}} {{the group as}} [...] "simultaneously creepy and adorable" [...] and the song as [...] "cheekily adventurous" [...] with an [...] "earworm chorus" [...] and [...] "iconic" [...] dance. He also said the song is [...] "smarter than it first appears", with layered 1980s brass and 1970s disco beats. Scott Interrante, writing for PopMatters, discussed [...] "Bar Bar Bar" [...] in his overview of K-pop in 2013: [...] "The song and video are bratty, obnoxious, and totally awesome.

6000|$|... "Don't {{get into}} the way of waiting too long before you fire, Tom," [...] Pete Hoskings said. [...] "Better to try to shoot too quick to begin with than to be too long about it. When you have made up your mind that you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shoot, <b>get</b> <b>your</b> bead on your mark and fire at once. You may want to hit a red-skin's head as he looks {{out from behind a}} tree, and to do that you must fire the instant you see him or he will be in again. One of the best shots I ever saw never used to raise his gun to his {{shoulder}} at all. He just dropped his piece into the hollow of his left hand, and would fire as he touched it. He did not seem to take any aim at all, but his bullet was sartin to hit the thing he wanted to, even if it were no bigger than an orange. He could not tell himself how he did it. 'I seen the thing and I fired, Pete,' he would say; 'the gun seems to point right of its own accord, I have not anything to say to it.' You see, shooting is a matter of eye. Some men may shoot all their lives, and they will never be more than just respectable, while others shoot well {{the first time that a}} gun is put in their hands. Want of nerve is what spoils half men's shooting; that and taking too long an aim. Well, it is time for us to be mounting and getting back. I have got to see that the dinner is all ready. I never can trust that black scoundrel, Sam, to do things right while I am away." ...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{publications}} speculated {{on whether}} Internet memes helped Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. Co-founder and former moderator {{of the group}} Sean Walsh said, [...] "This generation's memes are that generation's C-SPAN or Huffington Post. Seriously, memes are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be very prevalent in politics. They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ideas into <b>your</b> head." [...] The Washington Posts Caitlin Dewey believed memes are more participatory than news articles or official campaign letters besides addressing voter apathy through humor. Vices Carles Buzz found memes curated by the group appealed more to a progressive than their radio station's Facebook page. While examining the popularity of both Sanders and British politician Jeremy Corbyn, Jacobins Peter Frase used the group as an example that [...] "exploits the incongruity of these men’s nebbishy affect when contrasted with their youthful supporters." [...] Fortunes Ryan Holmes found it interesting that the memes had [...] "little - or nothing - to do with Sanders' actual campaign." [...] The Daily Koss Nerdstrom thought an online community like the group was what rival presidential candidates lacked. In Northwestern University's news magazine North by Northwestern, Facebook page Cats for Kasich founder Blake Kolesa and co-founder Noah Orner called it [...] "one of the many pop-culture phenomena that connect younger voters to politics." [...] Business Insiders Dan Turkel pointed out how the group highlighted enthusiasm among young Internet users. The Daily Dots Vic Vaiana said the group {{was one of the}} first leftist meme spaces to attract significant media coverage as well as increasing the popularity of similar spaces. Brit + Cos Tannara Yelland found Sanders' Internet appeal via memes resonated with Millennials.|$|R
5000|$|... "Habits (Stay High)" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most critics. Harley Brown of Billboard {{wrote that the}} track is [...] "one of the most easily identifiable pop songs has heard in recent memory: everyones gotten high, maybe eaten too many Twinkies, and regretted life decisions, but not everyone makes a really superb song about it". Pitchforks Carrie Battam stated that the tracks hook and production make the lyrics [...] "sound gracefully sad instead of tragic". In her review of Queen of the Clouds, Battam called it [...] "a big, sticky song, but not so big that it stuns your senses or numbs you into enjoyment". Nu Wave Pony deemed it as stellar and incredible, while Jennsdrunk of Pigeons and Planes wrote that [...] "the beat pulses, Los voice is solid, and the lyrics are definitely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> stuck in <b>your</b> head, whether {{you want them to}} or not." [...] Ewald Arndt of FDRMX said that [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is [...] "so fun to listen to" [...] despite its sad themes. AllMusics Heather Phares called it [...] "the Queen of the Cloudss standout track, while Evan Ross of And Pop wrote that [...] "it does a good job of describing that period of time between sadness and acceptance that comes with a breakup". Sam Lansky of Idolator stated that it [...] "has a little of the texture of Keshas no-fucks-given party-girl pop but with the languorous sadness of Robyn" [...] and that [...] "Itll <b>get</b> stuck in <b>your</b> head, which is right where it deserves to be." [...] Bradley Stern of MuuMuse called it [...] "the younger, more Swedish-sounding sister" [...] to Sias [...] "Chandelier" [...] (2014), while Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal considered it an [...] "anthem of female empowerment". Alex Kritselis of Bustle opined that [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was a dramatic song, but further stated that the [...] "sadness, anxiety and terror" [...] in the singers voice were authentic.|$|R
