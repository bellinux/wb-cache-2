5|$|I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 {{autobiography}} {{about the}} early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an <b>inferiority</b> <b>complex</b> into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.|$|E

When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all {{the fun out of}} the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} earlier, a healthy Nalla {{took part in}} various street theatre {{performances}} protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, {{that resulted in the}} marginalisation of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi (Nassar), a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi, called Bala (Kiran Rathod), fell in love with each other. Realising their chances of getting together would be slim if Padayatchi knew about their relationship, Nalla and Bala decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an <b>inferiority</b> <b>complex</b> due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.|$|E

The Japanese executed all the Malay Sultans on Kalimantan and wiped out the Malay elite in the Pontianak incidents. In the Jesselton Revolt, the Japanese slaughtered thousands of native civilians during the Japanese occupation of British Borneo and nearly wiped out the entire Suluk Muslim population of the coastal islands.

25|$|Though {{the strip}} {{did not have}} a lead {{character}} at the onset, it soon began to focus on Charlie Brown, a character developed from some of the painful experiences of Schulz' formative years. In early strips, Charlie Brown was depicted as distinctly younger than his cohorts Patty and Shermy. Charlie Brown's main characteristic is either self-defeating stubbornness or admirably determined persistence to try his best against all odds: he can never win a ballgame but continues playing baseball; he can never fly a kite successfully but continues trying to do so. Though his <b>inferiority</b> <b>complex</b> was evident from the start, in the earlier strips he also got in his own jabs when verbally sparring with Patty and Shermy. Some early strips also involved romantic attractions between Charlie Brown and Patty or Violet. On September 1, 1958, Charlie Brown's father was formally revealed to be a barber (after earlier instances in the strip that linked Charlie Brown to barbers by implication). In 1960, the now popular line of Charlie Brown greeting cards was introduced by Hallmark Cards. Charlie Brown and Snoopy reached new heights on May 18, 1969, as they became the names of the command module and lunar module, respectively, for Apollo 10.|$|E

HEUZÉ — Nationalized and internationalized Hinduism Hinduism {{might be}} the set of {{religious}} practices and ideologies which endured the deepest evolution during the past thirty years. The process of change {{was the result of}} a long maturation made of reformism and reaction combined and com- plexely interacting. New phenomenas as the rise of unemployed youth, specific <b>inferiority</b> <b>complexes</b> and armed confrontations, helped to pave the way for a new kind of hinduism and hindu attitudes, nationalist, politicised, somewhat centralised and more and more simple. The contribution explains how the complex set of communal attitudes and history between hindus and muslims have helped to promote this evolution. It also introduces the major role played by the polemics about a small mosque of the Gangetic Plain. As it is finally argued, the process of internationalisation of hindu perspectives and organisations is related to its nationalisation. G. Heuzé Djallal. L'hindouisme nationalisé et internationalisé.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the issue of the {{correlation}} between cultural, social, psychological and physical types of the gender-based violence and сastrate practices. It has been concluded by the author that castration is the process of the suppression of the low-flown groups’ ability to identify their own potential in various spheres of cultural, social, psychological and biological life made by status and dominant groups. Male castration in the gender culture leads to a set of pathological complexes, which integrate into the gender socialization and cause the slowdown of men’s productive aggression at work, communication, sexual activity, creativity. Somatic castration {{is considered to be a}} set of «final» physical consequences of cultural, social and psychological injuries that are inflicted to boy, young man, man by the social environment. Effects of castrate practices occur when the man start doubting about his usefulness and ceases to be a subject of social life. This enables his comprehensive addiction and over-exploitation. Cultural violence and castrate practices arise from the deprivation of men’s self-reference, moral, ethical and legal authority in society. Social violence and castrate practices include institutional (social-spatial and social-temporal) restrictions of men’s realization in various spheres of mankind’s self-realization being a social-gender group. Psychological violence and castrate practices enable the vaccination of different complexes, which are aimed at the reduction of level of men’s subjectivity, in particular, complexes of guilt and <b>inferiority,</b> <b>complexes</b> of doubts about the role matching, etc. Somatic violence and castrate practices form the ground level of the gender violence, enabling the occurrence of negative somatic effects, such as illnesses, deviant habits and premature death...|$|R
