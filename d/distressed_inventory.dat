40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the anatomical and functional outcomes of posterior intravaginal slingplasty (P-IVS) {{for the treatment of}} a vaginal vault or uterine prolapse (VP/UP). Materials and Methods: This was a 12 -month prospective, multicenter, observational study. Women aged over 30 years who presented with stage II or greater VP/UP underwent P-IVS by four urologists at four university hospitals. Preoperatively, pelvic examination by use of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system, the Pelvic Floor <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory</b> (PFDI) questionnaire, the 3 -day frequency volume chart, and uroflowmetry were completed. At the 12 -month follow-up, changes in the POP-Q, PFDI, frequency volume chart, and uroflowmetry parameters were assessed. Cure was defined as VP/UP stage 0 and improvement as stage I.

40|$|Study objective: To {{assess the}} {{incidence}} of urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction, and sexual problems after laparoscopic hysterectomy as compared with abdominal hysterectomy. Design: Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification 1). Setting: Single-center teaching hospital in the Netherlands, experienced in gynecologic minimal access surgery. Patients: Women with a benign or malignant condition scheduled for hysterectomy where vaginal hysterectomy was not feasible and laparoscopic hysterectomy was possible. Interventions: Laparoscopic (n = 38) and abdominal hysterectomy (n = 38). Measurements and main results: Patients were asked before and 3 months after surgery whether they experienced urinary incontinence and completed the validated questionnaires Urogenital <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory,</b> Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, Defecatory <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory,</b> and the Questionnaire for screening Sexual Dysfunctions 1 year after surgery. The incidence of urinary incontinence at 3 months after surgery decreased equally in both groups as compared with baseline. De novo urinary incontinence and sexual problems were rare. One year after surgery, a significant treatment effect favoring laparoscopic hysterectomy {{was found in the}} Urogenital <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory</b> and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, whereas no differences were found in the Defecatory <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory</b> and Questionnaire for screening Sexual Dysfunctions.

From January 2000 to June 2006, consecutive patients with confirmed stage 2 - 4 vaginal vault prolapse subsequently had a MSC. Detailed telephone interviews using the Cleveland Clinic Short Form- 20 Pelvic Floor <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory</b> (PFDI) questionnaire, with Urinary <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory</b> (UDI), Pelvic Organ Prolapse <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory</b> (POPDI) and Colorectal-Anal <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory</b> (CRADI) subscales was completed by all patients to assess symptoms before and after MSC, improvement in sexual function and overall satisfaction. In all, 21 patients had abdominal MSC; the median (range) follow-up was 52. 2 (21 - 99) months. Total PFDI scores were significantly better after MSC (mean 44. 0 / 300) than before (mean 113. 9 / 300; P < 0. 001). Analysis of the subscale scores showed that all patients reported a significant improvement of symptoms in the POPDI category (P < 0. 001). CRADI subscale scores showed no significant change after MSC (before, mean 7. 43 / 100 vs after 8. 47 / 100; P = 0. 542). There was an improvement of urinary symptoms on the UDI subscale after MSC but it was not statistically significant (P = 0. 08). Analysis of score differences over time after MSC showed an insignificant decreasing slope (P = 0. 227), suggesting long-term stability of symptoms after surgery; 90 % of patients reported a significant improvement in sexual function and excellent long-term overall satisfaction with MSC.

40|$|In many industries, the {{internet}} has increased price transparency and led to fierce price compe-tition. We propose a new business model that leverages the strength of {{the internet}}- specifically the ability to interact directly with its consumers- to customize prices for individual consumers in ways that do not trigger price responses by the competition. A web-based Interactive Pricing Response (IPR) system was developed for Freedom Air, a former low cost subsidiary of Air New Zealand. By targeting highly time-flexible travelers, the IPR system provides a mechanism by which airlines can generate incremental revenue by selling <b>distressed</b> <b>inventory</b> to price-sensitive consumers who are highly time-flexible (e. g., willing to travel any week within a four-week period). Empirical results show customer search and purchase behavior is highly predictable and driven by relative discounts. Most important, customer behavior can be directly integrated into the IPR system, effectively allowing managers to set conversion rates and relative discount rates offered in the market as a function of two key customer searching parameters. We believe that non-aviation industries can adapt our business model to target price-sensitive customers willing to delay pur-chases in exchange for discounts, thereby allowing firms to more effectively manage supply and demand without making discount levels transparent to competitors. ...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: In {{selected}} populations, pelvic organ prolapse (POP) {{was associated}} with bladder/bowel symptoms, but data on the general female population are lacking. Our aim was to obtain normative data on the prevalence of POP and pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) symptoms and signs and to identify associations. METHODS: Validated questionnaires on POP and PFD (urogenital <b>distress</b> <b>inventory,</b> (UDI) and defaecation <b>distress</b> <b>inventory</b> (DDI)) were sent to a general population of 2, 979 women (aged 45 - 85 years). Data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, chi square test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Response rate was 62. 7 %. Associations between POP stage and parity (0. 002) and vaginal bulging (< 0. 001) are significant. Anatomical locations of POP and PFD symptoms correlated significantly with incontinence of flatus, feeling anal prolapse, manual evacuation of stool, vaginal bulging, constipation and pain during faecal urge (p < or = 0. 005).

Those with baseline and 1 -year questionnaires (Colorectal-Anal <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory</b> (CRADI) and the Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire (CRAIQ)) were included. 2 ̆ 2 Bothersome 2 ̆ 2 CRADI symptoms (score 3 ̆e 2 (2 ̆ 2 moderately 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 quite a bit 2 ̆ 2)) were identified. CRADI and CRAIQ scores were compared, and postoperative symptom resolution and new symptom development were measured. RESULTS: Of 121 (80...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of multimodal supervised physiotherapy programs with the absence of treatment among women with persistent postnatal stress urinary incontinence. METHODS: This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Sixty-four women with stress urinary incontinence were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of either multimodal pelvic floor rehabilitation (n = 21), multimodal pelvic floor rehabilitation with abdominal muscle training (n = 23), or control non–pelvic floor rehabilitation (n = 20). The primary outcome measure consisted of a modified 20 -minute pad test. The secondary outcome measures included a Visual Analog Scale describing the perceived burden of incontinence, the Urogenital <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory,</b> the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, and pelvic floor muscle function measurements. RESULTS: Two patients dropped out, leaving 62 for analysis. At follow-up, more than 70 % of the women in the treatment groups (14 / 20 in the pelvic floor and 17 / 23 in the pelvic floor plus abdominal group) were continent on pad testing compared with 0 % of women in the control group. Scores on the pad test, Visual Analog Scale, Urogenital <b>Distress</b> <b>Inventory,</b> and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire improved significantly in both treatment groups (all P <. 002), whereas no changes were observed in the control group. Pelvic floor muscle function, however, did not improve significantly in either active group. CONCLUSION: Multimodal supervised pelvic floor physiotherapy is an effective treatment for persistent postnatal stress urinary incontinence...|$|R
