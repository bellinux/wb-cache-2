40|$|Objectives. The {{formation}} {{of the structure of}} hardened concrete grouting with two-stage expansion is a complex process that is influenced by many factors, both of a prescriptive nature (composition and additive dosage, mineralogical composition of Portland cement clinker, concrete composition, the presence of chemical additives) and in terms of process (the fineness of cement grinding, temperature of curing, etc.). Methods. In order {{to assess the impact of}} the above factors, the article proposes the introduction of a number of integrated indicators being characterised as a process in which influences are shown alongside the factor generating the influence. For the evaluation of the influence of different factors on the process of gas generation, an effectiveness ratio of gas generation is proposed by the authors. Results. The article presents the results of an investigation into the influence of the amount of <b>gassing</b> <b>agent</b> and the type and dosage of superplasticiser on the process of gassing by means of the displacement method on the mortar mix. The authors similarly propose a expansion efficiency coefficient. The article presents the results of the investigation into the influence of the amount of <b>gassing</b> <b>agent,</b> the presence and amount of superplasticiser, the sand/cement ratio, aggregate size and water-cement ratio during the first stage of expansion of the mixture. The authors propose a formula for describing the dependence of the relative expansion deformations on the concentration of filler. In order to assess the conditions in which a mixture is present, it is proposed to use an indicator consisting in the constraint expansion coefficient. Conclusion. Use of the hardening condition coefficient is proposed as a means of accounting for the effect of curing conditions on the strength of the concrete grouting with two-stage expansion. The authors recommend taking the introduction of correction factors into account when considering the impact of formulation and technological factors. </p...|$|E

40|$|The fire {{suppression}} {{characteristics of a}} selection of clean extinguishing agents were examined employing Under-writers Laboratories Standards UL 2166 (halocarbon agents) and UL 2127 (inert <b>gas</b> <b>agents).</b> Agents tested includ-ed HFC- 227 ea (FM- 20 Om), HFC- 23, HFC- 125, NAF-S-Ill, Inergen (IG- 541), and nitrogen.

In contrast, for the inert <b>gas</b> <b>agents</b> the most challenging fire was found to be the wood crib fire; at concentrations capable of readily extinguishing the plastic sheet fires, the inert <b>gas</b> <b>agents</b> were unable to provide sufficient cooling to prevent re-ignition of the wood crib following a 10 -min soak period. lNTRODUCTION Underwriters Laboratories has recently published new standard test methodologies for the evaluation of clean agent fire extinguishing systems, the successful completion of which will be required for the listing of clean extinguishing agent systems [l, 21.

40|$|The {{release of}} methyl {{isocyanate}} in Bhopal, India, caused the worst industrial accident in history. Exposures to industrial isocyanates induce lacrimation, pain, airway irritation, and edema. Similar responses are elicited by chemicals used as tear gases. Despite frequent exposures, the biological targets of isocyanates and tear gases in vivo {{have not been}} identified, precluding the development of effective countermeasures. We use Ca 2 + imaging and electrophysiology {{to show that the}} noxious effects of isocyanates and those of all major tear <b>gas</b> <b>agents</b> are caused by activation of Ca 2 + influx and membrane currents in mustard oil-sensitive sensory neurons. These responses are mediated by transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA 1), an ion channel serving as a detector for reactive chemicals. In mice, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of TRPA 1 dramatically reduces isocyanate- and tear gas-induced nocifensive behavior after both ocular and cutaneous exposures. We conclude that isocyanates and tear <b>gas</b> <b>agents</b> target the same neuronal receptor, TRPA 1. Treatment with TRPA 1 antagonists may prevent and alleviate chemical irritation of the eyes, skin, and airways and reduce the adverse health effects of exposures {{to a wide range of}} toxic noxious chemicals. —Bessac, B.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Considering its {{advantage}} of low density and favorable insulation properties, {{there are several}} applications for lightweight autoclaved aerated concrete of uniform cellular structure. The raw materials for the manufacturing of cellular concrete are Portland cement, finely grounded sand and lime. These are batched and mixed with water and metallic aluminum powder finely divided. There is a reaction between the aluminum powder and hydroxides forming millions of hydrogen bubbles throughout the mixture. The aluminum powder is the highest cost component, and {{the objective of this}} work is replacing it for another <b>gas</b> forming <b>agent,</b> like recycled foil. The foils are grinded in a high energy ball mill (attritor). Quartz sand is mixed with aluminum foil to reduce the time required for grinding, obtaining spherical particles and ensuring a uniform distribution of aluminum in the <b>gas</b> forming <b>agent.</b> The activity of this <b>gas</b> forming <b>agent</b> was determined by the gas volumetric technique. Average particle size and compressive strength of the samples were measured. The relationship between volume of the gas released during the reaction and milling conditions are presented, showing its viability for producing a high quality cellular concrete...|$|R
