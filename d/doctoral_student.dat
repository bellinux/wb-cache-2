5|$|Rabi chaired Columbia's physics {{department}} from 1945 to 1949, {{during which}} time it was home to two Nobel laureates (Rabi and Enrico Fermi) and eleven future laureates, including seven faculty (Polykarp Kusch, Willis Lamb, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, James Rainwater, Norman Ramsey, Charles Townes and Hideki Yukawa), a research scientist (Aage Bohr), a visiting professor (Hans Bethe), a <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> (Leon Lederman) and an undergraduate (Leon Cooper). Martin L. Perl, a <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> of Rabi's, won the Nobel Prize in 1995. When Columbia created the rank of University Professor in 1964, Rabi {{was the first to}} receive such a chair. This meant that he was free to research or teach whatever he chose. He retired from teaching in 1967 but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus until his death. A special chair was named after him in 1985.|$|E

5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This {{laid the groundwork for}} Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was the basis of his attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{worked with}} his first <b>doctoral</b> <b>student,</b> Melba Phillips, on {{calculations}} of artificial radioactivity under bombardment by deuterons. When Ernest Lawrence and Edwin McMillan bombarded nuclei with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with the predictions of George Gamow, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not conform to the theory. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips worked out a theory {{now known as the}} Oppenheimer–Phillips process to explain the results, a theory still in use today.|$|E
5|$|A <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the}} first woman elected to {{membership}} in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E

Iranian PhD students are the second big majority of international <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> in Sweden (UKÄ, 2013). In this thesis the culture related experiences of Iranian <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> in Sweden are studied in a communicative perspective. The different cultural dimensions of Persian and Swedish culture are discussed. The social and academic integration of Iranian <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> and their probable obstacles are studied, {{as well as their}} manner of confrontation and coping with the adjustment process in a new environment. The culture shock period, its different stages, and its impacts on the integration of the subjects are analyzed. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are employed. As the main data of this study are the narratives and micro-experiences of <b>doctoral</b> <b>students,</b> qualitative method is the dominant method used. 11 Iranian <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> were interviewed in semi-structured face to face interviews. Moreover, the quantitative data were gathered through questioners which were designed and distributed among 30 Iranian <b>doctoral</b> <b>students.</b> Data are categorized according to the different cultural dimensions of Persian and Swedish culture, culture shock period, integration and adjustment requirements, and significant explanations of the interviewees. Results are presented, summarized, and then discussed in relation to theoretical terms. This study reveals that socio-cultural knowledge, and being aware of intercultural communication patterns contributes to promote the social and academic integration of international <b>doctoral</b> <b>students.</b> Recommendations for improving the adjustment and integration of international students are presented at the end...|$|R
5|$|The locals saw Meiklejohn as an outsider. He was {{foreign to}} Madison in his politics, social life, and personality. Dean Sellery and President Frank's {{professional}} relationship was untrusting and contemptuous, which extended to Meiklejohn {{due to his}} close association with Frank. Sellery {{had the support of}} the faculty, who were envious of the Experimental College advisers' arrangements for higher salaries. In objection to the college's reputation for radicalism, the son of the man who endowed Meiklejohn's professorship revoked his funding. Frank needed the donor's support, and so the incident marked Frank's waning support for the college. Sellery spoke out against the Experimental College {{in the first quarter of}} 1929, and Frank attempted to fire him in response. In 1931, Sellery received letters from spies who found Meiklejohn's son Donald, a philosophy <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> at the university and a part-time Experimental College adviser, engaged in sex acts against university policy. Sellery pursued expulsion and denied Meiklejohn and his son's separate requests for a lesser punishment. A week later, Meiklejohn asked the advisers to close the college.|$|E

30|$|A look at {{different}} career paths in Table  2, Panel C, reveals a few {{differences in the}} specific type of empirical research adopted by some <b>doctoral</b> <b>students.</b> <b>Doctoral</b> <b>students</b> {{who would like to}} stay in academia are more likely to use commercial databases for their empirical research, while <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> who see their future in practice more often use surveys. Moreover, the table shows that no significant differences between career paths in academia and practice exist with respect to verbal-analytical research. In fact, nearly 60 % of <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> aiming at a position in academia (also) employ verbal-analytical reasoning in their dissertation. Although this difference is not significant, it is also noteworthy that prospective academics tend to adopt multiple methods, while a larger proportion of <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> going into practice uses only a single method in their dissertations.|$|R

40|$|Aim/Purpose: This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} supervisors’ discipline expertise in doctoral learning from a <b>student</b> perspective. Background:	<b>Doctoral</b> <b>students</b> need to develop expertise in a particular field of study. In this context, developing expertise requires <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> to master disciplinary knowledge, conventions and scholarship {{under the guidance of}} supervisors. Methodology	: The study draws on a mixed-method approach, using an online survey and semi-structured interviews conducted with <b>doctoral</b> <b>students.</b> Contribution: The paper brings to the fore the role of supervisors’ discipline expertise on doctoral students’ research progress. Findings: The survey data suggest that <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> nominate their supervisors {{on the basis of their}} discipline expertise. They also view supervisors’ expertise as key to the development of ‘insider’ knowledge of their doctoral research. Recommendations for Practitioners: Supervisors play a pivotal role in helping <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> overcome intellectual barriers by imparting their discipline knowledge as well as balancing satisfactory doctoral completion rate and high quality student experience. Impact on Society	: Doctoral supervision equips <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> with the right arsenal to be able to competently operate within their field and prepares them for their future research or professional career that demands a high level of discipline expertise. Future Research:	The scope of the findings leaves open a discussion about the experiences of <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> matched with non-discipline expert supervisory teams; for example, the extent of the mismatch and its ramifications...|$|R
