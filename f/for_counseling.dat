They found the remnants of several Molotov cocktails, a number of shotgun shells and the charred remains of Jones' pet dog, which had perished in the fire. Because Jones' suicide was witnessed by children, this led many to criticize Los Angeles television stations' practice of airing police pursuits live.

Of the approached patients some chose to receive a DNA test result (n = 58), some were approached but did not fulfill criteria for referral (n = 118) and some declined counseling and/or testing (n = 44). The comparative group consisted of patients not eligible <b>for</b> genetic <b>counseling</b> (n = 182) and was therefore not approached. Patients actively approached <b>for</b> genetic <b>counseling</b> showed no more long-term distress than patients not eligible <b>for</b> such <b>counseling.</b> There were no differences between the subgroups of approached patients.

Patients could seek out such advice on their own, but would not be required to. The provision would limit Medicare coverage to one consultation every five years. Rep.
