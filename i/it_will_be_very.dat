500|$|Throughout {{the bidding}} process and {{leading up to}} the vote at the 117th IOC Session, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, {{particularly}} as its bid was the city's third in recent history (previous bids being for 1992 and 2008). London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin, but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of Sebastian Coe as the head of London 2012, on 19 May 2004. In late August 2004, reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris. In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest. On 1 July 2005, IOC president Jacques Rogge, when asked who the winner would be, told the assembled press, [...] "I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less." ...|$|E

Surtr will ride in front, and both before and behind him there will be burning fire. His sword will be very fine. Light will shine from it more brightly than from the sun." [...] High continues that when the sons of Múspell ride over the bridge Bifröst it will break, {{and that they will}} continue to the field of Vígríðr. The wolf Fenrir and the Midgard Serpent will also arrive there. By then, Loki will have arrived with [...] "all of Hel's people", Hrym, and all of the frost jötnar; [...] "but Muspell's sons will have their own battle array; <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> bright". Further into the chapter, High describes that a fierce battle will erupt between these forces and the Æsir, and that during this, Surtr and Freyr will engage in battle [...] "and there will be a harsh conflict before Freyr falls". High adds that the cause of Freyr's death will be that Freyr is lacking [...] "the good sword" [...] that he once gave his servant Skírnir.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the band's catalog of music was written by Yoshiki with relatively little composition from the other members. hide contributed several songs, including the single [...] "Scars", while Pata's only claim is [...] "White Wind from Mr. Martin ~Pata's Nap~". Toshi's contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs. Taiji contributed music {{to a couple of}} songs, notably [...] "Voiceless Screaming" [...] from the album Jealousy, for which, when performed live, he played the acoustic guitar, and Desperate Angel. Heath's only writing credit is the instrumental song [...] "Wriggle" [...] on the 1996 album Dahlia, which he wrote with Pata. Only one song is credited as a full band collaboration, [...] "Easy Fight Rambling" [...] on the 1989 album Blue Blood. Of songs from the band's lesser-known former members, only the track [...] "Time Trip Loving" [...] from the single [...] "Orgasm", composed by Jun with Toshi writing the lyrics, was officially released. In 2010 it was reported that Sugizo had written some songs, though no further information has been given since. That year, Yoshiki claimed that their new material was [...] "pretty much the same thing, maybe a little edgier." [...] However, in 2014 he specifically stated it will not be the same as before, adding that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> heavy, melodic, and [...] "more contemporary." ...|$|E

We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E
500|$|In March 2006, Warner Bros. hired screenwriter William Monahan {{to adapt}} the novel Penetration by David Ignatius into a feature film, which would be {{directed}} by Ridley Scott. In April 2007, with the novel re-titled Body of Lies and the film similarly re-titled, actor Leonardo DiCaprio was cast in the lead role. DiCaprio chose to pursue the role because he considered it a throwback to political films in the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). DiCaprio dyed his hair brown, and wore brown contacts for the role. After DiCaprio was cast, Russell Crowe was courted for a supporting role, to which he formally committed after Monahan's script was revised by Steve Zaillian, who wrote Scott and Crowe's American Gangster. Crowe gained 63 pounds to suit his role. The actor said {{as a result of}} the film's exploration of the American government and foreign policy, [...] "I don't think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> popular, but that’s never been part of my project choice process." [...] Mark Strong, who plays Hani Salaam, the head of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate (GID) ascribed his casting to his performances in the 2005 films Syriana and Oliver Twist. The character Haani Salaam was modelled after the 2000–2005 GID chief Saad Kheir (1953–2009), whose involvement, according to the original author David Ignatius, in sharply handled interrogations without use of torture, an encounter with a jihadist with his mother on the phone and being called the 'fingernail boss' were near accurately featured in the film.|$|E

500|$|Borussia {{were drawn}} against Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic in the quarter–finals, {{the first leg}} was drawn 0–0 draw in Prague. The draw was {{significant}} {{because it was the}} first time in the competition, that Liberec had failed to win at home. Dortmund won the second leg 4–0, after goals from Márcio Amoroso on 51 minutes, Jan Koller on 57 minutes, Lars Ricken on 70 minutes, and finally Ewerthon on 89 minutes. Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi-finals, when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe; Milan. Nevertheless, Borussia won the first leg 4–0, after a hat-trick from Márcio Amoroso, and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result, stating that, [...] "We knew they had quick strikers. I am more surprised by the terrible performance of our team. The problem stemmed from the wings. I had no reason to change the team because Rui Costa has not trained for ten days. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult but it is our duty to give it our best and to try and qualify." [...] In the second leg, Milan won 3–1, with Filippo Inzaghi, and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes. However, Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph Metzelder. With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time, Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final.|$|E

2500|$|The Cycle Super Highways are {{a series}} of bike paths that connect Copenhagen to nearby suburbs.

While international media has created some hyperbole around the concept, labelling the network as bicycle superhighways, they are largely not grade separated. Rather the routes are regular cycle tracks receiving smaller targeted upgrades.|$|E
2500|$|Benazir Bhutto was prime {{minister}} {{at a time}} of great racial tension in Pakistan. Her approval poll rose by 38% after she appeared and said in a private television interview after the elections: [...] "We are unhappy with the manner in which tampered electoral lists were provided in a majority of constituencies; our voters were turned away." [...] The Conservatives attracted voters from religious society (MMA) whose support had collapsed. The Friday Times noted [...] "Both of them (Nawaz and Benazir) have done so badly in the past, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult for them to do worse now. If Bhutto's government fails, everyone knows there will be no new elections. The army will take over". In confidential official documents Benazir Bhutto had objected to the number of Urdu speaking class in 1993 elections, in context that she had no Urdu-speaking sentiment in her circle and discrimination was continued even in her government. Her stance on these issues was perceived as part of rising public disclosure which Altaf Hussain called [...] "racism". Due to Benazir Bhutto's stubbornness and authoritative actions, her political rivals gave her the nickname [...] "Iron Lady" [...] of Pakistan.
