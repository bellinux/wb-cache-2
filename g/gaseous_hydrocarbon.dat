50|$|The first can of {{pressurized}} {{shaving cream}} was Rise shaving cream, which {{was introduced by}} Carter-Wallace in 1949. By the following decade this format attained two-thirds of the American market for shaving preparations. The gas in shaving cream canisters originally contained chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), but this substance was increasingly believed to be detrimental to the Earth's ozone layer. This led to restrictions or reductions in CFC use, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency ban in the late 1970s. <b>Gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> propellants such as mixtures of pentane, propane, butane and isobutane could be used instead of the CFCs. Because of the large proportion of water in pressurized shaving cream, the risk from the normally flammable hydrocarbons was reduced.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{study shows}} {{that most of the}} drilled wells {{containing}} the Siwalik formation (Upper, Middle, and Lower Siwalik) indicates poor source rock potential. The organically rich Subathu samples in the form of coal showed high potential by having total organic content levels up to 80%. Despite the high TOC levels, the coals exhibit low hydrogen index which indicates a potential of gaseous hydrocarbons only. Furthermore, it is assumed that the <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> potential by them may have been lost by tectonic events that occurred in the basin. This is evident by palynological rock study that further indicates of more than 96% of the samples taken from the Subathu Formation was organically lean.

The component analysis of the products with Gas Chromatographs is carried out and the <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> gaseous products were compared with the conventional liquefied petroleum gas components. The paper produces some scope for the possibilities of production of C 3 and C 4 components as useful domestic and industrial fuel.

30|$|Hydrocarbon {{expulsion}} ratio model {{indicates the}} relative ratios between {{oil and gas}} generated by the source rock, which will indirectly indicate type of kerogen present and thermal maturity state of the source rock. As the formation consists of both kerogen type II–III and type III, {{there will be a}} mixture of both oil and gas in the hydrocarbon generation and this is reflected in Fig.  17. A transformation ratio of 12 % shows that until the present, the Taratu Formation has expelled more oil relative to gas as the oil window has been reached in 51  Ma upon thermal maturity. This also confirms the presence of kerogen type II/III and III present in the Taratu Formation.

40|$|It is {{important}} to look at converting methane into larger molecular weight hydrocarbons because the worlds 2 ̆ 7 supply of natural gas {{is equivalent to the}} worlds 2 ̆ 7 crude oil reserves. There are known processes such as the Fischer Tropsch process that can convert methane into larger molecular weight hydrocarbons but this process and other known processes are generally multistep processes. The study of using methane plasmas to produce larger molecular weight hydrocarbons {{is important}} because the plasma process converts methane to larger molecular weight hydrocarbons in a single step. ^ A methane plasma can produce liquid, polymeric, and <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> products. Previous plasma research has focused on characterizing only one product. In this study all the products that form in a methane plasma in both a microwave plasma and in a tubular dielectric barrier discharge reactor were studied. A new sampling system was developed for the microwave plasma system to better determine product selectivity and conversion. ^ Using the new sampling system the overall conversion of methane in both plasma systems could be modeled as a zero order plug flow reactor. The reaction rate constant was modified to be dependent on pressure and voltage or power. The modifications to the reaction rate constants were consistent with Huang and Suib. ^ Previous plasma studies reported either acetylene or ethane as the most abundant <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> product. Only one person has been able to produce either ethane or acetylene as the most abundant hydrocarbon gaseous product. The microwave plasma system was able to produce either acetylene or ethane as the most abundant <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> product. The specific energy (kJ/mole) of methane was important in determining whether ethane or acetylene is the most abundant <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> product. ^ In microwave systems, high surface area catalysts have been used to convert methane into larger hydrocarbons. In the tubular reactor the electrode was coated with different metals and even though the electrode had a relatively low surface area catalytic affects have been reported for water splitting, CO 2 decomposition, and NO reduction. By studying all the products and reactor conditions the specific energy of the tubular reactor was reduced to prevent polymer formation so that a catalytic effect was found with methane by using electrodes of different metals. A catalytic cycle was also demonstrated in the plasma system, which no plasma catalyst study had ever reported. ...|$|E
