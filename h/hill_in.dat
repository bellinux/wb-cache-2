5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill and building a large <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> Rødkleiva, or building a new <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> Holmenkollen and building a small <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built at the location of the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported building a large <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{the venue}} was {{upgraded}} for €1 million by installing a K60 inrun between the normal and large hill. This allowed the medium inrun {{to use the}} same outrun as the normal <b>hill.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, a small K25 hill, named Ninoufbakken, was installed slightly away from the main hills. The venue's certificate was due to expire in 2011, after which the venue would have to meet the International Ski Federation's (FIS) latest regulations. A €1.5 million upgrade program was initiated, which saw the inruns renovated, including installation of the Ski-Line track system and new Porsgrund ceramic tracks. The outruns saw new plastic mats and a new sprinkler system. The Nordic House, a sports centre, was also built. Construction started on the normal <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> May 2011 and on the large <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> August 2011, with completion scheduled for early 2012.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the fourteenth century, in {{addition}} to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period, were being used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred. These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon <b>Hill</b> <b>in</b> 1333 and Humbleton <b>Hill</b> <b>in</b> 1402.|$|E
