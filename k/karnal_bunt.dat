50|$|<b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> attacks durum wheat, rye, and triticale, {{a hybrid}} of wheat and rye. Despite its {{preference}} for a common crop, <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> can be extremely difficult to diagnose {{in the field for}} many reasons. First, not all kernels on a plant head will be infected, and thus infected plants are not as readily identifiable. This distribution is the reason for Karnal bunt's being referred to as partial bunt. Another factor which makes <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> difficult to readily diagnose in the field is the fact that most infected kernels do not show symptoms prior to maturity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> (also {{known as}} partial bunt) is a fungal disease of wheat, durum wheat, and triticale. The smut fungus Tilletia indica, a basidiomycete, invades the kernels and obtains {{nutrients}} from the endosperm, leaving behind waste products with a disagreeable odor that makes bunted kernels too unpalatable {{for use in}} flour or pasta. While <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> generally {{does not lead to}} devastating crop losses, {{it has the potential to}} dramatically decrease yield and poses additional economic concerns through quarantines which limit the export of suspected infectious wheat products from certain areas, including the U.S. Several chemical control methods exist for <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> of wheat, but much work remains to be done in identifying resistant host varieties.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> {{accounts}} for yield losses of approximately 0.5% annually, which is negligible. Some fields of particularly susceptible wheat cultivars in India, however, have suffered losses {{of up to}} 40% in the past, but such events are rare. Significant economic losses in wheat crops occur due to quarantine and other export restrictions placed on infected areas. [...] Furthermore, <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> of wheat poses no threat to human life in the United States as regulations deem wheat containing more than 3% bunted kernels {{unfit for human consumption}} and these crops are instead used in animal feed.|$|E
50|$|In {{recognition}} {{of one of}} his last official duties for the County of Riverside in 1996, Gill received a Special Commendation and Appreciation from the United States Secretary of Agriculture for his identification and monitoring of <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> disease.

50|$|Tilletia walkeri is {{a species}} of fungus in the Tilletiaceae family. It causes the disease Ryegrass bunt, which affects ryegrass. The fungus is related to those causing <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> in wheat. The species was {{described}} in 1999.|$|E

5000|$|The disease {{produces}} dark {{color and}} a fishy smell on infected kernels. Usually only the germ {{end of the}} kernel will show symptoms, but occasionally the entire kernel may appear diseased. The darkening of the kernel {{is a result of}} the kernel tissue being converted in a teleospore mass by the fungus. Another symptom is referred to as the [...] "canoe symptom" [...] as in the process of replacing the healthy kernel with teliospores, the disease tends to hollow out host kernels, resulting in a canoe shape. While the dark teliospores of the fungus may be diagnostic, diagnosis of <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> poses the added difficulty of differentiating between <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> from other infections which also result in the aforementioned symptoms, such as black point, common bunt, and dwarf bunt.|$|E
50|$|<b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> {{is named}} after Karnal, India, where the disease was first {{discovered}} on a wheat crop in 1931.

40|$|Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is {{the main}} staple food crop and major source of {{nutrition}} {{for the people of}} Pakistan. Many factors contribute to low yield in Pakistan, diseases being one of them. <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> (partial bunt) of wheat caused by Tilletia indica (Mitra) Mundkur, causes considerable losses in the yield of wheat. The disease not only reduces the weight of grains, but also deteriorates its quality and makes it unacceptable for human and animal consumption. The pathogen infects the ovaries in the emerging wheat heads and converts the grains partially or completely into dark colored powdery masses of teliospores. The diseased fields emit a foul smell like that of rotten fish due to production of trimethylamine. <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> can reduce wheat yields. <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> differs from other diseases of wheat in that the pathogen infects plants during anthesis and it sporulates on the same generation of the host which it infects. Neither all spikes of plant nor all grains in spike are affected by the disease and usually a few irregularly distributed kernels are bunted. Its spores remain viable in soil for a long period. Teliospores are very resistant to adverse environmental conditions. Although many control strategies have been suggested for the management of <b>karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> disease and the strategies include seed treatment with hot water and solar energy, seed treatment with fungicides and soil drenching with fungicides, however, the results were not convincing.

40|$|Technical trade {{barriers}} (TBTs) {{have become increasingly}} important barriers to trade. In agricultural trade, they are often implemented as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures. <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt,</b> a fungal disease of wheat, is one example where these types of measures have been implemented. ^ The United States led the campaign to list <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> as a quarantine pest. However, in 1996, <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> was detected {{in areas of the}} Southwestern United States. Officials opted to quarantine infected areas to maintain established trading relationships with countries listing <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> as a quarantine pest. This allowed the United States to continue exporting wheat. Since 1996, the fungus has spread to additional counties in the southwest. Four counties in north central Texas on the southern border of the wheat belt have been affected. It is possible that <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> may spread into other portions of the wheat belt. ^ This study examines the current incidence of <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> on the U.

A disease spread model simulates the potential spread of <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt</b> into Kansas, and the loss in production. Over a seven year period, this model indicates 6. 6 percent of Kansas production is quarantined. Results show an average increase in the wheat price of 0. 8 percent causes feed, ending stocks, and food demand to decline. Production increases in the original quarantine area {{and the rest of the}} United States, but declines in Kansas due to continual spread of <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt.</b> U.

Given that wheat accounts for 80 percent of the cost of milling flour, an increase in the wheat price lowers returns to operating capital. Alternatively, if these returns are assumed to be held constant, the increase in the wheat price is passed on to the consumer through a higher flour price. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper compares two {{previously}} established meteorological modelling methods when determining {{areas in}} Western Australia (WA) where conditions are favourable for infection of wheat (Triticum aestivum) by Tilletia indica, {{the cause of}} <b>Karnal</b> <b>bunt.</b> There was a strong correlation (r = 0. 83) between the Humid Thermal Index (HTI) model, which used long-term, average-monthly data, and the rainfall model, {{which was based on}} the per cent chance of at least three Suitable Rain Events (SRE) during the susceptible period (August to October). Results suggest that northern wheat growing areas are too hot and dry (HTI 3, chance of SRE 68 - 97 %), eastern areas are marginal to too hot and dry (HTI around 2. 2, chance of SRE 24 - 50 %), and western areas are suitable (HTI between 2. 2 and 3. 3, chance of SRE 41 - 78 %). The between and within year analysis indicated that infection was more likely to occur if anthesis occurred in northern areas in August, in October in southern areas, in September in eastern areas, and in August, September, and October in western and south-eastern areas.

The wild germplasm of wheat, however, represent a rich and still unexploited source for KB resistance. Here we report the evaluation of Aegilops tauschii germplasm for KB resistance, identification of resistance sources and transfer of resistance to T. aestivum. A collection of 183 accessions of Ae. tauschii, were screened under artificial inoculation with a mixture of nine KB isolates for 2 - 3 years in a specially designed screen house. Twenty-two accessions of Ae. tauschii were found to be highly resistant whereas 10 were moderately resistant. For transferring KB resistance to hexaploid wheat, a synthetic amphiploid between a KB resistant Ae. tauschii accession (# 3743) and KB susceptible T. durum cultivar was crossed with KB susceptible elite wheat cultivar. Homozygous introgression lines (ILs) derived from this cross were evaluated extensively for KB resistance under field as well as screen house conditions for four years (2004 - 2007). Mean KB incidence in KB resistant ILs ranged from 0 - 1. 2 % compared to 10. 7 % in the recipient parent and 30 % in a highly susceptible cultivar.
