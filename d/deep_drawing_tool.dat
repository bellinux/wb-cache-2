To reduce the error rate, an intelligent <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>tool</b> was developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU in cooperation with Audi and Volkswagen. Mechatronic components in a closed-loop control is the main differentiating factor between an intelligent and a conventional <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>tool.</b> In correlation with sensors for process monitoring, the intelligent tool consists of piezoelectric actuators to actuate the deep drawing process. By enabling the usage of sensors and actuators at the die, the forming tool transform to a smart structure. The interface between sensors and actuators will be realized with a closed-loop control. The content of this research will present the experimental results with the piezoelectric actuator. For the analysis a production-oriented forming tool with all automotive requirements were used. The disposed actuators are monolithic multilayer actuators of the piezo injector system. In order to achieve required force, the actuators are combined in a cluster.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the number}} of low-volume cars, such as fun cars increased. The batch size for these cars is {{in the range of}} 5, 000 up to 100, 000. Common <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> for the mass {{production}} of car body panels are made of steel or cast iron. They can be used for more than 1 million parts but their manufacturing is time-consuming and costly. The reason for this project was the lack of low-cost and less time-consuming manufacturing concepts for small batch production <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>tools.</b> The method of resolution was based on one category of rapid tooling technology which involves the application of advanced polymers to fabricate metal forming dies. Despite their advantages in production and cost reductions, polymer dies for sheet metal forming application have several drawbacks. Due to their lack of strength compared to steel or cast iron, the use of polymer dies was limited to a production rate below 1, 000 parts. The intention of this project was a significant durability improvement of polyurethane made <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>tools.</b> PVD coating and thermal coating (flame spraying and plasma spraying) have been investigated as well as the modification of polyurethane by tribological favourable additives. In fact of extensive efforts on the area of PVD coating and thermal coating was the result dissatisfying. The adhesive strength of the coatings was basically and essentially unsound, therefore the activities with this coatings have been quit. In terms of durability improvement the modified polyurethane performed very well. On this base tooling concepts have been developed and tested. These toolings are capable for a small batch size production of car body panels. Dependent on the sheet thickness, work piece material and geometry the tool life will be in a range from 3, 000 to 20, 000 parts. Compared to the common dies, made of steel or cast iron, the polyurethane dies have considerable advantages in manufacturing time and price as well as in repairing and modifying. The tool cost reduction is the outcome of less time for manufacturing and a significant smaller effort for the smooth finishing operation. (orig.)

40|$|During forming, the <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> {{press and}} <b>tools</b> undergo large loads, {{and even though}} they are {{extremely}} sturdy structures, deformations occur. This causes changes in the geometry of the tool surface and the gap width between the <b>tools.</b> The <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> process can be very sensitive to these deformations. Tool and press deformations can be split into two categories. The deflection of the press bed-plate or slide and global deformation in the <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> are referred to as macro press deformation. Micro-deformation occurs directly at the surfaces of the forming tools and is one or two orders lower in magnitude. The goal is to include tool deformation in a FE forming simulation.

Prototype tools for five different super alloy Inconel 718 sheet metal components were designed, manufactured and tested in 15 weeks. Two of these prototype tools (A, B) are the topics of this paper. The methodology is based on virtual tool design in which the tool concepts are secured and optimized with respect to sheet metal formability and shape deviation using FE-analyses. Tool surfaces are compensated for springback, if necessary, using the *INTERFACE_COMPENSATED_NEW capability in LS-DYNA v 971 (B). The compensated FE tool surfaces are used as reference to generate high quality surfaces suitable for the milling process. Laser scanning {{was used to determine}} shape deviation. The CAD-evaluation revealed a minor shape deviation within tolerance of component (A) and a small over-compensation of the final geometry of component (B).

Once made at external specialists these technologies are getting integrated in manufacturing lines of tool makers. Fraunhofer IWS developed systems and components for applying these technologies. Automated processing supported by measuring and control systems reduce existing application barriers at operators who are well skilled in mechanical treatment but less experienced with heat treatment and cladding. Since laser beam hardening and cladding is frequently necessary in the same line machine costs can be reduced if both processes share a laser. The optimum beam quality for both processes is quite similar and can be delivered by modern fiber coupled high power diode lasers.

40|$|Trends in the {{automotive}} industry tend towards fuel saving and reduction of exhaust gases by weight reduction. On the other hand the enhancement of safety is required. From this it follows an increased application of high strength steels as well as stainless steels in the car body production. The forming of these materials is associated with high requirements to forming procedure and forming tools. In comparison with forming of low strength steels the risk of spring back effects is increased caused by higher amount of elastic deformation. Furthermore during deep drawing processes tearing nearby the die corner may occur because load strengths {{in this area are}} too large. These load strengths are so called "plane strain" states. In order to avoid or reduce failure a monitoring of the stress states during the deep drawing process should be implemented. Basically the non-destructive electromagnetic testing method 3 MA (Micromagnetic Multiparameter Microstructure and Stress Analysis) is convenient to characterize stress states. A special miniaturized electromagnetic probe, a so called rotating field probe, which is able to detect multiaxial stress states, was developed.

40|$|In most forming {{processes}} {{based on}} tailored blanks, the tool material {{remains the same}} as that of sheet metal blanks without tailored properties. A novel concept of lightweight construction for <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> is presented in this work to improve the forming behavior of tailored blanks. The investigations presented here deal with the forming of tailored blanks of dissimilar strengths using tailored dies made of two different materials. In the area of the steel blank with higher strength, typical tool steel is used. In the area of the low-strength steel, a hybrid tool made out of a polymer and a fiber-reinforced surface replaces the steel half. Cylindrical cups of DP 600 /HX 300 LAD are formed and analyzed regarding their formability. The use of two different halves of tool materials shows improved blank thickness distribution, weld-line movement and pressure distribution compared to the use of two steel halves. An improvement in strain distribution is also observed by the inclusion of springs in the polymer side of tools, which is implemented to control the material flow in the die. Furthermore, a reduction in tool weight of approximately 75 % can be achieved by using this technique. An accurate finite element modeling strategy is developed to analyze the problem numerically and is verified experimentally for the cylindrical cup. This strategy is then applied to investigate the thickness distribution and weld-line movement for a complex geometry, and its transferability is validated. The inclusion of springs in the hybrid tool leads to better material flow, which results in reduction of weld-line movement by around 60 %, leading to more uniform thickness distribution...|$|R

This has been achieved by using a divided blank-holder, which consists of four segments and can move radially under axial pressure. The drawing process can be combined with a supplemental punch which gives a constant punch force during the drawing process. The experimental results {{show that there is}} no fracture at the flange of deformed blank, which is often observed in Maslennikov's process. The present new process is a very good trial to secure the advantages of <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> with elastic <b>tools,</b> but by using rigid tools. Very deep cups can be produced by repeating the drawing process. Theoretical analysis based on the energy and slab methods has also been conducted to study the possibility and the main features of this new process. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>drawn</b> shapes with {{orthogonal}} wall {{components are}} usually evaluated by shape accuracy and visual quality. There {{have been only}} a few investigations on the stability of such structures; however, {{the effect of the}} wrinkles on the stability of the wall is important for packaging applications and can support the shape accuracy. This paper focuses on the influences of process parameters on the stability of orthogonal walls of shapes produced by <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> with rigid <b>tools</b> and immediate compression. The wall stability was evaluated by tensile testing orthogonal to the direction of the wrinkles. The stability distribution was characterized with regard to the drawing height, and a comparison was made between the two different materials. The wall stability decreased with increases in the forming height. Furthermore, a blank holder force design and z-directional compression level improved the wall stability. Together with an elevated moisture content of the material and thermal energy supply that delivered two to three times higher resistance against wrinkle extension, these effects drastically improved the wall stability...|$|R
