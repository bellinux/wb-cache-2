5|$|Cone {{production}} varies a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> year to year, but, as {{a result}} of its low flowering rate, is generally very low. However, there are typically a very high number of follicles per cone, leading to relatively high seed counts. There is some seed predation, primarily from the curculionid weevil Cechides amoenus.|$|E

5|$|The series {{follows a}} tragic course in which Dream, having learned a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> his imprisonment, tries {{to correct the}} things he has done wrong in the past. Ultimately, this causes him to mercy kill his own son, which leads to his own death {{at the hands of}} the Furies. Dream, having found himself a {{replacement}} early on in Daniel Hall, dies in issue No. 69 (July 1995). The remaining issues deal with Dream's funeral, Hob Gadling choosing to remain immortal in spite of Dream's death, and two stories from the past. The series wraps with the story of William Shakespeare creating his other commission for Dream, The Tempest, his last work not in collaboration with other writers.|$|E
5|$|The vitriolic {{campaign}} of Richard Wagner against Meyerbeer {{was to a}} great extent responsible for the decline of Meyerbeer's popularity after his death in 1864. This campaign was as much a matter of personal spite as of racism – Wagner had learnt a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> Meyerbeer and indeed Wagner's early opera Rienzi (1842) was facetiously called by Hans von Bülow 'Meyerbeer's best opera'. Meyerbeer supported the young Wagner, both financially and in helping to obtain the premiere productions of both Rienzi and The Flying Dutchman at Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Sierra {{wanted the}} game to have Hollywood-quality film sequences, so they sought a {{director}} with experience in the film industry. They hired Peter Maris, whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films, although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies. Maris and Roberta Williams collaborated a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> {{the beginning of the}} process, with Maris explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker's perspective, and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer's perspective. Maris set up the camera angles and worked with the actors, using three motion-controlled cameras during the shooting. All filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen, and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers, which synchronized the relative motion of computer-generated, three-dimensional background art. Next, the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by Petro VLahos's UltiMatte system. The computer imaging components made Phantasmagoria a very different experience for Maris than his usual film industry work. Crow served as a production coordinator during filming, helping facilitate what happened on stage. He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action. Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist.|$|E

5|$|The Australian team {{joined the}} MCC cricketers {{on the journey}} to England, to play a further five Tests in 1921. Once again, some {{newspapers}} suggested Fender should captain the England team, but Douglas was initially retained; as the series progressed, several writers lamented the fact that Fender was overlooked. Fender began the season poorly and was not picked {{for the first three}} Tests, all of which were won by Australia. The England selectors tried 30 players {{in the course of the}} summer, many of whom critics did not consider to be of suitable quality. Fender began to take wickets consistently in the middle of the season, and scored a century in the Gentlemen v Players match, so he was chosen for the fourth Test. The game was drawn, affected by rain. Fender scored 44 not out and took two for 30 in the game. The final match was also a rain-ruined draw; Fender retained his place but had little success. He later said that he learned a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> Warwick Armstrong's captaincy of the Australians.|$|E

He was entirely self-taught, although he said that he learnt a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> attending Roger Désormière's and Hans Rosbaud's rehearsals. He also cited George Szell as an influential mentor. It was Szell who persuaded Boulez to accept the appointment with the New York Philharmonic.|$|E
25|$|Harbinger of Light (Australia). By 1880, {{there were}} about three dozen monthly spiritualist {{periodicals}} published around the world. These periodicals differed a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> each other, reflecting the great differences among spiritualists. Some, such as the British Spiritual Magazine were Christian and conservative, openly rejecting the reform currents so strong within spiritualism. Others, such as Human Nature, were pointedly non-Christian and supportive of socialism and reform efforts. Still others, such as the Spiritualist, attempted to view spiritualist phenomena from a scientific perspective, eschewing discussion on both theological and reform issues.|$|E
25|$|By 1953 {{there were}} 685 police boxes {{on the streets}} of Greater London, with an {{additional}} 72 smaller police posts, also designed by Trench, used in the inner divisions where there was no space for the larger kiosks. Between 1923 and 1960 the police box and/or post system had been adopted by most of the provincial police forces throughout Great Britain. The design and construction of the police boxes used in each system were at the discretion of each individual force, and consequently varied a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> location to location, but the police pillars/posts were usually one of three successive models provided by the General Post Office (GPO).|$|E

25|$|A {{referring}} expression (RE), in linguistics, is any noun phrase, or {{surrogate for}} a noun phrase, whose function in discourse {{is to identify}} some individual object (thing, being, event...) The technical terminology for identify differs a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> one school of linguistics to another. The most widespread term is probably refer, and a thing identified is a referent, as for example {{in the work of}} John Lyons. In linguistics, the study of reference relations belongs to pragmatics, the study of language use, though it is also a matter of great interest to philosophers, especially those wishing {{to understand the nature of}} knowledge, perception and cognition more generally.|$|E
25|$|Industrial Light & Magic and Skywalker Sound {{assisted}} {{in the creation of}} the game, which was the first collaboration between LucasArts and ILM in the field of in-game cinematics. Knoles said LucasArts and ILM learned a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> their cooperation, which allowed ILM to try new methods for creating scenes, as well as new tools and techniques. LucasArts provided ILM with models, textures, and a storyboarded script, and then applied their cinematic expertise in adapting the script into dynamic and visually stunning films. The sound designers of LucasArts and the sound designers at Skywalker Sound worked together to create the game soundtrack. Skywalker Sound made sounds directly for game animations and events, and created foley sounds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1849, the French Ballet Master Jules Perrot arrived in St. Petersburg, having {{accepted}} the position of premier maître de ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. He was accompanied by his chief collaborator, the prolific Italian composer Cesare Pugni, who was appointed Ballet Composer of the Imperial Theatres, a position created especially for him. Aside from dancing the principal rôles in many of Perrot's productions, Petipa rehearsed older works with the company and assisted Perrot in staging revivals (such as Giselle in 1850, and Le Corsaire in 1858), all the while learning a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> {{the man who was}} at that time the most celebrated choreographer in Europe. Although Petipa did not create his own original works during this period, he nevertheless staged many dances for various operas, and on occasion revised dances for Perrot's many revivals of older works.|$|E

25|$|Ondine {{is not a}} {{classical}} construction with great set pieces (except for the wedding divertissement in the third act) or grand formal pas de deux, but a continuous, flowing narrative. However, this narrative is itself not very strong {{and there is no}} real explanation of why the lovers are on a ship in Act 2, or what exactly has passed between Acts 2 and 3 to convince Palemon to return to his mortal lover, Beatrice (Berta). The work uses classical ballet vocabulary, but the form varies a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> the 19th century classics. Unlike them, is through-composed: there are no breaks for bows to the audience built in and (at least until the third-act divertissement) no bravura variations to self-consciously elicit the audience's response. Henze's glittering music is the dominating force, although it is a difficult score to dance to, with the pulse well hidden within its general sheen, but it is atmospheric and often exciting, bringing the close of Act I to a climax.|$|E
25|$|Researchers today doubt Las Casas' {{figures for}} the pre-contact levels of the Taíno population, {{considering}} them an exaggeration. For example, Anderson Córdova estimates a maximum of 500,000 people inhabiting the island. The Taíno population estimates vary a <b>great</b> <b>deal,</b> <b>from</b> {{a few hundred thousand}} up to 8,000,000. They had no resistance to Old World diseases, notably smallpox. The encomienda system brought many Taíno to work in the fields and mines in exchange for Spanish protection, education, and a seasonal salary. Under the pretense of searching for gold and other materials, many Spaniards took advantage of the regions now under control of the anaborios and Spanish encomenderos to exploit the native population by seizing their land and wealth. It would take some time before the Taíno revolted against their oppressors — both Indian and Spanish alike — and many military campaigns before Emperor Charles V eradicated the encomienda system as a form of slavery.|$|E
500|$|As a young Cardinals player, McBride {{said that}} he learned a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>from</b> the {{influence}} of teammate Lou Brock. McBride felt that Brock should have won the 1974 Most Valuable Player Award. Brock stole 118 bases that year, which broke the single-season league record. When combined with McBride's 30 steals, the total set a single-season MLB record for stolen bases by two teammates. Other than Brock and McBride, no St. Louis Cardinal had stolen 30 bases in a season since 1927. The 1974 Cardinals outfielders (McBride, Brock and Reggie Smith) all hit over [...]300, {{the first time since}} 1902 that the team's three starting outfielders all achieved that mark.|$|E
