40|$|A new {{technology}} for monitoring the physiological status of fruit during storage (HarvestWatch™ system with FIRM™ sensors, Satlantic, Canada) {{was used to}} detect anaerobic stress in pears by the increase in fluorescence response (Falpha). Two pear cultivars were studied: ‘Conference’, a long-term storage cultivar, and ‘Abbé Fétel’, which cannot be stored longer than 4 months in air. The fruit were stored in air at - 0. 5 °C after harvest until 18 November 2002, then in 4 gastight containers (2 per cultivar). In each container there was a fluorescence sensor in a box with 6 – 7 fruits. One container per cultivar was kept with a standard CA (2 kPa O 2; 0. 7 kPa CO 2); in the other, after 3 weeks with standard CA, the oxygen concentration was decreased. On 10 February ten fruits per container were sampled, and gas exchange was measured at - 0. 5 °C on single fruit in known gas mixtures (100 kPa N 2, O 2 at 0. 1, 0. 5, 2 and 21 kPa, with 0 and 5 kPa CO 2). ‘Abbé Fétel’ fruit had higher gas exchange rates and were more sensitive to low O 2, experiencing and increase in fluorescence response at higher O 2 level than ‘Conference’ fruits. The sensitivity to low oxygen levels was confirmed by respiratory quotient, which increased at O 2 levels similar to those which stimulated the change in fluorescence response. Therefore it seems that Falpha measures {{a response to the}} low O 2 stress which induces anaerobic respiration. The fluorescence monitoring system may have potential to detect physiological limits for aerobic respiration. A CA system with excellent tightness, analytical accuracy and control is needed to implement the HarvestWatch system. However, even under optimal atmospheric control, the small number of fruit that can be monitored may present challenges to successful implementation if sample fruit are not representative of the bulk of <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> <b>storage...</b>|$|E

We investigated the changes of wax composition and structure, the related genes and WRI 1 expression on Malus asiatica Nakai and sieversii fruits with the low temperature treatments, found that low temperature induced the up-regulated expression of McWRI 1, which promoted gene expression of McKCS, McLACs and McWAX in very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, resulting in the accumulation of alkanes component and alteration of wax structure on the fruit surface.

It was concluded that Japanese quince is a comparatively healthy plant, but some fungi were identified that could be potential threats to the crop, which is currently being developed for organic growing. Grey mould, Botrytis cinerea, was very common on plants in the fields, and was observed on shoots, flower parts, <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> all stages and also on <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> cold <b>storage.</b> An inoculation experiment showed that the fungus could infect both wounded and unwounded tissue in shoots. Studies of potted plants left outdoors during winter indicated that a possible mode of infection of the shoots could be through persisting <b>fruits,</b> resulting <b>in</b> die-back of shoots. Fruit spots, brown lesions and <b>fruit</b> rot appeared <b>in</b> the field. Most common were small red spots, which eventually developed into brown rots. Fungi detected in these spots were Septoria cydoniae, Phlyctema vagabunda, Phoma exigua and Entomosporium mespili. The fact that several fungi were connected with this symptom indicates that the red colour may be a general response of the host, rather than a specific symptom of one fungus. Fungi found in brown lesions and rots were Botrytis cinerea, Phlyctema vagabunda, Penicillium expansum, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Cryptosporiopsis curvispora. Phlyctema vagabunda was often found in brown rots and also in red spots, indicating that this was the most common fungus. Leaf spots were also a common symptom in the fields. The spots varied in size, shape and colour, and it was obvious that they were caused by several different fungi. From leaves sampled in Latvia, Septoria cydoniae, Phoma pomorum, Asteromella sp. and Ramularia sp. were detected. Phoma pomorum and Alternaria alternata were isolated from leaves sampled in Sweden. However, most of the fungi recorded were widely distributed saprophytes or secondary invaders and leaf diseases were not considered severe.

The maximum shelf life, delayed rotting and optimum fruit quality of wax apple were observed in 1. 00 and 0. 50 % ventilation at refrigeration storage followed by 1. 00 % ventilation at ambient storage. The fruits stored without polythene bags both at ambient and refrigeration had lowest shelf life and shrunk compared to ventilated polythene bag storage. The fruits stored with no ventilation in polythene bags both at ambient and refrigeration rotted early and was unacceptable due to poor fruit quality and strong aldehydic flavour when compared to ventilated storage bag. The sensory evaluation revealed that, <b>fruits</b> stored <b>in</b> ventilated polythene bags had better orgenoleptic quality both in ambient as well as refrigeration storage condition compared to fruits stored without polythene bags...|$|R

Thus food security exists when all people have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. Uncertainly, food security does not exist for a major proportion of the world population of around 900 million people are malnourished, implying that they are underprovided with calories (FAO, 2012). Since the total area for planting is maintained as it {{is we need to}} find another solution in order to feed ever increasing mouth. Many developed countries have opted to incorporate the genetic engineering to improve their productivity. But how to achieve this goal is debated controversially. In association to this genetically modified (GM) crops are sometimes mentioned for food security. In genetic engineering only the desired traits are inserted to a plant while; with conventional breeding methods, thousands of traits from two crops are combined.

40|$|Abstract Maintaining {{quality and}} delaying over-ripening and {{senescence}} {{are the main}} goals <b>in</b> handling and <b>storage</b> of fruits and vegetables. Conventionally, control of temperature and humidity and selective use of controlled or modified atmospheres have helped to obtain these goals. Nowadays new methods for delaying postharvest senescence and deterioration of perishable fruits, vegetables, potted plants, and cut flowers are emerging. These include the molecular modification of ripening physiology {{and the use of}} compounds that specifically target and inhibit ethylene responsiveness. One of these compounds, 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), has been shown to suppress ethylene responses and extend the postharvest shelf life and quality of numerous fruits and vegetables. Modeling the diffusion and transport of 1 -MCP gas <b>in</b> <b>storage</b> rooms for <b>fruits</b> and vegetables may be a potential tool to investigate several situations. Developing such model require knowledge about diffusion and reaction coefficients of 1 -MCP gas in the various materials, including the <b>fruit,</b> present <b>in</b> <b>storage</b> rooms. A model governing the diffusion and adsorption behavior of 1 -MCP gas <b>in</b> <b>fruits</b> and non target materials found <b>in</b> apple <b>fruit</b> <b>storage</b> rooms is presented. The model is used to estimate kinetics parameters using time-dependent profiles obtained from jar tests on the depletion of 1 -MCP gas by samples of wet and dry solid materials. Materials included in the investigation were: Golden delicious apple and bin construction materials [high density polyethylene (HDPE), slightly weathered oak, Poplar wood and cardboard]. The 1 -MCP gas diffusion parameters for dry and wet materials were successfully estimated. The model will be used to compute the distribution of 1 -MCP <b>in</b> <b>storage</b> rooms and assess the uniformity and dosing of application for different configurations. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Hexoses {{accumulate}} to {{high concentrations}} (~ 200 mM) <b>in</b> <b>storage</b> parenchyma cells of tomato fruit. Hexoses are sourced from the fruit apoplasm as hydrolysis products of phloem-imported sucrose. Three hexose transporters (LeHT 1, LeHT 2, LeHT 3), expressed <b>in</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>storage</b> parenchyma cells, {{may contribute to}} hexose uptake by these cells. An analysis of their full-length sequences demonstrated that all three transporters belong to the STP sub-family of monosaccharide transporters that localize to plasma membranes. Heterologous expression of LeHT 1 (and previously LeHT 2, Gear et al., 2000), but not LeHT 3, rescued a hexose transport-impaired yeast mutant when raised on glucose or fructose as the sole carbon source. Biochemically, LeHT 1, similarly to LeHT 2, exhibited transport properties consistent with a highaffinity glucose/H⁺ symporter. Significantly, LeHT 1 and LeHT 2 also functioned as low-affinity fructose/H⁺ symporters with apparent Km values commensurate with those of fruit tissues. A substantial reduction (80 – 90 %) <b>in</b> <b>fruit</b> expression levels of all LeHT genes by RNAi-mediated knockdown caused a 55 % decrease <b>in</b> <b>fruit</b> hexose accumulation. <b>In</b> contrast, photoassimilate production by source leaves and phloem transport capacity to fruit were unaffected by transporter knockdown. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that LeHTs play key roles in driving accumulation of hexoses into storage parenchyma cells during tomato fruit development...|$|R
