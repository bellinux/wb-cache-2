5|$|Since 1971, the Republic of China (Taiwan) {{has been}} {{excluded}} from the UN and since then has always been rejected in new applications. Citizens of this country are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with the passport of Taiwan. In this way, critics agree that the UN <b>is</b> <b>failing</b> its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People's Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own territory.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Kioe Lie and Houw Nio's {{marriage}} <b>is</b> <b>failing.</b> Owing to poor investments (some {{made with}} embezzled money), Houw Nio's gambling, and Kioe Lie's keeping of a mistress, {{they have lost}} their fortune.

5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} <b>is</b> <b>failing</b> {{to control the}} pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months.|$|E

25|$|Although a {{majority}} of forests continue to be owned formally by government, the effectiveness of forest governance is increasingly independent of formal ownership. Since neo-liberal ideology in the 1980s and the emanation of the climate change challenges, evidence that the state <b>is</b> <b>failing</b> to effectively manage environmental resources has emerged. Under neo-liberal regimes in the developing countries, {{the role of the}} state has diminished and the market forces have increasingly taken over the dominant socio-economic role.|$|E
25|$|Some {{ethnic groups}} {{complain}} over {{the distribution of}} the revenue generated by oil resources with claims that the central government <b>is</b> <b>failing</b> to invest profits from the oil industry in employment generation, post-war reconstruction and welfare projects. Low human development indicators among local Khuzestanis are contrasted with the wealth generation of the local oil industry. Minority rights are frequently identified with strategic concerns, with ethnic unrest perceived by the Iranian government as being generated by foreign governments to undermine the country's oil industry and its internal stability. The politics of Khuzestan therefore have international significance and go beyond the realm of electoral politics.|$|E

25|$|A typeII error {{occurs when}} the null {{hypothesis}} is false, but erroneously fails to be rejected. It <b>is</b> <b>failing</b> to assert what is present, a miss. A typeII error may be compared with a so-called false negative (where an actual 'hit' was disregarded by the test and seen as a 'miss') in a test checking for a single condition with a definitive result of true or false. A Type II error is committed when we fail to believe a true alternative hypothesis. In terms of folk tales, an investigator may fail to see the wolf ("failing to raise an alarm"). Again, H0: no wolf.|$|E
25|$|If a wicket falls {{near the}} end of a day's play, {{especially}} if the light <b>is</b> <b>failing,</b> or if the bowlers seem particularly confident, the captain may choose to send in a non-specialist batsman, referred to as a nightwatchman. If the nightwatchman does not get out before the end of that day's play then the specialist batsman will have been protected, and will not need to bat until the following day when conditions are likely to have improved. If the nightwatchman does get out, the cost of losing a late wicket will have been minimised, because the specialist batsman is still available to bat.|$|E
