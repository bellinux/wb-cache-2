5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics. These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits.</b> Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E
5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} spatial microsimulation in the aggregation of regional <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> values. The developed spatial microsimulation model uses simulated annealing to match the Irish Census of Agriculture data to a Contingent Valuation Survey that contains information on Irish farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) to have the corncrake restored as a common sight in the Irish countryside. We then use this matched farm survey and Census information to produce regional and national total WTP figures, and compare these to figures derived using more standard approaches to calculating aggregate environment benefit values. The main advantage of the spatial microsimulation approach for <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> value aggregation {{is that it allows}} one to account for the heterogeneity in the target population. Results indicate that the microsimulation modelling approach provides aggregate WTP estimates of a similar magnitude as those produced using the usual sample mean WTP aggregation at the national level, but yields regional aggregate values which are significantly different. <b>Environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> value; aggregation spatial microsimulation; willingness to pay; corncrake conservation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Forest road {{decommissioning}} is a pro-active {{mechanism for}} preventing future habitat degradation and {{for increasing the}} likelihood of endangered salmonid survival in the western U. S. High implementation costs however preclude many desirable projects from being undertaken, especially on federally owned land. Previous research and real-world applications have demonstrated the cost savings potential of reusing aggregate recovered from forest roads during decommissioning. These cost savings can effectively subsidize decommissioning projects, sug-gesting an economic benefit associated with improving <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit.</b> We present a mixed integer, multiple objective formulation to identify the efficient trade-off surface between conflicting economic and environmental criteria, where <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> {{is defined as the}} hazard weighted length of roads decommissioned. We compare nondominated frontiers identified with and with-out the opportunity to recycle aggregate. Our results suggest that aggregate recycling promotes a synergistic relationship between cost savings (subsidy) and environ-mental performance, where subsidies generally increase with increasing environmental performance. Effective sub-sidy values can reach 31 % of total expenditure, at the maximum level of <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit.</b> Transportation managers are therefore able to recover and reuse a nonrenewable resource, {{while at the same time}} promoting economic and environmental efficiency...|$|R
