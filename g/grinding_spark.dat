40|$|The {{existing}} standards for surface roughness cover only two dimensions, while in reality this is three-dimensional (3 D). In particular, the 3 D surface roughness parameters {{are important for}} solving the contact surface mechanics problems as related {{to the accuracy of}} 3 D surface roughness characteristics. One of the most important factors for determination of 3 D characteristics is the number of data points (NDP) on the x- and y-axes (i. e. in cut-off length). The NDP has a profound effect on the accuracy of measurement results, measuring time and volume of the output data (especially along the y-axis, where the NDP is identical to the number of parallel profiles). At a too small NDP the results will be incorrect and with too broad scatter, while a too large NDP - though not enlarging the range of basic information - considerably increases the measuring time. Therefore, the aim of the work was to find the optimal NDP for such surface processing methods as <b>grinding,</b> <b>spark</b> erosion and shot methods of surface treatment...|$|E

40|$|High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG) {{combines}} high {{depths of}} cut, high grinding wheel speeds with high work piece feed rates {{to deliver a}} very high stock removal process that can produce components free of surface damage. High contact temperatures are a characteristic {{of the process and}} this produces a mass of hot <b>grinding</b> <b>sparks</b> being ejected from the grinding zone. Neat oil cutting fluids are typically used in HEDG due to their excellent lubricity, but the high grinding wheel speeds employed leads to high levels of highly volatile cutting fluid mist in the machine canopy. This mist can mix with the hot <b>grinding</b> <b>sparks</b> being ejected from the grinding zone to create a potential fire hazard. The project aim was to produce a cutting fluid application strategy for the HEDG regime, focusing on establishing the thermal characteristics of cutting fluids {{in order to determine the}} optimum cutting fluid for the HEDG process. The cutting fluid application strategy also involved investigating the optimum means by which to apply the cutting fluid, based on minimising amount of cutting fluid used in the process and in reducing the potential fire hazard. The characteristics that have a thermal impact on the grinding process are the cooling, lubrication, ignition and misting properties of the fluid. A series of tests were established to investigate these properties and therefore allow different fluids to be compared and contrasted for their suitability for the HEDG regime based. Once an optimal cutting fluid had been established, the project then investigated the optimal method of applying this fluid, with particular reference to the type and design of the nozzle used to apply the fluid to the grinding zone. As part of these trials, a series of benchmark tests were also conducted using long established cutting fluid application techniques to enable the benefits of the new strategy to be evaluated. The project concluded that high viscosity neat oil ester based cutting fluids were the best fluids to be used in the HEDG regime due to they excellent lubricity and low misting properties coupled to their relatively high resistance to ignition when compared to neat mineral oils. The studies also found that using a high viscosity ester based fluid and then applying it using a coherent jet nozzle, significant reductions in the grinding powder and specific grinding energy could be achieved whilst significantly lowering the amount of mist in the machine, thus reducing the potential fire hazard and the volume of cutting fluid used by the process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The braced pillars were {{machined}} by <b>grinding</b> and <b>spark</b> machining. 3 -D topography {{and surface}} roughness of {{two kinds of}} braced pillars were measured. The effect of two kinds of braced pillars on stress distribution of vacuum plate glass was analyzed by electrometric method, and was in comparison. The stress distribution of their important sides was obtained such as sealing side, supporting side and braced pillar. The experimental result showed that maximal stress of braced pillar for vacuum glass occurred in the end side of each braced pillar. Controlling high precision of the brace height and good flatness of the glass sheet considerably improve vacuum plate glass quality, such as its strength, its dependability and service life...|$|R

During winter months, the Roundhouse is a functioning work area for Museum rolling stock, often with the volunteer workforce welding, <b>grinding</b> and sending <b>sparks</b> flying.

40|$|Tribological {{conditions}} between workpiece and tool have a {{major impact}} onto forming processes. Besides lubrication, temperature, and material, they are mainly influenced by the tool surface characteristics, especially by its topography, which is a result of finishing technology. Thereby formed lubricant pockets are of prime importance for the tribosystem due to its ability to separate the tribopartners by storing lubricant. The influence of four different tool finishing processes and their according surface topographies onto frictional behaviour have been investigated and quantified by the barrel compression test, in dry and lubricated tribosystems. The tool steel surfaces were stochastically microstructured by <b>grinding</b> and <b>spark</b> erosion as well as deterministic structured with micro calottes, applied by jet electrochemical machining and compared to a polished reference tool. The allocation of open and closed lubricant pockets over tool surfaces before and after the forming process was analysed by a self-made MATLAB tool...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the p-type Ga-doped Cu 3 Sb 1 −xGaxSe 4 {{compounds}} were fabricated by melting, annealing, <b>grinding,</b> and <b>spark</b> plasma sintering (SPS). The transport {{properties of}} Ga-doped Cu 3 Sb 1 −xGaxSe 4 compounds were investigated. As Ga content increased, the hole concentration of Cu 3 Sb 1 −xGaxSe 4 compounds increased, {{which led to}} an increase in electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the Seebeck coefficient of the Cu 3 Sb 1 −xGaxSe 4 compounds decreased as Ga content increased. The extra phonon scattering originating from Ga-doping effectively depressed the lattice thermal conductivity of the Cu 3 Sb 1 −xGaxSe 4 compounds. The ZT value of Cu 3 SbSe 4 markedly improved, which is primarily ascribed to the depressed lattice thermal conductivity and the increased electrical conductivity. The highest ZT value for the Cu 3 Sb 0. 985 Ga 0. 015 Se 4 compound was 0. 54 at 650 K, which is two times higher than that of a pure Cu 3 SbSe 4 compound...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{study has}} {{developed}} {{a new kind of}} high performance monolayer brazed diamond tool for ceramic grinding. The grit size of the diamond brazed in the grinding wheel surface is 300 µm, which has never been reported in diamond tools for ceramic precision machining. The experiment has achieved wonderful surface finish of Zirconia workpiece. This does owe to the designed and precision conditioned topography of the new developed grinding wheel. The topography of the grinding wheel before and after dressing has been measured by means of laser triangulation method. Then the Zirconia workpiece has been ground. The obtained Ra value decreases with no <b>spark</b> <b>grinding</b> times and the minimum Ra of the ground surface is 0. 11 µm. The study proved that the brazed large grit diamond tools would realize high efficiency and precision grinding, namely, high performance of ceramic grinding...|$|R
40|$|Grinding is an {{important}} process used when tight dimensional accuracy and low workpiece surface roughness are demanded. Despite the fact that grinding is widely used in industry, it is not well understood. The elastic deformation, which occurs {{in the beginning of}} the cycles, makes it necessary a spark out in the end of the cycle. An alternative to this is the use of a three-phase cycle. The main objective of this work is to compare the plunge cylindrical conventional <b>grinding</b> cycle (with <b>spark</b> out) and a three-phase one in terms of workpiece surface roughness. In order to accomplish this goal, several plunge grinding of hardened AISI 4340 steel experiments were carried out using both kinds of cycles in different grinding conditions. The vibration signal of the system was acquired in order to better understand the differences between the two kinds of cycles. The main conclusion was that conventional cycle produces lower workpiece surface roughness than the three-phase one (both with the same cycle time). It happens because the elastic deformation is better released in the conventional cycle...|$|R
2500|$|In 1280, a large {{store of}} {{gunpowder}} at Weiyang in Yangzhou accidentally caught fire, producing such a massive explosion that {{a team of}} inspectors at the site a week later deduced that some 100 guards had been killed instantly, with wooden beams and pillars blown sky high and landing {{at a distance of}} over 10 li (~2mi. or ~3km) away from the explosion, creating a crater more than ten feet deep. One resident described the noise of the explosion as if it [...] "was like a volcano erupting, a tsunami crashing. The entire population was terrified." [...] According to surviving reports, the incident was caused by inexperienced gunpowder makers hired to replace the previous ones, and had been careless while <b>grinding</b> sulfur. A <b>spark</b> caused by the grinding process came into contact with some fire lances which immediately started spewing flames and jetting around [...] "like frightened snakes." [...] The gunpowder makers did nothing as they found the sight highly amusing, that is until one fire lance burst into a cache of bombs, causing the entire complex to explode. The validity of this report is somewhat questionable, assuming everyone within the immediate vicinity was killed.|$|R
40|$|The zone-melted n-type Bi 2 Te 3 ingots {{were chosen}} as the {{starting}} material to prepare the bulk samples by two different synthesis routes including hand <b>grinding</b> combined with <b>spark</b> plasma sintering process (ZM+SPS) and melt spinning (MS) technique combined with a subsequent spark plasma sintering process (MS+SPS). The microstructures, thermoelectric properties and mechanical properties of three samples prepared by different techniques were studied. The ZM samples show rough grain size and strong grain orientations. After hand grinded and SPS process, the crystalline grains are refined and grain orientations are remarkably decreased. While the MS+SPS samples with fine grains have no distinct grain orientations. The results of thermoelectric properties and pressive strength measurement show that the maximum figure of merit ZT value reaches 0. 72 at 430 K for ZM starting materials and the pressive strength is only about 40 MPa. The maximum figure of merit ZT value decreases to 0. 68 at 440 K for the ZM+SPS samples but the pressive strength are increased to 110 MPa, which is about 175 % improvement compared with ZM samples. The maximum figure of merit ZT value and pressive strength are 0. 96 at 320 K and 200 MPa respectively for the MS+SPS samples, the room temperature ZT and pressive strength are about 64 % and 400 % improvement compared with ZM samples...|$|R
