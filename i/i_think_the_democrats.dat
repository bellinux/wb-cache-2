Spong Jr. {{away from}} his unfinished mission {{as head of the}} Marshall-Wythe School of Law. Spong made that abundantly plain as he began to tell friends {{that he would not be}} available for either of two high offices to which his name had been linked by speculation in recent weeks. Answering questions last week from a pair of visiting newsmen whom he has known for many years, Spong effectively removed himself from the field of prospective candidates for the Virginia Supreme Court as well as the U. S. Senate in 1982. A straw poll of Democratic State Central Committee members one week ago indicated Spong was clearly favored for senator by these active party workers. When members were asked for the Democratic nomination, Spong led a dozen or so prospects with 137 points to the runner-up 2 ̆ 7 s 118. Asked first if he were interested in running for the Senate seat to be vacated by Harry F. Byrd Jr. on Jan. 3, 1983, Spong responded with a quick, firm 2 ̆ 2 no. 2 ̆ 2 After a long pause, he added this one-sentence explanation: 2 ̆ 2 <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> need and should have a candidate whose appetite for public office is greater than mine. 2 ̆ 2 His response to the question of whether he might be available for the Supreme Court vacancy to be left Jan. 1 by the retirement of Justice Albertis S. Harrison Jr. seemed at first a bit tentative. 2 ̆ 2 Well, 2 ̆ 2 he began, 2 ̆ 2 I [...] [pause] [...] I will not ask that my name be considered for that position. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 It would be an honor to succeed Albertis Harrison on that court. But I 2 ̆ 7 m not quite ready to leave here. I like what I 2 ̆ 7 m doing, particularly the teaching, and I think I 2 ̆ 7 ll stay around a while. 2 ̆ 2 What Spong has been doing since late 1975 is dedicating all his efforts to the rebuilding and improving of the venerable but once shaky law school that was founded under Gov. Thomas Jefferson and Professor George Wythe at the College of William and Mary in 1779. Former 2 ̆ 2 Young Turk 2 ̆ 2 A former 2 ̆ 2 Young Turk 2 ̆ 2 and state senator in the General Assembly: Democrat Spong was Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s junior U. S. Senator in 1966 - 72. He was upset, a casualty of the McGovern presidential debacle, by Republican William Scott, largely as a result of a slashing electronic media blitz financed in the closing three week by a 250, 000 2 ̆ 2 loan 2 ̆ 2 from one man, the late J. B. Stetson Coleman. After his defeat, Spong quietly withdrew from the public gaze to concentrate on more scholarly pursuits involving research and writing on legal and governmental policy matters, as well as practicing law and teaching law courses at several institutions. Reporters and friends talking to him late last week got the impression he was so happily established in the academic world [...] he once said he was determined not to become a professional ex-senator, but carve out a new career [...] that he was not about to leave it now. In his slowly spoken, deliberate way, Spong minimized the possibilities that any sort of 2 ̆ 2 draft Spong 2 ̆ 2 movement might develop for the court or Senate, and indicated strongly that he would decline if it did. He has a commitment to himself to stay at W 2 ̆ 6 M until certain things are accomplished, which means until some indefinite time in the future, he said. More than that, he cited approvingly a recent article that quoted him as saying he and Mrs. Spong have never been happier than they are now. That doesn 2 ̆ 7 t mean he might not eventually move on to something else, he said. He wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t speculate now on what it might be, but it quite evidently won 2 ̆ 7 t be toward the Congress, even if his age [...] he was 61 September 29 [...] were no consideration. Recalling how he spent about 133, 00 on his 1966 campaign, Spong guessed it would cost 2 million or more to wage the same sort of campaign next year. 2 ̆ 2 The obligations one might encounter in raising that money would be burdensome to me, 2 ̆ 2 he said. What the Democrats need, he said, is 2 ̆ 2 someone who hungers for the position and is willing to begin right now and work full time for it from now on. 2 ̆ 2 No, he wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t suggest any names, but 2 ̆ 2 I hope they will find a candidate... who will continue the momentum that was undoubtedly started 2 ̆ 2 by the Democratic sweep of the three top state offices this year. (The 1981 election of Charles S. Robb as governor marked the first time Virginia Democrats have won either a gubernatorial or senatorial election since Spong and Harry F. Byrd Jr. were elected together as Democrats in 1966.) 2 ̆ 2 I was very happy being a senator... It 2 ̆ 7 s one of the greatest jobs in the world, 2 ̆ 2 he said. Then, with a little chuckle, he added: 2 ̆ 2 I guess what you have to do to get there is something that you have to consider as well. 2 ̆...|$|E

Krauthammer draws an analogy with John Kennedy's presidential campaign: [...] "When Kennedy ran in 1960, Nixon was about his age, but he basically ran against Eisenhower. He talked about the new and the new frontier... Remember {{what he said in}} his inaugural address? ...Kennedy said 'the torch has been passed to a new generation'. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> generational contrast is huge. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> baggage contrast is huge." ...|$|R

But, if there's just one thing where they're wrong, it's in the matter of <b>the</b> theatres. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it would be much better for the Government not to attempt to cut down or regulate theatres in any way. The theatre is the people's recreation. It builds them up. It's all part of a great machine to win the war. I like to stand in the box office and see the money come in and feel that the theatre is doing its bit. But, mind you, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> President is doing fine. So, all I say is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> theatres ought to be allowed to do fine, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{can there}} be any {{difficulty}} in understanding this? To you Democrats it {{may not seem like}} principle; but surely you cannot fail to perceive the position plainly enough. The distinction between it and the position of your candidate is broad and obvious, and I admit you have a clear right to show it is wrong if you can; but you have no right to pretend you cannot see it at all. We see it, and to us it appears like principle, and the best sort of principle at that--the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with their own business. My friend from Indiana (C. B. Smith) has aptly asked, [...] "Are you willing to trust the people?" [...] Some of you answered substantially, [...] "We are willing to trust the people; but the President is as much the representative of the people as Congress." [...] In a certain sense, and to a certain extent, he is the representative of the people. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is; but can he, in the nature of things know the wants of the people as well as three hundred other men, coming from all the various localities of the nation? If so, where is the propriety of having a Congress? That the Constitution gives the President a negative on legislation, all know; but that this negative should be so combined with platforms and other appliances as to enable him, and in fact almost compel him, to take the whole of legislation into his own hands, is what we object to, is what General Taylor objects to, and is what constitutes the broad distinction between you and us. To thus transfer legislation is clearly to take it from those who understand with minuteness the interests of the people, and give it to one who does not and cannot so well understand it. I understand your idea that if a Presidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question, or rather upon all questions, and the people, with full knowledge of this, elect him, they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions. By means of it, measures are adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of one party, and often nearly half of the other. Three, four, or half a dozen questions are prominent at a given time; the party selects its candidate, and he takes his position on each of these questions. On all but one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections, and his party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large portion of them are against it. But what are they to do? The whole was strung together; and they must take all, or reject all. They cannot take what they like, and leave the rest. What they are already committed to being the majority, they shut their eyes, and gulp the whole. Next election, still another is introduced in the same way. If we run our eyes along the line of the past, we shall see that almost if not quite all the articles of the present Democratic creed have been at first forced upon the party in this very way. And just now, and just so, opposition to internal improvements is to be established if General Cass shall be elected. Almost half <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> here are for improvements; but they will vote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their vote will have aided in closing the doors against improvements. Now this is a process which we think is wrong. We prefer a candidate who, like General Taylor, will allow the people to have their own way, regardless of his private opinions; and <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>the</b> internal-improvement <b>Democrats,</b> at least, ought to prefer such a candidate. He would force nothing on them which they don't want, and he would allow them to have improvements which their own candidate, if elected, will not.|$|R
