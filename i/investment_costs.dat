5|$|A new {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at Ålgårds Ullvarefabrikker. His company paid for traffic counting along the route, and the committee {{concluded that there was}} sufficient traffic to build a line. Two routes were proposed: one branching from Sandnes Station and one from Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower <b>investment</b> <b>costs,</b> but would give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOK787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{estimated}} to cost 267 million Norwegian krone. Estimates show that the benefit for society would be lower than the <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> (a negative net present value), giving an average estimated NOK124 million deficit. Norwegian Air Shuttle is building a unified fleet of 737-800 aircraft and will {{only be able to}} serve the airport during winter if the investments are carried out. The extension would allow increased charter traffic to Central Europe and increased regularity with existing flights. Avinor has stated that it cannot finance the investments without direct subsidies from the state.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} raised {{criticism}} against several fundamental shortcomings in the network system. The most fundamental {{is the lack of}} indoor coverage. This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics, Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other shortcomings are that the location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E
40|$|We study a Cournot duopoly {{model of}} {{preemption}} with irreversible investment under uncertainty expressed by a continuous stochastic process. In most real option approach in monopoly or duopoly models, they analyze the model {{which has the}} opportunity to be active on the market by paying the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> only. But {{there are two kinds of}} costs in practice, the production <b>cost</b> and the <b>investment</b> <b>cost.</b> The purpose of this paper is to show the effect on the threshold of each firm when the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> or the production cost increases. We show that the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> does not have the same effect as the production cost on the threshold of each firm. Formally, the threshold of the follower and the monopolist are directly proportional to the <b>investment</b> <b>cost,</b> while they are inversely proportional to a quadratic function of the production cost. We can observe that the threshold of the leader is linear function of the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> and is nonlinear function of the production cost...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{technology}} investment under flexible capacity {{strategy with}} demand uncertainty. Technology investment enables a firm {{to reduce its}} total production cost, while flexible capacity strategy aims to reduce a firms production waste by postponing production until demand is known. Adopting a general technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost,</b> we examine how technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> structure affects a firms technology investment decisions. We derive {{the conditions under which}} the firm will benefit from technology investment. We show that the firm can increase its expected profit through technology investment only when the unit technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> that varies inversely with the basic technology level is below a threshold. However, even though the technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is zero, the benefit from the increase in technology level is limited. Furthermore, we analytically determine the optimal technology levels and establish their relationships under different technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> structures. Our findings will help firms evaluate various technology investment options and choose the most proper one. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} hearing in 2002 both DNK director Tor Helge Lyngstøl and Minister of Justice, Odd Einar Dørum, {{stated that the}} choice of TETRA would provide sufficient data capacity. In {{a parliamentary}} decision in 2004 {{it was decided to}} opt for the open European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as a data transmission standard, which is used by all other police TETRA systems in Europe, but this was later changed by the directorate to the proprietary TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS) owned by Motorola. The latter would limit the number of supplies and would increase the <b>investment</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1989, Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi founded Braathens Helikopter. The {{shipping}} company had {{signed an agreement}} with the oil companies Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil to provide helicopter transport for their crews to their offshore oil installations Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk. This {{was the first time the}} incumbent Helikopter Service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services. The initial agreement secured Braathens Helikopter a revenue of NOK800 million in the course of five years, and gave the company a 20% market share. Four 19-seet Aérospatiale Super Puma helicopters were ordered, each costing NOK60 million. Total <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> were NOK300 million. Two helicopters were stationed at Stavanger Airport, Sola and two at Bergen Airport, Flesland. The initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2003 {{municipal}} elections, the Labour Party mayor {{candidates for}} the municipalities of Skedsmo, Rælingen and Lørenskog, Andreas Hamnes, Terje Granerud and Åge Tovan, proposed that a central, inter-municipal athletics venue be built for Nedre Romerike. The proposal was followed up by the three athletics clubs in the area, Minerva IS, Strømmen IF and Lørenskog FIL, who established a committee. Several locations were considered, but the committee landed on Lillestrøm idrettspark because {{of the availability of}} existing utilities, parking and changing rooms, which would reduce the <b>investment</b> <b>costs.</b> In the process, Strømmen stadion was rejected because it was undergoing upgrades to receive artificial turf and Marikollen was deemed too remote. Also Nordlimyra in Lørenskog was deemed unsuitable. The choice of Lillestrøm idrettspark was selected by consensus among the municipalities and the sports clubs in June 2005.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} a game-theoretic model to analyze firms¡ ¦ partial compatibility choices. The {{quality of a}} hybrid system depends on the minimum of the compatibility levels chosen by firms. We find that, depending on the <b>investment</b> <b>cost,</b> the compatibility level could be incompatibility or partial compatibility. When the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is very small, firms¡ ¦ optimal compatibility levels are partial. If the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is relatively large, then firms will choose incompatibility.

40|$|We {{examine a}} game of {{competition}} with access provision in which service quality is endogenously determined through infrastructure upgrades with spillovers. There {{are two types of}} equilibria in the free competition regime. In particular, voluntary access provision with an access charge higher than access cost occurs in equilibrium, irrespective of the degree of spillover and the <b>investment</b> <b>cost.</b> However, foreclosure also occurs in equilibrium when the degree of spillover is small and the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is low. We also show that, when voluntary access provision occurs in equilibrium, access regulation is socially desirable only if the degree of spillover is small and the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is high. On the contrary, access regulation is socially desirable in the broader range of <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> under foreclosure than under voluntary access provision...|$|R
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} {{plans to}} connect the Sognsvann Line to the Grorud Line with a new Ring Line. The company also considered building the ring {{as part of the}} tramway, and have combined operation with both tram and metro on the Sognsvann Line. This was later discarded, despite the higher <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> with a metro, since the tramway would give higher operating costs and longer travel time. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It became clear that Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbors to the Sognsvann Line complained about the proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line.|$|E
5|$|Using {{conventional}} GSM systems {{was rejected}} also because GSM lacks {{many of the}} functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, dispatcher centers, and direct communication. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected {{because of the lack}} of trans-border functionality and the need for more base stations, and thus higher <b>investment</b> <b>costs,</b> and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of the base station, even if the central parts of the network break down.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{scientific}} investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823–24 which showed that there were potentially huge profits to be made from the reserves, both from the coal sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but also from the coal under common lands in the region that Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries – such as that at Rhigos – directly, but given the <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> and attention they took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on the coal mined instead. The lessees might be iron-masters, who used the coal in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold the coal on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from £872 {{in the second half of}} 1826, to £10,756 in 1848–49.|$|E

5|$|By 1873 {{agreement}} {{had been}} reached as to the right-of-way to Voss, but not onwards towards Oslo. On 13 January 1874 Bergen city council started issuing stock for the Voss Line, to begin with 400,000 Norwegian speciedaler (NOK 1.6 million) was issued. In the 1873 parliamentary election the railway supporter Peter Jebsen was elected, spending {{the next few years}} furiously defending the railway. Parliament chose to not issue new railway projects in the 1874 session, and instead make a complete plan for all railway construction in the country—to be proposed by a committee. When the report was launched on 20 March 1875, the Voss Line was not included since it could not show a higher profitability than 1%. During the 1875 session there was not a majority for the Voss Line, partially {{due to the lack of}} capital available for local investors. This was based on a claim from Johan Jørgen Schwartz, the chairman of the committee, that the <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> were underestimated. This was countered by Nils Henrik Bruun, a constructor from Bergen, who was willing to construct all tunnels on the railway for less than the budgeted sum. When Jebsen in addition was willing to act as personal guarantee for Bruun in case of his death, the majority in the parliament shifted. On 9 June 1875 parliament voted with 61 against 42 to build Vossebanen.|$|E
