Therefore, dendritic filopodia may be used by post-synaptic cells to detect passing axons.

Possibly due to gene duplication, there are two M 6 A paralogs, M 6 Aa and M 6 Ab, in the zebrafish genome. In the present study, we used the zebrafish as a model system to investigate the role of zebrafish M 6 Ab in <b>filopodium</b> formation in PC 12 cells and neurite outgrowth in zebrafish embryos. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrated that zebrafish M 6 Ab promoted extensive <b>filopodium</b> formation in NGF-treated PC 12 cells, which is similar to the function of mammalian M 6 A. Phosphorylation at serine 263 of zebrafish M 6 Ab contributed to this induction. Transfection of the S 263 A mutant protein greatly reduced <b>filopodium</b> formation in PC 12 cells. In zebrafish embryos, only S 263 D could induce neurite outgrowth.

40|$|AbstractFilopodia, or {{the growth}} of bundles of {{biological}} fibers outwards from a biological cell surface while enclosed in a membrane tube, are implicated in many processes vital to life. This study models the effect of capping protein on such filopodia, {{paying close attention to}} the polymerization dynamics of biological fiber bundles within long membrane tubes. Due to the effects of capping protein, the number of fibers in the <b>filopodium</b> bundle decreases {{down the length of the}} enclosing membrane tube. This decrease in the number of fibers down the length of a growing <b>filopodium</b> is found to have profound implications for the dynamics and stability of filopodia in general. This study theoretically finds that the presence of even a relatively modest amount of capping protein can have a large effect on {{the growth of}} typical filopodia, such as can be found in fibroblasts, keratocytes, and neuronal growth cones. As an illustration of this modeling work, this study investigates the striking example of the acrosomal reaction in the sea cucumber Thyone, whose filopodia can grow remarkably quickly to ∼ 90 μm in ∼ 10 s, and where the number of fibers is known to decrease down the length of the <b>filopodium,</b> presumably due to progressive fiber end-capping occurring as the <b>filopodium</b> grows.

We have now investigated {{the role of the}} transmembrane protein CD 47 in this process in N 1 E- 115 neuroblastoma cells. Forced expression of CD 47 induced the formation of neurites and filopodia. Furthermore, an Fc fusion protein containing the extracellular region of the CD 47 ligand SHPS- 1 induced <b>filopodium</b> formation, and this effect was enhanced by CD 47 overexpression. SHPS- 1 –Fc also promoted neurite and <b>filopodium</b> formation triggered by serum deprivation. Inhibition of Rac or Cdc 42 preferentially blocked CD 47 -induced formation of neurites and filopodia, respectively. Overexpression of CD 47 resulted in the activation of both Rac and Cdc 42. The extracellular region of CD 47 was sufficient for the induction of neurite formation by forced expression, but the entire structure of CD 47 was required for enhancement of <b>filopodium</b> formation by SHPS- 1 –Fc. Neurite formation induced by CD 47 was also inhibited by a mAb to the integrin β 3 subunit. These results indicate that the interaction of SHPS- 1 with CD 47 promotes neurite and <b>filopodium</b> formation through the activation of Rac and Cdc 42, and that integrins containing the β 3 subunit participate in the effect of CD 47 on neurite formation...|$|E

40|$|TNF {{is known}} to {{regulate}} macrophage (M phi) migration, but the signaling pathways mediating this response have not been established. Here we report that stimulation of the 55 -kDa TNF receptor (TNFR- 1) induced an overall decrease in filamentous actin (F-actin), inhibited CSF- 1 - and Cdc 42 -dependent <b>filopodium</b> formation, and stimulated macropinocytosis. Using a panel of TNFR- 1 mutants, the regions of the receptor required {{for each of these}} responses were mapped. The decrease in F-actin required both the death domain and the membrane proximal part of the receptor, whereas inhibition of <b>filopodium</b> formation and increased pinocytosis were only dependent upon a functional death domain. When the TNF-induced decrease in F-actin was inhibited using either receptor mutants or the compound D 609, TNF-stimulated actin reorganization at the cell cortex became apparent. This activity was dependent upon the FAN-binding region of TNFR- 1, We conclude that different domains of TNFR- 1 mediate distinct changes in the M phi cytoskeleton, and that the ability of TNF to inhibit M phi chemotaxis may be due to decreased <b>filopodium</b> formation downstream of Cdc 42...|$|E
40|$|Filopodia are {{cellular}} protrusions important for axon guidance, embryonic development, and wound healing. The Rho GTPase Cdc 42 {{is the best}} studied inducer of <b>filopodium</b> formation, and several of its effectors and their interacting partners {{have been linked to}} the process. These include IRSp 53, N-WASP, Mena, and Eps 8. The Rho GTPase, Rif, also drives <b>filopodium</b> formation. The signaling pathway by which Rif induces filopodia is poorly understood, with mDia 2 being the only protein implicated to date. It is thus not clear how distinct the Rif-driven pathway for <b>filopodium</b> formation is from the one mediated by Cdc 42. In this study, we characterize the dynamics of Rif-induced filopodia by time lapse imaging of live neuronal cells and show that Rif drives <b>filopodium</b> formation via an independent pathway that does not involve the Cdc 42 effectors N-WASP and IRSp 53, the IRSp 53 binding partner Mena, or the Rac effectors WAVE 1 and WAVE 2. Rif formed filopodia in the absence of N-WASP or Mena and when IRSp 53, WAVE 1, or WAVE 2 was knocked down by RNAi. Rif-mediated filopodial protrusion was instead reduced by silencing mDia 1 expression or overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of mDia 1. mDia 1 on its own was able to form filopodia. Data from acceptor photobleaching FRET studies of protein-protein interaction demonstrate that Rif interacts directly with mDia 1 in filopodia but not with mDia 2.

An individual <b>filopodium</b> initially protrudes, but then becomes separated from the tip of the lamellipodium and seeds the formation of a new GP bundle within the lamella. In individual live cells expressing both GFP-myosin II and RFP-actin, myosin II puncta localize to the base of an individual <b>filopodium</b> an average 28 s before the <b>filopodium</b> seeds the formation of a new GP bundle.

Inhibition of myosin II motor activity in live cells blocks appearance of new GP bundles in the lamella, without inhibition of cell protrusion in the same timescale.

40|$|Migration {{of cells}} is {{critical}} to development of the central nervous system. Reelin, which was identified from the reeler mutant mice having a defect in the multilamellar structure of the brain, {{is thought to be}} a key signalling molecule that functions as a cue for determination of cell position. mDab 1 (mouse Disabled homologue 1) functions downstream of Reelin. However, the mechanism by which mDab 1 regulates cell migration during brain development is unknown. In the present paper, we show that mDab 1 associates with N-WASP (neuronal Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein) in vitro and in brains of embryonic mice. mDab 1 activates N-WASP directly, and induces actin polymerization through the Arp 2 / 3 (actin-related protein 2 / 3) complex. mDab 1 induces formation of filopodia when it is overexpressed in COS- 7  cells. This <b>filopodium</b> formation is dependent on N-WASP, because expression of an N-WASP mutant that cannot induce Arp 2 / 3 -complex-mediated actin polymerization suppressed <b>filopodium</b> formation. The PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding) domain of mDab 1 binds to N-WASP via the NRFY (Asn-Arg-Phe-Tyr) sequence close to the CRIB (Cdc 42 /Rac-interactive binding) motif of N-WASP and activates N-WASP in vitro. When mDab 1 is phosphorylated by Fyn kinase in COS- 7  cells, mDab 1 is ubiquitinated in a Cbl-dependent manner, and mDab 1 does not induce <b>filopodium</b> in the presence of activated Fyn.

40|$|Cell {{migration}} {{is a fundamental}} biological function, critical during development and regeneration, whereas deregulated migration underlies neurological birth defects and cancer metastasis. MARCKS-like protein 1 (MARCKSL 1) is widely expressed in nervous tissue, where, like Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), it is required for neural tube formation, though the mechanism is unknown. Here we show that MARCKSL 1 is directly phosphorylated by JNK on C-terminal residues (S 120, T 148, and T 183). This phosphorylation enables MARCKSL 1 to bundle and stabilize F-actin, increase <b>filopodium</b> numbers and dynamics, and retard migration in neurons. Conversely, when MARCKSL 1 phosphorylation is inhibited, actin mobility increases and <b>filopodium</b> formation is compromised whereas lamellipodium formation is enhanced, as is cell migration. We find that MARCKSL 1 mRNA is upregulated in {{a broad range of}} cancer types and that MARCKSL 1 protein is strongly induced in primary prostate carcinomas. Gene knockdown in prostate cancer cells or in neurons reveals a critical role for MARCKSL 1 in migration that is dependent on the phosphorylation state; phosphomimetic MARCKSL 1 (MARCKSL 1 (S 120 D,T 148 D,T 183 D)) inhibits whereas dephospho-MARCKSL(1 S 120 A,T 148 A,T 183 A) induces migration. In summary, these data show that JNK phosphorylation of MARCKSL 1 regulates actin homeostasis, <b>filopodium</b> and lamellipodium formation, and neuronal migration under physiological conditions and that, when ectopically expressed in prostate cancer cells, MARCKSL 1 again determines cell movement...|$|E
40|$|A <b>filopodium</b> is a cytoplasmic projection, exquisitely {{built and}} regulated, which {{extends from the}} leading edge of the {{migrating}} cell, exploring the cell's neighborhood. Commonly, filopodia grow and retract after their initiation, exhibiting rich dynamical behaviors. We model the growth of a <b>filopodium</b> based on a stochastic description which incorporates mechanical, physical, and biochemical components. Our model provides a full stochastic treatment of the actin monomer diffusion and polymerization of each individual actin filament under stress of the fluctuating membrane. We investigated the length distribution of individual filaments in a growing <b>filopodium</b> and studied how it depends on various physical parameters. The distribution of filament lengths turned out to be narrow, which we explained by the negative feedback created by the membrane load and monomeric G-actin gradient. We also discovered that filopodial growth is strongly diminished upon increasing retrograde flow, suggesting that regulating the retrograde flow rate would be a highly efficient way to control filopodial extension dynamics. The filopodial length increases as the membrane fluctuations decrease, which we attributed to the unequal loading of the membrane force among individual filaments, which, in turn, results in larger average polymerization rates. We also observed significant diffusional noise of G-actin monomers, which leads to smaller G-actin flux along the filopodial tube compared with the prediction using the diffusion equation. Overall, partial cancellation of these two fluctuation effects allows a simple mean field model to rationalize most of our simulation results. However, fast fluctuations significantly renormalize the mean field model parameters. The biological significance of our filopodial model and avenues for future development are also discussed...|$|E

More than 70 % of the obstacle movements were caused by filopodial contractions in which the obstacle attached at the extreme distal end of a <b>filopodium</b> and moved only as the <b>filopodium</b> changed its extension.

Although these retrograde flow movements also exerted enough force to account for growth cone pulling, we did not observe such movements on ventral growth cone surfaces. Occasionally obstacles were moved by interaction with ruffling lamellipodia. However, we obtained no evidence for attachment of the obstacles to ruffling lamellipodia or for directed obstacle movements by this mechanism.

It has been proposed that the essential role of VASP for formation of filopodia is its competition with capping proteins for filament barbed-end interaction. To better understand the function of VASP in <b>filopodium</b> formation, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo properties of Dictyostelium VASP (DdVASP) and extended our findings to human VASP. Recombinant VASP from both species nucleated and bundled actin filaments, but did not compete with capping proteins or block depolymerization from barbed ends. Together with the finding that DdVASP binds to the FH 2 domain of dDia 2, these data indicate that the crucial role of VASP in <b>filopodium</b> formation is different from uncapping of actin filaments. To identify the activity of DdVASP required in this process, rescue experiments of DdVASP-null cells with mutant DdVASP constructs were performed.

One component is purified to homogeneity and is identified as the Arp 2 / 3 complex, a protein complex that has been shown to nucleate actin polymerization. However, the purified complex alone is not sufficient to mediate the activity; a second component that binds Cdc 42 directly and mediates the interaction between Cdc 42 and the complex also is required. These results establish an important link between a signaling molecule, Cdc 42, and a complex that can directly modulate actin networks in vitro. We propose that activation of the Arp 2 / 3 complex by Cdc 42 and other signaling molecules plays a central role in stimulating actin polymerization at the cell surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of axon collateral branches {{is a fundamental}} aspect {{of the development of}} neuronal circuits. Emergence of axonal filopodia from the axon {{is the first step in}} the {{formation of}} axon collateral branches and pre-synaptic structures. Using embryonic sensory axons as a model system, we have determined that axonal filopodia are formed from transient accumulations of F-actin within the axon, termed actin patches. We found that the branch-inducing factor NGF induces the formation of axonal actin patches and filopodia. NGF signaling, through PI 3 K, promotes the formation of localized axonal microdomains of PIP 3 accumulation. The microdomains in turn drive formation of actin patches. Under basal conditions, only a subset of actin patches gives rise to filopodia, and many patches dissipate without forming a <b>filopodium.</b> Neither NGF nor direct activation of PI 3 K affects the probability that an actin patch will give rise to a <b>filopodium.</b> Thus, NGF increases formation of axonal filopodia through localized PI 3 K signaling that promotes the initiation of actin patch precursors to the formation of axonal filopodia. The promotion of actin patch formation by NGF may be mediated through a PI 3 K-TOR pathway driving intra-axonal protein synthesis. We propose the hypothesis that NGF signaling “turns up the volume” on the mechanism of filopodial formation by increasing axonal levels of the cytoskeletal proteins required for the orchestration of actin patch formation by PIP 3 microdomains...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFilopodia {{are highly}} dynamic cell-surface {{protrusions}} used by cells to sense their external environment. At {{the core of}} the <b>filopodium</b> is a bundle of actin filaments. These give form to the filopodia and also drive the cycle of elongation and retraction. Recent studies have shown that two very different actin nucleating proteins control the formation of filopodial actin filaments — Arp 2 / 3 and Formins. Although the actin filaments produced by these two nucleators have very different structures and properties, recent work has begun to piece together evidence for co-operation between Arp 2 / 3 and formins in filopodia formation, leading to a deeper understanding of these sensory organelles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{extension}} and retraction of filopodia {{in response to}} extracellular cues {{is thought to be}} an important initial step that determines the direction of growth cone advance. We sought to understand how the dynamic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton is regulated to produce extension or retraction. By observing the movement of fiduciary marks on actin filaments in growth cones of a neuroblastoma cell line, we found that <b>filopodium</b> {{extension and}} retraction are governed WIRING of the nervous system depends on the correct navigation of nerve growth cones along stereotyped pathways during development. Filopodia are slender protrusions of the actin cytoskeleton present in the periphery of nerve growth cones that have been implicated in growth cone pathfinding. Filopodiu...|$|E
40|$|The F-BAR domain is {{emerging}} as an important player in membrane remodeling pathways. F-BAR domain proteins couple membrane remodeling with actin dynamics associated with endocytic pathways and <b>filopodium</b> formation. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of F-BAR domain proteins {{in terms of their}} evolutionary relationships and protein function. F-BAR domain containing proteins can be categorized into five subfamilies based on their phylogeny which is consistent with the additional protein domains they possess, for example, RhoGAP domains, Cdc 42 binding sites, SH 3 domains and tyrosine kinase domains. We derive a protein-protein interaction network suggesting that dynamin 1 / 2, N-WASP, Huntingtin, intersectin and Cdc 42 are central nodes influencing F-BAR domain protein function...|$|E
40|$|WIP stabilizes actin {{filaments}} and {{is important}} for <b>filopodium</b> formation. To define the role of WIP in immunity, we generated WIP-deficient mice. WIP(minus sign/minus sign) mice have normal lymphocyte development, but their T cells fail to proliferate, secrete IL- 2, increase their F-actin content, polarize and extend protrusions following T cell receptor ligation, and are deficient in conjugate formation with superantigen-presenting B cells and anti-CD 3 bilayers. In contrast, WIP-deficient B lymphocytes have enhanced proliferation and CD 69 expression following B cell receptor ligation and mount normal antibody responses to T-independent antigens. Both WIP-deficient T and B cells show a profound defect in their subcortical actin filament networks. These results suggest that WIP {{is important for}} immunologic synapse formation and T cell activation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMisshapen (Msn) {{has been}} {{proposed}} to shut down Drosophila photoreceptor (R cell) growth cone motility in response to targeting signals linked by the SH 2 /SH 3 adaptor protein Dock. Here, we show that Bifocal (Bif), a putative cytoskeletal regulator, is {{a component of the}} Msn pathway for regulating R cell growth cone targeting. bif displays strong genetic interaction with msn. Phenotypic analysis indicates a specific role for Bif to terminate R 1 –R 6 growth cones. Biochemical studies show that Msn associates directly with Bif and phosphorylates Bif in vitro. Cell culture studies demonstrate that Msn interacts with Bif to regulate F-actin structure and <b>filopodium</b> formation. We propose that Bif functions downstream of Msn to reorganize actin cytoskeleton in decelerating R cell growth cone motility at the target region...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{reorganization}} of actin structures helps {{to mediate the}} interaction of cells with their environment. The Abl non-receptor tyrosine kinase can modulate actin rearrangement during cell attachment. Here we report that the Abl PxxP motifs, which bind Src homology 3 (SH 3) domains, are indispensable for the coordinated regulation of <b>filopodium</b> and focal adhesion formation and cell-spreading dynamics during attachment. Candidate Abl PxxP-motif-binding partners were identified by screening a comprehensive SH 3 -domain phage-display library. A combination of protein overexpression, silencing, pharmacological manipulation and mutational analysis demonstrated that the PxxP motifs of Abl exert their effects on actin organization by two distinct mechanisms, involving the inhibition of Crk signaling and the engagement of Nck. These results uncover a previously unappreciated role for Abl PxxP motifs in the regulation of cell spreading...|$|E
