40|$|SYNOPSIS The {{effect of}} blood in vaginal fluid on the assay of 6 -phosphogluconate {{dehydrogenase}} has been studied. Alternative assay procedures have been investigated to overcome these effects. A study of the activity of 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (<b>Enzyme</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>No.</b> 1. 1. 1. 44) in the vaginal fluid {{of large numbers of}} women has been carried out to investigate whether the assay of this enzyme would be suitable for widespread application as a screening procedure for early gynaecological cancer (Bonham and Gibbs, 1962...|$|E
30|$|The Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) {{molecule}} (1 mg mL- 1, <b>Enzyme</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>No.</b> 1.11. 1.7, 44 kDa) {{was purchased}} from Xiya Reagent (Chengdu, China). The sample (HRP) was dissolved in 0.02 μm filtered 0.1 M PBS, stored at 4  °C, and employed {{within two days}} of preparation. Potassium chloride (KCl), N-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 2, 2 ’-Azino-bis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) ((ABTS), 98 %) were purchased from DiBo chemical technology co., LTD (Shanghai, China). Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2, 30 %) was bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (3 -Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (3 -APTES) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Experiments were conducted using untrapure water from a Milli-Q water purification system (resistivity of 18.2 MΩ/cm, 25  °C, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) and was filtered through 0.02 μm in a FEI Strata 201 FIB system (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR, USA), a Zetasizer (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS), and an Axopatch 700 B (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

30|$|The {{idea of a}} {{particular}} structure being absolutely related to a biological activity has been considered the hallmark of biology for many decades. Hence, {{it is not surprising}} that <b>enzyme</b> <b>commission</b> classification was based upon the type of reaction the enzyme catalyzes –hydrolysis, isomerisation or redox reactions etc. [8]. This in retrospect may not have been such a wise move as we believed till now.|$|R
50|$|Pyridoxal {{phosphate}} (PLP, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, P5P), {{the active}} form of vitamin B6, is a coenzyme {{in a variety}} of enzymatic reactions. The <b>Enzyme</b> <b>commission</b> has catalogued more than 140 PLP-dependent activities, corresponding to ~4% of all classified activities. The versatility of PLP arises from its ability to covalently bind the substrate, and then to act as an electrophilic catalyst, thereby stabilizing different types of carbanionic reaction intermediates.|$|R
