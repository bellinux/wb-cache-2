Iotified Cyrillic {{letters are}} ligatures {{of the early}} Cyrillic decimal I and another vowel: Ꙗ (ancestor of Я), Ѥ, Ѩ, Ѭ, Ю (descended from another ligature, Оу, {{an early version of}} У). Two letters of the Bosnian, Macedonian and Serbian Cyrillic alphabets, lje and nje (љ, њ), were developed in the nineteenth century as ligatures of Cyrillic El and En (л, н) with the soft sign (ь).

She kind of began that trend of actually coming back with a whole new look and style and sound and winning it and hitting the top of the charts. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding.

500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid.

500|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] was celebrated in 2005. Radio {{stations}} around the world paid homage to USA for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by {{the release of a}} two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song. Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to [...] "use it to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> good [...] That's all we care about accomplishing." [...] Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20thanniversary of the song.

60|$|So very slyly and cleverly Old Man Coyote {{followed}} Granny and Reddy Fox, {{taking the}} greatest {{care that they}} should not suspect that he was doing it.

60|$|But after a while, {{having nothing}} else to do, Reddy began to think. Now it is {{surprising}} how thinking will change matters.

Right away Reddy realized that to have been so caught would have been much worse than being a prisoner in Farmer Brown's henyard.

They've got a name for it, you know; it's--confound you, don't you understand? A fellow feels--it's something like that blamed art of yours--he--well, I tore that photograph up and laid the pieces on that stack of money and shoved the whole business back across the table. 'Excuse me, Mr. Losada,' I said, 'but I guess I've made a mistake in the price. You get the photo for nothing.' Now, Carry, you get out the pencil, and we'll <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> figuring.

Shortly after that the snowstorm came on, and the high winds, and it was all we could do to gain one of the old shelters up there between the rocks. In journeying around we lost a good portion of our outfit, including some of the provisions, and all we had to live on for two days was some venison--Mr. Porter shot a small red deer--and some beans and crackers. We had intended to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> exploring, but the weather put a stop to everything of that sort. Then one of the party, Mr. Jackson, took sick and we had to do what we could to get him well again. At last Mr. Porter went out to see if he couldn't bring down something in the way of game. He could get only some small birds and they lasted only one meal. Then he went out again, after an elk he had seen at a distance. That was when he took the tumble over the cliffs." ...|$|E
6000|$|The deuce {{is in this}} volume. It {{has cost}} me more botheration and dubiety than any other I ever took in hand. On one thing my mind is made up: the verses at the end have no {{business}} there, and throw them down. Many of them are bad, many of the rest want nine years' keeping, and the remainder are not relevant--throw them down; some I never want to hear of more, others will grow in time towards decent items in a second Underwoods--and in the meanwhile, down with them! At the same time, I have a sneaking idea the ballads are not altogether without merit--I don't know if they're poetry, but they're good narrative, or I'm deceived. (You've never said one word about them, from which I astutely gather you are dead set against: [...] "he was a diplomatic man"--extract from epitaph of E. L. B.--"and remained on good terms with Minor Poets.") You will have to judge: one of the Gladstonian trinity of paths must be chosen. (1st) Either publish the five ballads, such as they are, in a volume called Ballads; in which case pray send sheets at once to Chatto and Windus.
