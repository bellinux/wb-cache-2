25|$|The Earth {{inductor}} compass is {{a device}} for determining aircraft direction using {{the magnetic field}} of the Earth. The operation of the compass {{is based on the}} principle of electromagnetic induction with the Earth's magnetic field acting as the <b>induction</b> <b>field</b> for an electric generator. A variation generated voltage, thus allows the Earth inductor compass to determine direction. The earth inductor compass is an American invention. It was designed in 1924 by Morris Titterington at the Pioneer Instrument Company. Designed to compensate for the weaknesses of the magnetic compass, the Earth inductor compass provided pilots with a more stable and reliable reference instrument.|$|E
25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an AC electric motor {{in which the}} electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is induced by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding instead of using mechanical commutation (brushes) that caused sparking in earlier electric motors.

40|$|The {{detection}} of smooth curves in images and their completion over gaps are two important problems in perceptual grouping. In this paper {{we examine the}} notion of completion energy and introduce a fast method to compute the most likely completions in images. Specifically, we develop two novel analytic approximations to the curve of least energy. In addition, we introduce a fast numerical method to compute the curve of least energy, and show that our approximations are obtained at early stages of this numerical computation. We then use our newly developed energies {{to find the most}} likely completions in images through a generalized summation of <b>induction</b> <b>fields.</b> Since in practice edge elements are obtained by applying filters of certain widths and lengths to the image, we adjust our computation to take these parameters into account. Finally, we show that, due to the smoothness of the kernel of summation, the process of summing <b>induction</b> <b>fields</b> can be run in time that is linear in the number of different edge elements in the image, or in O(N log N) where N is the number of pixels in the image, using multigrid methods...|$|R
