We conclude that existing WTO provisions do not clearly prohibit every form of discrimination in GSP. Economic analysis provides some support for India’s view that the drug-related preferences are harmful to its interests, and we argue that the WTO indeed may have a legitimate basis to regulate discrimination in GSP. However, a tightening of WTO rules on GSP might lead the developed countries to eliminate these schemes entirely, with costs for most or all developing countries that could well exceed the benefits...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{draws on}} critical race theory and critical legal theory {{in order to}} read and critique the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment of Erasmus AJA in BoE Trust Limited 2013 3 SA 236 (SCA). It will specifically focus on the contested jurisprudential and racial politics reflected in the reasoning followed in the judgement. It specifically takes issue with {{the way in which}} the judge avoided dealing directly with the constitutional and political implications of racially-exclusive testamentary provisions. Three specific features of the judgment are highlighted in the note as problematic: first, the rhetorical moves and ‘legal interpretive techniques’ by which the judge escaped the basic legal texts governing the situation in which a racially <b>discriminatory</b> <b>provision</b> is included in a will, as well as the substantive reasoning and normative choices that those texts necessarily invite. Secondly, how the escape from those legal texts evinces, or perhaps even facilitated, a certain evasion of, or anxiety towards the horizontal application of the Bill of Rights which explicitly proscribes overt (racial) discrimination by private non-state actors. And thirdly, how by following a formalist legal approach, one in which the basic assumptions of liberal legalism and capitalism are viewed as natural, normal and immutable, the judgment lacks a decisive rejection of racism. The judgment’s uncritical adulation of the common law of succession (and specifically the principle of freedom of testation) and its negation of a more substantive, constitutionally-infused mode of reasoning and adjudication generally reflects a conservative or traditional view of law. It is suggested that this view of law is problematic in our current post-apartheid context for two central reasons: it stands in tension with the project of transformative constitutionalism and prevents the coming into being of a more critical race jurisprudence for postapartheid South Africa...|$|E
40|$|The agrarian {{question}} {{is one of}} Zimbabwe's enduring colonial legacies. At independence the ensemble if issues comprising the agrarian question included an inequitable racial distribution of land, different tenure systems for blacks and white settlers, a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>provision</b> of agricultural support services, and repressive relations {{between the state and}} the peasantry. Peasant grievances over the agrarian question mobilised their support for the liberation struggle which culminated in independence in 1980. Contrary to the expectations of the majority of Zimbabweans, agrarian reforms introduced since independence have not transformed the colonial agrarian structure. The thesis investigates factors which account for the nature of agrarian reforms. Using a socio-historical analysis, it examines changes and continuities in agrarian policies and laws. In the main, the thesis argues that reform has been shaped by changes in power relations in society which are reflected in the exercise of state power. It shows that the manner in which independence was achieved and the character and ideologies of the social forces that inherited state power account for the changes and continuities in policies and laws. The thesis demonstrates that land reform was initially constrained by the constitutional provision which protected private property from compulsory acquisition. More important, it argues that reform has been determined by the failure to transform the inherited accumulation strategy, of which capitalist agriculture is an integral element. In addition, it demonstrates that the manner in which land has been redistributed reflects the continuation of colonial ideologies of modernisation. Furthermore, the thesis shows that communal tenure as constructed by the colonial state has been retained partly because of the ideology of nee-traditionalism and partly because it allows the state to intervene in peasant land use and production processes' as part of the process of modernisation. It also shows that the modernisation of peasant agriculture has been attempted through the extension of input, credit, price and marketing packages. Consequently, the thesis shows that the agrarian {{question is}} as relevant today as it was at independence, and that the limited and contradictory nature of the agrarian reforms reflects the limitations and contradictions inherent in the post-colonial democratisation process. Hence agrarian reform can only be adequately addressed as part of a comprehensive transformation of the accumulation process and societal democratisation...|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{response}} to an article by: Eskridge Jr., William N., The Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s Perry Decision and the Constitutional Politics of Marriage Equality, in 64 Stan. L. Rev. Online 93 (2012). This essay examines the impact of Perry v. Brown, 671 F. 3 d 1052 (9 th Cir. 2012), the first appellate federal court decision on the constitutional validity of marriage exclusion laws. The author argues that the major contribution of the Perry decision is to illuminate the meaning of animus, a term that is sharply contested in Equal Protection jurisprudence, and to explicate its relationship to standards of review. The Ninth Circuit holds that evidence of animosity toward a disfavored group triggers a heightened rational basis standard of review. The Supreme Court has not yet settled on how to analyze evidence of animus. In his dissent in Romer v. Evans, Justice Scalia ridiculed the idea that believing homosexuality to be immoral could be compared to racial or religious bias. By contrast, in her concurrence in Lawrence v. Texas, Justice O’Connor articulated the principle adopted by the Ninth Circuit in Perry: that laws driven by animus toward a social group are subject to a “more searching” version of rational basis review. The majority of Justices, however, appear to be gunshy about even acknowledging the existence of heightened rational basis review, even though they have been relying on it sub silentio for several decades. The Perry court provides the fullest articulation of it to date. The Court of Appeals in Perry also takes a new perspective on how courts should assess the validity of popularly enacted initiatives such as Proposition 8. For both proponents and opponents of popular constitutionalism, the gay marriage debates raise the question of whether voters or courts should get the last word in a constitutional democracy when they take polar opposite positions on a minority rights issue. The Perry opinion would impose less a death knell to such initiatives than a set of speed bumps, through which courts would analyze whether a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>provision</b> was the retraction of a right or a failure to extend it, and whether it had a demonstrably legitimate purpose, other than simply the imposition of stigma. In the gay marriage context, the court left open the possibility that limiting marriage to different sex couples could be justified by the desire to discourage “accidental procreation. ” However, based on evidence about the campaign to pass Proposition 8, the court found that animus had been the dominant motivation in this case...|$|E
40|$|Proposed {{constitutional}} changes must be put {{in terms}} that promote consensus, argues Russell McGregor. Can the changes recently recommended by the Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples succeed? Or {{to put it another}} way, can we repeat the success of 1967, when an overwhelming majority of Australians voted for constitutional change favourable to Aboriginal people? To answer these questions, it’s helpful to put the recent panel’s recommendations in historical perspective. The panel recommended the repeal of the two sections of the Constitution which refer to ‘race’: Section 25, which permits states to disqualify people of a particular race from voting in state elections (though it also deters states from actually doing so); and Section 51 (xxvi), which empowers the Commonwealth parliament to enact ‘special laws’ applicable solely to specific races. The panel made other recommendations on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, but here I’ll focus on the sections recommended for repeal, particularly Section 51 (xxvi) since it is, and always has been, the more contentious of the two. The original Constitution of 1901 included an additional <b>discriminatory</b> <b>provision</b> in Section 127, which stipulated that ‘aboriginal natives’ not be included in official census counts. This section was deleted in consequence of the 1967 referendum, which resulted in the removal of all constitutional references to Aboriginal people. The same referendum brought about the amendment of Section 51 (xxvi) to its present form. Before 1967, this section specifically excluded ‘the aboriginal race in any state’ from its ambit. In effect, this meant that the Commonwealth had the power to enact ‘special laws’ for any race except the Aboriginal race. Why was the exception made? A definitive answer is impossible. The record of constitutional drafting that culminated in 1901 gives few clues; indeed, Aboriginal issues were very seldom raised in the numerous federation conventions and conferences. Perhaps the best explanation is that offered by Hugh Mahon, a federationist and member of the first Commonwealth parliament. Mahon suggested that the ‘aboriginal race’ in Section 51 (xxvi) did not originally refer exclusively to Aboriginal Australians but also to Maori. The section first appeared in the constitutional draft of 1891, when New Zealand was a prospective member of the federation. At the time, Maori in New Zealand, unlike Aboriginal people in Australia, enjoyed full civil rights and New Zealand delegates were reluctant to jeopardise this by putting Maori affairs under federal (effectively, Australian-dominated) control. So a ‘race power’ clause was inserted allowing the Commonwealth to discriminate against what were then regarded as undesirable ‘alien’ races (such as Pacific Islanders and Chinese), but the ‘aboriginal race in any state’ was excepted to assuage New Zealand sensitivities. After New Zealand withdrew from the federation process, the exception was retained largely out of the federal leaders’ indifference toward Aboriginal affairs. The original intention of the reference to the ‘aboriginal race’ in Section 51 (xxvi) seems to have been beneficent (to safeguard Maori rights) but its implementation was to the detriment of Aboriginal people. Invoking this clause, successive Commonwealth governments shrugged aside responsibility for Aboriginal affairs onto the states. Whenever there was criticism of Australia’s record in indigenous affairs, Commonwealth authorities trotted out Section 51 (xxvi) as the standard excuse for inaction. There was nothing they could do, they protested (somewhat disingenuously) since the Constitution made Aboriginal affairs a state prerogative. As public disquiet intensified over the status and treatment of Aboriginal people, especially after the Second World War, so pressure grew for the Commonwealth to take a greater role in Aboriginal affairs. Many campaigners for the Aboriginal cause came to believe that this required constitutional change, specifically the repeal of Section 127 and the deletion of the reference to the ‘aboriginal race’ from Section 51 (xxvi). A campaign to amend the Constitution in this manner was launched by the human rights activist Jessie Street in 1957, and {{over the next ten years}} the campaign was led by the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI). Some activists and politicians in the 1950 s and 1960 s advocated the repeal of the entirety of Section 51 (xxvi) : that is, the abolition of the Commonwealth power to enact ‘special laws’ applicable to specific races. (This is what the current Panel on Constitutional Recognition recommends.) However, the leaders of FCAATSI were convinced that the Commonwealth needed to retain its power to enact laws specific to a particular race so it could legislate for the benefit of Aboriginal people, in, for example, granting land, employment and economic opportunities. Not all FCAATSI members agreed with this, but the leadership line prevailed, so when Australians went to the polls on 27 May 1967 they voted for the deletion not of the entirety of Section 51 (xxvi) but only of the reference to the ‘aboriginal race’. In any event, the constitutional niceties were lost on the majority of voters. The 1967 referendum was presented as an opportunity for the Australian public to affirm their acceptance of Aboriginal people as fellow citizens. Eagerly grasping the opportunity, the Australian people registered the greatest referendum victory in Australia’s history. Over 90 percent voted Yes. In some electorates the Yes vote exceeded 95 percent, and in none was it under 70 percent – a result as close to consensus as can be expected in a democratic contest. The consequences of the 1967 referendum were less tangible than is commonly supposed. Contrary to popular memorialisation, it did not secure the vote or civil rights for Aboriginal people; they already possessed these before the referendum. But this in no way detracts from the significance of the overwhelming Yes vote. As I explain in my recent book, Indifferent Inclusion: Aboriginal People and the Australian Nation (Aboriginal Studies Press), the significance of the referendum lay in its symbolic affirmation of Aboriginal people’s acceptance into the national community. The recent recommendations of the Panel on Constitutional Recognition seek to extend that affirmation by repealing the ‘race power’, prohibiting racial discrimination and explicitly recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. There’s an irony in the fact that the 1967 affirmation of Aboriginal acceptance resulted in the deletion of the only two references to Aboriginal people in the Constitution, whereas the recent panel’s recommendations (if successful) will put references back in again. But that merely signals the fact that social inclusion is an ongoing process that is still far from complete. One point about the 1967 referendum that is often overlooked is that there was no campaign for a No vote. Even the federal government broke with convention by providing, in the official advice issued to voters immediately before the referendum, only the case for Yes. It seems unlikely that there will be the same degree of unanimity when the current recommendations on constitutional change go to referendum. But the lessons for those pushing for a referendum are clear: the constitutional changes must {{be put in}} terms that provoke least controversy and promote greatest consensus.
