5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Song dynasty (960–1279) was noted for its towering Buddhist pagodas, enormous stone and wooden bridges, lavish tombs, and extravagant palaces. Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand, architectural writing blossomed during the Song dynasty, maturing into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise, organized manner. In addition to the examples still standing, depictions <b>in</b> <b>Song</b> artwork, architectural drawings, and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding the {{architecture of}} the period.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{has been}} the subject of many biographical films.

Amongst other film portrayals of Wagner are: Alan Badel in Magic Fire (1955); Lyndon Brook <b>in</b> <b>Song</b> Without End (1960); Trevor Howard in Ludwig (1972); Paul Nicholas in Lisztomania (1975); and Richard Burton in Wagner (1983).|$|E
5|$|Buddhism {{never fully}} {{recovered}} after several major persecutions in China from the 5th through the 10th centuries, although Daoism continued to thrive <b>in</b> <b>Song</b> China. In northern China under the Jin dynasty after 1127, the Daoist philosopher Wang Chongyang (1113–1170) established the Quanzhen School. Wang's seven disciples, {{known as the}} Seven Immortals, gained great fame throughout China. They included the prominent Daoist priestess Sun Bu'er (c. 1119–1182), who became a female role model in Daoism. There was also Qiu Chuji (1148–1227), who founded his own Quanzhen Daoist branch known as Longmen ("Dragon Gate"). In the Southern Song, cult centers of Daoism became popular at mountain sites that were reputed to be the earthly sojourns of Daoist deities; elite families had shrines erected in these mountain retreats {{in honor of the}} local deity thought to reside therein. Much more so than for Buddhist clergy, Daoist priests and holy men were sought when one prayed for having a son, when one was physically ill, or when there was need for change after a long spell of bad weather and poor harvest.|$|E

5|$|Kite: As {{written in}} the Mozi, the Zhou Dynasty philosopher, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer Lu Ban (fl. 5th century BC) from the State of Lu created a wooden bird that remained flying {{in the air for}} three days, essentially a kite; there is written evidence that kites were used as rescue signals when the city of Nanjing was besieged by Hou Jing (died 552) during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502–549), while similar accounts of kites used for military signalling are found in the Tang (618–907) and Jin (1115–1234) dynasties; kite flying as a pastime can be seen in painted murals of Dunhuang dating to the Northern Wei (386–534) period, while descriptions of flying kites as a pastime have been found <b>in</b> <b>Song</b> (960–1279) and Ming (1368–1644) texts.|$|E

In parts of Apulia (Grecìa Salentina, for example) the Griko dialect is commonly used <b>in</b> <b>song.</b> The Apulian city of Taranto is a home of the tarantella, a rhythmic dance widely performed in southern Italy.

5|$|The gentry {{distinguished}} {{themselves in}} society through their intellectual and antiquarian pursuits, while {{the homes of}} prominent landholders attracted a variety of courtiers, including artisans, artists, educational tutors, and entertainers. Despite the disdain for trade, commerce and the merchant class exhibited by the highly cultured and elite exam-drafted scholar-officials, commercialism played a prominent role <b>in</b> <b>Song</b> culture and society. A scholar-official would be frowned upon by his peers if he pursued means of profiteering outside of his official salary; however, this did not stop many scholar-officials from managing business relations {{through the use of}} intermediary agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{new school}} of hip hop was a {{movement}} in hip hop music starting 1983–84 with the early records of Run–D.M.C. and LL Cool J. Like the hip hop preceding it, it came predominantly from New York City. The new school was initially characterized in form by drum machine led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock. It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as <b>in</b> <b>song</b> its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the funk and disco influenced outfits, novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of artists prevalent in 1984, and rendered them old school. New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts. By 1986 their releases began to establish the hip hop album as a fixture of the mainstream.|$|E

5|$|The quail is a {{small to}} medium-sized, cryptically {{coloured}} bird. In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long {{before the arrival of}} chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used <b>in</b> <b>song</b> contests.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} {{recognized}} subspecies across {{the range of}} these wrens and they differ slightly <b>in</b> <b>song</b> and appearance. The birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of time. When out in the open, they investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years. Both sexes give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, among other species. Some populations {{have been affected by}} mercury contamination.|$|E
