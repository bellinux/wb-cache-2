40|$|The <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> {{control system}} is greatly {{affected}} by the random road excitation during the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> adjusting of the driving condition. The structure of <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> adjusting system is first analyzed, and then the mathematical model of the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> adjusting system with the random disturbance is established as a stochastic nonlinear system. This system is decoupled using the differential geometry theory and stabilized using the Variable Structure Control (VSC) technique. The designed <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> control system converges in probability to be asymptotically stable in the sliding motion band, and the desired control law is solved to ensure the stable adjustment of the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> system. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed stochastic VSC method is effective for the dynamic adjusting of the <b>ride</b> <b>height.</b> Finally, the semiphysical rig test illustrates the applicability of the proposed scheme...|$|R
40|$|In general, tire {{deformations}} {{caused by}} wheel rotation are not {{taken into account}} when developing vehicle aerodynamics. On the road the tires radially expand as speed increases, which affects the actual <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> of a vehicle. In turn this often increases the real aerodynamic drag compared to values obtained using CFD or a wind tunnel as the mass flow across the relatively rough underbody increases with ground clearance. In this study, on-road <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> were measured while running a vehicle {{in a straight line}} with fixed velocity whilst the aerodynamic lift of the vehicle was determined in a wind tunnel. Subsequently, the relationships between <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> and axle load were obtained by loading the vehicle at standstill with ballast. By comparing the <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> at high and very low velocities with expected vertical displacement caused purely by aerodynamic lift force as computed according to the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> - axle load equations, the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> change due to tire radial expansion was determined...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} the knowledge on aerodynamic wing - wheel interaction. Hereto an experimental and computational study has been performed, during which the wing <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> and the wing - wheel overlap and gap have been considered as the primary variables. The wheel drag for the combined configuration is generally lower at low <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> and higher at high <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> compared to the case without wing. This results primarily from changes in the flow separation {{over the top of}} the wheel - partly induced by the wing circulation - from the channel flow along the inside of the wheel and from the vortex interaction in the wheel wake. The wing downforce increases at low <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> due to the wheel presence, but reduces at high <b>ride</b> <b>heights.</b> The modified channeling effect, vortex and separation effects govern the wing flow field, although the wheel circulation acts as an additional mechanism for downforce enhancement and limitation. The wing - wheel interaction has been studied extensively for a baseline configuration, using forces, on-surfaces pressures for the wing and wheel, oil flow and PIV data. A reduced set of data has been obtained for alternative overlap and gap settings. An increase in overlap generally leads to a reduction in wheel drag and wing downforce. A larger gap setting has relatively little influence on the wheel drag at low <b>ride</b> <b>heights,</b> but shifts the higher <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> part of the curve to lower values. The wing downforce is generally slightly lower when the gap increases. An analogy between the wing - wheel configuration and a multi-element airfoil has been used to partly explain the aerodynamic interaction between the components, based on the cross flow along the flap trailing edge. The application of a steady RANS computational approach with Spalart Allmaras turbulence model has been assessed for a baseline configuration over a range of <b>ride</b> <b>heights.</b> Qualitatively, the flow field is predicted fairly accurately, but the flow quantities correlate less satisfactory with the experiments. The downstream interaction in underpredicted, resulting in lower values for the wheel drag, in particular at high <b>ride</b> <b>heights.</b> The use of non-conformal zones around the wing is one of the causes for this discrepancy.

50|$|A third dispute came {{less than}} a week later, as the teams {{prepared}} to race in Hungary. Red Bull were accused of having illegally made changes to the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> of their car while under parc fermé conditions at the Canadian Grand Prix after the FIA asked them to make changes to the RB8. The technical regulations at the time dictated that any adjustments to the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> of the car must be made {{with the use of a}} tool, but the FIA had requested that the team change a part of the car that would enable them to change the front <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> by hand. Team principal Christian Horner admitted that the team had been asked to change the offending part, but denied that the team had illegally changed the front <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> of their cars after qualifying for the race.|$|R

40|$|Downbody {{pressures}} {{below that}} which would occur {{on a flat}} bottomed model, the underbody flow rate increases {{and the result is}} a greater down-force. Cooper et al. @ 4 # found that for any one dif-fuser angle, the down-force exerted on the model increased as the model was lowered from a freestream <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> to near the ground until a maximum was reached. Below this <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> down-force reduced sharply. They surmised that at this critical height the sum of the boundary layer thickness under the body and over the ground became a substantial fraction of the <b>ride</b> <b>height.</b> They also documented a difference in the down-force curves be-tween smaller and larger diffuser angles below a certain <b>ride</b> <b>height,</b> the latter showed a reversal in the consistent trend in down-force seen in all the curves above this <b>ride</b> <b>height.</b> George @ 1 # observed a leeside vortex pair on the upsweep surface of a diffuser which appeared to keep the flow attached to the surface and thus maintain down-force.

50|$|Air suspension, as standard, {{gives the}} driver {{the option of}} three <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> {{settings}} including a standard <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> of 172 mm, an off-road height of 227 mm and a lowered access mode. There is also an extra height available which is accessed by holding the respective button for when the off-road <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> is not enough. When the vehicle bellies out, its control system will sense weight being lessened on the air springs and the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> is automatically raised to the suspensions greatest articulation. The cross-link aspect of the suspension system, which debuted on the L322 Range Rover in 2002, results in better off-road performance by electronically operating valves in pneumatic lines which link adjacent air springs.

A number of <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> were studied covering various force regions. Surface pressures, sectional forces, and wake characteristics were compared to experimental data.
