25|$|Wootz steel {{which is}} also known as Damascus steel was a unique and highly prized steel {{developed}} on the Indian subcontinent as early as the 5th century BC. Its properties were unique due to the special smelting and reworking of the steel creating networks of iron carbides described as a <b>globular</b> <b>cementite</b> in a matrix of pearlite. The use of Damascus steel in swords became extremely popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|E

Using {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} methods the layer by layer analysis of the bulk hardened superior quality rails is carried out and the quantitative parameters of structure, phase state and defect substructure gradients are established.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the magnetic easy axes of micro- and nanoscopic ferromagnetic precipitates embedded in a bulk material is proposed and applied to <b>globular</b> <b>cementite</b> (Fe 3 C) embedded in a ferrite matrix. The method combines magnetic force microscopy (MFM) with electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) measurements. Magnetic domain structures in globular and in lamellar cementite precipitates in unalloyed pearlitic steels were imaged using MFM. The domain structure of the precipitates was analyzed in dependency of their size, shape and crystallographic orientation. It {{was found that the}} magnetic moments of the cementite precipitates are highly geared to their crystalline axes. The combined MFM and EBSD studies allow the conclusion that the cementite easy direction of magnetization is the long [010] axis. For fine lamellae cementite the determination of their crystallographic orientations using electron diffraction techniques is very difficult. With the previous knowledge of the behavior of the domain structure in <b>globular</b> <b>cementite,</b> the crystalline orientations of the fine lamellae cementite can be estimated by simply observing the magnetic microstructures and the topographic profiles...|$|E

The results obtained are discussed, based on a theoretical model describing {{the change in the}} RSII with the type of <b>cementite</b> (<b>globular</b> and lamellar) and temperature...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a solidification sequence of graphite eutectic cells of A and D types, {{as well as}} <b>globular</b> and <b>cementite</b> eutectics. The morphology of eutectic cells in cast iron, the equations for their growth and the distances between the graphite precipitations in A and D eutectic types were analyzed. It is observed a critical eutectic growth rate at which one type of eutectic transformed into another. A mathematical formula was derived that combined the maximum degree of undercooling, the cooling rate of cast iron, eutectic cell count and the eutectic growth rate. One type of eutectic structure turned smoothly into the other at a particular transition rate, transformation temperature and transformational eutectic cell count. Inoculation of cast iron {{increased the number of}} eutectic cells with flake graphite and the graphite nodule count in ductile iron, while reducing the undercooling. An increase in intensity of inoculation caused a smooth transition from a cementite eutectic structure to a mixture of cementite and D type eutectic structure, then to a mixture of D and A types of eutectics up to the presence of only the A type of eutectic structure. Moreover, the mechanism of inoculation of cast iron was studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and content}} of a cementite phase controls the macroscopic, mechanical and magnetic properties of steels. The influence of the cementite content on the bulk magnetic properties in unalloyed steels was observed in hysteresis loop and Barkhausen noise signals. <b>Globular</b> <b>cementite</b> embedded in a ferrite matrix is characterized by atomic force microscopy and magnetic force microscopy. Size, shape and orientation of the grains influence the domain configuration. When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetization process occurs mainly in the ferrite matrix. The Bloch walls in the ferrite matrix move, and they are pinned by the cementite precipitates. This microscopic observation correlates with the macroscopic magnetic properties of the investigated material...|$|E
40|$|Mirrored carbon-spirals {{have been}} {{produced}} from pressured ferrocene via the bilateral extrusion of the spiral pairs from an iron core. A parametric plot of the surface geometry displays the fractal growth of the conical helix made with the logarithmic spiral. Electron microscopy studies show the core is a crystalline cementite which grows and transforms its shape from spherical to biconical as it extrudes two spiralling carbon arms. In a cross section along the arms we observe graphitic flakes arranged in a herringbone structure, normal to which defects propagate. Local-wave-pattern analysis reveals nanoscale defect patterns of two-fold symmetry around the core. The {{data suggest that the}} bilateral growth originates from a <b>globular</b> <b>cementite</b> crystal with molten surfaces and the nano-defects shape emerging hexagonal carbon into a fractal structure. Understanding and knowledge obtained provide a basis for the controlled production of advanced carbon materials with designed geometries...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of a cementite phase influences significantly the macroscopic mechanical and magnetic properties of steels. Based on a correlation between mechanical and magnetic properties, mechanical properties {{as well as the}} morphology and content of the cementite phase can be inspected by electromagnetic non-destructive testing methods. The influence of the carbon content on bulk magnetic properties of unalloyed steels is studied on a macroscopic scale by hysteresis loop and Barkhausen noise measurements. The micro- and nanostructure is investigated by atomic force microscopy and magnetic force microscopy. Surface topography images and magnetic images of <b>globular</b> <b>cementite</b> precipitates embedded in a ferrite matrix are presented. The size, shape, and orientation of the precipitates influence the domain configuration. Applied external magnetic fields cause magnetization processes mainly in the ferrite matrix: Bloch walls move and are pinned by the cementite precipitates. The correlation between the microscopic observations and macroscopic magnetic properties of the material is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Using {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} methods the layer by layer analysis of the bulk hardened superior quality rails is carried out and the quantitative parameters of structure, phase state and defect substructure gradients are established. The gradient character of changing of structure-phase states and dislocation substructure along the cross section of rail head is revealed. The oil bulk hardening of superior quality rails is accompanied by the formation of morphologically different structure, being produced according to the shear and diffusion of γ-α transformation. The base structure volume is formed by the diffusion mechanism and is consisted of plate pearlite grains, free ferrite grains and grains of ferrite-carbide mixture. The presence of the bend extinction contours testifying to curvature-torsion of crystal lattice is revealed on electron microscope images. The analysis of far acting internal field stresses created by interfaces of cementite plates of pearlite grains and interfaces of pearlite and ferrite grains is carried out. It is shown that the interface boundaries <b>globular</b> <b>cementite</b> particles-matrix are the possible places of microcracks initiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the carbon content in form of <b>globular</b> <b>cementite</b> precipitates in unalloyed steels was macroscopically characterized by means of magnetic hysteresis loop and Barkhausen noise techniques. The choice of {{the frequency of the}} applied field has a strong influence on the Barkhausen noise profiles. At sufficiently high frequency (0. 5 Hz) there are two peaks, one at lower field, the amplitude of which corresponds to the amount of ferrite and one at higher field, the amplitude of which corresponds to the amount of the cementite phase, respectively. Magnetic force microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction techniques were used to determine the magnetic and crystallographic microstructures of the steels. Cementite has its own domain structure and stray fields which influence the magnetization process of the steel by its own magnetic contribution. When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetization process in ferrite occurs mainly at lower fields through the 180 ° and 90 ° domain walls. A higher field is required for the observation of 180 ° domain wall movements in cementite...|$|E
40|$|Medium {{carbon steels}} are mostly used for simple {{applications}}; however, new applications {{have been developed}} for which good sheet metal formability is required. These types of steels have an inherent low formability. A medium-carbon hot-rolled SAE 1050 steel was selected for this study. It has been cold rolled with thickness reductions varying between 7 and 80 %. The samples obtained were used to evaluate the strain hardening curve. For samples with a 50 and 80 % thickness reduction, an annealing heat treatment was performed to achieve recrystallization. The material was characterized in the ""as-received"", cold rolled and annealed conditions using several methods: optical metallography, X-ray diffraction (texture), Vickers hardness, and tensile testing. For large thickness reductions, the SAE 1050 steel presented low elongation, less than 2 %, and yield strength (YS) and tensile strength (TS) around 1400 MPa. Texture in the ""as-received"" condition showed strong components on the { 001 } plane, in the, and (110) directions. After cold rolling, the texture did not present any significant changes for small thickness reductions, however. It changed completely for large ones, where gamma, //ND, alpha, HRD, and gamma prime, //ND, fibres were strengthened. After annealing, the microstructure of the SAE 1050 steel was characterized by recrystallized ferrite and <b>globular</b> <b>cementite.</b> There was little change in the alpha fibre for the 50 % reduction, whereas for the 80 % reduction, its intensity increased. Both gamma and gamma prime fibres vanished upon annealing for 50 and 80 % reductions alike. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. CNPq (Brazil) [308839 / 2005 - 6...|$|E
