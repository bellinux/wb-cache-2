500|$|After {{the end of}} the Falklands War in 1982, the Vulcan B.2 was due to be {{withdrawn}} from RAF service that year. However, the Falklands campaign had consumed much of the airframe fatigue life of the RAF's Victor tankers. While Vickers VC10 tanker conversions had been ordered in 1979 and Lockheed TriStar tankers would be ordered subsequent to the conflict, as a stopgap measure six Vulcans were converted into single point tankers. The Vulcan tanker conversion was accomplished by removing the jammers from the ECM bay in the tail of the aircraft, and replacing them with a single Hose <b>Drum</b> <b>Unit</b> (HDU). [...] An additional cylindrical bomb-bay tank was fitted, making a total of three, giving a fuel capacity of almost [...]|$|E

2500|$|The probe-and-drogue {{refueling}} method {{employs a}} flexible hose that trails from the tanker aircraft. [...] The drogue (or para-drogue), sometimes called a basket, is a fitting resembling a shuttlecock, attached at its narrow end (like the [...] "cork" [...] nose of a shuttlecock) with a valve to a flexible hose. [...] The drogue stabilizes the hose in flight {{and provides a}} funnel to aid insertion of the receiver aircraft probe into the hose. [...] The hose connects to a Hose <b>Drum</b> <b>Unit</b> (HDU). [...] When not in use, the hose/drogue is reeled completely into the HDU. The receiver has a probe, which is a rigid, protruding or pivoted retractable arm placed on the aircraft's nose or fuselage to make the connection. [...] Most modern versions of the probe are usually designed to be retractable, and are retracted when not in use, particularly on high speed aircraft.|$|E
