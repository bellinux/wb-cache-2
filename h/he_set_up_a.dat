5|$|In 627, Khosrow sent Shahrbaraz a letter, {{which said}} that he should send his army to Ctesiphon. Shahrbaraz, however, disobeyed, and moved to Asuristan, where <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> camp in Ardashir Khurrah. Khosrow then sent Farrukhzad to {{negotiate}} with him. However, Farrukhzad made a secret conspiracy against Khosrow and joined Shahrbaraz.|$|E

5|$|After {{ending his}} {{coaching}} career, Wurtenburg {{spent several years}} acting as a referee for Yale's football team. His final contribution to football was publishing a book about Yale football in the early 20th century. Around 1904, Wurtenburg began pursuing {{a career as a}} physician. <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> medical office near his house in New Haven, Connecticut, and became an ear, nose and throat specialist. Wurtenburg maintained his medical office until at least 1920. He died in 1957 at the age of 93, in New Haven.|$|E
5|$|An Oberst at 28, Mölders was {{appointed}} Inspector General of Fighters, a post responsible for deciding the ongoing tactical and operational {{doctrine of the}} Luftwaffes fighter strategies.

5|$|He {{arrived in}} Killarney, Manitoba, in 1903, {{where he worked}} as a farmhand during the harvest. When winter came, he found work as a {{lumberjack}} in Fort William, Ontario. A voyage west followed, and <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> homestead in east-central Alberta. Once there, he began to practice dentistry, drawing on his army experience. On 9 September 1919, he married Marion Stuart. They had three sons and two daughters.|$|E
50|$|Giuseppe Penone {{was invited}} to the Venice Biennale in 2007 where <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> {{installation}} for the new opening of the Padiglione Italiano.|$|R
50|$|In February 1987, he {{emigrated to}} Perth, Western Australia where <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> {{industrial}} cleaning business {{as well as}} coaching in local football.|$|R

5|$|<b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{defensive}} alliance against the Mongols, which included Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Halych, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow and other Ruthenian and Polish princes. His allies supported him in occupying the Duchy of Styria in 1254, {{but it was}} lost to King Ottokar II of Bohemia six years later. During Béla's reign, a wide buffer zonewhich included Bosnia, Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) and other newly conquered regionswas established along the southern frontier of Hungary in the 1250s.|$|E
5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open one of his own. He {{became one of the most}} {{respected}} photographers of his day, with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family as customers in the early 1860s. He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) and Berlin (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> photographic firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E
5|$|Opinion of the Rivadavia {{government}} was {{divided between the}} two ideologies. For Unitarians like Sarmiento, Rivadavia's presidency was a positive experience. <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> European-staffed university and supported a public education program for rural male children. He also supported theater and opera groups, publishing houses and a museum. These contributions were considered as civilizing influences by the Unitarians, but they upset the Federalist constituency. Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the gauchos were arrested by Rivadavia for vagrancy and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> Ilim Pulp's {{representative}} office of in Beijing, China, {{where he was}} in charge of sales, marketing and development of new products.|$|R

5|$|Pirlo {{was named}} to Italy's 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup, and {{appeared}} in all of Italy's matches at the tournament, playing 668 minutes in total. In Italy's first match of the tournament on 12 June, Pirlo scored the opening goal against Ghana, and subsequently helped set up a goal for Vincenzo Iaquinta to seal a 2–0 victory, as the midfielder was named Man of the Match. In the second match on 17 June, <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> diving header for Alberto Gilardino from a set piece which proved to be vital in the 1–1 draw against the United States.|$|E
5|$|While {{teaching}} at Holmewood <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> 12½ inch reflector telescope at his home, which he kept into his old age. He developed a {{particular interest in}} {{the far side of}} the Moon, a small part of which is visible from Earth as a result of the Moon's libration; the Moon was his specialist subject throughout his life. He claimed to have discovered and named the Mare Orientale (Eastern Sea) in 1946, along with Hugh Percy Wilkins, though he later conceded that German astronomer Julius Heinrich Franz should be credited with the discovery. The feature had been observed several times since telescopic observations began. Moore described the short-lived glowing areas on the lunar surface, and gave them the name transient lunar phenomena in 1968.|$|E
5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E

50|$|Baltens' son Dominicus {{moved to}} Germany where he married {{the widow of}} Bartholomäus Kilian. <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> {{engraving}} workshop in Augsburg, which {{was known as the}} Kilian family of engravers.|$|R
5|$|Borsa's {{successor}} Ladislaus Kán went {{even further}} by usurping royal prerogative during his voivodeship between 1294 and 1315. He arbitrarily assumed {{the titles of}} count of Bistritz, Hermannstadt and the Székelys to expand his authority over Saxon and Székely communities exempted from voivodal authority. <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> tax-collecting body, seemingly covering the entire province. He captured Otto of Bavaria, a claimant to the Hungarian throne and seized the Holy Crown of Hungary from {{him in the first}} half of 1307. He handed the royal diadem to King Charles I in 1310, but continued to rule Transylvania de facto independently until his death in 1315. His son of the same name declared himself voivode, a title even used by the monarch when referring to him in a charter of August 12, 1315. Dózsa Debreceni, the voivode King Charles I appointed in 1318, defeated some rebellious minor lords, but royal authority in Transylvania was only restored by Thomas Szécsényi in the 1320s.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the battle}} at Winterthur made {{possible}} the victory at Zürich. Once the Austrian armies united west, north and east of Zürich, Charles decided he had a sufficiently superior force to attack Masséna's positions in Zürich. His strategy, to develop a converging attack, was not entirely possible without another Austria corps, which was commanded by Suvorov, and positioned in the mountains in Italy; this would have {{made possible the}} near encirclement of Masséna's command at Zürich, making the French position untenable. Even so, at the First Battle of Zürich (4–7 June 1799), the Austrian army forced the French to abandon Zürich; Masséna withdrew across the Limmat, where <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> defensive position on the low-lying hills overlooking the city and awaited his opportunity to reacquire the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1541 the Congregation elected Vermigli to the {{important}} post of prior of Basilica of San Frediano in Lucca. The prior at San Frediano exercised some episcopal authority {{over half the}} city, as well as control of the Lateran's religious houses. As at his earlier post in Spoleto, the monks of the San Frediano monastery {{as well as the}} clergy of Lucca were known for moral laxity, which led to an openness to the new Lutheran religion there. Vermigli saw his task as one of education as well as moral correction. <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> college based on humanist principles of education and modeled on the newly founded St John's College, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Instruction was in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Among the professors were the humanists Immanuel Tremellius, Paolo Lacizi, Celio Secondo Curione, and Girolamo Zanchi, all of whom would later convert to Protestantism. The Congregation recognized Vermigli's work by appointing him to a disciplinary commission of seven canons in May 1542.|$|E
50|$|When the Pacemakers {{split up}} in 1966, {{he bought a}} garage with fellow former Pacemaker, Les Maguire. In 1973, Chadwick moved to Sydney, Australia, where <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> {{employment}} agency.|$|R

5|$|In 1841, a new Master of the Mint, William Ewart Gladstone was appointed. Gladstone thought {{highly of}} Pistrucci and corresponded {{with him in}} Italian, but was unwilling to grant him any new {{commissions}} while the Waterloo Medal remained outstanding. By 1844, the continued expense of Pistrucci was a concern to the Audit Office. Gladstone restored cuts in Pistrucci's pay {{that had been made}} for failure to train an apprentice, and offered him a bonus of £400 to complete the medal. Pistrucci was to work solely on the one project. He vacated his home at the Royal Mint, moving to Old Windsor, where <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> workshop to attempt the medal's completion. Although Pistrucci worked constantly on the medal during some periods, he was slowed by a fall in his cottage, which incapacitated him for much of 1846. On 1 January 1849, Pistrucci submitted the matrices of the medal to the Royal Mint, and was paid £1,500.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1876 Jenny Morris was {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy. Refusing {{to allow her to}} be societally marginalised or institutionalised, as was common in the period, Morris insisted that she be cared for by the family. When Janey took May and Jenny to Oneglia in Italy, the latter suffered a serious seizure, with Morris rushing to the country to see her. They then proceeded to visit a number of other cities, including Venice, Padua, and Verona, with Morris attaining a greater appreciation of the country than he had on his previous trip. In April 1879 Morris moved the family home again, this time renting an 18th-century mansion on Hammersmith's Upper Mall in West London. Owned by the novelist George MacDonald, Morris would name it Kelmscott House and re-decorate it according to his own taste. In the House's grounds <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> workshop, focusing on the production of hand-knotted carpets. Excited that both of his homes were along the course of the River Thames, in August 1880 he and his family took a boat trip along the river from Kelmscott House to Kelmscott Manor.|$|E
5|$|Josef Mengele was {{a medical}} officer {{assigned}} to Auschwitz concentration camp from 1943 {{until the end}} of the war. As well as making most of the selections of inmates as they arrived by train from all over Europe, he performed unscientific and usually deadly experiments on the inmates. He left the camp in January 1945 as the Red Army approached and was briefly in American custody in Weiden in der Oberpfalz, but was released. He took work as a farm hand in rural Germany, remaining until 1949, when he decided to flee the country; he acquired a Red Cross passport and left for Argentina; <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> business in Buenos Aires in 1951. Acting on information received from Wiesenthal, West German authorities tried to extradite Mengele in 1960, but he could not be found; he had in fact moved to Paraguay in 1958. He moved to Brazil in 1961 and lived there until his death in 1979.|$|E
50|$|Ewing Kauffman {{established}} the Kansas City Royals, bringing {{major league baseball}} back to Kansas City. Shortly before Kauffman's death, <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> unprecedented complex succession plan to keep the team in Kansas City.|$|R
50|$|Pursuing his {{scientific}} interest, Webb sought {{to increase the}} propaganda role in the US-USSR conflict. <b>He</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> alliance with university scientists called Project Troy to study radio propagation behind the iron curtain.|$|R
