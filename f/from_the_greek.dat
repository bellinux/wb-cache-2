5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker originally {{described the}} tasselled wobbegong in an 1867 volume of Archives Néerlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles. His account {{was based on}} two Indonesian specimens, one caught off Waigeo and the other off Aru. He gave it the name dasypogon, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> dasys ("hairy") and pogon ("beard"), and assigned it to the genus Crossorhinus (a synonym of Orectolobus). In 1908, Charles Tate Regan created the new genus Eucrossorhinus for this species, derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> eu ("good"), krossoi ("tassel") and rhinos ("nose"). Regan subsequently reconsidered the main trait he used to separate Eucrossorhinus (the spacing of {{the fourth and fifth}} gill slits) and synonymized it with Orectolobus. Later authors have placed the tasselled wobbegong either in its own genus or in Orectolobus. Other common names for this species are bearded wobbegong and Ogilby's wobbegong.|$|E
