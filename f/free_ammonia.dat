25|$|The {{position}} of the equilibrium in the carbamate formation/decomposition depends on {{the product of the}} partial pressures of the reactants. In the total recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure—by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a carbamate decomposer that operates under full system pressure and configured to provide maximum gas-liquid contact). This flushes out <b>free</b> <b>ammonia,</b> reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the total recycle process altogether.|$|E

2500|$|GluDHs are {{ubiquitous}} {{enzymes that}} occupy an important branch-point between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Both {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD) EC 1.4.1.2] and {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADP) dependent GluDH [...] enzymes are present in Plasmodia; the NAD-dependent GluDH is relatively unstable and not useful for diagnostic purposes. Glutamate dehydrogenase provides an oxidizable carbon source used for the production of energy as well as a reduced electron carrier, NADH. Glutamate is a principal amino donor to other amino acids in subsequent transamination reactions. The multiple roles of glutamate in nitrogen balance make it a gateway between <b>free</b> <b>ammonia</b> and the amino groups of most amino acids. Its crystal structure is published. The GluDH activity in P.vivax, P.ovale and P. malariae has never been tested, but given the importance of GluDH as a branch point enzyme, every cell must have a high concentration of GluDH. It is well known that enzymes with a high molecular weight (like GluDH) have many isozymes, which allows strain differentiations (given the right monoclonal antibody).

40|$|Ammonia {{is formed}} in tubular cells from pre-cursors {{brought to the}} kidney in {{arterial}} blood (1 - 5). This ammonia diffuses passively as the free base into acid urine, where it is trapped as ammonium ion, and into peritubular capillaries, where it is rapidly removed into the general cir-culation (6 - 9). Under most circumstances, the concentration of ammonia in renal venous blood exceeds that in arterial blood. Thus ammonia has diffused from cells into peritubular blood as well as into urine. However, when ammonia is infused intravenously to elevate the arterial con-centration significantly, the gradient reverses; the concentration of ammonia in renal venous blood is less than that in arterial blood (10, 11). Thus ammonia has diffused from peritubular blood across tubular cells into urine. The fact that the diffusion of ammonia occurs from cells to renal venous blood under normal conditions and in the reverse direction when the arterial ammonia concentration is elevated implies that there must exist a blood concentration at which ammonia does not diffuse in either direction. The blood perfusing the kidney neither gains nor loses ammonia; the arterial and renal venous con-centrations are equal.

These new chemical bonds impart the structural rigidity necessary for a successful perm. The rigidification process is akin to the vulcanization of rubber, where commonly polysulfide linkages are used to crosslink the polymer chains.
