40|$|Background: Differences in body {{composition}} are extensively investigated {{in subjects with}} COPD as low muscle mass was independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Also cardio-vascular co-morbidity is often reported in COPD and the contribution of fat mass in COPD related co-morbidity is gaining interest. We hypothesized that the prevalence of low muscle mass and high fat mass is higher in subjects with COPD compared {{to a group of}} current and former smokers without COPD, which result in higher reported cardiovascular co-morbidity in the COPD group. Methods: In 954 subjects with COPD and 955 subjects without COPD, {{body composition}} was assessed by bio-electrical impedance analysis and information on self-reported co-morbidity was collected. Participants were stratified for low <b>fat</b> free mass <b>index</b> and high <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> (resp. <b>fat</b> free mass <b>index</b> 50 th percentile of the subjects without COPD). Results: Subjects with COPD {{were more likely to have}} low <b>fat</b> free mass <b>index</b> than current and former smokers without COPD. The prevalence of high <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> was comparable between the groups. The percentage of self-reported co-morbidity was higher in subjects with COPD, but only reports of myocardial infarction were disease specific. Conclusion: Low <b>fat</b> free mass <b>index</b> was more common in COPD, but the prevalence of high <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> was comparable between subjects with and without COPD. Nevertheless, subjects with COPD reported more myocardial infarction, implying that other factors than the amount of fat mass are involved in the increased co-morbidity in COPD...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{factors are}} {{important}} determinants of overweight. We examined {{whether there are}} differential effect sizes depending on children's body composition. We analysed data of n =  4, 837 children recorded in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), applying quantile regression with sex- and age-specific standard deviation scores (SDS) of body mass index (BMI) or with body <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> and fat-free mass index at 9 years as outcome variables and an "obesity-risk-allele score" based on eight genetic variants known {{to be associated with}} childhood BMI as the explanatory variable. The quantile regression coefficients increased with increasing child's BMI-SDS and <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> percentiles, indicating larger effects of the genetic factors at higher percentiles. While the associations with BMI-SDS were of similar size in medium and high BMI quantiles (40 th percentile and above), effect sizes with <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> increased over the whole <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> distribution. For example, the <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> of a normal-weight (50 th percentile) child was increased by 0. 13 kg/m(2) (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 09, 0. 16) per additional allele, compared to 0. 24 kg/m(2) per allele (95 % CI: 0. 15, 0. 32) in children at the 90 th percentile. The genetic associations with fat-free mass index were weaker and the quantile regression effects less pronounced than those on <b>fat</b> mass <b>index.</b> Genetic risk factors for childhood overweight appear to have greater effects on fatter children. Interaction of known genetic factors with environmental or unknown genetic factors might provide a potential explanation of these findings. ...|$|R

MATERIAL 36 patients with DM 2 (mean age 60. 11 ± 7. 29 yrs, mean BMI 31. 23 ± 4. 40 kg/m 2) were studied. The control group consisted of 30 healthy individuals correlative age (57. 36 ± 7. 35 yrs) and BMI (29. 91 ± 4. 00 Kg/m 2). METHODS Both D and C groups were fully examined by clinical and biochemical means and were administered 75 g of glucose for an OGTT. They were studied for (a) fat accumulation and distribution by a variety of conventional means, as well as by MRI application for abdomen and hip imaging with multiple sections, employing multiple indexes of visceral and subcutaneous fat, (b) basic blood levels of insulin, resistin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor, (c) changes of insulin, leptin and receptor levels during OGTT, (d) insulin resistance by the use of HOMA-IR and (e) insulin secretion, calculated as “area under the curve” (AUC) from OGTT. RESULTS Both D and C groups did not differ regarding all the <b>fat</b> <b>indexes,</b> with the exeption of BIA:%fat, found higher in diabetics (p= 0. 014). Strong positive correlations were found between the conventional and MRI <b>indexes</b> of <b>fat,</b> when reflected to the same variable (accumulation, distribution in visceral or subcutaneous fat), {{with the exception of the}} findings by skin-folder stand. The diabetics exhibited characteristically higher HOMA-IR, compared to controls (p< 0. 001). Among the various <b>fat</b> <b>indexes,</b> BMI exhibited the strongest correlation with HOMA-IR (r= 0. 507, p= 0. 002) in diabetics. In contrast to what was expected, strong correlations of HOMA-IR with some subcutaneous <b>fat</b> <b>indexes</b> were found. Insulin AUC was not correlated to any of the <b>fat</b> <b>indexes.</b> As expected, diabetics demonstrated higher levels of fasting glucose and insulin and higher HbA 1 c and significantly lower insulin AUC compared to controls. Basic levels of leptin and of leptin receptor were not different between D and C groups. By contrast, basic resistin levels were found significantly higher in diabetics (p= 0. 006). A strong negative correlation between leptin levels and leptin receptor levels was found. In the diabetic group, leptin levels were strongly correlated with a variety of <b>fat</b> <b>indexes,</b> including MRI and some indexes reflecting the subcutaneous fat. Similarly, resistin levels correlated with various indexes reflecting either subcutaneous or opisthoperitoneal fat in the control group. In contrast, negative correlation was noted to exist between leptin receptor levels and insulin AUC in diabetics. Finally, leptin to resistin levels ratio was found to correlate positively with HOMA-IR in diabetics. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the independent associations of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary (SED-time), with total and abdominal body fat (BF), and the bidirectionality of these associations in adults at high risk of type 2 diabetes. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We measured MVPA (min per day) and SED-time (h per day) by accelerometry, and indices of total (body weight, fat mass (FM), BF% and FM index) and abdominal BF (waist circumference (WC)) using standard procedures in 231 adults (41. 3 +/- 6. 4 years) with parental history of type 2 diabetes (ProActive UK) at baseline, 1 -year and 7 -year follow-up. Mixed effects models were used to quantify the independent associations (expressed as standardised beta-coefficients (95 % confidence interval (CI))) of MVPA and SED-time with <b>fat</b> <b>indices,</b> using data from all three time points. All models were adjusted for age, sex, intervention arm, monitor wear time, follow-up time, smoking status, socioeconomic status and MVPA/SED-time. RESULTS: MVPA was inversely and independently associated with all indices of total BF (for example, 1 s. d. higher MVPA was associated with a reduction in FM, beta = - 0. 09 (95 % CI: - 0. 14, - 0. 04) s. d.) and abdominal BF (for example, WC: beta = - 0. 07 (- 0. 12, - 0. 02)). Similarly, higher <b>fat</b> <b>indices</b> were independently associated with a reduction in MVPA (for example, WC: beta = - 0. 25 (- 0. 36, - 0. 15); FM: beta = - 0. 27 (- 0. 36, - 0. 18)). SED-time was positively and independently associated with most <b>fat</b> <b>indices</b> (for example, WC: beta = 0. 03 (- 0. 04, 0. 09); FM: beta = 0. 10 (0. 03, 0. 17)). Higher values of all <b>fat</b> <b>indices</b> independently predicted longer SED-time (for example, WC: beta = 0. 10 (0. 02, 0. 18), FM: beta = 0. 15 (0. 07, 0. 22)). CONCLUSIONS: The associations of MVPA and SED-time with total and abdominal BF are bidirectional and independent among individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The association between BF and MVPA is stronger than the reciprocal association, highlighting the importance of considering BF as a determinant of decreasing activity and a potential consequence. Promoting more MVPA and less SED-time may reduce total and abdominal BF...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare different indices for evaluating nutritional conditions of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in an alpine environment during the autumn in order to detect the most convenient ones for management purposes in our specific situation. Body conditions of 274 red deer were evaluated using kidney <b>fat</b> <b>index,</b> back <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> and body condition scores. Body Condition Scores was the easiest but the least reliable method. Both kidney <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> and back <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> were significantly affected by age and sex class (always lower in younger animals) and, in females, also by lactation status. In stags, a negative regression effect of culling date on both kidney <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> and back <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> was observed. A significant positive correlation between kidney <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> and back <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> was recorded.

Using direct estimates of body fat mass, we aimed to assess the association between C-section and adiposity using <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> and BMI z-score in three birth cohort studies from Pelotas, Brazil. Methods We measured weight, height and fat mass (using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)) at ages 6, 18 and 30  years among participants in the 2004, 1993 and 1982 population-based Pelotas Birth Cohort Studies, respectively. We used multiple linear regression analysis to examine the crude and adjusted association between C-section and the body composition indicators. We also modelled height as an outcome to explore the presence of residual confounding. Results We observed that <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> and BMI z-score were strongly and positively associated with C-section in the crude analysis. However, when we adjusted for socioeconomic characteristics, maternal BMI, parity, age and smoking during pregnancy, effect estimates were attenuated towards the null, except for 30 -year-old women. In those women from the 1982 cohort, C-section remained associated with <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> (β[*]=[*] 0. 82; CI 95 % 0. 32; 1. 32) and BMI z-score (β[*]=[*] 0. 15; CI 95 % 0. 03; 0. 28), even after adjusting for all potential confounders, suggesting an increase in <b>fat</b> mass <b>index</b> and BMI at 30  years among those born by C-section.

40|$|White-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii) {{populations in}} the Northern Plains {{have been in a}} general decline for the past decade or longer. A {{suggested}} reason for this population decline was reduced body condition of individual jackrabbits due to habitat changes.

We removed and weighed kidneys and all perirenal fat associated with the kidneys from collected jackrabbits.

Body condition was assessed by measuring the amount of kidney fat within each collected jackrabbit. Seasonal fluctuations were evident in average kidney weight and kidney fat for both sexes of white-tailed jackrabbits. The kidney <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> in both male and female peaked in winter and was near 0 % in summer.

The present study examines the hypothesis that reproduction in the pouched mouse is opportunistic (sensu Bronson 1989) and that the winter inhibition of reproduction is controlled by a reduction in either food quantity or quality. Food restriction (70 % of normal daily food intake) for six weeks, under short day conditions, was associated with a significant decrease in body <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> and mass of the accessory glands, testes and epididymides, while a high-fibre diet resulted in a significant reduction in <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> and masses of both the accessory glands and epididymides. A lowfibre/low-protein diet had no significant effect on either <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> or masses of the reproductive organs.   Although the three experimental diets resulted in assimilation of significantly less energy than the controls, they did not inhibit spermatogenesis. We conclude that reproduction in the pouched mouse in the Eastern Cape Province is probably opportunistic and that the  winter inhibition of reproduction may be controlled by a reduction in available energy which results from a combination of the lower ambient temperatures of winter and reduced food quantity and/or quality. </strong...|$|E
40|$|Background: Weight loss is {{recognised}} as {{a marker}} of poor prognosis in patients with cancer but the aetiology of cancer cachexia remains unclear. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the relationships between CT measured parameters of body composition and the systemic inflammatory response in patients with primary operable colorectal cancer. Patient and Methods: 174 patients with primary operable colorectal cancer who underwent resection with curative intent (2003 – 2010). Image analysis of CT scans was used to measure total <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> (cm 2 /m 2), subcutaneous <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> (cm 2 /m 2), visceral <b>fat</b> <b>index</b> (cm 2 /m 2) and skeletal muscle index (cm 2 /m 2). Systemic inflammatory response was measured by serum white cell count (WCC), neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS). Results: There were no relationships between any parameter of body composition and serum WCC or NLR. There was a significant relationship between low skeletal muscle index and an elevated systemic inflammatory response, as measured by the mGPS (p = 0. 001). This was confirmed by linear relationships between skeletal muscle index and both C-reactive protein (r = 20. 21, p = 0. 005) and albumin (r = 0. 31, p, 0. 001).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: 1) to follow changes in body composition during pregnancy using a non-invasive method; 2) to compare the results obtained with X-ray computerized tomography (CT) and with the slaughter method; and 3) to study the influence of litter size on changes in body reserves in pregnant does. Seventeen pregnant Pannon White rabbit does were examined by means of CT {{on the day of}} insemination, on days 14, 21 and 28 of pregnancy, and a few hours after parturition. At comparable time points, non-pregnant does (n = 26) were also scanned as a control group. During the CT procedure 27 images (scans) were taken from all of the animals in the body region from the scapular arch to the femoral-tibial articulation. The scans were processed by means of the computerized imaging technique, to obtain three-dimensional (3 D) histograms that represented the changes in the water content, and in the fat and muscle tissues of the does. On the day after parturition all the does were slaughtered and the fat content of their empty bodies was subjected to chemical analysis. In the first 14 days of pregnancy little change was detected in body composition. Thereafter, in the abdominal region a marked increase was noted in densities corresponding to water and water-rich tissues, in correspondence with the growth of uterine contents. From day 21 of pregnancy a decrease in fat was noted in the pregnant does and an increase in the same reserves in the non-pregnant control group. To compare the fat content of animals in different physiological states so-termed <b>fat</b> <b>indices</b> were created by relating pixels corresponding to fat densities to the total number of pixels. In the same way muscle indices were created to demonstrate the changes in the muscle reserves during the experimental period.

Masses and incidence of plastic in chicks were compared between birds found dead of "natural causes " and those injured by motor vehicles. Naturally killed Laysan Albatross chicks had significantly greater masses of plastic in their proventriculi and gizzards and had significantly lighter body masses and lower <b>fat</b> <b>indices</b> than injured but otherwise healthy chicks. Ingested plastic probably {{does not cause}} significant direct mortality in Laysan Albatross chicks, but likely causes physiological stress {{as a result of}} satiation and mechanical blockages...|$|R

Riders demonstrated reductions in body <b>fat</b> <b>index,</b> % body fat and endomorphy (p greater than. 05). Graded exercise, using a "Racermate" wind load simulator/racing cycle ergometer system, showed reduced cardiovascular demands to warm-up exercise, and increased cardiovascular index, VO 2 maximum, aerobic/anaerobic threshold shifts during maximal exercise (NS), with no changes in gearing, equivalent road speed, absolute/relative power output and leg power. Compared with "non-select" riders demonstrated lower body <b>fat</b> <b>index,</b> % body fat and endomorphy (p greater than. 05), higher Hb and PCV % (p greater than. 05) and elevated neuroticism and extraversion (p greater than. 05). Furthermore, "select" riders demonstrated lower HR and CV index during warm-up exercise (p greater than. 05), and elevated CV index, VO 2 maximum, aerobic/anerobic thresholds during maximal exercise (p greater than. 05), resulting from higher gearing, equivalent road speed and absolute/relative power output (p greater than. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Antlers of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) likely {{contribute}} to breeding success of males, defence of feeding sites by females, {{and recognition of}} the hierarchical status of conspecifics. However, few data are available on how antler mass is related to age, body mass, fat reserves, other physical indices, and reproduction. Mass of antlers was recorded for 958 caribou obtained in early and late winter, 1982 through 1987, from the Beverly herd of barren-ground caribou (R. t. groenlandicus) in north-central Canada. In females, antler mass increased with age to 14 years, whereas mean body mass was stable from 7 through 13 years. Female antler mass correlated with body mass, body size, <b>fat</b> <b>indices,</b> and pregnancy rate both among and within age classes. In males, antler mass correlated highly with lean body mass to age 4 years. Antler mass varied among years in concert with fatness in females and with changes in body mass in both sexes. We conclude that antler mass is an index of body mass, body size, condition, and pregnancy rate, but high variation makes it inferior to other indices.

40|$|The {{association}} between regional fat mass distribution and cardiometabolic risk factors has been inconsistent in the literature, and data for ethnic minority groups, such as non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, are lacking. We aimed {{to examine this}} association among 8802 US residents {{who participated in the}} 1999 - 2004 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Leg <b>fat</b> <b>indices</b> included leg <b>fat</b> mass (FM), leg fat mass percent (FM%), leg to whole body FM ratio (leg/whole) and leg to trunk FM ratio (leg/trunk). We evaluated the correlation between leg <b>fat</b> <b>indices</b> and adiposity-related risk factors, as well as the association of these indices with metabolic syndrome (MetS). After adjusting for covariates including age, gender, and trunk FM or trunk FM%, higher leg FM and leg FM % were, in general, correlated favorably with adiposity-related risk factors and associated with lower odds of MetS in all ethnicities, including non-Hispanic whites and blacks and Hispanic groups. In addition, in all multivariate-adjusted models, leg/whole and leg/trunk ratios were strongly associated with lower levels of most risk factors and decreased odds of MetS in these ethnicities (all odds ratios comparing extreme quintiles < 0. 1). Our results show that leg fat accumulation is inversely associated with adiposity-related biological factors and risk of MetS in both whites and ethnic groups, suggesting that regional fat distribution {{plays an important role in}} the etiology of adiposity-related diseases in these populations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose {{of review}} This review {{presents}} the latest clinical applications of bioelectrical impedance analysis. It discusses {{the evaluation of}} nutritional status by using fat-free mass and body fat, percentiles of fat-free mass and body fat, height-normalized fat-free mass and body <b>fat</b> mass <b>indices</b> and a resistance/ reactance vector graph. Recent findings Fat-free mass and body fat {{can be used to}} evaluate nutritional status by comparing individuals or groups of individuals with themselves or with reference values. Percentile distributions are also useful in determining whether individuals or groups fall within the population range. Percentile ranks {{can also be used to}} define nutritional depletion and obesity. The use of the fat-free mass and body <b>fat</b> mass <b>indices</b> has the advantage of compensating for differences in body height. The use of low, normal, high and very high fat-free mass and body <b>fat</b> mass <b>indices</b> ranges that correspond to underweight, normal, overweight and obese body mass index categories further aid in the nutritional assessment process. With vector bioelectrical impedance analysis, an individual impedance vector is compared with the 50, 75, and 95...|$|R
