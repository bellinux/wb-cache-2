25|$|However, {{for some}} sweet wines, a {{successful}} harvest requires manual work {{and training for}} pickers to pick only clusters where the berries have reached optimum ripeness or {{have been affected by}} noble rot (for the Sélection de Grains Nobles).

25|$|Removal of the spleen (splenectomy) is {{effective}} in reducing the severity of these complications, but is {{associated with an increased}} risk of overwhelming bacterial septicaemia, and is only performed on those with significant complications. Because many neonates with severe elliptocytosis progress to have only a mild disease, and because this age group is particularly susceptible to pneumococcal infections, a splenectomy is only performed on those under 5 years old when it <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crayfish {{often find}} {{themselves}} in a conflicting situation where they are performing the highly motivated behavior of feeding when they suddenly receive a tail flip stimulus. Often, the crayfish will not perform a tail flip in this situation. This is because when a crayfish is actively feeding, the LGI itself is modulated by the behavior. Feeding increases the threshold for the tail flip, and even when the tail is tapped, no spikes are initiated. As a result, it takes an especially strong stimulus to elicit the tail flip. This prevents the crayfish from going hungry unless it <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E
25|$|Steel is {{classified}} by Det Norske Veritas with a class notation of +1A1 ICE-1A+ Pusher and Pusher/Barge Unit E0. It {{has the highest}} Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, {{which means that the}} pusher is designed to operate in difficult ice conditions both alone and when coupled to a barge mainly without icebreaker assistance. While usually connected to a barge, Steel is also capable of operating independently. However, the low metacentric height of the pusher, only , results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the vessel very uncomfortable in severe weather. For this reason short transit journeys without a barge are done only when it <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite the name, {{necessity}} {{alone is}} an insufficient claim to create any easement. Parcels {{without access to}} a public way may have an easement of access over adjacent land if crossing that land <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>necessary</b> to reach the landlocked parcel {{and there has been}} some original intent to provide the lot with access, and the grant was never completed or recorded but is thought to exist. A court order is necessary to determine the existence of an easement by necessity. To obtain this generally the party who claims the easement files a lawsuit, and the judge weighs the relative damage caused by enforcing an easement against the servient estate against the damage to the dominant estate if the easement is found not to exist and is thus landlocked.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} chronic {{inflammation}} ensues, and functional CD4+ T cell levels begin to decrease, eventually {{to a point}} where the CD4+ T cell population is too small to recognize the full range of antigens that could potentially be detected. The depletion of CD4 T cells and the development of chronic inflammation are signature processes in HIV pathogenesis that propel progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). CD4 T cell depleted to the cell count of less than 200cell/μL in blood during AIDS allows various pathogens to escape T cell recognition, thus allowing opportunistic infections that would normally elicit a helper T cell response to bypass the immune system. While these complete bypass situations only occur when the helper T cell response <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>necessary</b> for infection clearance, most infections increase in severity and/or duration because the immune system's helper T cells provide less efficient immune response.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of the Allied invasion, the Germans had laid almost six million mines in Northern France.

In likely landing spots for gliders and parachutists, the Germans emplanted slanted poles with sharpened tops, which the troops called Rommelspargel ("Rommel's Asparagus"). Low-lying river and estuarine areas were intentionally flooded. Rommel believed that Germany would inevitably be defeated unless the invasion could be stopped on the beach, declaring, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>necessary</b> that we push the British and Americans back from the beaches.

Sam seems to have more of the heart of darkness about him than Dean does... I just sense that there's this ongoing watchful eye that Bobby's got on Sam." [...] Although he loves each of them [...] "like a son", Bobby is willing to allow the brothers to put themselves in harm's way if it <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>necessary.</b> For example, when Dean wants to detoxify Sam from his addiction to demon blood in [...] "When the Levee Breaks", Bobby instead points out that Sam giving in to his demonic abilities could help him to prevent Lucifer's return, even though the amount of blood required to kill Lilith would [...] "change [...] forever". Beaver noted, [...] "Bobby is old enough that he's fairly clear-headed about what the priorities ought to be.
