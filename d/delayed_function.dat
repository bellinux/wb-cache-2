In particular, the paper finds that (1) the linear <b>delay</b> <b>function,</b> the only proven FIFO-consistent <b>delay</b> <b>function,</b> substantially overestimates link travel time due to the so-called double-counting effect, (2) the piece-wise linear <b>delay</b> <b>function,</b> an improvement over the linear <b>delay</b> <b>function</b> in reducing double-counting, does not always respect FIFO (i. e., not FIFO-consistent), and (3) a class of smooth, convex <b>delay</b> <b>functions</b> bounded by the linear and piece-wise linear <b>delay</b> <b>functions</b> respects FIFO for certain inflow profiles but not for others. A condition is given to identify those inflow profiles that cause FIFO violations in the delay-function model with nonlinear <b>delay</b> <b>functions.</b> Finally, the paper also provides an accurate and stable solution algorithm for delay-function models. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{retrospective}} analysis was undertaken {{to examine the}} influence of calcium-channel blocking drugs on early renal allograft function. <b>Delayed</b> <b>function</b> was denned {{as the need for}} dialysis or a reduction in serum creatinine of less than 15 % within 4 days of transplantation. The drug histories of 172 patients were examined. After exclusions, the data from 138 patients were analysed. No patient was taking any calcium-channel blocking drug other than nifedipine. Thirty-one patients were taking nifedipine at the time of transplantation and these had a <b>delayed</b> <b>function</b> rate of 16 % compared with 40 % for 107 patients not taking nifedipine (x 2, />< 0. 05). <b>Delayed</b> <b>function</b> occurred in 61 % of cases when the donor age was over 50 years compared with 29 % with younger donors (x 2, P< 0. 05). A total ischaemic time of longer than 24 h and administration of inotropic support to the donor were associated with <b>delayed</b> <b>function</b> (x 2, P< 0. 05). Administration to the donor of mannitol, steroids, phenoxybenzamine and heparin had no effect on the rate of <b>delayed</b> <b>function.</b> Recipients treated with low-dose dopamine in the perioperative period had no advantage.

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{retrospective study}} was conducted to assess the risk factors of renal transplant graft failure focusing on the effects of gender of both the donor and the recipient. Methods: Medical records of primary renal transplantation performed in a single transplant hospital were reviewed. Cases of ABO incompatibility, positive cross-matches, or multiple organ transplants were excluded. A total of 766 patient records were reviewed, and variables were analyzed with Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox regression to determine the independent factors associated with graft survival. Results: The overall 5 -year graft and patient survival rates were 84. 7 % and 92. 2 %, respectively. Univariate analysis showed significantly poorer prognosis in male patients and in those with acute rejection, <b>delayed</b> <b>function,</b> or more mismatches in human lymphocyte antigens. Multivariate analysis with step-wise regression identified three independent prognostic factors for poor graft survival (male gender, acute rejection, and <b>delayed</b> <b>function).</b> The 5 -year graft survival rates for female and male patients were 87. 9 % and 81. 3 %, respectively. The risk ratio of graft failure for male renal transplant recipients was 1. 3732, when compared with that for female patients. The risk ratios for those with acute rejection and <b>delayed</b> <b>function</b> were 1. 8330 and 1. 5422, respectively.

40|$|Objectives: To analyze {{surgical}} complications in kidney transplantation {{and their}} influence on graft survival. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis {{was made of the}} early and late surgical complications occurring in 216 consecutive kidney transplants performed at our institution and {{their influence on}} graf tsurvival. Results: At least one surgical complication occurred in 82 (38 %) of the 216 transplantations, and 68 (31 %) required some type of repeat surgery, 23 in the early post operative period and 45 more than 3 months after surgery. Mean follow–up was 48 months(SD þ/ 33. 4), and median follow–up 48 months(range, 0 – 166 months). No recipient or donor factor spredisposing to surgical complications were found. Graft survival was significantly shorter in patients with surgical complications [3 -and 5 -year survival rates of 86 %(95 %CI 83 %– 89 %) and 78 %(95 %CI 73 %– 82 %) as compared to 92 % (95 %CI 90 %– 94 %) and 88 %(95 %CI 85 %– 91 %),p: 0. 004]. Early repeat surgery, venous thrombosis, and wound infection were among the complications having an independent influence on graft survival. A multivariate analysis of graft survival in the whole groups howed early repeat surgery to bea factor with an independent prognostic value (OR: 4. 7; 95 %CI 2. 2 – 10,po 0. 0001). <b>Delayed</b> <b>function</b> and donor age older than 60 years were the other independent influential factors.

30|$|Until recently, current {{literature}} on complications of the tension-band plate had focused on re-operation following rebound growth and plate breakage {{in the setting}} of Blount’s disease [7, 9, 10]. In a recent case series, Fillingham et al. highlighted a more common complication—delayed return of function—in 37  % of patients at 2 weeks after the use of the tension-band plate [11]. The study defined a delay in return of function as continued use of crutches, diminished range of motion (ROM), or persistent pain. Patients 11  years of age and older, patients with four or more plates, or patients with femoral plates were most at risk of <b>delayed</b> <b>function.</b> As a result of the study by Fillingham et al., our clinical practice changed to routinely include immediate post-operative physical therapy (PT) with the anticipation of preventing symptoms of delayed return of function [11].|$|E
30|$|We {{believe the}} {{approach}} to the distal femur causes femoral plates to be more associated with functional pain, use of crutches, or impaired range of motion. Dissection of the distal femur for placement of the plates involves the iliotibial band or vastus medialis, which are both {{actively involved in the}} biomechanics of the knee. In addition, accurate insertion of a plate on the lateral aspect of the distal femur commonly requires violation of the joint capsule. Iatrogenic injury to any of these structures, and particularly the joint capsule, would contribute to the symptoms of post-operative delay in return of function. As for the etiology of the <b>delayed</b> <b>function</b> {{with the use of a}} greater number of plates and bilateral operations, it is intuitive that both will lead to more soft tissue manipulation, causing increased post-operative pain and range of motion impairment.|$|E

In the presented study, five of 19 and six of 19 patients who underwent PT in the immediate postoperative period underwent placement of four or more plates and bilateral operations, respectively, with five subjects meeting both of these criteria. Following the use of immediate postoperative PT, however, none of these patients experienced a delay in return of function secondary to pain, reliance on crutches, or reduced ROM, attesting to the benefit of PT even after a more intensive operative intervention.|$|E

40|$|Popular {{features}} for speech processing, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), {{are derived from}} the short-term magnitude spectrum, whereas the phase spectrum remains unused. While the common argument to use only the magnitude spectrum is that the human ear is phase-deaf, phase-based features have remained less explored due to additional signal processing difficulties they introduce. A useful representation of the phase is the group <b>delay</b> <b>function,</b> but its robust computation remains difficult. This paper advocates the use of group <b>delay</b> <b>functions</b> derived from parametric all-pole models instead of their direct computation from the discrete Fourier transform.
