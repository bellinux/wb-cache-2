Meanwhile, co-bartender Coach (Nicholas Colasanto) is offered a coaching job in Venezuela requiring fluency in Spanish. Derek (an unseen character voiced by George Ball) arrives unexpectedly {{at the bar and}} entertains the patrons with his talents, which include singing, playing a pool table, tap dancing and telling stories.

5|$|Because of the Pandavas' ruined {{financial}} state, Balarama's wife, Revati, {{refuses to}} honour {{her commitment to}} marry Sasirekha and Abhimanyu and expresses her support for the alliance with the Kauravas. Krishna, who is aware of Duryodhana and Shakuni's real intentions, orders his charioteer Daaruka to take Subhadra and Abhimanyu through the forests to Ghatotkacha hermitage. Ghatotkacha, {{who happens to be}} Abhimanyu's brother, at first thinks they are intruders in his forest and attacks them but later apologises for the misunderstanding. When Subhadra explains the change in the marriage arrangements, Ghatotkacha decides to wage war against both the Kauravas and Balarama. At the urging of his mother, Hidimbi, and Subhadra, Ghatotkacha abandons his plans and is advised instead to try some trickery in Dvaraka. With the knowledge of Krishna and Sasirekha's servant, <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> the sleeping Sasirekha in her bed from Dvaraka, and flies to his hermitage. Assuming Sasirekha's form, he returns to Dvaraka and, {{with the help of his}} assistants Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, wreaks havoc on her wedding to Lakshmana Kumara, preventing the marriage from being carried out.|$|E

5000|$|Sudama was Lord Krishna's classmate {{and a very}} {{intimate}} friend. Lord Krishna was a King. Sudama was an impoverished poor Brahmin. This difference did not come {{in the way of}} their true friendship. Sudama went to Dwarka to meet Krishna. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> a very humble gift to be presented to Lord Krishna. What did <b>he</b> <b>carry?</b> Some books say <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> pohe (beaten rice), while some books and movies say <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> sattu powder (peeth). This confusing difference is because Sudama carried neither sattu nor pohe. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> with him a combination of sattu and pohe called [...] "sattu-peeth pohe". It is an exclusive prominence of Samvadi Lad Brahmins to which Sudama belonged. That Sudama was a Samvadi Lad Brahmin is more or less widely accepted; whether his home town was Bhurgakacha (Bhadoch) or Porbandar is a point on which a minor difference of opinion exist.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>carried</b> a sword named Pr√©cieuse.|$|R
5|$|Optimus {{is given}} the task of {{removing}} the Dark Energon from Cybertron's core by the council. Optimus and his old friend Ironhide, along with rookie Autobot soldier Warpath first attempt to rescue Omega Supreme from the Decepticons, who is being tortured by Dark Energon. They call in Ratchet who heals Omega Supreme. The Autobots free Omega Supreme and gain access to Cybertron's core. Struggling against a mysterious corrupted worm and countless Decepticons, Optimus then speaks with Cybertron's core, which informs him {{that it has been}} heavily damaged by the Dark Energon. It states that it can repair itself by shutting down, but the process will take millions of years during which Cybertron will become cold, barren, and lifeless. The core then tells Optimus that if <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> a small piece of the core with him, the core can still survive during the repairs. Optimus accepts the burden and the core relinquishes the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.|$|E
5|$|Stela 31 is the {{accession}} monument of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II, also bearing two {{portraits of}} his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin, {{as a youth}} dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> a spearthrower {{in one hand and}} bears a shield decorated with the face of Tlaloc, the Teotihuacan war god. In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and ritually buried. Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal. A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic, which describes the arrival of Siyah K'ak' at El Peru and Tikal in January 378. It was also the first stela at Tikal to be carved on all four faces.|$|E
5|$|Summer invites Ryan {{to a party}} {{after the}} show, and Ryan convinces Seth to join him. For the first time, Seth is {{introduced}} to the sex-, drug-, and alcohol-fueled side of Newport. He experiences the wildness of a party for the first time, while Ryan flirts with Marissa. Luke takes a girl to the beach. Later at the party, Ryan rebuffs an intoxicated Summer, but Seth misinterprets the encounter and reveals Ryan's real background. Seth walks down the beach, and is bullied {{by a group of}} water polo players that includes Luke. Ryan defends Seth by punching Luke, but Luke's friends intervene and beat up Ryan and Seth. After returning to the Cohens, Ryan sees that Marissa's friends left her passed out on her drive; <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> her to the Cohens' pool house to sleep. When Kirsten finds Seth and Ryan asleep in the pool house the next morning, she is unhappy with Ryan's new influence and insists to Sandy that Ryan leaves. Sandy drives Ryan back to Chino, but when they find his home empty, they return to Newport.|$|E
50|$|In 1891 <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> out {{the first}} {{experiment}} providing evidence of the size-weight illusion. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> out a various number of procedures comparing what people thought was the heaviness of lifted weights. He realized that lifters thought that larger objects were lighter than smaller objects of the same mass.|$|R

5000|$|Ricardo [...] "Rico" [...] Tubbs {{was armed}} with a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun in the first season. In Season 2, he used an Ithaca 37 sawed-off pump shotgun called an Ithaca Stakeout, which <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> on a halter under his jacket. Beginning in Season 3 (and for the {{remainder}} of the show), <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> a modified, short-barreled Remington 870. As a backup, <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> a Smith & Wesson Model 38 Bodyguard with Pachmayr grips. He can also be seen using a SIG P228 in the series finale 'Freefall' and a Smith & Wesson Model 36 in the pilot episode.|$|R
5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
5|$|The husband, whose stained hands reveal he is a dyer by trade, looks harried as <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> his {{exhausted}} youngest daughter. In earlier impressions (and the painting), {{his hands}} are blue, to show his occupation, while his wife's face is coloured with red ink. The placement of the cow's horns behind his head represents him as a cuckold and suggests the children are not his. Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane protrudes between the son's legs, doubling as a hobby horse, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his gingerbread. A limited number of proofs missing the girl and artist's signature were printed; Hogarth added the mocking girl to explain the boy's tears.|$|E
5|$|Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) is Joel's brother. At {{the initial}} outbreak, he picked Joel and Sarah {{up in his}} car {{to take them to}} safety. When the car is hit by a truck, he defends Joel as <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> Sarah, whose leg is badly hurt. After Sarah's death, Joel and Tommy {{initially}} survive together, but differing outlooks and Joel's hardened ways led to their estrangement, and Tommy left to join the Fireflies. After becoming disillusioned, he subsequently left them as well, and built a settlement around a working power plant in Wyoming with his wife, Maria. Many years later, Joel arrives at Tommy's settlement, and the brothers are reunited. Tommy initially refuses to take Ellie off Joel's hands, but upon seeing their close bond and realizing that Joel doesn't trust himself to protect Ellie, he agrees to take her to Marlene himself. However, Ellie confronts Joel about Sarah and, after having a change of heart, Joel and Ellie continue their journey after Tommy promises them sanctuary should they need it.|$|E

5|$|After some time, Neto's {{parents and}} sister visit him, and are deceived by {{the doctor who}} says Neto {{requires}} months of treatment. Neto begs his parents to take him with them and they refuse. Days later, Neto tries to escape but is captured and receives electric shock treatment. Suddenly, in another day, his father visits him to say he and Meire are missing him; Neto asks to leave the place and Wilson takes him away. At home, his mother asks a downcast Neto {{if he wants to}} return to school or to work as a salesman; he decides to work. The mother of one of his friends forbids Neto to see him, and he discovers Leninha is a married woman. Then, he becomes distressed to the point of leaving a client {{in the midst of a}} sale. To unwind, Neto goes to a party at night, where he mixes Coca-Cola and cacha√ßa. Drunk, <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> his friend Bel to the bathroom and they start to kiss each other. However, he goes berserk and starts to damage the place. The police are called and send him to another psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert {{the people in the}} vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Marthandan {{arrives at}} Ratnapuri. Vijayavarman asks {{him to stay}} in an {{isolated}} palace on the outskirts and tells him that he should not meet his wife Manohari until the coronation, as the current moment is inauspicious. On entering a hotel in Ratnapuri, Veerangan and Sagayam beat up a gang of rowdies. Hired by Vijayavarman, they mistake Veerangan for Marthandan. Veerangan is chased by palace guards and ends up in Marthandan's room. Marthandan and Veerangan meet face to face. Veerangan tells him of the pathetic state the people of Ratnapuri, and Marthandan agrees to set everything right as soon as he takes charge. On the eve of the coronation, Vijayavarman arranges for Marthandan to be poisoned. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> out his plan with the help of Karmegam, a royal advisor. Marthandan swoons after drinking a few sips of the poisoned beverage, but is soon saved by Veerangan and Ratnapuri's commander-in-chief. However, Marthandan is still unconscious and incapacitated. The commander-in-chief, and one of the ministers, persuade Veerangan to take Marthandan's place to ensure that the coronation takes place as scheduled. A reluctant Veerangan agrees {{to do so in the}} interests of the state, and arrives just in time for the coronation. It takes place smoothly and Veerangan, as Marthandan, becomes Ratnapuri's new king. Vijayavarman and Pingalan are taken aback and send men to investigate. They find the unconscious Marthandan and kidnap him.|$|E

50|$|Pinckney {{retained}} the electoral votes {{of the two}} states that <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> in 1804 (Connecticut and Delaware), and he also picked up New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and three electoral districts in North Carolina besides the two electoral districts in Maryland that <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> earlier. Except for the North Carolina districts, all of the improvement was in New England.|$|R
60|$|However, when {{nearly all}} the strangers had been defeated, a young unknown knight {{presented}} himself. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> a portrait, enclosed in a bow encrusted with diamonds, and he declared himself willing to maintain against them all that the Queen was the ugliest creature in the world, and that the Princess whose portrait <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> was the most beautiful.|$|R
5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E
