25|$|Guitars {{could have}} come to Hawaii from several sources: sailors, missionaries, or {{travelers}} to and from California.

25|$|Delany {{worked for}} a brief period as {{principal}} of a colored school before going into practice as a physician. During another cholera outbreak in 1854, most doctors abandoned the city, as did many residents who could leave, as no one knew how the disease was caused nor <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the epidemic. With a small group of nurses, Delany remained and cared for the victims. Delany is rarely acknowledged in the historiography of African American education (Anderson, 1988; Bullock, 1967; Butchart, 1980). He is not counted among African American educators, perhaps because he neither featured prominently in the establishment of schools nor philosophized at length on Black education.|$|E
