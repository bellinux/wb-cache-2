2500|$|The {{press was}} almost {{unanimous}} in its {{condemnation of the}} steel mill seizure. [...] The New York Daily News <b>head</b> <b>line</b> was typical: [...] "Truman Does a Hitler". [...] Only one newspaper with a sizeable circulation supported the president. Congress, too, reacted negatively. There were calls for Truman's impeachment, {{and a number of}} bills introduced to strip the WSB of its powers, to permit the government to end the strike, and to withdraw congressional approval of the expenditure of funds to operate the steel plants. The steel companies also condemned the action. Clarence B. Randall, president of Inland Steel, gave a nationally broadcast speech on April 9 attacking Truman and the Steelworkers. The employers' public relations group, [...] "Steel Companies in the Wage Case," [...] undertook an ambitious advertising campaign against the Truman administration. Full-page advertisements in major metropolitan newspapers appeared the next day excoriating the seizure, and within a week tens of thousands of pamphlets and fact sheets had been produced supporting the steel manufacturers' position.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are various}} types of line {{stopping}} heads. The oldest and still most widely used method of line plugging is the pivoting head style line stop.

Other methods include the folding <b>head</b> <b>line</b> stop which enters the pipe through a reduced branch hot tap, the Sure-Stop line stop which intersects the pipe and doesn't seal inside the pipe like other methods, and the HTP which is a high temperature, high pressure system that will stop the flow on existing pipes at operating temperatures above what other methods of line stops can safely stop.|$|E
