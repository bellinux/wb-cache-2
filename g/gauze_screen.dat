The album was released as a standalone CD issue, as a doublepack with the movie on DVD and as a limited numbered issue with CD, DVD and book. As with Bloodsports, Night Thoughts was very well received by both fans and critics alike and became their highest charting album since Head Music in 1999. [...] A series of concert dates in the UK and Europe to support the release followed. The first half of each show consisted of the band playing the album tracks in sequence, while onstage behind a <b>gauze</b> <b>screen</b> with the movie projected onto it. The second half consisted of a mix of back catalogue material, including a number of b-sides and obscure songs. The band also did a number of instore acoustic appearances in HMV stores to promote the release, including Q sessions and movie screenings.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of {{the flow}} field between the turning vanes and inlet plane for the test blades in the NPS Subsonic Cascade Wind Tunnel to January 1981 are reviewed. Typical {{velocities}} in this section are {{of the order of}} 100 to 200 ft/sec and the distance is less than two feet. It is concluded that some modification is necessary to achieve one percent uniformity for the mean velocity at the test cascade inlet plane and several approaches are suggested. From a study of simple analyses for turbulent wakes and the effects of wire <b>gauze</b> <b>screens,</b> it is predicted that the desired uniformity may be obtained by installing a single screen of high resistance coefficient; the necessary pressure drop and turning {{of the flow}} would be substantial. Placing the turning vanes at closer pitch might be adequate, but further measurements and numerical analysis would probably be necessary for design purposes.

40|$|Analytical {{models were}} {{developed}} to study the effect of flow contraction and screening on inflow distortions to identify qualitative design criteria. Results of the study are that: (1) static testing distortions are due to atmospheric turbulence, nacelle boundary layer, exhaust flow reingestion, flow over stand, ground plane, and engine casing; (2) flow contraction suppresses, initially, turbulent axial velocity distortions and magnifies turbulent transverse velocity distortions; (3) perforated plate and <b>gauze</b> <b>screens</b> suppress axial components of velocity distortions to a degree determined by the screen pressure loss coefficient; (4) honeycomb screen suppress transverse components of velocity distortions to a degree determined by the length to diameter ratio of the honeycomb; (5) acoustic transmission loss of perforated plate {{is controlled by the}} reactance of its acoustic impedance; (6) acoustic transmission loss of honeycomb screens is negligible; and (7) a model for the direction change due to a corner between honeycomb panels compares favorably with measured data...|$|R

5000|$|Both the Davy and Stephenson lamps were fragile.

40|$|Many of the {{employees}} of Buffalo industrial plants will be wearing masks tomorrow, and office employees will often be using <b>gauze</b> <b>screens</b> across their desks. • These actions {{are a result of}} a meeting of the Industrial Physicians and Surgeons Association of Buffalo last night in the Larkin Men’s club. • City bacteriologist Dr. William G. Bissell, who is also a major in the NY National Guard stationed at Canisius college to teach preventive medicine hygiene, expressed that the mask was the best preventive measure for offices and factories at the meeting last night. • On nearly every count, those present at the meeting agreed to adopt Dr. William G. Bissell’s suggestions. • There is a national organization with a similar function as this smaller local organization. • This was the first local meeting at which Dr. Chester T. Stewart, head doctor at the Curtiss airplane. • How long the closing rule will last depends upon what happens so far in response to the closing, said Dr. William G. Bissell. • Dr. William G. Bissell seemed to express he thought things were getting better. • He described the disease, how it is transmitted via close contact of people, preventive measures, and treatment. • Everyone at the meeting wore a face mask. • Dr. William G. Bissell stressed the importance of the mask, but said one did not have to wear it when in open air. • He said that physicians should use something stronger as a mask when attending to sick patients. • He also said that plant foremen should report every employee who was sick at all, regardless of symptoms. • Dr. William G. Bissell suggested that plant managers use a germicide made of creosote for any reason, and would not recommend any proprietary germicide. • He said that the health dept. was producing bactrin, but that it was not known how successful that treatment would be. • He emphasized sprays and face masks as preventive measures. • Dr. P. H. Hourigan, the physician at the Larkin plant, said that their employees were wearing masks yesterday, and that they had produced 8, 000 masks. Some of these masks would be donated to the city. • The Buffalo Forge Co. began spraying noses and mouths of all employees with an oil solution. • The Pierce plant will begin this spraying process tomorrow. • The Curtiss plant will request masks to be worn where thought necessary. • The Larkin plant has been washing telephone mouthpieces with a 2 % carboxylic acid solution, which Dr. William G. Bissell has approved. • Sputnum was discussed as a way the germ is spread. • Officials from Seneca Iron & Steel Co., the American Chemical & Aniline Co, the Buffalo Dry Dock Co., and other plants were present. • This organization will meet weekly during the epidemic, and will meet next Saturday night at the same place at 8 : 30 pm. • These individuals are strongly supporting the health dept. due to the fact they have been allowed to remain open. • Health dept. propaganda is being circulated in all the plants.

40|$|A {{new form}} of self-confined flow was {{investigated}} in which a recirculation zone forms away from any solid boundary. An inviscid flow analysis indicated that in a purely meridional axisymmetric flow a stationary, spherical, self-confined region should occur {{in the center of}} a streamlined divergent-convergent enlargement zone. The spherical confinement region would be at rest and at constant pressure. Experimental investigations were carried out in a specially built test apparatus to establish the desired confined flow. The streamlined divergent-convergent interior shape of the test section was fabricated according to the theoretical calculation for a particular streamline. The required inlet vorticity distribution was generated by producing a velocity profile with a shaped <b>gauze</b> <b>screen</b> in the straight pipe upstream of the test section. Fluid speed and turbulence intensity were measured with a constant-temperature hot-wire anemometer system. The measured results indicated a very orderly and stable flow field...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{present report}} is a {{continuation}} of an interim report dated 8 th August, 1951. The latter- report dealt with the flow in a model casing whereas the present reports deals with a similar investigation on the ‘Reavell’ compressor inlet casing which is {{to be part of the}} 9 in x 9 in supersonic wind tunnel installation, In the basic condition the flow had a circumferential instability* caused by the splitting of the inlet flow around the central shaft fairing. In addition the main flow through the casing was under-turned by approximately 200, Consequently the flow at the exit annulas was unsteady and changes of 300 in the exit flow direction were found. It was also found that at least four guide vanes were stalled in any one flow configuration. The instability was prevented by a flat dividing plate placed behind the central shaft fairing, but smooth flow at exit, in the vicinity of the plate, was only possible when curved fairings were added to both sides of the plate. A <b>gauze</b> <b>screen,</b> of 30 wires per inch, placed at entry, partly reduced the unsteadiness at exit but it had little effect on the flow direction and did not unstall the guide vanes. A perforated plate, having 15. inch diameter holes and 50 per cent blockage, similarly placed, had little or no effect. The guide vanes were unstalled by adding curved extensions to their leading edges. The large changes in the flow direction across the annulus at exit were, however, only reduced by modifying the internal contour of the casing. With these modifications flow angle variations of between 5 ° and 10 ° were obtained at exit. The velocity at exit was not uniform over the exit passages between the guide vanes, but the variations, which were not unduly large, were caused by secondary flows and the wakes from the vanes. This investigation has clearly shown that in the basic condition the unsteady, non-uniform flow at the exit from the inlet casing, which is immediately upstream of the first stage of the compressor, will tend to cause periodic stalling of the rotating blades in that stage. Since the relative velocities are high the danger of running into stn 3 ling flutter cannot be overlooked, especially as the cascade effect may reduce the critical flutter speed of the isolated blade. Stalling flutter, which usually takes place in the fundamental torsional mode, may be aggravated by a high order resonance occuring at the given rotational speed of the compressor. The suggested' modifications to the design of the inlet casing should prevent stalling of the first stage blades 'of the compressor caused by upstream, unsteady, non-uniform flow...|$|E
