5|$|Sejanus {{was born}} in 20 BC at Volsinii, Etruria, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of Lucius Seius Strabo. The Seii were Romans of the equestrian class (or knights), the lower of the two upper social classes of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 159 - 173. Previous {{research}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> {{of eating}} disordered individuals {{appears to have}} focused almost exclusively on <b>the</b> <b>families</b> of anorexics. In view of {{the problems associated with}} the conceptualization of bulimia as a syndrome distinct from anorexia nervosa, it seems possible that research <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> of anorexics may have included <b>the</b> <b>families</b> of bulimics. Following the introductory overview of some of the literature on bulimia, highlighting the lack of diagnostic clarity in this area, previous research <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> of both anorexics and bulimics is reviewed. In view of the lack of documented research <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> of bulimics from a systems perspective, the present study aimed to explore these families' functioning. Family functioning was assessed according to the McMaster Model of Family Functioning (Epstein and Bishop, 1981) : clinical interviews with 13 bulimics provided qualitative data on their families' functioning: quantitative data were elicited from <b>the</b> <b>family</b> members of 10 of these bulimics by means of <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> Assessment Device (Epstein and Bishop, 1983). Clinical assessment of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> of bulimics reveals unhealthy <b>family</b> functioning. <b>The</b> ratings of all family members {{as well as those of}} the researcher indicate that there is familial dysfunction on all dimensions of <b>family</b> functioning. <b>The</b> main emphases in these families appears to be on instrumental issues, while affective issues are inappropriately handled. Discussion centres on the findings of the present study, which show some variance with the results of previous research <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> of anorexics; and an understanding of bulimia from a systems perspective is presented...|$|R
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, the key {{challenge}} to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modelled themselves on Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy soon managed to draw its neighbours into a network of international and inter-state relations. This network revolved around treaty making, and included the welcoming of the new ruler <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of kings, and the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions. Whereas classical writers are fond of making ethical and legal distinctions between peace and war, Byzantines regarded diplomacy {{as a form of}} war by other means. For example, a Bulgarian threat could be countered by providing money to the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|Chris Wilton, a {{recently}} retired tennis professional, is taken on as {{an instructor at}} an upmarket club in London. He strikes up a friendship with a wealthy pupil, Tom Hewett, after discovering their common affinity for opera. Tom's older sister, Chloe, is smitten with Chris, and the two begin dating. During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom's American fiancée, Nola Rice, and they are instantly attracted to each other. Tom's mother, Eleanor, does not approve of her son's relationship with Nola, a struggling actress, which {{is a source of}} tension in the family. Chloe encourages her father, Alec, to give Chris a job as an executive in one of his companies; he begins to be accepted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> and marriage is discussed.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E

5|$|In the 13th and 14th centuries {{the estate}} {{was held by}} the de Holne family. During the 17th century the Staynings were lords of the manor and in the 18th descendents of FitzMartin by then known as the Martyn family had taken over. William Martin sold Holnicote to William Blackford and it descended through his family and then passed to the Dyke family. Sir Thomas Acland married <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> and added the surname to become Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet and it {{remained}} in his family until the donation in 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{corrected}} the subgroups of Thyreophora. He placed Acanthopholididae, Stegosauridae and Ceratopsidae together inside the group. Five years later, he corrected {{the name of}} the family to Acanthopholidae, which is now the correct spelling. In the same publication, he also changed the genera included. He assigned Hylaeosaurus, Stegoceras, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon inside it but moved Stegopelta and Ankylosaurus <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Ankylosauridae. Nopcsa then downgraded the phylogenetic rank of Acanthopholidae to make it a subfamily inside Nodosauridae. The clade was defined to include Ankylosaurus and Acanthopholinae. Inside Acanthopholinae he placed Acanthopholis, Hylaeosaurus, Rhodanosaurus, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon. Now considered as an artificial grouping, it was defined to include dinosaur taxa now considered to be polacanthids, a pachycephalosaur and Acanthopholis, a genus that is widely considered to be dubious. Acanthopholidae and Acanthopholinae are now dubious groups since the validity of Acanthopholis has changed.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette's father {{likewise}} {{died on the}} battlefield. On 1 August 1759, Michel de Lafayette {{was struck}} by a cannonball while fighting a British-led coalition at the Battle of Minden in Westphalia. Lafayette became marquis and Lord of Chavaniac, but the estate went to his mother. Perhaps devastated by the loss of her husband, she went to live in Paris with her father and grandfather, leaving Lafayette to be raised in Chavaniac-Lafayette by his paternal grandmother, Mme de Chavaniac, who had brought the château <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> with her dowry.|$|E

5|$|Paleontologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were {{for many years}} poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until the discovery of A. altai. A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae entirely, with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen's fragmentary nature. The discovery of A. altai in 2009 confirmed {{the placement of the}} genus within the Tyrannosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Pugs {{arrived in}} the United States {{during the nineteenth century}} and were soon making their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> home and the show ring. The American Kennel Club {{recognized}} the breed in 1885. The Pug Dog Club of America was founded in 1931 and was recognised by the American Kennel Club that same year. In 1981, the Pug Dhandys Favorite Woodchuck won the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in the United States, the only Pug to have won there since the show began in 1877. The World Champion, or Best in Show at the 2004 World Dog Show held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was a Pug named Double D Cinoblu's Masterpiece.|$|E
5|$|Sing {{was born}} on 2 March 1886 in Clermont, Queensland, Australia, {{the son of a}} Chinese father and an English mother. His parents were John Sing (c. 1842–1921), a drover from Shanghai, China, and Mary Ann Sing (née Pugh; c. 1857–unknown), a nurse from Kingswinford, Staffordshire, England. Sing's mother had given birth to a {{daughter}} named Mary Ann Elizabeth Pugh on 28 May 1883, less than two months before marrying Sing's father on 4 July 1883. It is unclear whether this child was John Sing's daughter as well. A daughter, Beatrice Sing, was later born <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> on 12 July 1893. The three children grew up together on the farm run by the Sings, and all three performed well academically.|$|E

5|$|St Gwenllwyfo's Church is a 19th-century parish church {{near the}} village of Dulas, in Anglesey, north Wales. It was built between 1854 and 1856 to replace an earlier church in the parish, also {{dedicated}} to St Gwenllwyfo, which needed repair and had become too small for its congregation. The new church was built nearer to the Llys Dulas estate, whose owner contributed £936 towards the total cost of £1,417, rather than near the area where many of the parishioners lived. In 1876, Sir Arundell Neave (who had married <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> that owned Llys Dulas) donated 27 panels of 15th and 16th-century stained glass that had once belonged to a Flemish monastery.|$|E
5|$|The {{house at}} Burton Pynsent was built section by section {{over the period}} of many years. Construction was {{commenced}} by Marmaduke Jennings in approximately 1565 and was continued by the Jennings family throughout the 17th century. In 1679 the house passed to Sir William Pynsent, who had married <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> Pynsent's son bequeathed the house to his political idol, William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, despite never meeting him. His intention was to disinherit Lord North, a relative of his wife, who had supported a tax on Somerset cider which Pynsent disagreed with, and which Pitt had blocked. Pynsent died in 1765 and his relatives were unhappy at being left just 1,000 guineas each, and so unsuccessfully contested the will over the following six years.|$|E
5|$|By custom {{there were}} seven {{conditions}} where a man could divorce his wife. These were: (1) disobedience to parents-in-law, (2) barrenness (unable to continue family line), (3) adultery (mixing another clan's blood <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family),</b> (4) jealousy (of concubines), (5) incurable disease (unable to continue family line), (6) loquacity (not getting along with brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law), and (7) theft. However, a husband {{was not allowed to}} divorce his wife if she had completed three years of mourning for one of his deceased parents, if there were no living relatives in her father's family to return to, or if the husband's family was originally poor but became rich after marriage. Sometimes women were also able to initiate the divorce and remarry if the husband's family was in poverty, he was diseased, or his in-laws were too abusive. Although remarriage was frowned upon (especially since divorce meant a wife took away her dowry wealth from her ex-husband's family), it was nonetheless common amongst divorcees and widowers in all social groups.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, {{he moved to the}} United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including {{as a member of the}} Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London with the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co. His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.|$|E
5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell {{of men with}} shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.|$|E
5|$|The {{successive}} {{rulers of}} Monaco tended to live elsewhere and visit their palace only occasionally. Charles III was succeeded in 1889 by Albert I. Albert married Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton, {{a daughter of}} Scotland's 11th duke of Hamilton, and his German wife, a princess of Baden. The couple had one son, Louis, before their marriage was annulled in 1880. Albert was a keen scientist and founded the Oceanographic Institute in 1906; as a pacifist he then founded the International Institute of Peace in Monaco. Albert's second wife, Alice Heine, an American banking heiress who was the widow of a French duke, did much to turn Monte Carlo into a cultural centre, establishing both ballet and the opera in the city. Having brought a large dowry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> she contemplated turning the casino into a convalescent home for the poor who would benefit from recuperation in warm climes. The couple, however, separated before Alice {{was able to put}} her plan into action.|$|E
