25|$|From 2015, Hornby plc {{began to}} {{announce}} a series of declining financial results. The major reason behind the decline Hornby declared was two fold, with {{the decline in the}} number of (now aged, and hence older) collectable customers, and a lack of interest in modelling as a hobby in light of the digitization and advancement of the internet games industry. After the PLC shares dropped by more than 50% in a year, at the 2016 results Hornby declared that it planned to cut more than half of the toys it made, after discovering that it generated 90% of its profits from only 50% of its range. In the year to 31 March 2017, revenues fell further to £47.4m from £55.8m, while underlying losses widened to £6.3m from a £5.7m deficit in 2016. The financial declines culminated in July 2017, when the largest shareholder Phoenix Asset Management (PAM) agreed to buy 17.6 million Hornby shares for 32.375p from the second largest - and activist/protagonist shareholder - New Pistoia Income (NPI), which gave PAM a 55.2% holding in the company. This triggered under stock <b>exchange</b> <b>rules</b> a mandatory takeover offer of Hornby by PAM, at the NPI strike price of 32.375p, valuing Hornby at £27.4million. As a result of the takeover, the chairman of Hornby resigned from the company in August 2017, followed by the Chief Executive in September 2017.|$|E

40|$|Linear logical {{frameworks}} with subexponentials {{have been}} used for the specification of among other systems, proof systems, concurrent programming languages and linear authorization logics. In these frameworks, subexponentials can be configured to allow or not for the application of the contraction and weakening <b>rules</b> while the <b>exchange</b> <b>rule</b> can always be applied. This means that formulae in such frameworks can only be organized as sets and multisets of formulae not being possible to organize formulae as lists of formulae. This paper investigates the proof theory of linear logic proof systems in the non-commutative variant. These systems can disallow the application of <b>exchange</b> <b>rule</b> on some subexponentials. We investigate conditions for when cut-elimination is admissible in the presence of non-commutative subexponentials, investigating the interaction of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rule</b> with local and non-local contraction rules.

40|$|Recent work {{establishes}} {{a direct link}} between the complexity of a linear logic proof {{in terms of the}} <b>exchange</b> <b>rule</b> and the topological complexity of its corresponding proof net, expressed as the minimal rank of the surfaces on which the proof net can be drawn without crossing edges. That surface is essentially computed by sequentialising the proof net into a sequent calculus which is derived from that of linear logic by attaching an appropriate structure to the sequents. We show here that this topological calculus can be given a better-behaved logical status, when viewed in the variety-presentation framework introduced by the first author. This change of viewpoint gives rise to permutative logic, which enjoys cut elimination and focussing properties and comes equipped with new modalities for the management of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rule.</b> Moreover, both cyclic and linear logic are shown to be embedded into permutative logic. It provides the natural logical framework in which to study and constrain the topological complexity of proofs, and hence the use of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rule...</b>|$|R
