5|$|Charlie's first notable storyline was {{a lesbian}} {{relationship}} with Joey Collins (Kate Bell). The storyline was implemented by producers to boost ratings and Anderson said it helped portray Charlie's vulnerable side. The storyline angered Christian and conservative oriented family groups. They complained that Home and Away had featured sexualised plotlines unsuitable for children, and Channel Seven was inundated with parental complaints stating that children {{should not be}} exposed to same-sex relationships in a family show. Viewership declined after transmission of the storyline and producers cut scenes to attune to viewers' wishes, which outraged the LGBT community. The storyline came to a natural end and Anderson and executive producer Cameron Welsh praised the plot because it portrayed a real-life situation and denounced the conservative views as outdated. Anderson stated that the storyline was a <b>great</b> <b>one</b> to portray in terms of acting.|$|E
5|$|There were {{professional}} {{musicians in}} the previous three generations of Holst's family {{and it was clear}} from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist, but was prevented by neuritis in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the trombone professionally and later became a teacher—a <b>great</b> <b>one,</b> according to his colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams. Among other teaching activities he built up a strong tradition of performance at Morley College, where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924, and pioneered music education for women at St Paul's Girls' School, where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of Whitsun music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.|$|E

25|$|Colonial era {{scholarship}} {{proposed that}} Indra shares etymological roots with Zend Andra derived from Old High German Antra, or Jedru of Old Slavonic, but Max Muller critiqued these proposals as untenable.

25|$|A {{possible}} wife of Huni {{was instead}} a queen Djefatnebty, whose name appears in black ink inscriptions on beer vases from Elephantine. Her name {{is guided by}} the title <b>great</b> <b>one</b> of the hetes-sceptre, making her definitely a queen consort. According to an interpretation by Günter Dreyer, Djefatnebty's death is mentioned alongside several events {{during the reign of}} king Huni, although no king is mentioned in the inscription by his name. Dreyer is convinced that the notations concern the 22nd year of Huni's reign, since the Turin canon credits him with a reign of 24 years and no 3rd dynasty king is archaeologically proven to have ruled so long. Dreyer's interpretation is not commonly accepted, though.|$|E

25|$|This {{trade-off}} {{does not}} apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit having a reduced melting point. Such a glass seal is rigid, and will experience increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may prevent vacuum glazing from being used when the temperature differential is too <b>great.</b> <b>One</b> manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35°C.|$|E

Belinus and Brennius accepted and took their great army to Germany. Soon after this movement north, Rome broke the treaty and marched north, and Brennius went to fight the Romans while Belinus remained at war with the Germans (who were being helped by various other Italian troops).|$|E
25|$|The Oilers lost another {{important}} player before the 1990–91 season, as Jari Kurri chose {{to play the}} entire season with the HC Milano Devils. Grant Fuhr was also suspended for 60 games for drug abuse. The season itself was not a <b>great</b> <b>one</b> for the Oilers: they finished with 37 wins and 80 points, good for third place in the Smythe Division. In the playoffs, the Oilers met the Flames in the opening round. In a thrilling series, the Oilers won the series in seven games, led by seven goals by Esa Tikkanen. Despite injuries suffered in the series with Calgary, they defeated the Los Angeles Kings in six games. Their success was unable to continue into the Conference Final, however, as they lost in five games to the Minnesota North Stars, who were making their Cinderella run.|$|E

The team {{finished}} with a 48–19–0–1 record; winning their third Emms Trophy for {{the best record in}} the central division as well as the top seed in the Eastern Conference. The Colts were led by their captain Bryan Little who scored a total of 41 goals and 66 assists for a team leading 107 points. He was selected to represent Canada at the 2007 IIHF World Junior Under 20 Championships held in Sweden that year. Hunter Tremblay (89 points), Richard Clune (78 points), and Kris Spare (51 points), each enjoyed career years. Making their OHL and Colts debuts this year was forward Alex Hutchings, future captains Tomas Marcinko, and Stefan Della Rovere, defencemen Brian Lashoff and Ryan Gottschalk, and goaltender Michael Hutchinson. These players would prove to be the core of the Colts team for the next four years. Also added to the roster were forwards Cory McGillis, and T.J. Battani, as well as defenceman Mike Weber. Although finishing top in their conference, the playoffs were a disappointment for the Colts who, after defeating Brampton Battalion in four games, were swept by the sixth place Sudbury Wolves in the conference semi-finals.|$|E
