5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

In 1998, three volunteers from the Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission went to Paris to find the grave, which they discovered was crumbling, undated, and scheduled for removal. Through the commission's efforts as well as donations, including some <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> of Bryant and Bullitt, the grave was restored.|$|E

Recently, Sandstede, Scheel and Wul derived a center bundle theorem, reducing local bifurcation <b>from</b> <b>relative</b> periodic solutions to a nite dimensional problem. Independently, Lamb and Melbourne showed how to systematically study local bifurcation from isolated periodic solutions with discrete spatiotemporal symmetries. In this paper, we {{show how the}} center bundle theorem, when combined with certain group theoretic results, reduces bifurcation <b>from</b> <b>relative</b> periodic solutions to bifurcation from isolated periodic solutions. In this way, we obtain a systematic approach {{to the study of}} local bifurcation <b>from</b> <b>relative</b> periodic solutions...|$|R

Another memorial plaque was also installed, by Metro officials, at Fort Totten station; it was subject to complaints <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> of the dead, who claimed that it was insensitive.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826, {{and soon}} {{thereafter}} his parents acquired a farm {{of their own}} to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother {{died when he was}} eight; Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (née du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned <b>from</b> <b>relatives,</b> Kruger's only education was three months under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father.

In 1915, he {{was transferred to the}} école primaire supérieure (secondary) at Bingerville in spite of his family's reluctance to have him go to boarding school. The same year, at Bingerville, Houphouët converted to Christianity; he considered it a modern religion and an obstacle to the spread of Islam. He chose to be christened Félix.|$|E
5|$|Within several years, Xhinovci {{was forced}} to close Pizzeria Hitleri because local KLA commanders felt that it would tarnish the organization's image.

5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, {{a substantial portion}} of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> that died in concentration camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) medical {{examiners}} identified {{most of the}} bodies within 10 weeks of the accident. Due to extreme impact forces only one body was identifiable by sight. For approximately 100 bodies, the examiners used DNA; the DNA analysis {{has been referred to}} as the largest DNA identification project in Canadian history. About 90 bodies were identified by Canadian {{medical examiners}} using dental records. For around 30 bodies, examiners used fingerprints and ante mortem (before death) X-rays. The large number of ante mortem dental X-rays meant that around 90 bodies had been identified by the end of October. The RCMP contacted relatives of victims to ask for medical histories and dental records. Blood samples <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> were used in the DNA identification of victims.|$|E
5|$|The farm invasions {{severely}} impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe {{had produced}} over two {{million tons of}} maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000.

By 2009, 75% of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. In 2000, the country's GDP was US $7.4 billion; by 2005 this had declined to US $3.4 billion. Inflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000% and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> abroad.|$|E

5|$|The fruiting {{body has}} a convex-shaped cap, at first small in {{relation}} to its stipe, expanding in volume as it matures. The skin of the cap is dry, matte and can be coloured from maroon to chocolate brown with a reddish tint. These characteristics distinguish it visually <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> such as Boletus edulis, Boletus reticulatus and Boletus aereus. The young, immature cap may have a pale pink colour and a white, powdery flush. Measuring 410cm (1.64 in) tall by 38 (1.22.2in) cm wide, the bulbous stipe is often large, swollen and imposing, bearing a network. The overall colour may have an orange-red tinge which is more obvious in the lowest parts, although this is also common in other species. As with all boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body can be very variable. The cap diameter can be as much as 30cm (12in) and stem height 15cm (6in).|$|E
5|$|Five SAO Krajina police {{officers}} were prosecuted by Knin District Court in 1992 {{for the murder of}} the Rakić family. The investigation was spurred on by requests <b>from</b> <b>relatives</b> of the victims, who threatened the RSK authorities that they would notify the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) unless the RSK authorities continued searching, which led Đuro Kresović, president of Knin District Court to write to the Minister of the Interior of the RSK asking for instructions on how to proceed, stating that any attempt to retrieve the bodies of the Rakić family would uncover numerous other bodies in the Golubnjača Pit. He requested instructions on how to proceed with the investigation and what to do if the UNPROFOR found out about the bodies in the pit. Even though the RSK investigation was completed, trial of those suspected of involvement in the murders did not begin before 2010 in Belgrade. The trial and the appeals process were concluded in 2013, resulting in four convictions: Čedo Budisavljević was sentenced to thirteen years in prison, while Mirko Malinović, Milan Bogunović and Bogdan Gruičić were sentenced to twelve, ten, and eight years in prison respectively.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} has been to {{investigate}} the distinction between a nonresonant and resonant Hopf bifurcation <b>from</b> <b>relative</b> equilibria. Resonant and nonresonant Hopf bifurcations <b>from</b> <b>relative</b> equilibria posed in two spatial dimensions, in systems with Euclidean SE(2) symmetry, have been extensively studied {{in the context of}} spiral waves in a plane and are now well understood. We initially investigate Hopf bifurcations <b>from</b> <b>relative</b> equilibria posed in systems with compact S 0 (3) symmetry where S 0 (3) is the group of rotations in three dimensions/on a sphere. Unlike the SE(2) case the skew product equations cannot be solved directly and we use the normal form theory due to Fiedler and Turaev to simplify these systems. We show that the normal form theory resolves the nonresonant case, but not the resonant case. New methods developed in this thesis combined with the normal form theory resolves the resonant case. We find that the resonant Hopf bifurcation produces a motion which is strikingly different from the nonresonant case. By considering the geometric properties of the underlying relative equilibrium we give a definition of resonance directly related to the Hopf bifurcation phenomena. This yields conditions for the occurrence of a resonant Hopf bifurcation <b>from</b> a <b>relative</b> equilibrium in a system with general compact symmetry. By extending the approach used to resolve the S 0 (3) case we then solve the skew product equations for a general compact symmetry group. The specific case of a Hopf bifurcation <b>from</b> a <b>relative</b> equilibria with symmetry of an irregular dodecahedron is also considered. Furthermore we look at nonresonant and resonant Hopf Bifurcations <b>from</b> <b>relative</b> equilibria posed in a system with noncompact Euclidean symmetry in three spatial dimensions...|$|R
