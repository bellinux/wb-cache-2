Another offshoot is electrogrind (or cybergrind) which incorporates electronic music <b>elements</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> sampling and programmed drums.

50|$|According to scholars, the Visuddhimagga {{is one of}} the {{extremely}} rare texts within the enormous literatures of various forms of Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism to give explicit details about how spiritual masters were thought to actually manifest supernormal abilities.
