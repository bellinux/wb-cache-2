2500|$|In its <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession,</b> Russia made a {{reservation}} regarding article 18 of the Berne Convention, {{stating that the}} treaty [...] "shall not extend to the works which, at {{the date of entry}} into force of the said Convention in respect of the Russian Federation, are already in the public domain in its territory." [...] This statement effectively denied the retroactivity of the Berne Convention for foreign works within Russia. This was of some importance because of the issue of foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the UCC. Such works had never been eligible to copyright in the Soviet Union or in Russia. Under §18(2) of the Berne Convention, they should have become copyrighted in 1995 because that article only exempted works that once were copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia. The reservation made by Russia used a slightly different phrasing, just stating that works that were in the public domain in Russia in 1995 would not be reprotected. As pre-1973 foreign works were not copyrighted at all and thus in the public domain in Russia in 1995, such foreign works remained in the public domain in Russia.|$|E
2500|$|The Berne Convention {{also became}} {{effective}} for Russia on March 13, 1995. The Berne Convention is retroactive in principle: {{according to its}} article 18, it applies to all works that are copyrighted in their source country (the country where the first publication of the work occurred) {{on the day the}} treaty enters in force with respect to a joining country such as Russia. Article 18(2) adds that if [...] "through the expiry of the term of protection which was previously granted, a work has fallen into the public domain of the country where protection is claimed, that work shall not be protected anew." [...] Hence works that were copyrighted in Russia on March 13, 1995 became copyrighted in all other Berne Countries on that date. Under these provisions, foreign works not formerly copyrighted in Russia should also have become copyrighted in Russia. Russian legal scholars had warned of this, and the government feared the impacts on the trade balance with Western countries if Russian publishers would suddenly have to pay royalties for foreign works. In its <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession,</b> Russia therefore made a reservation regarding article 18 of the Berne Convention, stating that the treaty [...] "shall not extend to the works which, at the date of entry into force of the said Convention in respect of the Russian Federation, are already in the public domain in its territory." [...] For Russian and Soviet work that originated in Russia, this was just a restatement of article 18(1) of the Berne Convention; but as far as foreign works were concerned, this reservation effectively denied the retroactivity of the Berne Convention within Russia. This was of some importance because of the issue of foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the UCC. Such works had never been eligible to copyright in the Soviet Union or in Russia. Under §18(2) of the Berne Convention, they should have become copyrighted in 1995 because that article only exempted works that once were copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia. The reservation made by Russia used a slightly different phrasing, just stating that works that were in the public domain in Russia in 1995 would not be reprotected. As pre-1973 foreign works were not copyrighted at all and thus in the public domain in Russia in 1995, such works remained in the public domain in Russia. Russia thus got rather favorable conditions when it joined Berne Convention: Russian and Soviet works became copyrighted retroactively in other Berne countries, but pre-1973 works from those other countries did not become copyrighted in Russia.|$|E

5000|$|The Polish Native Church {{is an open}} church, {{without any}} claims of {{exclusivity}} in any sense - this regards both the individual’s faith {{and his or her}} membership with churches or religious organisations. Members of the Native Polish Church insist that their Slavic ancestors were followers of the same God as the Christians and Muslims and others worship in their own special way. This means that one can be both a member of the Native Polish Church and a member of a different religious association (not necessarily pagan). Therefore, membership with the Native Polish Church does not require any formal act of apostasy from the candidate’s previous faith. The only formal membership requirement is the filing of an appropriate <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> that serves as a statement of creed.|$|E

50|$|The Volkskammer, the Parliament of East Germany, {{passed a}} {{resolution}} on 23 August 1990 declaring the accession (Beitritt) of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, and {{the extension of the}} field of application of the Federal Republic's Basic Law to the territory of East Germany as allowed by article 23 of the West German Basic Law, effective 3 October 1990. The East German <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> (Beitrittserklärung) to the Federal Republic as allowed by article 23 of the West German Basic Law, approved by the Volkskammer on 23 August, was formally presented by its President to the President of the West German Bundestag by means of a letter dated 25 August 1990. Thus, formally, the procedure of reunification by means of the accession of East Germany to West Germany, and of East Germany's acceptance of the Basic Law already in force in West Germany, was initiated as the unilateral, sovereign decision of East Germany, as allowed by the then existing provision of article 23 of the West German Basic Law.|$|E

5000|$|Article 23 of the Basic Law {{provided}} other de jure German states, initially {{not included}} in the field of application of the Basic Law, with the right to declare their accession (Beitritt) at a later date. Therefore, although the Basic Law was considered provisional, it allowed more parts of Germany to join its field of application. On one side, it gave the Federal Republic of Germany - composed as it was in 1949 - no right to negotiate, reject or deny another German state's declaration of its accession to the FRG, subject to the FRG's recognising that state de jure and being satisfied that the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> resulted from the free self-determination of its people; while on the other side an acceding state would have to accept the Basic Law and all laws so far legislated under the institutions of the FRG as they were. As the Federal Republic could not itself declare the accession of another part of Germany under Article 23, this provision could not be applied as an instrument of annexation, nor could accession under Article 23 be achieved by international treaty. It remained unclear whether accession under Article 23 could be achieved by a part of Germany whose government was not recognised de jure by the Federal Republic, and if so how; but in practice this situation did not arise. Article 23, altered after 1990, originally read as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Hence, the Volkskammer of the GDR on 23 August 1990 {{declared}} the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law; and so initiated {{the process of}} reunification, to come into effect on 3 October 1990. Nevertheless the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including the fundamental amendments to the Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.

50|$|Under article 45 of the Treaty, {{it entered}} into force {{according}} to international law on 29 September 1990, upon {{the exchange of}} notices regarding {{the completion of the}} respective internal constitutional requirements for the adoption of the treaty in both East Germany and West Germany. With that last step, and in accordance with article 1 of the Treaty, and in conformity with East Germany's <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> presented to the Federal Republic, Germany was officially reunited at 00:00 CEST on 3 October 1990. East Germany joined the Federal Republic as the five Länder (states) of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. These states were the five original states of East Germany, but were abolished in 1952 in favour of a centralised system. As part of the 18 May treaty, the five East German states were reconstituted on 23 August. At the same time, East and West Berlin reunited into one city, which became a city-state {{along the lines of the}} existing city-states of Bremen and Hamburg. Berlin was still formally under Allied occupation (that would only be terminated later, as a result of the provisions of the Two Plus Four Treaty), but the city's administrative merger and inclusion in the Federal Republic of Germany, effective on 3 October 1990, had been greenlighted by the Allies, and were formally approved in a meeting of the Allied Control Council on 2 October 1990. In an emotional ceremony, at the stroke of midnight on 3 October 1990, the black-red-gold flag of West Germany—now the flag of a reunited Germany—was raised above the Brandenburg Gate marking the moment of German reunification.|$|E
