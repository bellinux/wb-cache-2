5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 {{remaining}} in the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly and get a defensive stop in order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards {{until late in the}} drive, forcing Virginia Tech to use up valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes {{remaining in the}} game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E

25|$|Axis & Allies is not {{a strict}} {{historical}} wargame, due to its streamlining for ease of play and balancing so that both sides <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> For instance, the economic model is simplistic, with each territory producing a number of Industrial Production Certificates (IPCs) {{for the purchase of}} new units. Moreover, the game is supposed to start in the spring of 1942, but Japan is immediately in position to attack Hawaii again, while Germany is pressed well into the Soviet Union with an initially superior force. If the game were truer to history, the Axis empires would be at their climax in 1942, about to be pushed back by the Allies.|$|E

25|$|However, the Giants did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> Delvin Joyce {{returned}} Chandler's short kickoff 32 {{yards to}} the 47-yard line. Collins then {{led them to the}} 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds left. But Junkin botched a snap for a 41-yard field goal attempt, resulting in a feeble pass play that fell incomplete. The Giants were also called for having an illegal man downfield on the play, and the game ended. The following day, it was revealed that the penalized player (guard Rich Seubert) had in fact checked in as an eligible receiver before the field goal attempt, although a different Giant lineman (guard Tam Hopkins) actually was illegally downfield. NFL Vice President of Officiating Mike Pereira admitted pass interference also should have been called on 49ers defensive end Chike Okeafor for pulling down Seubert. Had the two right calls been made, the down would have been replayed at the previous spot, the San Francisco 23.|$|E
500|$|In {{previous}} seasons, UConn {{had been}} largely dependent on running the ball; the team developed more balance in 2009, ranking 41st of 120 Division I FBS teams nationally in rushing offense and 46th in passing. Marcus Easley's emergence as a productive wide receiver was key {{to the development of}} the Huskies' passing attack. [...] A former walk-on who entered the season with only five career receptions, he led Connecticut in receiving in 2009 with 44 catches for 853 yards and eight touchdowns. [...] Quarterback Zach Frazer was inconsistent in the early season. He was injured in the game against North Carolina, but regained his starting role after backup Cody Endres was hurt in the Rutgers game later in the season. [...] In UConn's four games before the bowl, Frazer performed well; he threw six touchdown passes against only two interceptions and helped the Huskies score an average of 41 points per game. [...] Experts felt Frazer would need to have a good performance for Connecticut to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 16 August 2010, Iranian {{officials}} withdrew Mohammed Soleimani {{from the}} men's under-48-kilogram category taekwondo final against Israel's Gili Haimovitz, citing an ankle injury. According to the officials, Soleimani had first hurt his ankle at the World Junior Championships in Mexico {{earlier in the}} year, and the injury had flared up again during his semifinal contest against the US's Gregory English. Soleimani was sent to hospital for an X-ray, and his ankle was put into a cast. Haimovitz was awarded the gold medal by default at a victory ceremony at the Suntec International Convention Centre from which Soleimani, the silver medallist, was absent. Interviewed later on, Soleimani said he was [...] "very sad" [...] to have missed the bout as he was [...] "sure [...] {{was going to get}} the gold medal". Israel's chef-de-mission Daniel Oren claimed that the pullout had been politically motivated. He said: [...] "It's not the first time this has happened at the Olympics. But this is a first for a medal match. To be honest, once our boy got into the final, we knew {{that this is going to}} happen. I spoke to our boy after the final and he, of course, was disappointed that he did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> his gold through an actual fight. I feel more sorry for the Iranian boy. He must have trained hard to get to this stage and was not given a chance to fight. We are dealing with sports here, youth sports, in fact. It's a pity that politics got involved." [...] However, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: [...] "As far as the IOC is concerned, there is no sinister intent here. What we know factually is that the athlete injured his ankle and was sent to the hospital for an X-ray. Tests revealed he did not suffer anything broken, and he is all right now. So unless more factual information is available, it [...] is mere speculation." [...] This was reiterated by IOC President Jacques Rogge on 17 August: [...] "He [...] was driven to the hospital, was examined by a Singaporean doctor, totally independent, not belonging to the organisation and he diagnosed an ankle sprain. For us, that's the end of the story." [...] Previously, Iran has stated that since its existing government does not recognize Israel as a state, its policy is to withdraw from competing against the country.|$|E

2500|$|In Mongolia, {{racing is}} a people's sport where {{everyone}} participates. [...] Each family selects the best horse from their herd and {{takes it to}} the fair to race. [...] However, in recent years, the introduction of fast foreign crossbreeds has changed the sport. [...] Only the richest breeder can afford to buy and raise a Thoroughbred/Mongolian mix, and such horses tend to win races. [...] This has led to complaints that ordinary people no longer <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>win,</b> and that racing has become {{the province of the}} elite. Racing horses with a child in the saddle run in full gallop over 35km at a time. Children are used instead of adults because they are lighter. [...] Mongolians are not so much concerned with the skill and experience of a jockey as the ability of the horse.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{a nucleus}} of young talent and high {{expectations}} for 1999–2000, injuries caused the Bruins to plummet {{to the bottom of}} their division, and they went on track to miss the playoffs. This was further exacerbated by negative attention over teammate Marty McSorley's hit on Donald Brashear. With his career nearing an end and the team going in the wrong direction, Bourque requested a trade from the fading Bruins so he would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the Stanley Cup. Bourque wanted to be traded to a team on the East Coast such as the Philadelphia Flyers, and Flyers' general manager Bobby Clarke offered the Bruins Andy Delmore and Daymond Langkow for Bourque. Bruins general manager Harry Sinden badly wanted Bourque {{to have a chance to}} close out his career with a Cup win and decided to pursue a trade with the Colorado Avalanche instead. Doing his best to keep word of the deal out of the press, Sinden worked out the specifics of the deal and on March 6, 2000, Sinden told Bourque he would be traded to the Avalanche and said, [...] "this may not be your first choice, but this is the team I feel is best." [...] Bourque and fellow veteran Dave Andreychuk were sent to Colorado in exchange for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Sammy Pahlsson, and a first-round draft pick (2000 draft, 27th overall, Martin Samuelsson).|$|E
