5|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} {{has also}} been detected in Callisto's atmosphere via recent analysis of 2001 Hubble Space Telescope data. Spectral images taken on 15 and 24 December 2001 were re-examined, revealing a faint signal of scattered light that indicates a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona.</b> The amount of hydrogen present in Callisto's atmosphere varies depending {{on the stage of}} its orbit.|$|E
40|$|Optical {{measurements}} of thermospheric and ionospheric processes and their interpretation are reviewed and the chemical reactions {{and their effects}} on emissions are discussed. Also included are the phenomena which excite the airglow and aurora, i. e., the solar UV/EUV flux and auroral particle precipitation. Consideration is given to solar flux, atomic emissions, molecular emissions, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona,</b> and molecular oxygen and the green line nightglow...|$|E
40|$|Energetic neutral atoms (ENA), {{emitted from}} the {{magnetosphere}} with energies of about 50 keV, have been measured with solid state detectors on the IMP 7 / 8 and ISEE 1 spacecraft; they are produced when singly charged trapped ions collide with the exosphere neutral <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona</b> and the energetic ions are neutralized by charge exchange. ENA observations during the recovery phase of two moderate geomagnetic storms are analyzed: November 22 - 23, 1973, from IMP 8 at 33 earth radii and December 17, 1977, from ISEE 1 at 20 earth radii...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{high-resolution}} observations by Reynolds, Roesler, and Scherb {{identify the}} low-intensity nighttime H-alpha and H-beta emission components that {{originate in the}} geocorona. They suggest that a Balmer-line-producing mechanism {{such as the one}} proposed by Kondo and Kupperian is perhaps responsible for generating the H-alpha and H-beta components of the geocorona. A theoretical calculation was performed using this model in which the <b>geocorona</b> <b>hydrogen</b> is excited through collision with the electrons. The results agree well with the observed intensity ratio, H-alpha/H-beta = 4 to 5. Other consequences of this excitation mechanism are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{performed}} during 1983 - 1986 on {{the ring}} current, the injection boundary model, and the radiation belts are discussed. The results of these studies yielded the first observations on the composition and charge state of the ring current throughout the ring-current energy range, and strong observational support for an injection-boundary model accounting for the origins of radiation-belt particles, the ring current, and substorm particles observed at R less than about 7 earth radii. In addition, the results have demonstrated that the detection of energetic neutral atoms generated by charge-exchange interactions between the ring current and the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona</b> can provide global images of the earth's ring current and its spatial and temporal evolution...|$|E
40|$|Data on ion and {{electron}} {{temperatures and}} concentrations to several thousand kilometers of altitude {{were obtained from}} the Atmosphere Explorer C satellite for 1974 and to 850 km from Arecibo incoherent scatter radar measurements. These data were used to normalize diffusive equilibrium profiles. From these profiles and by using the neutral atmospheric model of Jacchia (1971) and a new hydrogen model, the charge-exchange-induced neutral hydrogen escape fluxes for equatorial and middle latitudes were calculated. The data confirm earlier estimates that the charge exchange loss is more important than Jeans escape for the earth. It is also found that inside the plasmapause this charge exchange process with hot plasmapheric ions is the major production and loss process for the satellite population in the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona...</b>|$|E
40|$|Particle distributions, currents, and {{the ring}} current {{situation}} {{prior to the}} August 1984 launch of the AMPTE Charge Composition Explorer (CCE) are discussed. CCE results which demonstrate the capability of these new measurements to pursue questions of ring current sources, energization, and transport are presented. Consideration is given to various ring current generation mechanisms which have been discussed in the literature, and a two-step generation process which {{to a certain extent}} unifies the previous mechanisms is presented. The first in-situ global observations of ring current decay as obtained through the detection of energetic neutral atoms generated by charge exchange interactions between the ring current and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona</b> are discussed, as well as the possibility of using the detection of energetic neutral atoms to obtain global images of the earth's ring current...|$|E
40|$|An {{estimate}} of the topside proton concentration {{can be obtained by}} analyzing the incoherent scatter radar autocorrelation function from that region. Our observations at Arecibo, Puerto Rico indicate that the H+ to O+ composition transition height often occurs as low as 450 km during winter nights, near solar minimum. In the summer, the nighttime transition height is only slightly higher, near 600 km. This height is also affected by the level of magnetic activity. Maximum concentrations of H+ occur near 04 : 00 LT, with a minimum about twelve hours later. The observations of topside H+ were acquired during the past six years as part of the Regular World Day experiments, and from studies of the low latitude <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona.</b> In particular, we will emphasize the results obtained during the solstice and equinox periods of the Thermospheric Mapping Study...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{a one-year}} set of Lyman-alpha airglow data {{measured in the}} local zenith at altitudes from 400 to 1100 km by a UV photometer aboard OGO- 6. The zenith-intensity data are fitted to theoretical airglow calculations in four spherically symmetric models of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona</b> to determine both the Ly-alpha solar flux at line center and the average atomic hydrogen column density. After correcting for a loss of instrument sensitivity, the Ly-alpha flux {{is found to be}} linearly correlated with daily Zurich sunspot number. It is also found that the hydrogen density is inversely correlated with Jacchia exospheric temperature, but the dependence is not that predicted by steady-state models with Jeans evaporative escape as the only loss mechanism. It is suggested that charge-exchange production of fast hydrogen atoms from 'hot' ionospheric protons might provide the additional loss this result requires...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} diurnal and magnetospheric modulations on the {{structure}} of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona</b> is analyzed on the basis of recent observations. Particular attention is given to the enhancement of neutral escape by plasma effects, including the recently observed phenomenon of low-altitude ion acceleration. It is found that, while significant fluxes of neutral H should be produced by transverse ion acceleration in the auroral zone, the process is probably insufficient to account for the observed polar depletion of hydrogen atoms. Analysis of recent exospheric temperature measurements from the Dynamics Explorer- 2 satellite suggest that neutral heating in and near the high latitude cusp may be the major contributor to depleted atomic hydrogen densities at high latitudes. Altitude profiles of the production rates for escaping neutral hydrogen atoms during periods of maximum, minimum, and typical solar activity are provided...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial exospheric atomic {{hydrogen}} (H) resonantly scatters solar Lyman-α (121. 567 nm) radiation, observed as {{the glow of}} the H-geocorona. The Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers (TWINS) satellites are equiped with two Lyman-α line-of-sight Detectors (LADs) each. Since during the past solar minimum conditions the relevant solar control parameters practically did not vary, we are using LAD data between June and September 2008 to create a time averaged <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona</b> model representative for these solar minimum conditions. In this averaged model we assume that the H-geocorona is longitudinally symmetric with respect to the earth-sun line. We find a 3 -dimensional H-density distribution in the range from 3 to 8 earth radii which with some caution can also be extrapolated to larger distances. For lower geocentric distances than 3 earth radii a best fitting r-dependent Chamberlain (1963) -like model is adapted. Main findings are larger than conventionally expected H-densities at heights above 5 RE and a pronounced day-to-night side H-density asymmetry. The H-geocorona presented here should serve as a reference H-atmosphere for the earth during solar minimum conditions...|$|E
40|$|The Energetic Neutral Atom Precipitation {{experiment}} {{is scheduled to}} be flown on the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS 1) NASA mission. The objective of this {{experiment is}} to measure very faint emissions at nighttime arising from fluxes of energetic neutral atoms in the thermosphere. These energetic atoms have energies ranging up to about 50 keV, and arise from ions of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen trapped in the inner magnetosphere. Some of these ions become neutralized in charge exchange reactions with neutral hydrogen in the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona</b> that extends through the region. The ions are trapped on magnetic field lines which cross the equatorial plane at 2 to 6 earth radii distance, and they mirror at a range of heights on these field lines, extending down to the thermosphere at 500 km altitude. The ATLAS 1 measurements will not be of the neutral atoms themselves but of the optical emission produced by those on trajectories that intersect the thermosphere. The ENAP measurements are to be made using the Imaging Spectrometric Observatory (ISO) which is being flown on the ATLAS mission primarily for daytime spectral observations, and the ENAP measurements will all be nighttime measurements because of the faintness of the emissions and the relatively low level of magnetic activity expected...|$|E
40|$|The cleft ion {{fountain}} {{has been}} identified as a prodigious source of upflowing suprathermal ionospheric plasma. Modeling efforts have traced the path of these ions from the polar ionosphere along trajectories where the ions are energized to keV energies and deposited in the near earth plasma sheet. Mass and energy dispersion of these ions accounts in a natural way for the observed variation in heavy ion content of the plasma sheet. Observations of ion composition in the plasma sheet by the AMPTE and ISEE spacecraft establish that ionospheric ions dominate in the near earth plasma sheet but solar wind ions become significant tailward. The heavy ion content of the plasma sheet increases with both solar cycle and magnetic activity. Direct injection of ionospheric ions into the ring current has been observed in the outer plasmasphere. Several mechanisms for the direct injection of ions from the plasmasphere and ionosphere into the ring current have appeared. Estimation of ionospheric source strengths and residence times have led to an estimate of the magnetospheric densities that would result solely from an ionospheric outflow populating the magnetosphere. Estimated densities were quite reasonable even without inclusion of a solar wind source of ions. Ring current ions decay primarily via charge exchange with the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona,</b> however, the roles of pitch angle diffusion and Coulomb collisions in this decay process are being clarified. Modeling and observations of ENA by the 1 SEE 1 spacecraft has led to a re-affirmation of the dominant role of charge exchange in ring current decay. Ion cyclotron waves contribute to ring current decay in the dusk bulge region. The role of low frequency. (+ to thermal electrons are sufficient to power SAR arcs and represent an energy sink for ring current O+ within the plasmasphere. Coulomb collisions may be important for decay of low energy (< 10 KeV) ring current ions in the plasmasphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{magnetosphere}} is a 400 year old science {{that began with the}} publication by Gilbert, in 1600, of his hypotheses that the Earth was a giant magnet. Since then we have learned many things about the magnetosphere, particularly in the last 40 years of the space age, but we still have many unanswered questions. In spite of the many thousands of observations of this system we still lack a global understanding of how it works. This is due to its large size and tenuous nature that mean that any measurement made of the fields or particles involved only give one a knowledge of the local conditions at a given time. To gain a global perspective through such observations would require the simultaneous operation of thousands of satellites spread throughout the magnetospheric system in addition to observations made on the ground. Such a program would be impractical at least from financial considerations. What is needed for the advancement of magnetospheric physics is to develop the same capabilities that astrophysicists, solar physicists and meteorologists have been using for years [...] - the ability to stand back from the object under study and see it in its entirety. The challenge for doing this for the magnetosphere is that the particle densities are very low and the material is, for the most part, not luminous. In the last 25 years several ideas have been proposed that would allow at least the imaging of certain portions of the magnetosphere. These include imaging of the plasmasphere through the resonant scattering of solar 304 A from He+ ions, imaging of various hot plasma populations (i. e. the ring current, plasmasheet, upflowing ionospheric ions, etc.) from the neutral atoms that result when ions of these populations charge exchange with the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>geocorona,</b> and imaging the aurora at various wavelengths in the far ultraviolet. In addition, a novel technique for probing various boundaries in the magnetosphere by bouncing low frequency radio waves off of them has been extensively studied. Such a technique is analogous to the way the under water world can be probed with sonar. About five years ago NASA convened a science working group to study the possibility of flying a magnetospheric imaging mission. This resulted in a number of proposals for such a mission, one of which was selected to be the first MIDEX mission, to be launched in early 2000. The mission is called IMAGE (Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration) and its P. I. is J. Burch at SwRI. The IMAGE spacecraft will carry imagers to view the plasmasphere, aurora, ring current, inner plasmasheet, and upflowing ionospheric ions as well as a radio sounder to probe the location, shape and dynamics of the magnetopause, plasmapause, etc. Between its selection last April and the non advocacy mission review, which takes place next spring, the IMAGE teams needs to further refine the design of the mission and its instruments. The theory and modeling (T&M) subgroup of this team has the task of demonstrating what kind of images the instruments on IMAGE will see as well as showing that useful scientific information can be extracted from such images. As a central element to the efforts of the T&M subgroup we have decided to simulate and create synthetic images for the magnetic cloud event of October, 1995. In this event a large cloud, with high plasma densities and strong magnetic fields, ejected from the sun collided with the earth's magnetosphere triggering a three day period of intense magnetic storms and substorms. This event was observed from a number of different spacecraft and on the ground so we have a good data set to work with. In our work we will place the IMAGE spacecraft in the magnetosphere on its proposed orbit, with its proposed instruments, to see what it would see had it been there. Existing models of the plasmasphere, ring current and magnetopause will be run for this event to give the structures for the imaging instruments. There are several models which are lacking and which need to be developed. These include a model for the cusp, the inner plasmasheet and the upflowing ions. My task this summer was to develop the upflowing ion model and use it to create synthetic images...|$|E
