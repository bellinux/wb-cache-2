5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice it in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817.
