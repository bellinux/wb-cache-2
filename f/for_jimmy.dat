Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes <b>for</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

60|$|Deering hesitated. He {{was big and}} muscular, but he {{admitted}} that on the rocks Stannard was the better man. Moreover, {{to know he was}} accountable <b>for</b> <b>Jimmy's</b> plunge had shaken him, and he saw Stannard was very cool.|$|R

5|$|The Quadrophenia {{film was}} {{released}} that year. It {{was directed by}} Franc Roddam in his feature-directing début, and had straightforward acting rather than musical numbers as in Tommy. John Lydon was considered <b>for</b> <b>Jimmy,</b> but the role went to Phil Daniels. Sting played Jimmy's friend and fellow mod, the Ace Face. The soundtrack was Jones' first appearance on a Who record, performing on newly written material not on the original album. The film was a critical and box office success in the UK and appealed to the growing mod revival movement.

25|$|Virginia has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} more Republican Southern states, for instance it was the only Southern state not to vote <b>for</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Carter in 1976, its congressional delegation is mostly conservative, with eight of eleven Congressmen and both Senators belonging to the Republican Party prior to the 2006 election, this made Virginia's Congressional delegation the most Republican of any Southern state.

The state's political majority has been changing from conservative white to a mixture of races, especially Hispanic.
