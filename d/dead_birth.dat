Thanks to financial statements, which were available in Písek, is in the master thesis calculated, in which years were unions losing and profiting. Registers of <b>dead,</b> <b>birth</b> and marriage would be checked for the informations in every single year. In a registr of birth were checked months, when were kids born or number of twins. In a register of dead were checked genders and their marital status. In a register of married people were checked grooms, grooms fathers, father of brides and grooms and brides witnesses. The theoretical part deals with the history of the village Lašovice, then deals with credit unions in the Czech countries. There are also demographic indicators, such as birth rate, marriages a dead rate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Objective: {{to assess}} {{some aspects of}} {{expressed}} maternal (pregnant women) satisfaction and perception of care provided at 10 primary health care centers within the Primary Health Care. Methodology: The study covered a sample of 50 pregnant women attending for maternal health care. From May 10 th to August 30 th each individual in the sample was interviewed using a specific questionnaire form. The results indicated that most of women attending Prenatal care are good perception with care provided, the level of satisfaction was mostly of pregnant women is satisfied with care services. The study indicates no correlation relationship between overall satisfaction and their demographic characteristic expect the number <b>dead</b> <b>birth</b> with p-value (0. 025). Conclusion: the most of women pregnant no opportunity for better education and most of pregnant women were satisfied with all care aspect. Recommendation: to further studies should be conducted to involve a larger geographical area. The Ministry of Health should apply continuing education courses for staffs ' worker in primary health care centers to increase their knowledge about {{maternal and child health}} care services...|$|E

The comparison of rigid and flexible foundation on the behaviour of the dam was discussed. In the finite element modeling the concrete slab on the upstream was represented through six-noded element, while the interface characteristic between dam body and concrete slab was modeled using interface element. The maximum settlement and stresses of the cross section was founded {{and the distribution of}} them were discussed and tabulated in form of graphs and contours. The effect of reservoir filling loading have gradual effect to the dam response behavior. The computed results by the present method were found to be in good agreement with the comparison of value to the existing dams in the world...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was, to show {{relations}} between various metabolic parameters and the occurrence of inflammatory diseases of the uterus in dairy cows. Additionally, we wanted to find limiting values that show an increased risk of disease if they were exceeded or fallen short of. In eight dairy herds 124 cows and heifers were examined weekly from week 2 before calving to week 5 postpartum. Metabolic parameters in blood as total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transferase, glutamate dehydrogenase and β-hydroxy butyric acid were examined once weekly from week 2 before to week 2 after parturition. Parameters in milk such as fat, lactose, fat-/lactose-quotient, protein, fat-/protein-quotient and urea were examined or calculated in week 1 and 2 postpartum in cisternal and residual milk, body condition was determined with body condition scoring on every date of examination. Gynaecologic examinations were conducted in week 2, 4 and 5 postpartum. Furthermore, additional data as milk yield, calving interval, <b>dead</b> <b>births,</b> problems at parturition, as well as the time from parturition to first insemination and calving to conception interval, was documented. For the evaluation of the data, cows were divided into two groups. Cows, that suffered from puerperal metritis, clinical metritis, clinical endometritis or pyometra were assigned to the group “ill”. Cows, that didn’t suffer from any uterine disease on one of the dates of examination, were assigned to the group “healthy”. If there were significant differences in parameters between groups, we formed limiting values for these parameters. The exceeding or deceeding of these limiting values showed a higher risk of disease. Probably the energy deficit, which is reflected in the change of metabolic parameters, is most likely responsible for an impairment of the immune system and thereby for the higher risk of suffering uterine disease...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} novel factors that mediate skeletal muscle development or function. We began the study by searching the gene expression databases for genes that have no known functions but are preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle. This search led to the identification of the Src homology three (SH 3) domain and cysteine rich (C 1) domain 3 (Stac 3) gene. We experimentally confirmed that Stac 3 mRNA was predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. We determined if Stac 3 plays a role in skeletal muscle development or function by generating Stac 3 knockout mice. All Stac 3 homozygous mutant mice were found <b>dead</b> at <b>birth,</b> were never seen move, and had a curved body and dropping forelimbs. These mice had marked abnormalities in skeletal muscles throughout the body, including central location of myonuclei, decreased number but increased cross-sectional area of myofibers, decreased number and size of myofibrils, disarrayed myofibrils, and streaming Z-lines. These phenotypes demonstrate that the Stac 3 gene plays a critical role in skeletal muscle development and function in mice...|$|R
