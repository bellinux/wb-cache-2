5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his {{experience}} in World War I, Kenney <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> respect for Japanese fighters. He decided to conserve his bombers, and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided. SWPA had a low priority, and simply {{could not afford to}} replace losses from costly daylight missions. What he needed was an effective long-range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill, but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems. Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.|$|E

5|$|After Diocletian's {{reform of}} the provinces, {{governors}} were called iudex, or judge. The governor became responsible for his decisions first to his immediate superiors, {{as well as to}} the more distant office of the emperor. It was most likely at this time that judicial records became verbatim accounts of what was said in trial, making it easier to determine bias or improper conduct on the part of the governor. With these records and the Empire's universal right of appeal, Imperial authorities probably <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> power to enforce behavior standards for their judges. In spite of Diocletian's attempts at reform, the provincial restructuring was far from clear, especially when citizens appealed the decisions of their governors. Proconsuls, for example, were often both judges of first instance and appeal, and the governors of some provinces took appellant cases from their neighbors. It soon became impossible to avoid taking some cases to the emperor for arbitration and judgment. Diocletian's reign marks the end of the classical period of Roman law. Where Diocletian's system of rescripts shows an adherence to classical tradition, Constantine's law is full of Greek and eastern influences.|$|E
5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to {{the figure of a}} former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of the}} cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but was a handsome, sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge of the results of the experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and it is he who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not have enough time to work them into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E

Terry Lenzner, who was the chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, speculates that it was Nixon's desire to know what O'Brien knew about Nixon's dealings with Hughes that may have partially motivated the Watergate break-in.|$|E

Women were also given a prominent place in the Ishinpō, with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act.

25|$|The 12.7cm/50 Type 3 naval gun was {{a medium}} calibre naval gun of the Imperial Japanese Navy used during World War II. It was the {{standard}} weapon for Japanese destroyers between 1928 and 1944 (except Akizuki and Matsu classes). It has been credited {{as a true}} dual-purpose gun, but this was more a nominal capability than real as its bag propellant and need for hand ramming required the gun to be loaded at angles between 5–10° which dropped its rate of fire to a relatively slow 5–10 rounds per minute and its training speed of only 6° per second meant that it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> difficulty engaging enemy aircraft with any chance of success. After the end of World War II the gun remained in service on the two Japanese destroyers ceded to the Soviet Union and the Republic of China as war reparations.|$|E
25|$|Houston had no labor {{relations}} experience {{prior to his}} service on the NRLB. For the first several years of his first five-year term on the board, Houston relied heavily on his legal staff for advice. United States Department of Labor solicitor general Gerard D.

Reilly also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> influence on Houston during Houston's first few years in office. But as Houston gained experience, he forged an alliance with the NLRB's moderate chairman, Harry Millis, who was a firm believer in collective bargaining and labor unions. In his second five-year term on the NLRB, Houston became the most consistently pro-labor member of the board. Reilly came to believe that NLRB Chief Trial Examiner Frank Bloom (a left-wing lawyer) heavily influenced Houston in these later years.|$|E

25|$|The best-known {{version of}} the grand-ducal coat of arms is found on the tomb of Gustavus I (1523–60) in the Uppsala cathedral (Figure 5). It has been {{suggested}} that either Duke John himself, or his brother Eric XIV, was leading the design work on the heraldic signs on the tomb. Neither statement can be confirmed, but it is known that Eric XIV showed an interest in heraldry. The monument was commissioned from Guillaume Boyen (Willem Boy), a Flemish architect and sculptor who had worked in Sweden. He started on the task in Antwerp in 1562, completing it 10 years later; however, the tomb was not in place in Uppsala until the early 1580s, and the finishing work lasted until 1591. In addition to the royal arms of Sweden and those of Finland, the arms of the 11 provinces are depicted. From Finland they include North and South Finland, as well as Tavastia and Karelia. The work of Willem Boy is of exceptional quality, which is perhaps {{explained by the fact that}} lions were a dominant feature in the heraldry of Flanders, and he would therefore have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> exposure to it before receiving the commission for the tomb of Gustavus I.|$|E
25|$|Alex Koslov put his {{recently}} won AAA Cruiserweight Championship {{on the line}} in the third PPV match of the night as he wrestled against Extreme Tiger, Crazy Boy and Alan Stone in a Elimination hardcore match. The match saw the frequent use of both tables and ladders throughout the match, mixed in with steel chairs for good measure. Koslov's reign as the first AAA Cruiserweight champion ended after just over two weeks as he was the first man eliminated from the match, pinned by Alan Stone. With Koslov eliminated it was a guarantee {{that there would be a}} new champion by the end of the match. Alan Stone's inexperience in Hardcore matches caused him to be eliminated secondly, leaving Crazy Boy and Extreme Tiger, both of whom <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> experience with hardcore matches. The final section of the match had several slow sections where one wrestler set up a table, a ladder or an elaborate chair set up while the other wrestler had to lay on the mat and pretend to be knocked down. At one point Crazy Boy very obviously pushed himself into position so that Extreme Tiger could execute a leap off the top rope onto him. In the final moments of the match saw Extreme Tiger leap out of the ring and splash Crazy Boy through a table. After taking a moment to recover Extreme Tiger was able to get back in the ring, only seconds before the referee counted Crazy Boy out. With the count out victory Extreme Tiger was declared the new AAA Cruiserweight champion.|$|E
