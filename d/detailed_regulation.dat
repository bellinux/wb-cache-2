60|$|I {{suggest this}} {{body as a}} sort of {{concrete}} sample of the thing I have in mind. I am quite open to hear and accept the most far-reaching modification of this scheme; it is the idea of the scale that I wish particularly to enforce. Municipalize on this scale, I would say, and I am with you altogether. Here is something distinctly and clearly subserving that making of mankind upon which all sane social and political proposals must ultimately base themselves. But to put more power, and still more {{power in the hands of}} these petty little administrative bodies that we have to-day, is, I submit, folly and darkness. If the existing areas are to remain the same, then, on the whole, my vote is against municipal trading, and on the whole, with regard to light, to tramways and communications, to telephones, and indeed to nearly all such public services, I would prefer to see these things in the hands of companies, and I would stipulate only for the maximum publicity for their accounts and the fullest provision for <b>detailed</b> <b>regulation</b> through the Board of Trade.|$|E

50|$|The Staggers Act was one {{of three}} major {{deregulation}} laws passed by Congress in a two-year period, as the cumulative result of efforts to reform transport regulation begun in 1971, during the Richard Nixon Administration.

5000|$|... 122... Canada’s {{problem is}} that the {{proposed}} Act reflects an attempt that goes well beyond these matters of undoubted national interest and concern and reaches down into the <b>detailed</b> <b>regulation</b> of all aspects of securities. In this respect, the proposed Act is unlike federal competition legislation, which has been held to fall under s. 91(2) of the Constitution Act, 1867. It would regulate all aspects of contracts for securities within the provinces, including all aspects of public protection and professional competence within the provinces. Competition law, by contrast, regulates only anti-competitive contracts and conduct — a particular aspect of economic activity that falls squarely within the federal domain. In short, the proposed federal Act overreaches the legislative interest of the federal government.|$|E
50|$|The Act of 1880 had clear {{objectives}} for {{the running of}} savings banks. At the same time, a number of its areas lacked precision in the newly introduced regulation. However, this lack of precision facilitated the growth and development of savings banks in Spain. In particular, freedom (i.e., lack of <b>detailed</b> <b>regulation)</b> regarding investment policies created diversification and growth of assets at a greater rate than counterparts elsewhere in Europe. From the time the Act of 1880 was published {{until the end of}} the 19th century, the number of entities doubled from 26 in 1880 to 66 in 1905, while the sum of cash and assets held as deposit increased by four percent from 12 per cent of total savings in Spain in 1880 to 16 percent in 1905.|$|E
