40|$|Management {{factors like}} {{the type of}} {{defoliation}} and seed mixture influence yield and forage quality of grass clover mixtures. In comparison to harvesting, grazing is less cost intensive. For economical reasons a maximum duration of grazing period is required. Grazing over winter can cause pasture damages.

This study compares different grass clover mixtures concerning yield, forage quality and suitability for winter grazing. With this background, tall fescue exerted more {{significant effect on the}} dry matter yield than perennial ryegrass. White clover showed significant superiority over all the other tested species, with regard to protein and energy contents. Otherwise, swards with red clover and alfalfa had a significantly higher legume contents and produced higher dry matter and N yields than the other swards.

40|$|When grass {{species are}} used to reseed {{depleted}} drylands, grazing is often prescribed during the establishment phase. Total protection from grazing often leads {{to the presence of}} persistent weed species and is hard to accept by land users keen to graze reseeded land as soon as possible. The particular case of reseeding arid Mediterranean cereal fallows with one native grass species, Stipa lagascae (Stipa), in Tunisia was tested. Seedlings, derived from two different seed sources (selected and bulk), and volunteer annual weed species underwent four different cutting treatments to ground level (early cut, late cut, early and late cuts and no cuts). No effect of any of the treatments on seedling survival or dry matter mass of Stipa seedlings was found.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were carried out from 1988 to 1990 at Thirlstane in NorthWestern Tasmania to determine the suitability of modern high yielding winter barley cultivars for dual purpose (winter grazing plus grain) management. The barley cultivar Ulandra (WU 3076) {{was used in the}} experiments. It has a prostrate growth habit and late flowering, characters which should make it suitable for use as a dualpurpose crop where growing points need to be protected during grazing. In the first experiment sown in late April 1988, four grazing treatments were used, (i) control, no grazing, (ii) <b>early</b> <b>grazing</b> (as soon as a reasonable amount of forage was available), (iii) late grazing Gust prior to the shoot apex reaching grazing height), (iv) early and late grazing (a combination of grazing treatments (ii) and (iii)). The grazing was carried out using Angus cattle to defoliate the crop as quickly as possible. In addition, small areas of each plot were mechanically defoliated, to assess whether cutting can simulate the effects of grazing. Immediately following the completion of the second grazing all treatments were split for nitrogen application of 0 or 50 kg N/ ha, to determine its effects in assisting recovery following grazing. The least amount of dry matter was removed by the <b>early</b> <b>grazing</b> and the most by the single late grazing. Nitrogen compensated for the loss of dry matter following <b>early</b> <b>grazing,</b> in that maximum dry matter and grain yield were brought up to the level. of the nil N control. Nitrogen had no effect on late or twice grazed treatments, where maximum dry matter and final grain yield were greatly reduced. Grazing reduced final plant height by 15 - 20 cm. As the control treatment lodged, particularly with N application, the reduction in plant height could be considered to be an advantage. Cutting resulted in lower grain yields than grazing due to the greater severity of its effects on the growing crop. In 1989 the experiment was repeated for a range of sowing times, late March, early April and late April. Wet weather in winter caused some problems with waterlogging, and as a consequence growth was reduced on all treatments. The late March sowing was the most affected as the worst of the water logging occurred at the time of grazing. The late April sowing was grazed in late August-early September during drier conditions and was therefore better able to recover from the effects of grazing. The early April sowing produced the largest amount of forage for all grazing treatments. The late March and early April sowings grew rapidly in late autumn and early spring before the onset of the colder weather and produced more leaf area than the late April sowing, although none of the leaf areas were as high as might normally be expected. The late April sowing grew slowly up {{to the beginning of the}} warmer weather in early spring and whilst leaf area was always smaller than the other sowings, the crop appeared better able to utilise it in terms of final grain yield. well below the potential that has been shown for barley in previous years under Tasmanian conditions. All treatments in the late March sowing produced poor yields. The early and late April sowings produced similar yields for the control and the <b>early</b> <b>grazing.</b> In the early Aµril sowing the effects of late grazing reduced the grain yields more than in the late April sowing. Harvest index increased with both later sowing and heavier grazing. Numbers of ears and grains per ear were decreased by grazing but increased by later sowing date. Nitrogen assisted in recovery following grazing with higher grain yields for all treatments. It increased the number of ears, possibly due to increased tiller survival. Nitrogen fully compensated for the effects of grazing on the early grazed treatments. The grazing experiment was again repeated in 1990 using the early and late April sowing dates. Whilst growth and yield were better, the overall trends between treatments were similar to the two previous seasons. Nitrogen again assisted in crop recovery following grazing. The results therefore showed that, with careful management, grain yield could still be satisfactory for crops grazed early, provided that conditions were not too wet during grazing and recovery was aided by adequate nitrogen nutrition. Sowing time appeared to be less critical than timing of grazing, which should be in relation to apex position and stage of development as well as when ground conditions are suitable. Late grazing, or grazing twice, generally had a severe affect on recovery for grain yield, due to removal of the potentially most productive growing points as well as leaf area, and could only be recommended if winter forage was of greater value to a farmer than final grain yield. Cutting, which tends to remove more leaf at the same defoliation height as grazing, is not an accurate method of predicting grain yields. However, it can be useful in predicting overall trends...|$|E

The results revealed that there is an inverse relationship between the grazing intensity and amount of carbon, nitrogen, soil organic matter and EC. However, a direct relation exists between the grazing intensity and amount of soil potassium, phosphorus, pH and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen. Vegetation in class 1 and 2 which were cereals and forbs had greatest percentage in the reference area. Furthermore, the percentage forage cover increases with the grazing intensity.

Overall annual fertilizer N use on the farms decreased during the study period (266 to 223 kg/ha, s. e. 6. 5; P < 0. 001) mainly due to lower inputs for the first application in spring and for the production of first-cut silage. These decreases were partly offset by applying more slurry in spring for <b>early</b> <b>grazing</b> and for first-cut silage.

A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 13 dairy farms (578 cows) in western France in spring 2012. In each herd, lactating cows of the treatment group received fenbendazole orally, control cows remained untreated. Daily cow MP was recorded from 2 weeks before until 15 weeks after treatment. Individual serum pepsinogen and anti-Ostertagia antibody levels (expressed as ODR), faecal egg count and bulk tank milk (BTM) Ostertagia ODR were measured at treatment time. Anthelmintic treatment applied during the previous housing period was recorded for each cow. In each herd, information regarding heifers' grazing and anthelmintic treatment history was collected to assess the Time of Effective Contact (TEC, in months) with GIN infective larvae before the first calving. The effect of treatment on weekly MP averages and its relationships with herd and individual indicators were studied using linear mixed models with two nested random effects (cow within herd). Unexpectedly, spring treatment had a significant detrimental effect on MP (- 0. 92 kg/cow/day on average).

It was <b>grazed</b> <b>early</b> on {{in the history of}} Adelaide's white settlement, and has since retained a cover of grass, with few trees or shrubs, thus appearing brown in summer, and green in winter.|$|R
40|$|Data on {{phytoplankton}} and zooplankton biomass, {{and physical}} and chemical variables, are combined with a published multivariate description of diatom species composition to interpret variation within an area around South Georgia surveyed during an austral summer. Large-scale species distributions could be equated to the different water masses which reflected {{the interaction of the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current with the island and the Scotia Ridge. Small-scale factors were found to act at an interstation scale and imposed local variation on the biogeographic pattern. Nutrient depletion could be related to phytoplankton biomass but no single inorganic nutrient of those measured (NO 3 −N, PO 4 −P and silica) could be identified as important. The ratio Si:P appeared to be more important as an ecological factor. The impact of grazing by krill and other zooplankton could only be resolved as differences in phytoplankton biomass and phaeopigment content. Diatom species composition showed a relation to local krill abundance very different from that suggested by published studies, but could be explained as the effect of <b>earlier</b> <b>grazing</b> outside the study area. The effects of vertical mixing could not account for interstation differences as pycnocline depth was uniformly greater than euphotic depth, and vertical stability very low. Some comparison was made with data collected in 1926 – 31 by the Discovery Investigations. Significant differences in the distribution of certain taxa such as Chaetoceros criophilum and C. socialis were traced to major differences in hydrology...|$|R
