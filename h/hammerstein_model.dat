50|$|Because of the {{problems}} of identifying Volterra models other model forms were investigated as a basis for system identification for nonlinear systems. Various forms of block structured nonlinear models have been introduced or re-introduced. The <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model</b> consists of a static single valued nonlinear element followed by a linear dynamic element. The Wiener model is the reverse of this combination so that the linear element occurs before the static nonlinear characteristic. The Wiener-Hammerstein model consists of a static linear element sandwiched between two dynamic systems, and several other model forms are available. All these models can be represented by a Volterra series but in this case the Volterra kernels take on a special form in each case. Identification consists of correlation based and parameter estimation methods. The correlation methods exploit certain properties of these systems, which means that if specific inputs are used, often white Gaussian noise, the individual elements can be identified one at a time. This results in manageable data requirements and the individual blocks can sometimes be related to components in the system under study.|$|E

This study presents a new modeling of an IPA system using <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model</b> based Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm. The <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model</b> is one of the blocks structured nonlinear models often used to model a nonlinear system and it consists of a static nonlinear block followed by a linear block of dynamic element.

The goal of this thesis is to investigate the performance of one such <b>model,</b> the <b>Hammerstein</b> cascade, in describing isometric muscle force. We examine the effectiveness of <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>models</b> in predicting the isometric recruitment curve and dynamics of a muscle stimulated at fourteen frequencies between 1 to 100 Hz. Explanted frog plantaris longus muscle is tested at the nominal isometric length only; hence, the muscle's force-length and force-velocity dependences are neither assumed nor ascertained. The pilot data are fitted using ten different models consisting of various combinations of linear dynamics with polynomial nonlinearities. Models identified using data with input stimulation frequencies of 20 Hz and lower generate an average RMS error of 12 % and are reliably stable (87 of 90 simulations). Between 25 to 40 Hz, the average error generated by the estimated models is 10 %, but the estimated dynamics are less stable (16 of 30 simulations). Above 40 Hz, linear and <b>Hammerstein</b> nonlinear <b>models</b> fail to consistently generate stable dynamic estimates (11 of 30 simulations), and errors are large (eRMs = 44 %). (cont.) Simulations also suggest <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>models</b> found iteratively do not perform much better than linear dynamic systems (in general, eRMS = 10 to 15 %). In addition, simulations using iterated nonlinearities generate RMS errors that are comparable to those simulations using a fixed nonlinearity (both about 16 %). These preliminary results warrant further investigation into the limits of <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>models</b> found iteratively {{in the identification of}} isometric muscle dynamics. by Danielle S.
