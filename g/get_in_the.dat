5|$|To {{give the}} series its own {{distinctive}} musical identity, according to Djawadi, the producers asked {{him not to}} use musical elements such as flutes or solo vocals {{that had already been}} successfully used by other major fantasy productions. He mentioned that a challenge in scoring the series was its reliance on dialogue and its sprawling cast: on several occasions already-scored music had to be omitted so as not to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of dialogue.|$|E
5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
5|$|As the Flames sank in the standings, their {{attendance}} also sagged. For most {{of their}} first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHL. However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum: buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City in leaving for the United States. The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the 1999–2000 season. The Flames issued another appeal for more season tickets {{in the summer of}} 2000. The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful. The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5million between 2001 and 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1801, the {{population}} of Wales was 587 thousand, {{and most of these}} would have been living in rural areas and employed in agriculture. By 1911, {{the population}} had swelled to 2.4 million, more than half of whom lived in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, where they were employed in mining, steel and other industries. There was a shift away from the land with many dwellers in the rural west emigrating in the 1830s and 1840s and migrating to the cities {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. By 1911, agriculture was a minor industry in Glamorgan, and migrant labour from England was needed to help <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harvest. Rural craftsmen were also lost and their supply was replenished from depressed areas of southwestern England and by mass immigration from Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In {{professional}} wrestling, some wrestlers use {{the soccer}} kick is as a finishing move. A number of professional wrestlers {{prior to the}} 1980s professional wrestling boom were taught to use wrestling moves and strikes legitimately. This {{was due to the}} likelihood of attacks on the wrestlers from fans. This included the soccer kick, which former pro-wrestler, CM Punk stated was the easiest tactic to use when a fan tried to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring to confront a wrestler. High profile users of soccer kicks as a finishing move includes Katsuyori Shibata, and Randy Orton. In Japan within a 1977 puroresu match between Antonio Inoki and Great Antonio, Inoki started to shoot on Great Antonio after Great Antonio refused to sell Inoki's offence. Inoki used a takedown on Great Antonio and then used soccer kicks and head stomps to legitimately knock out Great Antonio.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E

In the ring, Benjamin body slammed White, which was followed by a running forearm. White retaliated with a dropkick to Benjamin's knee. The match concluded after White grabbed a golf club that he hid in the steel steps and tried to assault Benjamin with it.

5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car and leave Andy outside, then tell him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns to the office and confronts his co-workers; there is a long, awkward silence, and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas and ruin the tension. During filming, it was changed so Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not work very well and cut it, but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the flatulence, while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Nico Rosberg {{got away}} well, fending off {{an attack by}} {{teammate}} Hamilton into the first corner. Behind them, Vettel had a bad getaway that saw him <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of the Red Bull cars. In turn 5, he touched Daniel Ricciardo's car, suffering a puncture that forced him into the pit lane {{at the end of}} the first lap. While he was able to get back out, Fernando Alonso ended his race after just one lap due to a loss of power. Therefore, the order after the first lap stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Kvyat and Ricciardo. The two Mercedes cars of Rosberg and Hamilton soon opened a gap on the Red Bull cars of Kvyat and Ricciardo, exchanging fastest laps in the process, while Felipe Massa and Max Verstappen got entangled in a fight for sixth place. Kimi Räikkönen, who was told early on to cool his brakes, made good progress up the field and was in 13th position by lap 8. One lap later, Valtteri Bottas became the first of the front runners to pit, putting on the medium compound, followed just a lap later by teammate Massa. While Räikkönen had moved up to eighth place by lap 12, Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz Jr. got into a fight for sixth place, with Pérez being asked by his team to stay out as long as possible.|$|E

Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes).
