40|$|Fresnel zone {{plates are}} diffractive {{elements}} that are essential to <b>form</b> <b>images</b> in many scientific and technological areas, especially where refractive optics is not available. One of the main shortcomings of Fresnel zone plates, which limit their utility with broadband sources, is their high chromatic aberration. Recently presented, Fractal Zone Plates (FZPs) are diffractive lenses characterized by an extended focal depth with a fractal structure. This behaviour predicts an improved performance of FZPs as <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> <b>devices</b> with an extended depth of field and a reduced chromatic aberration. Here we report {{the achievement of the}} first polychromatic images obtained with a FZP that confirm these predictions. We show that the polychromatic modulation transfer function (MTF) of a FZP affected by defocus is about two times better than one corresponding to a Fresnel zone plate. This result opens the possibility to improve imaging techniques that use conventional Fresnel zone plates over a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from x-rays to THz.

40|$|KEY WORDS: X-ray microscopy, {{chromatic}} aberration, {{depth of}} field, zone plates Fresnel zone plates are diffractive {{elements that are}} essential to <b>form</b> <b>images</b> in X-ray micros-copy[1, 2]. One of the main shortcomings of Fresnel zone plates their high chromatic aberra-tion. Recently presented, Fractal Zone Plates (FZPs) [3] are diffractive lenses characterized by a fractal focal structure with an extended focal depth, as compared with Fresnel lenses. This behaviour predicts an improved performance of FZPs as <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> <b>devices</b> with an ex-tended depth of field and a reduced chromatic aberration. Here we examine the incoherent imaging characteristics of these elements using polychromatic light in the visible range. The performance of FZPs is cotrasted with conventional Fresnel zone plates of the same focal dis-tances. We have demonstrated experimentally that the FZP provides an extended depth of field and a reduction of chromatic aberration. This finding is confirmed objectively using the modulation transfer function as a merit function. We show that the polychromatic modulation transfer function (MTF) of a FZP affected by defocus is about two times better than one corresponding to a Fresnel zone plate...|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} {{factors that affect}} the {{performance}} of the clustering system. One is the accuracy of the fingerprints extracted from <b>images.</b> Various <b>forms</b> of <b>device</b> fingerprints such as sensor pattern noise (SPN) [1 – 12], camera response function [13], re-sampling artifacts [14], color filter array (CFA) interpolation artifacts [15, 16], JPEG compression [17], and lens aberration [12, 18] have been proposed in recent years. Other device and image attributes such as binary similarity measures, image quality measures, and higher order wavelet statistics have also been adopted for identifying source imaging devices [19 – 22]. While many methods [13 – 16] make specific assumptions in their applications, SPN-based methods [1 – 12] do not require such assumptions to be satisfied and thus have drawn much more attention. Another merit of SPN is that it is unique to each device, which means it is capable of differentiating individual devices of the same model [1, 3, 5, 11]. These merits make SPN a good candidate for various digital forensic applications.|$|R

Using of image approach to foreign territory management practice is already producing positive effects, {{but there are some}} difficulties in Russia, particularly in the Far East. Authors explore scientific publications in a foreign press, describing various marketing techniques used to territorial <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> in foreign countries. The territorial image is its image {{from the point of view}} of different public groups. Favorable territorial image is a powerful way of working with mass consciousness. Territorial <b>image</b> can be <b>formed</b> by various marketing techniques. This article presents the results of a preliminary study of scientific publications of materials in the past three years, selected for content analysis in foreign databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. This study was conducted by a traditional analysis of documents. Its aim was the selection of publications describing the use different marketing techniques of territorial <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> in foreign countries and their grouping according to the technology used and the time period. The analysis has revealed the relationship between using individual technologies of territorial <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> and territorial life cycle stages.

40|$|We show that, {{when the}} <b>images</b> <b>formed,</b> the frontal {{part of the}} Shroud of Turin laid on a body in the same {{position}} as when the blood stains formed by contact. In other words, after the Shroud was laid on top of a body, no forceful flattening occurred before the <b>images</b> <b>formed.</b> Moreover, the argument that {{the top half of the}} Shroud could not have been draping a real body when the <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> – to avoid prominent image distortions – is shown to be incorrect. If a cloth is appropriately laid on the front part of a body, and a body <b>image</b> <b>forms</b> by a vertical projection on the cloth, no major image distortions occur. Small image distortions are to be expected, and indeed we can observe some on the Shroud. These two aspects – the Shroud was not forcefully flattened before the <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> and no major image distortions occur due to the way the Shroud was laid on the body – give the simplest scenario for the formation of the images. There is no need to claim a special event that would have flattened the Shroud before the <b>images</b> <b>formed.</b> Our analysis is based on precise length measurements on digital images, the blood stain locations, and geometry.

40|$|<b>Images</b> <b>formed</b> by {{acquisition}} <b>devices</b> {{are usually}} corrupted by noise and other interferences. Hence, regularization meth-ods {{have been introduced}} to restore the degraded images and obtain solutions that are stable {{in the presence of}} per-turbations. While the regularization parameter is crucial to the characteristics of the restoration, most existing selection methods either require memory-intensive computation or prior knowledge of the noise [1]. Moreover, the use of a small regularization parameter will produce a restoration that is dom-inated by large, high frequency noise components, whereas large regularization parameter imposes greater importance on the regularizer, causing important information to be lost. Therefore, we investigate and present a contrast measure-based method for automated selection of regularization parameter that will produce a balanced choice. In the proposed method, empirical observations show that the highest peak in the absolute derivative of the contrast measure tends to correlate directly with the optimum regu-larization parameter for any norm value. The effectiveness of the proposed method is then evaluated on Synthetic Aperture Radar images of the T 72, BTR 70 and BMP 2 military vehicles provided by the MSTAR database [2] against the Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) method. Fig. 1 shows the results for norm values less than 1. It is clear that the proposed method perform better than the GCV method; it enhances the main body and the edges of the object. This is consistent with observations by Cetin and Karl [3] that the regularizer, when used with norm values {{less than or equal to}} 1, enhances point-based features and improves the resolvability of objects. For norm values greater than 1, shown in Fig. 2, although the proposed method sometimes chooses a smaller parameter value than the GCV method, the parameter choices are quite reasonable to allow for object identification. In conclusion, the proposed method provides similar perfor-mance to the GCV method, but with the advantage that it is computationally less intensive and is also independent of prior knowledge of the noise...|$|R
