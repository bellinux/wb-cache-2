5|$|Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) is {{appointed}} {{as the new}} coach of McKinley High's failing football team, resulting in reductions to the glee and cheerleading budgets {{in favor of the}} football team. Will and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) team up, hoping to drive Beiste out of the school and have their budgets restored. Amidst her scheming with Will, Sue also demotes Santana (Naya Rivera) from her position as head cheerleader after learning she has had breast implants, replacing her with Quinn (Dianna Agron). Artie asks Finn to help him join the football team. He hopes to win back his girlfriend Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz), who has broken up with him to date Mike. Beiste believes that Finn is colluding against her by forcing her to reject a wheelchair-dependent student, and drops Finn from the team, appointing Sam as the new quarterback. Will is unable to convince her to take Finn back, but realizes that his hostile behavior <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> his new colleague. Later, he defends Beiste from a Sue-driven sexual harassment accusation by Brittany (Heather Morris), and apologizes, re-earning Sue's enmity.|$|E
25|$|Much of the state's {{ecological}} woes {{stem from}} the housing explosion, which is mostly centered {{in the capital of}} Cuernavaca, but it is a problem in places such as Cuautla as well. Groups such as the Frente de Pueblos en Defensa de la Tierra y el Agua and Guardianes de los Àrboles have criticized the government for allowing city areas to grow with insufficient planning and control. They also claim that it <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> much of the state's ecosystem and water supply.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2006 Gallup poll, 84% {{of investors}} believe that illegal {{immigrants}} mostly take low paying jobs that Americans do not want. However, nearly 62% of investors say illegal immigration <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> the investment climate. 68% of investors say that illegal immigrants cost taxpayers too much because they use government services like {{public education and}} medical services, while 25% {{say that in the}} long run, illegal immigrants become productive citizens who come to make up paying their fair share of taxes. About 80% thought that the government should do more to curb illegal immigration.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, {{implemented}} a grade deflation policy {{to curb the}} number of A-range grades undergraduates received. Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as {{a larger percentage of}} the student body received them. While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school. Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally, but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades, Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison. Further, studies have shown that employers prefer high grades even when they are inflated. The policy remained in place even after Malkiel stepped {{down at the end of}} the 2010–2011 academic term. The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.|$|E
500|$|When {{the news}} of the {{imminent}} death sentence arrives, Zeenat is compelled to tell the truth to Meera. Meera is shocked beyond belief to hear Zeenat's words. The fact that her friendship was based on false pretenses is what hurts her more. She immediately refuses to sign the maafinama (statement of forgiveness). She makes it clear that she wants to hurt her husband's murderer, even if it was an accident, because of how much she <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> in her new, veiled life. She leaves for the haveli. Zeenat, initially, is deeply hurt from Meera's decision but eventually accepts it as fate and decides to leave for her hometown. Meera later has a change of heart, perhaps because of her disillusionment at Randhir's willingness to [...] "sell" [...] her to Chopra. She gets encouragement from her paternal grandmother and hurries towards the railway station, where she meets Zeenat and gives her the signed statement of forgiveness. Zeenat extends her hand from the train and Meera grabs it and climbs aboard, presumably running away from the only life she has ever known, as the train speeds up into the distance.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{maintaining}} {{a place in the}} promotion places {{during the first half of}} the season and his [...] "stabling influence" [...] on the club, chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn offered McCall a new contract in January 2009. Later in the month, Lawn gave further backing to McCall, who was coming under pressure from the club's fans following a run of one win in nine games; during the run McCall was also charged by The Football Association for the first time of his managerial career after he had contested a refereeing decision during a game with Luton Town. McCall signed a new contract in February, which extended his deal by another two years and would have kept him at the club until 2011. He set himself the goal of earning two promotions to put City in the Championship. However, less than a month later, McCall offered to resign if they did not reach the play-offs after his side lost 4–1 to Bournemouth – their fifth consecutive away defeat. [...] "Nobody <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> more than me but it's as simple as that, if we miss out I don't deserve to be here," [...] he said. City eventually missed out on promotion, but McCall decided to stay on as manager and took a voluntary pay cut in the process because of the club's budget being reduced.|$|E

January 2011, Tom Delay was convicted of money {{laundering}} and sentenced {{to three years in}} prison but was freed on bail while appealing his conviction. His comments in 2005 made Shays the first Republican to say DeLay should step down from the Majority Leader post. He fought to maintain the Republican Party rule that requires an indicted leader to step down — the rule that ultimately resulted in Tom DeLay's resignation. Shays stated that he should resign, saying, [...] "Tom's conduct <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> the Republican Party, <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> this Republican majority and it <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> any Republican who is up for re-election." ...|$|E

2500|$|Their last Paramount film, Duck Soup (1933), {{directed}} by the highly regarded Leo McCarey, is the highest rated of the five Marx Brothers films on the American Film Institute's [...] "100 years ... 100 Movies" [...] list. It did not do as well financially as Horse Feathers, but was the sixth-highest grosser of 1933. The film sparked a dispute between the Marxes and the village of Fredonia, New York. [...] "Freedonia" [...] {{was the name of}} a fictional country in the script, and the city fathers wrote to Paramount and asked the studio to remove all references to Freedonia because [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> our town's image".

The ban was lifted in October 2010, a move considered a pivotal point in Angelle's political career.|$|E
2500|$|Blackman is {{a rarity}} {{as a female}} jazz percussionist. [...] "In the past, {{there were a lot}} of stigmas {{attached}} to women playing certain instruments", Blackman says. [...] "I think a lot of women stick to particular instruments, like piano, that are acceptable, so that lessens the playing field in terms of how many women are out there. And let's face it, boys' clubs still exist. But I care nothing about that at all. I'm going to do what I'm going to do musically anyway." [...] However Blackman draws on the role models of her mother who played violin in an orchestra and her grandmother who was a classical pianist and does not let stereotypes deter her. [...] "God forbid I should be limited to only play my drums in my basement; but if that's all I had, that's what I would do", says Blackman. [...] "Any woman, or anyone facing race prejudice, weight prejudice, hair prejudice ... if you let somebody stop you because of their opinions, then the only thing you're doing <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> yourself. I don't want to give somebody that power over me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{economic}} prosperity, the Israeli economy faces many challenges, {{some are}} short term {{and some are}} long term challenges. On the short term its inability to duplicate its success in the telecommunication industry into other growing industries hampers its economic outlooks. Its inability to foster large multinational companies {{in the last decade}} also calls into question its ability to employ large numbers of people in advanced industries. On the long term, Israel is facing challenges of high dependency of the growing number of Ultra-Orthodox Jews who have a low level of official labor force participation amongst men, and this situation could lead to a materially lower employment-to-population ratio and a higher dependency ratio in the future. The governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, stated that the growing poverty amongst the Ultra-Orthodox <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> the Israeli economy. According to the data published by Ian Fursman, 60% of the poor households in Israel are of the Haredi Jews and the Israeli Arabs. Both groups together represent 25–28% of the Israeli population. [...] Organizations such as The Kemach Foundation, Gvahim, Jerusalem Village and The Jerusalem Business Networking Forum are addressing these challenges with job placement services and networking events.|$|E

2500|$|... 'Tony', {{directed}} by recurring actor Harry Enfield, sees Tony Stonem attend a university open day {{not long after}} taking an ecstasy tablet that awakens elements of his old personality. In a visual metaphor for Jungian psychology, a mysterious girl who is a projection of Tony's subconscious helps him conquer his mental impairments. His old self again, he confronts Michelle and Sid and tells them their relationship is 'wrong'. With the Stonem parents unable to run the house, Effy takes over in episode seven. She starts a new private school and befriends weird girl Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell), and resolves to solve her brother's and his friends' relationship problems. Cassie <b>is</b> <b>hurting</b> and turning to promiscuity, but through Effy's machinations, she and Sid get back together, as do Tony and Michelle. Actor Daniel Kaluuya wrote 'Jal', which sees her struggle with her pregnancy, while Chris is rushed to hospital with a Subarachnoid Haemorrhage. Meanwhile, Maxxie introduces his new boyfriend, James (Sean Verey). In 'Cassie', Jal tells Chris she is having an abortion. Cassie feels without her eating disorder and other problems, she is disempowered; she is traumatised when Chris dies in her arms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage and flees to New York City. In the series finale, the gang get their A Level results, collectively mourn Chris and eventually part ways, with Sid following Cassie to New York, Anwar moving with Maxxie and James to London, and Sketch left behind. The series ends with Effy in Tony's bed, revelling in the art work of emotions she has created as she claims her top place in their social world, and also as series' lead in the upcoming series.|$|E
