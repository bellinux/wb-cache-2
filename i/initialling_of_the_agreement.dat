40|$|More {{than half}} of interstate wars are {{resolved}} by negotiations. On the other side, only 15 % of intrastate wars are resolved by negotiations. In terms of power balance, {{it has been shown}} that perceived equals negotiate less efficient that perceived unequal’s in interstate conflicts. It has also been shown that the less empowered parties emerge with better than expected results in asymmetrical interstate negotiations. Are these findings reflected in intrastate peace negotiations? In attempt to shed light on this question I have investigated the post-conflict constitutional processes in a perceived symmetrical case, Nepal, and a perceived asymmetrical case, Sierra Leone. Constitutional processes are negations. Thus, the powersharing arrangements that follow constitutional processes are a result of negotiators interest and the actor ́s leverage during the negotiations. As predicted, perceived symmetry negatively affected <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> negotiation, while asymmetry facilitated the process. Interestingly, <b>the</b> resulting power-sharing <b>agreements</b> in Sierra Leone did not seem to follow the predicted pattern. However, in a wider perspective that includes consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> that goes beyond <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> time frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> <b>the</b> weaker part did emerge with better than expected outcome.

Pollution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marine environment is the introduction by man, directly or indirectly of substance or energy into the environment, including estuaries, which results or is {{likely to result in}} such deleterious effects as harm to living resources and marine life, hazards to human health, hindrance to marine activities, including fishing and other legitimate uses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea, impairment <b>of</b> quality for use of sea water and reduction of amenities.

40|$|As {{evidenced}} by <b>the</b> rapid growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third-party logistics industry, {{more and more}} firms are electing to outsource logistics in order {{to cut costs and}} to focus on core competencies. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key decisions faced by firms when engaging third party logistics providers involves <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> with <b>the</b> provider. <b>Agreements</b> range from requirements for service on demand to more structured <b>agreements,</b> in which <b>the</b> timing and size of shipment quantities are specified in advance. By agreeing to more structured arrangements, firms can decrease the uncertainty faced by the logistics provider and thus the logistics provider's costs, and therefore negotiate better rates. In order to understand <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> using more structured agreements, however, firms need to understand how to effectively utilize the service provided in these agreements. In this dissertation, motivated by these observations, we develop stylized models of simple production-distribution systems in order to explore <b>the</b> efficient use <b>of</b> structured logistics agreements. First, we introduce <b>the</b> general framework <b>of</b> models that we explore in this manuscript and present our motivation behind it. Second, we present a brief review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stochastic supply chain literature. In this field, while there has been considerable interest in especially the supply contracts, the emphasis has been mostly on channel coordination and other informational efficiency aspects rather than the operational efficiency that we focus on. Third, we introduce our basic model with a fixed commitment logistics contract in a make-to-order production setting. We mathematically formulate this problem using stochastic dynamic programming and fully characterize the optimal policy structure. We prove some important properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal policy function that describe its sensitivity to reserved capacity levels and shipment times in the contract. We also provide sufficient conditions for decomposing this problem in time, whereby the complexity in computationally determining the optimal policy parameters can be greatly reduced. Fourth, we extend our model to a make-to-stock production environment and again completely characterize <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal policy function. We show monotonicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal function parameters with respect to committed capacities in all cases and with respect to time in the periodic shipment case. Fifth, we analyze and extend our results regarding the optimal policy structure to more sophisticated logistics agreements such as option contracts and multi-level option contracts, and introduce additional uncertainties to the system such as stochastic spot market price and stochastic availability of additional capacity. Sixth, we present an <b>initial</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> logistics <b>agreements</b> with shipment times chosen dynamically by the contact buyer. Lastly, we provide a computational study illustrating <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> optimal contract parameters to demand uncertainty and cost parameters, as well as exploring <b>the</b> relative benefits <b>of</b> different logistics agreements under varying operating conditions. Overall, we investigate simplified models of production-distribution systems with outsourced logistics, our analysis and characterization of optimal policies provide some insight into <b>the</b> practical use <b>of</b> transportation contracts in addition to building a foundation for future investigation of models that incorporate more complicated critical aspects of important real-world problems relating to integrated production and distribution management in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> outsourced logistics agreements...|$|R
40|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{is one of}} 13 major {{operating}} components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Health and Human Services (HHS). CDC's Oral Health Program is located within the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP). The CDC's current (FY 2010) budget for oral health activities is approximately $ 14. 4 million. Over the past decade, a gradual but steady rise in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> funding has allowed CDC to implement and expand several initiatives. CDC initiated a cooperative <b>agreement</b> program, called <b>the</b> State-based Oral Disease Prevention Program, in FY 2001. This program provides financial support and technical assistance to state oral health programs to help them strengthen their capacity to provide oral health promotion and disease prevention programs. <b>The</b> <b>initial</b> cycle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooperative <b>agreement</b> program provided support to 12 states and <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Palau; <b>the</b> second cycle, which began in 2008, initially provided funding to 16 states. In 2010, a modest increase in CDC's budget allowed the agency to fund three additional states. In addition, CDC has cooperative <b>agreements</b> with <b>the</b> Association <b>of</b> State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) and the Children's Dental Health Project (CDHP) to provide assistance and tools {{that can be used}} by state and community oral health programs and oral health coalitions to strengthen their programs. As resources permit, the Oral Health Program will seek to expand these cooperative agreements and develop formalized relationships with other national organizations in order to promote and accomplish our mission, priorities, goals, and objectives. Over the past decade, CDC also has focused on improving the data systems available through its Web site. In 1999, CDC implemented the Water Fluoridation Reporting System (WFRS), an Internet-based tool to help state fluoridation managers monitor <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> water fluoridation within their states. In 2001, the National Oral Health Surveillance System (NOHSS) was implemented on the CDC Web site. Provided in collaboration with ASTDD, NOHSS includes nine indicators that allow states to monitor <b>the</b> burden <b>of</b> oral diseases, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oral care delivery system, and <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> community water fluoridation. CDC now plays a greater role in leading surveillance aspects of national surveys and promoting analyses of data from those surveys, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In 2002, a tool called My Water's Fluoride was added to the Web site. This tool provides information on <b>the</b> fluoridation status <b>of</b> water systems for participating states. In 2000, CDC and <b>the</b> National Institute <b>of</b> Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), National Institutes of Health, entered into a partnership to provide the Dental, Oral and Craniofacial Data Resource Center, whose primary function is to collect data and other information needed to support research, program evaluation, and policy development at CDC, NIDCR, and other agencies within the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. CDC assumed the management and lead for this project in 2007. " - p. 1 Overview [...] I.
