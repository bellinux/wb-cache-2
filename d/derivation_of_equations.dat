50|$|The <b>derivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equations</b> from {{an action}} has several advantages. First of all, {{it allows for}} easy {{unification}} of general relativity with other classical field theories (such as Maxwell theory), which are also formulated {{in terms of an}} action. In the process the derivation from an action identifies a natural candidate for the source term coupling the metric to matter fields. Moreover, the action allows for the easy identification of conserved quantities through Noether's theorem by studying symmetries of the action.|$|E
