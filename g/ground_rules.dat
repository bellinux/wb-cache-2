5|$|By early 1916, the British {{blockade}} of Germany {{was beginning to}} have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, law {{professor}} Phillip E. Johnson set out his {{argument that the}} <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> of science as presented at Edwards v. Aguillard unfairly disqualified creationist explanations by excluding the supernatural, and in 1991, he brought out a book entitled Darwin on Trial, challenging the principles of naturalism and uniformitarianism in contemporary scientific philosophy.|$|E

His third book, The Yankee Years, {{was released in}} February 2009. The book, co-authored by Sports Illustrated writer Tom Verducci, details Torre's tenure as manager of the New York Yankees.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, the Pirates {{were the}} first {{baseball}} team to cover their field with a tarp during inclement weather, and though the field was kept dry from the rain, the Allegheny River still caused problems. Flooding sometimes covered the entire outfield with inches of standing water, causing <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> that gave any ground ball hit into the outfield an automatic single. In 1907, Pittsburg's pitcher Nick Maddox threw a no-hitter at Exposition Park.|$|E
25|$|The Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Charter of Privileges and Exemptions, is a document written by the Dutch West India Company in an effort to settle its colony of New Netherland in North America through the establishment of feudal patroonships purchased and supplied by members of the West India Company. Its 31 articles establish <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> and expectations of the patroons and inhabitants of the new colonies. It was ratified by the Dutch States-General on June 7, 1629.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} Tillman Act of 1907, Congress has imposed {{a growing number}} of {{restrictions}} on elections and campaign financing. The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, Buckley v. Valeo (1976), which, {{in the face of a}} First Amendment challenge, set the <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> for campaign finance legislation, generally disallowing restrictions on expenditures by candidates, but permitting restrictions on contributions by individuals and corporations.|$|E
25|$|Pre-session Strategy {{refers to}} the leader’s ability to {{understand}} the importance of small talk just prior to group discussion. The facilitator must cordially greet the group members and begin small talk {{while at the same time}} avoid the topics and issues that will be discussed during the sessions. This will allow the group leader to observe the kind of interactions and understand which participant has what qualities. Recording is beneficial for the leader via tape recording and note taking. Note taking is useful as they can be utilized even if the tape recorder stops working. Someone other than the group leader or the facilitator should take detailed and in depth notes of the discussion. Beginning of the Discussion includes the usual pattern of discussion which is welcome, overview and topic, <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> and first question. The overview must provide an explanation of the purpose and importance of the topic of discussion. <b>Ground</b> <b>rules</b> must be stated explicitly. Some of the examples are, minimizing or eliminating side conversations, one person talks at a time, no criticizing what others have to say and treating everyone’s opinion with respect and dignity. The initial conversation should include an “ice breaker” in order to make the members more comfortable and open.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{was unusually}} {{low to the}} playing field, the air-inflated dome {{occasionally}} figured into game action. Major League Baseball had specific <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> for the Metrodome. Any ball which struck the Dome roof, or objects hanging from it, remained in play; if it landed in foul territory it became a foul ball, if it landed in fair territory it became a fair ball. Any ball which became caught in the roof over fair ground was a ground rule double. That has only happened three times in its history – Dave Kingman for the Oakland Athletics on May 4, 1984, University of Minnesota Gophers player George Behr and Corey Koskie in 2004. The speakers, being closer to the playing surface, were hit more frequently, especially the speakers in foul ground near the infield, which were typically hit several times a season, which posed an extra challenge to infielders trying to catch them. However, beginning with the 2005 season, the <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> for Twins games were changed such that any batted ball that struck a speaker in foul territory would automatically be called a foul ball, {{regardless of whether or}} not it was caught. The dome's roof color made it close to impossible to catch balls without taking the eye off the ball. As a result, fielders frequently lost balls in the roof. An example of this is seen in a home run derby put on by a softball entertainment crew prior to a Twins game. Taken at field level, the balls generally tended to be lost in the roof. The roof was high enough that it has never been a concern for events other than baseball.|$|E
5000|$|A ball {{sticking}} {{in the bullpen}} screen or bouncing into the bullpen is a <b>ground</b> <b>rule</b> double.|$|R

500|$|After Obama's victory, Lu became {{executive}} director of the Obama-Biden Transition Project, a position that was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the transition. [...] During the transition period, Lu was in daily contact with Bush administration officials, managed the $9 million budget, and negotiated the <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> for Obama transition representatives to gather information on federal agency operations and programs.|$|E
500|$|... "The Deal" [...] is {{the ninth}} {{episode of the}} second season of NBC's Seinfeld, and the show's 14th episode overall. The episode centers on protagonists Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld) and Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) who decide to have a purely {{physical}} relationship, {{with a set of}} <b>ground</b> <b>rules.</b> However, as their [...] "relationship" [...] progresses, they experience difficulties maintaining their original friendship.|$|E
500|$|... "Avatar" [...] was {{developed}} after Duchovny initially suggested having a Skinner-centric episode {{as a way}} to give himself a break. Skinner's popularity amongst fans had risen with his increased role in the episodes [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and [...] "Paper Clip" [...] and these episodes helped re-establish the <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> regarding where Skinner stood in regard to the X-Files. The episode title means the incarnation of a deity in Sanskrit.|$|E
50|$|This <b>ground</b> <b>rule</b> {{is linked}} to the issue of dies cedit and dies venit. The fact {{that there has to be}} a {{transfer}} of rights and/or duties with regard to the bequest and/or status of the deceased can also be regarded as a <b>ground</b> <b>rule</b> of the law of succession. Somebody must take the place of the deceased testator with regard to ownership of his assets, or in the case of customary law, with regard to status. In the case of the common law of succession, there is a transfer of rights (and sometimes also responsibilities) which belonged to the deceased.|$|R

500|$|During {{this time}} period, the {{establishment}} of the <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> of each park rested with the home team. In 1884, team captain and on-field manager Cap Anson decided that balls hit over the fence were to be home runs. [...] Williamson used these short dimensions and new <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> to set the single-season home run record by hitting 27 in a 112-game season, surpassing the record of 14 set by Harry Stovey the previous year. Of the 27home runs he hit that year, 25 of them were hit at home. [...] This record stood for 35 years until it was broken in 1919 by Babe Ruth, who hit 29 for the Boston Red Sox in a 140-game schedule. [...] The first three of Williamson's 27 home runs came on May 30, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Wolverines. Williamson became the first major league baseball player to hit three home runs in one game. [...] During these two record-breaking seasons, his fielding prowess did not recede. He did not lead the league in fielding percentage in either 1883 or 1884, but did lead in assists, capping off a streak of five consecutive years in which he did so, while also leading the league in double plays for the second and third consecutive years.|$|E
500|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>rules</b> for story {{development}} {{were established}} at the outset. Part of the marketing pitch, [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] dictated that Clark would not wear the Superman costume, nor would he fly. After initial discussion of possible storylines, a second rule decreed that Clark could never directly kill anyone. This created a dilemma since Clark {{must be able to}} defeat the [...] "bad guys" [...] from week to week. A solution developed in later episodes with the introduction of the Belle Reve sanitarium (Belle Reve is a Federal prison for metahumans and other supervillains in the comics).|$|E
500|$|After {{setting the}} <b>ground</b> <b>rules,</b> Gough and Millar {{conceived}} ideas that facilitated week-to-week story development. For example, kryptonite's role was {{expanded to include}} enhancement of {{the sins of the}} antagonist: instead of creating physical monsters, exposure to kryptonite would amplify their personal demons. This was not treated as literally in the pilot and [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] as it was in later episodes. In [...] "Cool", it was [...] "the 'cool' kid literally [...] cool, needing human body heat to stay alive". After several episodes, the writers developed a story that would help establish the show as more than a [...] "villain of the week" [...] series. The ninth episode ("Rogue"), which took longer than usual to develop due to its divergence from the standard formula, became their first [...] "true crime story" [...] and demonstrated that Smallville could include more than kryptonite-powered villains.|$|E
50|$|The Reds {{broke the}} shutout {{in the sixth}} inning, when Heinie Groh hit a <b>ground</b> <b>rule</b> double, then came around to score on a single by Pat Duncan, cutting the White Sox lead to 4-1.|$|R
5|$|The Phillies scored {{first for}} the second game in a row, with Raúl Ibañez hitting a <b>ground</b> <b>rule</b> double and then scoring on a Matt Stairs RBI single off A. J. Burnett in the second inning.|$|R
50|$|A {{ball that}} hits the roof or a {{suspended}} object in fair territory is in play. If it gets stuck in fair territory, it is <b>ruled</b> a <b>ground</b> <b>rule</b> double, and all runners advance two bases.|$|R
500|$|David Duchovny {{initially}} suggested {{having a}} Walter Skinner-centric episode {{as a way}} to give himself a break, although ultimately he still ended up having a large part in the episode. Duchovny felt that Skinner was a good character who was not utilized to his full extent on the show. Duchovny's idea, which was written in collaboration with writer Howard Gordon, also surrounded the conceit that what Mulder and Skinner do comes with a tremendous price. Skinner's popularity amongst fans had risen with his increased role in the episodes [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and [...] "Paper Clip" [...] and these episodes helped re-establish the <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> regarding where Skinner stood in regards to the X-Files. Writer Vince Gilligan noted that Skinner was originally intended to be a bad guy, but because Mitch Pileggi was such a good actor the writers decided to not take his character in that direction.|$|E
500|$|In 1861 a {{committee}} of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS) including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and Joule among its members was tasked with investigating the [...] "Standards of Electrical Resistance". In their first report (1862) they laid the <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> for their work – the metric system was to be used, measures of electrical energy must have the same units as measures of mechanical energy and two sets of electromagnetic units {{would have to be}} derived – an electromagnetic system and an electrostatic system. In the second report (1863) they introduced the concept of a coherent system of units whereby units of length, mass and time were identified as [...] "fundamental units" [...] (now known as base units). All other units of measure could be derived (hence derived units) from these base units. The metre, gram and second were chosen as base units.|$|E
500|$|As {{they are}} {{watching}} TV in Jerry's apartment, Jerry and Elaine flip through the channels, stumbling upon the soft-core pornography channel. Upon {{the realization that}} neither of them has had sexual relations in a while, they start toying {{with the idea of}} sleeping together. They refer to their friendship as [...] "this" [...] and sexual intercourse as [...] "that". However, as they do not wish to ruin their friendship, they establish a set of <b>ground</b> <b>rules.</b> Happy with their agreement, they {{make their way to the}} bedroom. The next day Jerry has lunch with his friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), and makes him aware of his situation with Elaine. George remains skeptical, even after Jerry explains the rules system to him. He is proven right when Jerry and Elaine get into an argument over the second rule: [...] "Spending the night is optional". Jerry eventually does not spend the night, leaving their agreement on shaky terms.|$|E
50|$|The Phillies scored {{first for}} the second game in a row, with Raúl Ibañez hitting a <b>ground</b> <b>rule</b> double and then scoring on a Matt Stairs RBI single off A. J. Burnett in the second inning.|$|R
50|$|On 10 April 2014, Polda Jabar {{initiated}} a reconciliation to avoid unnecessary future clashes of Persib and Persija's rivalry. This meeting concluded with six agreements {{that will be}} the <b>ground</b> <b>rule</b> if one or both sides broke the agreements on future dates.|$|R
