25|$|These attacks brought {{instability}} and chaos to the kingdom. Peroz I tried again {{to drive out}} the Hephthalites, but {{on the way to}} Herat, his army was trapped by the Huns in the desert; Peroz I was killed, and his army was wiped out. After this victory, the Hephthalites advanced forward to the city of Herat, throwing the empire into chaos. Eventually, a noble Iranian from the old family of Karen, Sukhra, restored some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>order.</b> He raised Balash, one of Peroz I's brothers, to the throne, although the Hunnic threat persisted until the reign of Khosrau I. Balash (484–488) was a mild and generous monarch, who made concessions to the Christians; however, he took no action against the empire's enemies, particularly, the White Huns. Balash, after a reign of four years, was blinded and deposed (attributed to magnates), and his nephew Kavadh I was raised to the throne.|$|E
25|$|Aetius campaigned vigorously, {{somewhat}} {{stabilizing the}} situation in Gaul and in Hispania. He relied heavily on his forces of Huns. With a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the Nibelungenlied, the Huns slaughtered many Burgundians on the middle Rhine, re-establishing the survivors as Roman allies, the first Kingdom of the Burgundians. This may have returned some sort of Roman authority to Trier. Eastern troops reinforced Carthage, temporarily halting the Vandals, who in 435 agreed to limit themselves to Numidia and leave the most fertile parts of North Africa in peace. Aetius concentrated his limited military resources to defeat the Visigoths again, and his diplomacy restored a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> to Hispania. However, his general Litorius was badly defeated by the Visigoths at Toulouse, and a new Suevic king, Rechiar, began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania. At one point Rechiar even allied with Bagaudae. These were Romans not under imperial control; some of their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks of a Roman captive under Attila who was happy in his lot, giving a lively account of the vices of a declining empire, {{of which he had}} so long been the victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the universal corruption, which increased the influence of the rich, and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A-site ordered PrBaMn 2 O 6 manganites were {{obtained}} by a two-step synthesis process. The chemical composition, crystal structure, magnetic and magnetotransport properties have been investigated {{with regard to the}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> the Pr 3 + and Ba 2 + cations. A-site disordered Pr 0. 50 Ba 0. 50 MnO 3 has a cubic perovskite-like unit cell (SG = m 3 Pm, Z = 1), while the A-site ordered PrBaMn 2 O 6 has a tetragonal unit cell (SG = mmm/ 4 P, Z = 2). The A-site ordered state in PrBaMn 2 O 6 remains stable on heating to 1300 0 C in an oxidizing medium (P[O 2] = 1 bar). The cation ordering leads to {{a significant increase in the}} critical temperatures of phase transitions. A-site ordered PrBaMn 2 O 6 is a metallic ferromagnet with the TC ~ 320 K, whereas TC of a fully disordered sample is ∼ 140 K. The samples with intermediate <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>ordering</b> contain two magnetic phases. Slightly below TC, all samples exhibit a metal–insulator transition and a peak of the magnetoresistance, amounting to approximately 10 % and 65 % in a magnetic field of 9 kOe for the fully ordered PrBaMn 2 O 6 and disordered Pr 0. 50 Ba 0. 50 MnO 3, respectively. The results are interpreted in terms <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> the Pr 3 + and Ba 2 + cations...|$|R
