As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 <b>got</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rain and soon fell ill.

25|$|CMLL held a {{steel cage}} match {{involving}} 12 Mini-Estrellas, the rules dictated {{that the last}} two men in the cage would have immediately to face off in a Luchas de Apuestas ("Bet match") with the loser either having to unmask or have his hair shaved off as a result. The match took place on November 6, 2012 in Arena Coliseo in Guadalajara, Jalisco and included Aéreo, Astral, , Fantasy, Mercurio, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Halcón, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Violencia, Pierrothito, Shockercito and Último Dragoncito. The wrestlers {{were not allowed to}} even attempt to leave the cage until three minutes into the ring, but once the deadline was up Pequeño Halcón was the first person out of the cage followed by Mercurio and Aéreo. Moments later, as Pequeño Olímpico was trying to climb over the top part of the wire mesh on the cage gave out and Pequeño Olímpico ended up with his arm trapped in the cage, needing help to get loose and to the floor where he was checked to see if he needed medical attention. After that Fantasy climbed over the cage the floor, escaping the match and joining Mercurio and Aéreo, who were still on the floor. Moments later Astral {{climbed to the top of}} the cage and dove off the 15-foot-high cage, landing a Moonsault on Mercurio, Aéreo and Fantasy who were still on the floor. During the move Astral <b>got</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cage and landed in an uncontrolled manner on the floor, hitting his head, which promoted the medical personnel to immediately rush him out of the arena. The bad fall also hurt Mercurio, who had to be removed from the ring on a stretcher. Many of the remaining contestants, including Pierrothito bled during the match, some was possibly intentional as part of the plan for the match while others were not intentionally bleeding. Demus 3:16 was the recipient of several throws and falls off the cage as he tried to escape, finally shaking off his opponents to climb out. Once Demus 3:16 was on the floor he needed help to even stand and had to be helped from the arena. The last person to escape was Pequeño Violencia, who's back was bleeding from being thrown against the cage repeatedly. With Pequeño Violencia out it left Shockercity and Pequeño Black Warrior as the last two men in the ring, with both of them risking their hair on the outcome of this part of the match. Shockercito finally managed to defeat his opponent when he applied the La Reienera submission hold on Pequeño Black Warrior, forcing him to submit. Following the loss Pequeño Black Warrior had all his hair shaved off. Following the match Shockercito stated that he hoped his victory would earn him a match against one of the Mini-Estrella champions.|$|E

500|$|Despite the evacuations, Nina's closest {{approach}} to Hawaii was 120miles away. However, it came {{close enough to}} bring winds and heavy rain to the islands. There were four deaths reported in connection to the storm. The first reported was on Oahu when Herman Palepana, a lineman in the Honolulu street department, was killed when he was electrocuted by a power line downed during Nina's passing. Soon after, a sampan called the Setsu Maru sent a distress call reporting that the boat was sinking 10miles east of Niihau. Even though the Navy sent the submarine rescue vessel Couchal and conducted an air-seas search for the vessel, {{no trace of the}} sampan or the wreckage had been found. All three people aboard the boat were reported dead as a result. Another person in Hanapepe was injured when a tree came through a window in his house, causing minor forehead cuts. The phone lines to the county seat of Kauai County, Lihue, were broken during the hurricane. The Aloha Theater in Hanapepe had been flooded by up to three feet of water. Reports from the five major islands indicated that less than 50 homes had been damaged during the storm and roughly 12 of them being destroyed on Kauai alone. Another ship disaster occurred when the Greek freighter Margarita Chandris <b>got</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storm's winds while heading to Honolulu from Kobe. A distress call from the ship described the ship as [...] "out of control". The initial fears were that the winds from Nina would pull the ship closer to its center. These fears were made worse when the ship was found to be cargoless, making it easier to be moved by the waves. A later call said that the crew was unable to steer the ship. Three ships, the Rainier, the United States Coast Guard cutter Winnebago and the cargoliner President Monroe, were sent out to find and guide the Chandris to port. The Monroe finally found the freighter and guided it toward land until the Winnebago caught up. The cutter finally caught up to the Margarita Chandris and relieved the President Monroe and started planning to board and make repairs. Afterward, it was decided that the Margarita Chandris had enough fuel to drift into Honolulu alone. Nina's proximity also caused heavy rains, with 20.42inches falling in Wainiha in 14hours. Overall, Hurricane Nina was responsible for $100,000 in damages (1957USD), mostly from heavy surf, some of which measured 35feet high.|$|E
