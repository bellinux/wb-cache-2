The attack was regarded as being in breach of the United Nations Charter (S/RES/487) and international law and was widely condemned.|$|E

During the first phase, which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline, the [...] "applicant cities" [...] are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organisation. This information allows the IOC to analyse the cities' hosting capacities and {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of their plans. Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports, the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is the true candidature stage: the accepted applicant cities (from now on referred to as [...] "candidate cities") are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended, more detailed, candidature file. These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a group composed of IOC members, representatives of international sport federations, NOCs, athletes, the International Paralympic Committee, and international experts in various fields. The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four-day <b>inspection</b> <b>visits</b> to each of the candidate cities, where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of the themes covered in the candidature file.

2500|$|During {{the entire}} war, the ICRC {{monitored}} warring parties’ {{compliance with the}} Geneva Conventions of the 1907 revision and forwarded complaints about violations to the respective country. When chemical weapons were used in this war {{for the first time}} in history, the ICRC vigorously protested against this new type of warfare. Even without having a mandate from the Geneva Conventions, the ICRC tried to ameliorate the suffering of civil populations. In territories that were officially designated as [...] "occupied territories", the ICRC could assist the civilian population on the basis of the Hague Convention's [...] "Laws and Customs of War on Land" [...] of 1907. This convention was also the legal basis for the ICRC's work for prisoners of war. In addition to the work of the International Prisoner-of-War Agency as described above this included <b>inspection</b> <b>visits</b> to POW camps. A total of 524 camps throughout Europe were visited by 41 delegates from the ICRC until the end of the war.|$|E

As one of Hu Jintao's closest associates and most trusted advisors, {{in addition to}} being of an appropriate level of seniority, Ling seemed long destined for higher office. Ling's political fortunes, however, took an abrupt turn in 2012. On March 18, Ling's only son, then 23-Year old Ling Gu, was involved and killed in a car crash on Beijing's 4th Ring Road while driving a black Ferrari 458 Spider accompanied by two women, reportedly of minority ethnic background, who survived. Ling Gu was said to have been found naked, and the women were described as either naked or otherwise [...] "scantily clad," [...] which seemed to suggest sexual activity while driving. [...] While this account was later disputed, the widely discussed [...] "Ferrari crash" [...] was juicy tabloid fodder and exacerbated public cynicism over the debauchery and conspicuous consumption often associated with children of the Communist ruling elite.|$|E
