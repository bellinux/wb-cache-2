None of us are naive enough not to know what kids do. It’s {{important}} not to patronise the youth of today, we’re not gonna be writing about ‘oh let’s just hold hands for a while’ you know?

500|$|Original pre-release {{advertising}} {{included a}} regional [...] "mail drop" [...] of circulars presenting screenshots of a screaming Geeson and the tagline [...] "Warning! An Horrific Alien Birth! A Violent Nightmare in Blood! Inseminoid at a Cinema Near You Soon!" [...] Warren, who regrets {{the decision to}} publicise the film in such a graphic manner, comments, [...] "The problem with mail-drops <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{no way of knowing}} who lives in the house, or who will see it first. It could be a pregnant woman, and old lady, or even worse, a young child. So it was not such a good idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor wanted Asgard in {{this film}} {{to have a more}} natural look than its predecessor. To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, {{capturing}} six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, [...] "The benefit of that <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> some real world terrain to work with – so you have buildings that have to convey natural features. Then from there we went in there populating the terrain with different buildings." [...] For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies.|$|E

500|$|In September 2006, Langan made {{a low-key}} {{departure}} from Granada {{to take up}} a position as an executive producer with BBC Films. Although approached to join BBC Films some years before, only in 2007 did she feel it was the time to [...] "concentrate more exclusively on film". She immediately began overseeing editing work on The Other Boleyn Girl, which was already in post-production. She also began developing The Damned United, a film based on David Peace's novel that fictionalised the 44 days Brian Clough managed Leeds United F.C. in 1974. The film was adapted by Peter Morgan, executive produced by Andy Harries, and starred Michael Sheen as Clough. On why she continues to work with the same people on her projects, Langan said, [...] "The reason I return to working with the same people <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> invested time, energy and thought and care into these relationships and that can pay dividends—The Queen is an example of those relationships paying dividends".|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} noted {{generally}} that natural justice is a fundamental element {{of the rule of}} law. In administrative law, the two principles of natural justice, which constitute a framework for common law procedural rights, are the rule against bias (nemo iudex in causa sua, or [...] "no man a judge in his own cause") and the right to be heard (audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side"). In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v. Wood Hall Ltd. & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd. (1978), the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of [...] "fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties." [...] Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999, MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice, which he described thus: [...] "atural justice requires essentially two basic principles. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the right to be heard and to explain your case, and, two, is the right to equal treatment. A right to have your case heard also means that there is a review." ...|$|E

This is something I want to clearly state: this is a false stereotype. Today there is antisemitism in Poland, as unfortunately the rest of Europe; it {{is more or less}} at the same level as the rest of Europe. More important <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a growing number of Poles who oppose antisemitism." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 6, 2014, John Petrucci {{said that}} Dream Theater were already [...] "planting seeds for album No. 13". He commented: [...] "There are some song ideas and {{little things like}} that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted. One {{of the great things}} about this career <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the {{opportunity}} every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?' Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{distinctive}} {{voice has}} become a gift for impressionists such as Jon Culshaw, who regularly impersonates Baker in the comedy series Dead Ringers: in one episode, he makes a prank call to Baker in character as the Doctor, which prompts the memorable reaction from the real Baker: [...] "No, no, {{there must be a}} mistake, I'm the Doctor." [...] Similarly, when Culshaw called another Doctor, Sylvester McCoy, in character, he got the response: [...] "Tom? <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Have</b> you been down the pub?" [...] Other typical [...] "in character" [...] send-ups for Culshaw would include asking a garage engineer to convert his TARDIS to unleaded and complaining of the 400-year journey time from Euston to Glasgow by train.|$|E
2500|$|Patrick W. Galbraith, {{the author}} of The Moe Manifesto, was interviewed in the Otaku USA magazine. Galbraith was asked whether Imouto Paradise! 2 falls into the 'moe' category, to which he replied, [...] "Well, it’s an adult manga based on an erotic visual novel, so I’d say that it’s wank material. It’s not exactly {{mainstream}} manga, you know? Where it might overlap with the moe phenomenon, though, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> really cute characters {{and people who are}} into those characters." [...] Furthermore, he commented on the restriction of the Imouto Paradise! 2 manga, saying that, [...] "I don’t think that it’s surprising that they took on Imouto Paradise, because it’s got a decent fan following, has an emphasis on incest, which is one act specifically mentioned in the ordinance, and the characters are marked by a kind of cuteness that’s worrisome for a lot of people, because cuteness often bleeds into youthfulness." [...] Like Kanemitsu, Galbraith showed distaste towards the government's decision to restrict the manga, saying that he [...] "is not a fan" [...] of this ordinance.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of the murder, 16/17 December 1916, Rasputin was invited to Felix's {{apartment}} at the Moika Palace. He was told that Irina would be in residence and Rasputin would have an opportunity to meet her. Rasputin had often expressed interest in meeting the beautiful 21-year-old princess. Irina, however, was on a visit to the Crimea. Irina had been aware that Felix had talked about eliminating Rasputin and it was originally intended that she participate in the murder. [...] "You too must take part in it," [...] Felix wrote to her before the murder. [...] "Dm(itri) Pavl(ovich) knows all about it and is helping. It will all take place in the middle of December, when Dm(itri) comes back." [...] In late November 1916, Irina wrote to Felix: [...] "Thanks for your insane letter. I didn't understand the half of it. I see that you're planning to do something wild. Please take care and do not get mixed up in any shady business. The dirtiest thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> decided to do it all without me. I don't see how I can take part in it now, since it's all arranged... In a word, be careful. I see from your letter that you're in a state of wild enthusiasm and ready to climb a wall... I'll be in Petrograd on the 12th or 13th, so don't dare do anything without me, or else I won't come at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{begins with}} Perry, {{sitting on the}} ground while mouthing the lyrics and staring at the camera. As she {{finishes}} the verse, the camera shifts to the ballroom, in which the dancers start to dance. The song's chorus kicks in, and she is now found in the ballroom, {{in the middle of all}} the dancers. As the second verse begins and she has an owl on her arm, which she lets go and flies. The bird represents [...] "something strong, free [...] powerful". Bonacorso added: [...] "She lets it go into the world and that literally letting this force within her go wild. That's an important part of love <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to let it go." [...] The video also shows Perry, with a golden dress and cross-shaped earrings, with flames on her body. By the second repetition of the chorus, a bed gets lit on fire, which the director included to refer to love that [...] "can burn you like an inferno". As the song reaches its climax, Perry gets hit by a car, with tiny broken debris from it shattering behind her, while she remains stationary and unharmed. This scene symbolizes the experience of true love, that changes [...] "your world" [...] and [...] "hits you out of the blue". This scene cuts to the ballroom, where Perry is surrounded by a similar explosion of [...] "colorful" [...] flowers, which is used to contrast the more violent nature of falling in love and the softer part of it, the [...] "joyful and wonderful" [...] feelings.|$|E
