50|$|The {{process is}} carried out in a stirred tank reactor where the olefin and the syngas are bubbled {{from the bottom of}} the reactor through the {{catalyst}} phase under intensive stirring. The resulting crude aldehyde phase is separated at the top from the aqueous phase. The aqueous catalyst-containing solution is re-heated via a heat exchanger and pumped back into the reactor. The excess olefin and syngas is separated from the aldehyde phase in a stripper and fed back to the reactor. The generated heat is used for the generation of process steam, which is used for subsequent distillation of the organic phase to separate into butyraldehyde and <b>isobutyraldehyde.</b> Potential catalyst poisons coming from the synthesis gas migrate into the organic phase and removed from the reaction with the aldehyde. Thus there is no accumulation of catalyst poisons, and the elaborate fine purification of the syngas can be omitted.|$|E
50|$|The Ruhrchemie/Rhone-Poulenc process (RCRPP) {{relies on}} a rhodium {{catalyst}} with water-soluble TPPTS as ligand (Kuntz Cornils catalyst) for the hydroformylation of propene. The tri-sulfonation of triphenylphosphane ligand provides hydrophilic properties to the organometallic complex. The catalyst complex carries nine sulfonate-groups and is highly soluble in water (about 1 kg L−1), {{but not in the}} emerging product phase. The water-soluble TPPTS is used in about 50-fold excess, whereby the leaching of the catalyst is effectively suppressed. Reactants are propene and syngas consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a ratio of 1.1:1. A mixture of butyraldehyde and <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> in the ratio 96:4 is generated with few by-products such as alcohols, esters and higher boiling fractions. The Ruhrchemie/Rhone-Poulenc-process is the first commercially available two-phase system in which the catalyst is present in the aqueous phase. In the progress of the reaction an organic product phase is formed which is separated continuously by means of phase separation, wherein the aqueous catalyst phase remains in the reactor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Increasing {{global demand}} and {{reliance}} on petroleum-derived chemicals will necessitate alternative sources for chemical feedstocks. Currently, 99 % of chemical feedstocks {{are derived from}} petroleum and natural gas. Renewable methods for producing important chemical feedstocks largely remain unaddressed. Synthetic biology enables the renewable production of various chemicals from microorganisms by constructing unique metabolic pathways. Here, we engineer Escherichia coli {{for the production of}} <b>isobutyraldehyde,</b> which can be readily converted to various hydrocarbons currently derived from petroleum such as isobutyric acid, acetal, oxime and imine using existing chemical catalysis. <b>Isobutyraldehyde</b> can be readily stripped from cultures during production, which reduces toxic effects of <b>isobutyraldehyde.</b> Results We adopted the isobutanol pathway previously constructed in E. coli, neglecting the last step in the pathway where <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> is converted to isobutanol. However, this strain still overwhelmingly produced isobutanol (1. 5 [*]g/L/OD 600 (isobutanol) vs 0. 14 [*]g/L/OD 600 (<b>isobutyraldehyde)).</b> Next, we deleted yqhD which encodes a broad-substrate range aldehyde reductase known to be active toward <b>isobutyraldehyde.</b> This strain produced isobutanol and <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> at a near 1 : 1 ratio, indicating further native <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> reductase (IBR) activity in E. coli. To further eliminate isobutanol formation, we set out to identify and remove the remaining IBR s from the E. coli genome. We identified 7 annotated genes coding for IBRs that could be active toward isobutyraldehyde: adhP, eutG, yiaY, yjgB, betA, fucO, eutE. Individual deletions of the genes yielded only marginal improvements. Therefore, we sequentially deleted all seven of the genes and assessed production. The combined deletions greatly increased <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> production (1. 5 [*]g/L/OD 600) and decreased isobutanol production (0. 4 [*]g/L/OD 600). By assessing production by overexpression of each candidate IBR, we reveal that AdhP, EutG, YjgB, and FucO are active toward <b>isobutyraldehyde.</b> Finally, we assessed long-term <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> production of our best strain containing a total of 15 gene deletions using a gas stripping system with in situ product removal, resulting in a final titer of 35 [*]g/L after 5 [*]days. Conclusions In this work, we optimized E. coli for the production of the important chemical feedstock <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> by the removal of IBRs. Long-term production yielded industrially relevant titers of <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> with in situ product removal. The mutational load imparted on E. coli in this work demonstrates the versatility of metabolic engineering for strain improvements. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{possibility}} of the removal of <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> and 2 -pentanone was investigated in biotrickling filters (BTFs) at higher temperature (52 - 65 °Q. First, the biodegradation of <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> and 2 -pentanone in activated sludge was proven by batch experiments at 52 and 62 °C. In batch experiments <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> was also degraded up to a temperature of 72 °C. Thereafter two bioreactors were operated in parallel, one at ambient temperature (BTF 25), and one at 52 °C (BTF 52). Maximum elimination capacities of 97 and 139 g m- 3 h- 1 were observed in BTF 25 and BTF 52, respectively, for <b>isobutyraldehyde.</b> Maximum elimination capacities of 53 and 63 g m- 3 h- 1 were obtained for 2 -pentanone in BTF 25 and BTF 52, respectively. A significant difference was observed in the operational stability of the two reactors. In the reactor at ambient temperature, operational problems such as foam formation, higher biomass accumulation and organic acid production were observed.

LlAdhA(RE 1), which contains three amino acid mutations (Y 50 F, I 212 T, and L 264 V), was engineered to increase the microbial production of isobutanol (2 -methylpropan- 1 -ol) from <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> (2 -methylpropanal). Structural comparison of LlAdhA and LlAdhA(RE 1) indicates that the enhanced activity on <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> stems from increases in the protein's active site size, hydrophobicity, and substrate access. Further structure-guided mutagenesis generated a quadruple mutant (Y 50 F/N 110 S/I 212 T/L 264 V), whose KM for <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> is ∼ 17 -fold lower and catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) is ∼ 160 -fold higher than wild-type LlAdhA.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{combination}} of 6 Li and 13 C NMR spectroscopic and computational studies of oxazolidinone-based lithium enolates-Evans enolates-in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution revealed a mixture of dimers, tetramers, and oligomers (possibly ladders). The distribution depended on the structure of the oxazolidinone auxiliary, substituent on the enolate, and THF concentration (in THF/toluene mixtures). The unsolvated tetrameric form contained a D 2 d-symmetric core structure, whereas the dimers were determined experimentally and computationally to be trisolvates with several isomeric forms. Aldol additions to <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> and cyclohexanone with lithium enolates derived from Evans enolates are described. The trisolvated dimeric enolates undergo rapid addition to <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> to give a 12 : 1 syn:syn selectivity in high yield along with small amounts of one anti isomer. The efficacy of the addition depends critically on aging effects and the reaction quench. Unsolvated tetrameric enolates that form on warming the solutions are unreactive toward <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> and undergo retroaldol reaction under forcing conditions. Additions to cyclohexanone are relatively slow but form a ! single isomeric adduct in > 80 % yield. The ketone-derived aldolates are robust. All attempts to control stereoselectivity by controlling aggregation failed. Rate studies of addition to cyclohexanone trace the lack of aggregation-dependent selectivities to a monomer-based mechanism.

This induction {{is not always}} successful, especially with white wines, such as Chardonnay. A study was initiated to examine the compatibility of yeasts commonly used in Oregon winemaking with various strains of malolactic bacteria. In preliminary and pilot plant scale experiments, the yeast strain found to be most conducive to malolactic fermentation by lactic acid bacteria was Montrachet (Red Star). The malolactic bacterial strains that were best able to complete malolactic fermentation in various wines, fermented by different yeast strains, were the two Oregon commercial strains, ER 1 A and Ey 2 d, and the Pinot Noir juice isolate, DAPN 85 A. Sensory analysis of aroma by difference from control test was done on Chardonnay wine fermented by 4 different yeast strains and 3 different malolactic bacterial strains. In all cases, there was an overall significant difference in malolactic fermented wine aroma when compared to control wines. Organic acid analyses by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and analyses of volatile compounds by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were done on selected Chardonnay wines. Propionic acid was found to diminish in malolactic fermented wines while acetic acid content increased. Isobutanol and <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> increased significantly in MLF wines, compared to the controls. Chemical analyses of MLF and control wines suggested two possible chemical reactions resulting from the MLF. The first was the reduction of <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> to isobutanol, and the second was the hydrolysis of isobutyl acetate to <b>isobutyraldehyde</b> and acetate.
