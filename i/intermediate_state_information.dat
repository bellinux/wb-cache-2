40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} method for {{learning}} interactions among objects when <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> <b>information</b> is not available. Learning is accomplished by observing a given sequence of actions on objects. We have selected the Incredible Machine game as a suitable domain for analyzing and learning object interactions. We first present how behaviors are represented by finite state machines using the given input. Then, we analyze {{the impact of the}} input type corresponding to relations on the overall performance. Our analysis includes four different types of input: a knowledge base including part relations; spatial information; temporal information; and spatio-temporal information. We show that if a knowledge base about relations is provided, learning is accomplished to the desired extent. Our analysis also indicates that spatio-temporal analysis is superior to spatial and temporal analyses and gives similar results to that of the knowledge-based approach.

40|$|AI {{planning}} engines require {{detailed specifications}} of dynamic {{knowledge of the}} domain {{in which they are}} to operate, before they can function. Further, they require domain-specific heuristics before they can function efficiently. The problem of formulating domain models containing dynamic knowledge regarding actions is a barrier to the widespread uptake of AI planning, because of the difficulty in acquiring and maintaining them. Here we postulate a method which inputs a partial domain model (one without knowledge of domain actions) and training solution sequences to planning tasks, and outputs the full domain model, including heuristics {{that can be used to}} make plan generation more efficient. To do this we extend GIPO’s Opmaker system [1] so that it can induce representations of actions from training sequences without <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> <b>information</b> and without requiring large numbers of examples. This method shows the potential for considerably reducing the burden of knowledge engineering, in that it would be possible to embed the method into an autonomous program (agent) which is required to do planning. We illustrate the algorithm as part of an overall method to acquire a planning domain model, and detail results that show the efficacy of the induced model...|$|E
50|$|Based {{upon the}} first and fourth theorem, {{workflow}} has {{to be separated from}} other action elements. These action elements must be isolated by <b>intermediate</b> <b>states,</b> and <b>information</b> systems have to react to states. A workflow element contains the sequence in which a number of action elements should be executed in order to fulfill a flow. A consequence of the stateful workflow elements is that state is required for every instance of use of an action element, and that the state therefore needs to be linked or be part of the instance of the data element serving as argument. We call this data element the life cycle data element of a flow.|$|R

An algorithm in which <b>intermediate</b> <b>states</b> are treated based on Whitehead's moment method is inspected, by taking {{examples of the}} double GT^+ transitions ^ 36 Ar→^ 36 S, ^ 54 Fe→^ 54 Cr and ^ 58 Ni→^ 58 Fe. This algorithm yields rapid convergence on the 2 νββ matrix-elements, even when neither relevant GT^+ nor GT^- strength distribution is convergent. A significant role of the shell structure is pointed out, which makes the 2 νββ matrix-elements highly dominated by the low-lying <b>intermediate</b> <b>states.</b> Experimental <b>information</b> of the low-lying GT^± strengths is strongly desired. Half-lives of T^ 2 ν_ 1 / 2 (EC/ EC; ^ 36 Ar→^ 36 S) = 1. 7 × 10 ^ 29 yr, T^ 2 ν_ 1 / 2 (EC/ EC;^ 54 Fe tarrow ^ 54 Cr) = 1. 5 × 10 ^ 27 yr,T^ 2 ν_ 1 / 2 (EC / EC;^ 58 Ni→^ 58 Fe) = 6. 1 × 10 ^ 24 yrand T^ 2 ν_ 1 / 2 (β^+/ EC;^ 58 Ni→^ 58 Fe) = 8. 6 × 10 ^ 25 yr are obtained from the present realistic shell-model calculation of the nuclear matrix-elements...|$|R

Participants considered {{the idea of this}} database, its structure, technical requirements, content, and principles of operation. This report presents the consensus conclusions from the workshop, key discussion points, and the goals and plan for near-term and intermediate-term development of the ISWdb. The main points of consensus from the workshop were: (1) This international database is of interest and of practical use for the shock-wave and high pressure physics communities; (2) <b>Intermediate</b> <b>state</b> <b>information</b> and off-Hugoniot information is important and should be included in ISWdb; (3) Other relevant high pressure and auxiliary data should be included to the database, in the future; (4) Information on the ISWdb needs to be communicated, broadly, to the research community; and (5) Operating structure will consist of an Advisory Board, subject-matter expert Moderators to vet submitted data, and the database Project Team. This brief report is intended to inform the shock-wave research community and interested funding agencies about the project, as its success, ultimately, depends on both of these groups finding sufficient value in the database to use it, contribute to it, and support it...|$|E
40|$|Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) {{planning}} {{is an effective}} yet knowledge intensive problem-solving technique. It requires humans to encode knowledge {{in the form of}} methods and action models. Methods describe how to decompose tasks into subtasks and the preconditions under which those methods are applicable whereas action mod-els describe how actions change the world. Encoding such knowledge is a difficult and time-consuming process, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose a new learning algorithm, called HTNLearn, to help acquire HTN methods and action mod-els. HTNLearn receives as input a collection of plan traces with partially annotated <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> <b>information,</b> and a set of annotated tasks that specify the conditions before and after the tasks ’ completion. In addition, plan traces are annotated with po-tentially empty partial decomposition trees that record the processes of decomposing tasks to subtasks. HTNLearn outputs are a collection of methods and action models. HTNLearn first encodes constraints about the methods and action models as a con-straint satisfaction problem, and then solves the problem using a weighted MAX-SAT solver. HTNLearn can learn methods and action models simultaneously from par-tially observed plan traces (i. e., plan traces where the intermediate states are partially observable). We test HTNLearn in several HTN domains. The experimental results show that our algorithm HTNLearn is both effective and efficient...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAutomated {{planning}} requires action models described using languages {{such as the}} Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as input, but building action {{models from}} scratch {{is a very difficult}} and time-consuming task, even for experts. This is because it is difficult to formally describe all conditions and changes, reflected in the preconditions and effects of action models. In the past, there have been algorithms that can automatically learn simple action models from plan traces. However, there are many cases in the real world where we need more complicated expressions based on universal and existential quantifiers, as well as logical implications in action models to precisely describe the underlying mechanisms of the actions. Such complex action models cannot be learned using many previous algorithms. In this article, we present a novel algorithm called LAMP (Learning Action Models from Plan traces), to learn action models with quantifiers and logical implications from a set of observed plan traces with only partially observed <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> <b>information.</b> The LAMP algorithm generates candidate formulas that are passed to a Markov Logic Network (MLN) for selecting the most likely subsets of candidate formulas. The selected subset of formulas is then transformed into learned action models, which can then be tweaked by domain experts to arrive at the final models. We evaluate our approach in four planning domains to demonstrate that LAMP is effective in learning complex action models. We also analyze the human effort saved by using LAMP in helping to create action models through a user study. Finally, we apply LAMP to a real-world application domain for software requirement engineering to help the engineers acquire software requirements and show that LAMP can indeed help experts a great deal in real-world knowledge-engineering applications...|$|E

This paper presents a motion planner that constructs a trajectory that passes at an <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> through a dynamic objective region, which is comprised of a certain lower dimensional submanifold in the configuration/velocity state space, and then returns to rest. Planning speed and reliability are greatly improved by finding good <b>intermediate</b> <b>states</b> first, because the choice of <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> couples the ramp-up and ramp-down subproblems, and moreover very few (often less than 1 %) <b>intermediate</b> <b>states</b> yield feasible solution trajectories.

40|$|Resonant inelastic x-ray {{scattering}} (RIXS) is a spectroscopic technique {{which has been}} widely used to study various elementary excitations in correlated and other condensed matter systems. For strongly correlated materials, besides boosting the overall signal the dependence of the resonant profile on incident photon energy is still not fully understood. Previous endeavors in connecting indirect RIXS, such as Cu K-edge for example where scattering takes place only via the core-hole created as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>state,</b> with the charge dynamical structure factor S(q,ω) neglected complicated dependence on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> configuration.

Our results are relevant to indirect RIXS in correlated materials, such as high Tc cuprates. We demonstrate that RIXS spectra {{can be reduced to}} S(q,ω) when there is no screening channel for the core-hole potential in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>state.</b> We also show that two-magnon excitations are highlighted at the resonant photon energy when the core-hole potential in the corresponding <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> is poorly screened.
