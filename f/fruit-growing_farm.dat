40|$|Mites are pests {{which can}} cause {{significant}} damage to apple orchards, especially during drought years. If the level of mite populations is not properly controlled, the leaves whiter and fall, the attacked trees become weaker, have small fruits and fail to form buds for the next year. Limiting the propagation of phytophagus mites populations by using specific acaricides has been inefficient, due to the mites capacity of rapidly developing breeds resistant to the acaricides that were used repeatedly. This paper contains and interprets data collected during 2008 â€“ 2009 concerning the testing of the biological efficacy for products with acaricide effect {{and their impact on}} useful species (predators and parasites). The experiment was conducted in the experimental polygon of SCDVV Blaj, the <b>fruit-growing</b> <b>farm</b> Aiud, on a 9 - 12 year old apple plantation cultivated with the varieties: Idared, Starkrimson, Jonathan and Florina. Treatments were performed before and after bloosom with: Demitan 200 SC 0. 06 % 0. 05 % Torque, Envidor 0. 5 %, Omit 57 is 0. 1 %, 0. 2 %Sanmite. When comparing products, the differences between them were significant. Efficiency coefficient ranged between 95 % and 27. 91 %. The obtained results revealed the selectivity of Demitan and Envidor products over the useful entomofauna present in the studied ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Ray (1998) has {{proposed}} a model for estimating scale efficiency using a parametric approach. Following this methodology, a scale efficiency measure is obtained from the estimated parameters of the production frontier function and from the estimated scale elasticities. This study aims to estimate technical and scale efficiencies achieved by the Italian citrus <b>fruit-growing</b> <b>farms.</b> A stochastic frontier production model is considered in order to estimate technical and scale efficiencies. The analysis is expected to estimate the role of both technical and scale efficiencies in conditioning productivity. Particular attention is put on determining the (technical and scale) inefficiency effects associated {{with a set of}} structural and environmental variables that should affect efficiency and on the relationship between technical and scale efficiency scores. Empirical findings suggest that the greater portion of overall inefficiency in the sample might depend on producing below the production frontier than on operating under an inefficient scale. Indeed, room for improving technical efficiency is, on average, larger (29 %) than the margin due to scale inefficiency (18. 2 %). Results also indicate a weak relationship between the two efficiency measures. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{constituency}} was {{a relatively}} prosperous, largely rural, Lowland seat, {{on the fringe of}} the Highlands, with successful livestock <b>farming,</b> <b>fruit-growing</b> and tourism interests, a combination of small towns and rich agricultural land, with relatively low unemployment. It included the towns of Pitlochry, Forfar and Blairgowrie. The south-western area, near the town of Perth, is the most populous.|$|R

Unemployment is relatively low and half the electorate lived in the town of Perth itself.|$|R
50|$|By the 1920s, steam trams {{operated}} between Cronulla and Sutherland, via Miranda. The {{trip from}} Miranda to Sutherland took fifteen minutes and cost three pence (2.5 cents). In 1923 {{there were five}} shops in Miranda, including a post office and butcher, {{at the intersection of}} the main road from Sutherland and Port Hacking Road. Settlements of returned soldiers from World War I were well established in Miranda at this time and the area was considered {{to be one of the}} best <b>fruit-growing</b> and poultry <b>farming</b> areas.|$|R
