40|$|A thick, bimodal {{segment of}} {{specific}} length and height between two single mode sections of a planar waveguide {{can serve as}} an integrated optical interferometer. It is realized by etching a wide strip form a guiding film. A vertically <b>guided,</b> <b>laterally</b> unguided beam of light is then made to traverse the strip perpendicularly. For {{a wide range of}} materials the structure can be dimensioned such that it shows the proper behavior of an interferometer: depending on the phase gain of the two modes in the thick region, the guided light interferes either almost completely destructively at the transition to the output segment, i. e. the power is radiated away into the substrate and cover regions, or constructively, i. e. most of the power passes the device. We believe that for certain applications structures of this kind can be a simple substitute for instruments like Mach-Zehnder interferometers or directional couplers. This is illustrated by two numerically simulated examples: A polarizer constructed from silicon based waveguides, which offers 30 dB polarization discrimination and 0. 1 dB insertion loss with a total length of only 10 micrometers, and a proposal for an integrated magneto optic isolator experiment, where the freedom in the lateral direction can be exploited for a proper tuning of the device...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMannesmann {{effect is}} studied using a hollow {{cylinder}} model, which is devised to analyze a hole expansion phenomenon in artificial roll piercing of a hollow cylindrical material by two barrel-type rolls without any <b>mandrel</b> and <b>guiding</b> tools. A rigid-thermoviscoplastic {{finite element method}} is employed with a special mesh generation scheme which can control the mesh density especially on the small hole surface. No damage model is used to soften the material and the hole expansion simulation is conducted without any additional assumptions about material and process. Artificial roll piercing processes {{for a wide range}} of hole diameters with outer diameter fixed are simulated with emphasis on hole expansion. It has been shown that the relative hole expansion ratio of the maximum hole diameter to the initial hole diameter increases as the initial hole diameter decreases, indicating that the hole expansion phenomenon is next to the Mannesmann effect occurring in actual roll piercing. It has been also shown that the hole expansion is related to the cavity formation occurring just after the material passes the mandrel nipple, which leads to the decrease in the pushing force exerted on the mandrel in an actual roll piercing process...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional {{photonic}} crystal structures not only confine light and <b>guide</b> waves <b>laterally</b> but also reflect {{light in the}} normal direction due to a slow Bloch mode effect.

40|$|Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) {{integrated}} circuit (IC) {{technology is the}} most commercially successful platform in modern electronic and control systems. So called "smart power" technologies such as Bipolar CMOS DMOS (BCD), combine the computational power of CMOS with high voltage transistors (~ 20 - 100 V) to enable the monolithic integration of advanced smart power applications used in e. g. automotive (car) applications, digital audio amplifiers, and integrated analog-digital systems. Many of such systems require data communication or signal transfer with galvanic isolation, for safety and interference reasons or to interface between low voltage digital parts and high voltage (power) components on an IC. Optocouplers transfer signals optically across a galvanically isolated channel. They can be operated {{for a wide range}} of data rates (including DC), and are less prone to external electromagnetic interference. Monolithic integration of such optocouplers in CMOS ICs require research and development of suitable light emitters and light detectors for an energy efficient, high speed, and cost effective operation of the system. This PhD thesis covers two broad aspects. Firstly, it deals with the physics, design, and analysis of efficient light emitting diodes (LEDs) in silicon CMOS technology. Silicon LEDs conventionally emit infrared light (~ 1100 nm), which is not compatible with the spectral detection efficiency of silicon photo-detectors. This is because silicon can efficiently detect light having wavelengths of less than ~ 1000 nm. Therefore the focus is on a specific design solution to this problem, where the LED is biased in "avalanche breakdown". In this situation, there exists a high electric field in the device, which is responsible for light being emitted at shorter wavelengths (400 nm- 900 nm). Such an emission, if properly <b>guided</b> <b>laterally</b> across the CMOS IC, would be detected by a silicon photodiode with a relatively high quantum efficiency. Wide-spectrum Si LEDs are promising for the integration of opto-electronics in CMOS. Secondly, this thesis analyzes the feasibility of realizing a monolithic optical link using silicon LEDs in a BCD silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS technology, from a device physics viewpoint. The optical coupling is treated as a conversion process from electrons to photons (in the LED) and back again to electrons (in the detector). Analysis is done from the viewpoint of coupling efficiency, where also the effect of heating across such a link due to high power dissipation in the avalanche-mode LED has been considered. Optical propagation via built-in waveguides in SOI technologies is also studied using Finite difference time-domain simulations. The analysis of this link is aimed at integrating avalanche-mode LEDs, which have the potential to be driven at high speeds (~ GHz), with single-photon sensitive optical detectors (e. g. using SPADs) ...|$|R

The other patient presented macroscopic hematuria on the first postoperative day, and urethral perforation was diagnosed by cystoscopy. The tape was seen passing through the urethra.

They were reoperated without further sequelae: In one patient, the tape was cut and covered with vaginal epithelium, and in another patient, only the tape was covered. There were no tape displacements. Neither heavy bleeding nor postoperative hematomas were reported. Three patients (1.6 %) had postoperative urinary infection before discharging; no other infections were diagnosed during the hospital stay.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the lifetime of}} magnetically trapped atoms above a planar, layered atom chip structure. Numerical calculations of the thermal magnetic noise spectrum are performed, based on the exact magnetic Green function and multi layer reflection coefficients. We have performed lifetime measurements where the centre of a side <b>guide</b> trap is <b>laterally</b> shifted {{with respect to the}} current carrying wire using additional bias fields. Comparing the experiment to theory, we find a fair agreement and demonstrate that for a chip whose topmost layer is metallic, the magnetic noise depends essentially on the thickness of that layer, as long as the layers below have a, much smaller conductivity; essentially the same magnetic noise would be obtained with a metallic membrane suspended in vacuum. Based on our theory we give general scaling laws of how to reduce the effect of surface magnetic noise on the trapped atoms...|$|R

Rear wheel steering vehicles include forklifts and backward moving conventional motor vehicles which are front wheel vehicles. A SSM for rear wheel steering vehicles would enable a forklift to move into any spaces using automation.

40|$|Typically, {{continuous}} filament composite components are fabricated using a filament winding technique. In this operation, fibers {{are introduced to}} a rotating <b>mandrel</b> while a <b>guide</b> holding the material traverses {{back and forth to}} place the material in a helical pattern over the surface of the mandrel. This procedure is continued until complete coverage is obtained. An alternative method for fabricating {{continuous filament}} composite components is braiding. In the braiding operation a mandrel is traversed {{through the center of the}} braider while 144 strands of material traverse around a carrier ring. As the fibers are applied to a mandrel surface, 72 carriers holding the fibers travel clockwise, while another 72 carriers travel counterclockwise to interlock fibers. An additional 72 carriers located on the back of the braider introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite giving the composite lateral strength. The goal of using the braider is to reduce production time by simultaneously applying 144 strands of material onto a mandrel as opposed to the four-strand wrapping most filament winding techniques offer. Benefits to braiding include the ability to (1) introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite structure; (2) fabricate non-symmetric components without using complex functions to produce full coverage; and (3) produce a component with a higher degree of damage tolerance due to the interlocking of fibers. The fabrication of bore evacuator chambers for a tank cannon system is investigated by utilizing a 144 carrier braiding machine, an industrial robot, and a resin applicator system...|$|R
40|$|The Institute of Flight Guidance of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Braunschweig is {{involved}} in the EU project OPTIMAL. One of the objectives was to demonstrate the rotorcraft system’s 4 D flight guidance capabilities. For these advanced interoperability flight trials the FHS (Flying Helicopter Simulator) – the highly modified Eurocopter EC 135 T 1 research helicopter from DLR - is equipped with an SBAS receiver and a special 4 D-capable experimental rotorcraft flight management system (FMS) using also a 4 D referenced flight guidance. SBAS offers a performance comparable to an ILS CAT I without requiring any specific installation on ground and consequently is well adapted to rotorcraft IFR operations at isolated helipads like for example hospitals or helidecks. In the framework of the flight trials the practical flyability of the helicopter-specific steep and curved time referenced IFR approach procedure should be confirmed. The approach procedures were initially developed for Bremen airport (EDDW). Vertical guidance allows a precise height control throughout the final descent and reduces the risk of collision with terrain at night or in bad weather conditions. Approaches with vertical guidance are known as being much safer than <b>laterally</b> <b>guided</b> NPAs referring to worldwide aircraft accident statistics. The paper will provide an analysis of the flight results which promise very good navigation accuracies regarding time-based 4 D-curved approaches.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{revision}} and a seismotectonic interpretation of deep crust strike–slip earthquake sequences {{that occurred in}} 1990 – 1991 in the Southern Apennines (Potenza area). The revision is motivated by: i) the striking similarity to a seismic sequence that occurred in 2002 ∼ 140 km NNW, in an analogous tectonic context (Molise area), suggesting a common seismotectonic environment of regional importance; ii) the close proximity of such deep strike–slip seismicity with shallow extensional seismicity (Apennine area); and iii) the {{lack of knowledge about}} the mechanical properties of the crust that might justify the observed crustal seismicity. A comparison between the revised 1990 – 1991 earthquakes and the 2002 earthquakes, as well as the integration of seismological data with a rheological analysis offer new constraints on the regional seismotectonic context of crustal seismicity in the Southern Apennines. The seismological revision consists of a relocation of the aftershock sequences based on newly constrained velocity models. New focal mechanisms of the aftershocks are computed and the active state of stress is constrained via the use of a stress inversion technique. The relationships among the observed seismicity, the crustal structure of the Southern Apennines, and the rheological layering are analysed along a crustal section crossing southern Italy, by computing geotherms and two-mechanism (brittle frictional vs. ductile plastic strength) rheological profiles. The 1990 – 1991 seismicity is concentrated in a well-defined depth range (mostly between 15 and 23 km depths). This depth range corresponds to the upper pat of the middle crust underlying the Apulian sedimentary cover, in the footwall of the easternmost Apennine thrust system. The 3 D distribution of the aftershocks, the fault kinematics, and the stress inversion indicate the activation of a right-lateral strike–slip fault striking N 100 °E under a stress field characterized by a sub-horizontal N 142 °-trending σ 1 and a sub-horizontal N 232 °-trending σ 3, very similar to the known stress field of the Gargano seismic zone in the Apulian foreland. The apparent anomalous depths of the earthquakes (N 15 km) and the confinement within a relatively narrow depth range are explained by the crustal rheology, which consists of a strong brittle layer at mid crustal depths sandwiched between two plastic horizons. This articulated rheological stratification is typical of {{the central part of the}} Southern Apennine crust, where the Apulian crust is overthrusted by Apennine units. Both the Potenza 1990 – 1991 and the Molise 2002 seismic sequences can be interpreted to be due to crustal E–W fault zones within the Apulian crust inherited from previous tectonic phases and overthrusted by Apennine units during the Late Pliocene–Middle Pleistocene. The present strike–slip tectonic regime reactivated these fault zones and caused them to move with an uneven mechanical behaviour; brittle seismogenic faulting is confined to the strong brittle part of the middle crust. This strong brittle layer might also act as a stress <b>guide</b> able to <b>laterally</b> transmit the deviatoric stresses responsible for the strike–slip regime in the Apulian crust and may explain the close proximity (nearly overlapping) of the strike–slip and normal faulting regimes in the Southern Apennines. From a methodological point of view, it seems that rather simple two-mechanism rheological profiles, though affected by uncertainties, are still a useful tool for estimating the rheological properties and likely seismogenic behaviour of the crust...|$|R
40|$|Presently, {{precision}} {{approaches of}} aircraft to airports with vertical and lateral guidance are only conducted as straight in approaches {{with a single}} glide path, mostly using VHF radio navigation technology. Here, the final approach track is usually several kilometers long (10 nautical miles) and cannot be changed due to the linear propagation of radio signals. Using the technology of augmented Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) this final approach path can be made more flexible with several curved and straight segments with different vertical profiles in order to enable a safe descent with vertical guidance also in mountainous terrain, around obstacles or for noise abatement. Currently, a special type of <b>laterally</b> <b>guided</b> curved approaches is already implemented in very few places. This type of approach procedure is called Required Navigation Performance Authorization Required and is usually only available for specially approved operators. Here, the lateral guidance during the approach is usually based on a position solution provided by satellite navigation systems in conjunction with inertial navigation systems and the vertical guidance is still based on measurements of a barometric altimeter. This type of approach with vertical guidance is supposed to enhance the situational awareness for pilots compared to non-precision approach procedures (no vertical guidance) and reduce the risk for controlled flight into terrain. However, {{the accuracy of the}} barometric vertical guidance is inferior compared to precision approach procedures, temperature dependent and requires the correct pressure setting for each approach in the aircraft. Therefore, novel curved approach procedures should rely solely on satellite navigation augmented by either a ground based or satellite based system and only optionally by inertial measurement systems. When augmentation systems provide additional accuracy and integrity improvements, a vertical component of the position can be computed. Together with a predefined path, this highly accurate position solution can enable curved approaches with a vertical glide path guidance down to the required minimum obstacle clearance (200 ft above ground). Using a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) at the airport, one or more Terminal Area Paths (TAP) could be broadcast to provide precision guidance to aircraft maneuvering in the terminal area. Such a use of the system would allow the provision of multiple curved approaches to multiple runway ends with only one ground installation and as such save cost to the airport and airline operator whilst providing the added benefit of noise abatement and enhanced obstacle clearance. The transmission of multiple curved or segmented steep approaches enables approaching aircraft to select the approach path most suitable for the given situation. An experimental GBAS station was installed at the research airport in Braunschweig. Data processing complied with the currently proposed requirements to support automatic landings. Corrections for GPS measurements and integrity parameters were sent to a research aircraft which was equipped with an experimental GPS receiver providing raw measurement data. The received data and measurements were then processed on board in real-time and provide approach guidance information to the experimental pilot in form of a flight director indication. To evaluate system performance the authors create a truth reference track from a post processed carrier phase solution. Finally, the GBAS outputs and the received ILS signals are compared to the truth reference. The system performed well within all specifications and showed full availability at all times during the flight. Compared to ILS, GBAS is significantly more precise and shows almost no nois...|$|R
