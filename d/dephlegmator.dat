5000|$|By {{controlling}} {{the temperature of}} the condenser, often called a <b>dephlegmator,</b> a reflux still may be used to ensure that higher boiling point components are returned to the flask while lighter elements are passed out to a secondary condenser. This is useful in producing high quality alcoholic beverages, while ensuring that less desirable components (such as fusel alcohols) are returned to the primary flask. For high quality neutral spirits (such as vodka), or post distillation flavored spirits (gin, absinthe), a process of multiple distillations or charcoal filtering may be applied to obtain a product lacking in any suggestion of its original source material for fermentation. The geometry of the still also plays a role in determining how much reflux occurs. In a pot still, if the tube leading from the boiler to the condenser, the lyne arm, is angled upward, more liquid {{will have a chance to}} condense and flow back into the boiler leading to increased reflux. Typical results can increase production as high as 50% over the basic worm type condenser. The addition of a copper [...] "boiling ball" [...] in the path creates an area where expansion of gasses into the ball causes cooling and subsequent condensation and reflux. In a column still, the addition of inert materials in the column (e.g., packing) creates surfaces for early condensation and leads to increased reflux.|$|E

The current work is targeted {{on the investigation}} of vapor absorption refrigeration (VAR) parameters on overall energy utilization factor (EUF). The <b>dephlegmator</b> heat is recovered internally in VAR instead of rejecting to environment. This work {{can be used to}} control the operational conditions of VAR to enhance the desalination and cooling together. The studied process parameters in VAR are strong solution concentration, separator or generator temperature, <b>dephlegmator</b> effectiveness, circulating water inlet temperature and evaporator temperature. Out of these five variables, lower limit of separator temperature, upper limit of <b>dephlegmator</b> effectiveness and lower limit of circulating water temperature are fixed in the specified range to attain the optimum strong solution concentration and optimum evaporator temperature. At the specified boundaries of three variables, the optimized strong solution concentration and evaporator temperature are 0. 47 and 10 °C respectively. At this condition, the maximized cycle EUF is 0. 358...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. This study {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} power plant incorporating a steam turbine and a direct air-cooled dry/wet condenser operating at different ambient temperatures. The proposed cooling system uses existing A-frame air-cooled condenser (ACC) technology and through {{the introduction of a}} hybrid (dry/wet) dephiegmator achieves measurable enhancement in cooling performance when temperatures are high. In order to determine the thermal-flow performance characteristics of the wet section of the <b>dephlegmator,</b> tests are conducted on an evaporative cooler. From the experimental results, correlations for the water film heat transfer coefficient, air-water mass transfer coefficient and the air-side pressure drop over a deluged tube bundle are developed. During periods of high ambient temperatures the hybrid (dry/wet) condenser operating in a wet mode can achieve the same increased turbine performance as an oversized air-cooled condenser or an air-cooled condenser rith adiabatic cooling (spray cooling) of the inlet air at a considerably lower cost. For the same turbine power output the water consumed by an air-cooled condenser incorporating a hybrid (dry/wet) <b>dephlegmator</b> is at least 20 % less than an air- cooled condenser with adiabatic cooling of the inlet air.

40|$|Batch {{distillation}} {{applied to}} hydrous ethanol fuel (HEF) production {{on a small}} scale still requires operating conditions that ensure optimal top product quality and productivity. The aim {{of this study is to}} statistically validate a batch still through the employment of response surface methodology (RSM). Operational and productivity parameters were formulated in order to guarantee quality compliance with the legal requirements for the top product concentration, besides providing support information to control the production of HEF {{on a small scale}}. The reboiler control and <b>dephlegmator</b> temperatures maintained within the range of 97. 5 to 99. 5 °C and 60 to 70 °C, respectively, combined with a variable reflux ratio, was satisfactory in obtaining a top product concentration, in accordance with legal regulations, as well as high productivity.

40|$|Three {{applications}} of two-phase flow and heat transfer in plate-fin heat exchangers have been studied. A <b>dephlegmator</b> is a heat exchanger in which reflux condensation of a vapour mixture occurs, and plate-fln versions have importance in cryogenic gas separation processes. Numerical calculations for different binary mixtures {{show that the}} number of transfer units can be expressed as a simple function of the inlet vapour state and flow rate, heat load, and channel geometry. The calculations also show that the vapour and liquid exit compositions tend to limiting values as the number of transfer units increase. These limiting values correspond to liquid leaving the exchanger in equilibrium with the vapour entering. The effect of surface tension on liquid running down the rectangular passages of plate-fin exchangers is to draw it to the corners leaving less liquid on the walls and possible dry-out. A comparison of two CFD calculations with and without surface tension shows that effect can be significant. For a liquid with a surface tension only 1...|$|E
40|$|First {{and second}} law {{analysis}} {{have been conducted}} for three low temperature driven ammonia-water absorption cooling cycles with increasing internal heat recovery. Based {{on the results of}} exergy analysis the structural analysis has been achieved. The obtained Coefficients of Structural Bonds (CSB) consider how the irreversibility of the whole cycle is affected by a change in the irreversibility related to an efficiency improvement of a single component. Trends for the different configurations are similar, while quantitative differences among the main heat exchangers are considerable. The highest values of the CSB are found for the refrigerant heat exchanger. Also the evaporator, the condenser, the generator and the absorber show values higher than unity. The lowest CSB&rsquo;s are obtained in the solution heat exchanger. In general, CSB&rsquo;s decrease with increasing efficiency. That means that for very efficient heat exchangers, a further improvement looks less attractive. The <b>dephlegmator</b> is an exception as it shows a singularity of the CSB value due to its complex interactions with the other components. Once the CSB&rsquo;s are obtained for the main components, they can be used in the structural method of the thermoeconomic optimisation. This method enables us to find the optimum design of a component in a straightforward calculation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Air Cooled {{condensers}} {{were first}} introduced in US power industry in early 1970 ’s, but only during last 10 - 15 years {{number of installations}} greatly increased largely due to growing attention being paid to environmental safety. Also, growing demand for water for both domestic and industrial use has brought an increased interest in use of Air Cooled condensers. This is a review paper which studies the performance of Air-cooled condenser under various operating conditions {{it is found that}} there is degradation in performance of air cooled condenser under high ambient temperatures and windy conditions. The heat rejection rate of ACC also depends on surface condition of fins and thus its performance is reduced due to external fouling of finned tubes due to weather conditions and by internal fouling from condensate (Ammonia corrosion). A Hybrid (dry/wet) <b>dephlegmator</b> achieves major enhancement in performance when ambient temperatures are high. Also shading of condensers is done for air-conditioning units to mitigate the adverse effect of high ambient temperatures due to solar radiation. Now a day’s wind walls are used to reduce the effect of high wind velocity. second option is to increase the fan speed Fin cleaning {{plays an important role in}} heat rejection. External cleaning improves air side heat transfer coefficient. In order to improve the performance of an ACC Flat tubes inclined at some angle to horizontal can also be used in place of conventional circular horizontal tubes so that an improvement in heat transfer rate occurs...|$|E
40|$|A methode {{for obtaining}} second law analysis, {{of heat and}} mass {{transfer}} unit operations between two fluid streams, is presented. For single phase heat exchangers, the heat exchanger temperature characteristic Th =Th (Tc) is introduced where Th and Tc stands for the stream temperature of the hot and cold stream along the heat exchanging surface. If the two streams involve two-phase fluids, additional information is needed to define the vapour content and the existing deviations from the equilibrium. This can be given by the vapour/liquid ratio and the relevant fluid temperature characteristic Tv =Tv (Tl) connecting the vapour and the liquid temperature of the corresponding phases of each stream. A non-equilibrium vapour-liquid mixture can be represented by its corresponding equilibrium state and a non-equilibrium-equilibrium deviation (NED) measured by the corresponding entropy difference. It is shown, how the two streams of the heat exchanger can be combined to form an equivalent single stream representing the behaviour of the heat exchanger. The same approach is extended further to include the mass transfer operations between two-phase binary mixture streams. In this case {{in addition to the}} temperature characteristic mentioned above, the mass fraction characteristic for the liquid-vapour coexisting phases are needed or, instead of that, the temperature characteristics of liquid and vapour {{as a function of the}} local equilibrium temperature. It is shown how the equivalent single stream can be obtained and the special cases of evaporator, absorber, rectificator, condenser and <b>dephlegmator</b> are considered in brief. Combination of such equivalent single streams, compose the description of complex thermodynamic cycles as for instance is the cycle of non-equilibrium absorption refrigeration. © 1989 VDI Verlag GmbH...|$|E

A comparison of two CFD calculations with and without surface tension shows that effect can be significant. For a liquid with a surface tension only 1 % that of water, about 50 % more mass flows down the corner region of a square duct of side 0. 944 mm. This transfer of liquid to the corner takes place in the first millimetre of flow downwards. Experimental measurements of pressure drop were taken for air and air-water flow through eight different plate-fin pads. The two-phase pressure drops for the serrated fin were two to five times larger than those for the plain fin. However, the effect of increasing the water flow rate at a fixed air flow rate was to increase the pressure drop by up to 75 % in both cases. Over 200 two-phase pressure drops measurements were made, nearly all of the data were predicted to within 20 % by the Lockhart and Martinelli (1949) correlation with C factor of 12.
