40|$|Recent {{developments}} in sub-Saharan Africa highlight an increasing trend toward liberalized domestic markets and foreign trade. To {{take advantage of}} these developments, small-scale farmers must be able to participate in productive activities in which they have a competitive advantage. This implies access to well-organized marketing, distribution and post-harvest systems; effective market information; and technologies that allow them to be price and quality competitive. An outline is given of an ongoing strategic partnership between the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, and TechnoServe Inc., an international non-profit business development organization, and their work with a range of public and private sector actors to improve the incentives for smallholders to produce high-quality pigeon peas targeted at high-value niche markets differentiated by quality standards. In Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania, smallholder farmers are being linked to different niche markets through a range of institutional and market arrangements. A regional strategy to introduce new technologies, along with simple and easily administered quality standards based on end-user needs, can help farmers, traders and exporters to benefit from niche markets that demand higher quality standards than the traditional export market for <b>fair</b> <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> (FAQ) grain. ...|$|E

The author assumed that a consumer can buy or lease a new car, or he/she can buy a used or a CPO car. While, like Kim (1985), the author assumed {{that the quality of}} a car depends on the maintenance level, the maintenance level in this model is chosen when a car is still a 'new' car, i. e. after the warranty ends. The model implied that the <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> of traded used cars can be either higher or lower than the <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> of nontraded used cars.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the roles of}} the level and variability in quality in driving customer retention for a new service. We present model-free evidence that while high <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> helps in retaining customers, high variability leads to higher termination rates. Apart from these main effects, we use model-free evidence to document the presence of (a) an interaction effect between <b>average</b> service <b>quality</b> and its variability on termination rates, (b) customer learning about service quality over time, and (c) slower rate of learning among households that experience high variability. We postulate a mechanism involving risk aversion and learning, which can induce this interaction effect and test this against several alternative explanations. We show {{that it is important to}} consider variability in quality while inferring the impact of improvements to <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> - ignoring the interaction effect between <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> and variability leads 18 % to 64 % (5 % to 31 %) overestimation (underestimation) of quality improvement elasticities among high-variability (low-variability) households. Given that responsiveness to quality decreases with variability, it is better for the firm to focus quality improvement efforts on customers experiencing low variability; increasing <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> by 1 % lowers termination by 1. 1 % for low-variability households, but only by 0. 41 % for high-variability households...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explains}} the multifacet technology for analyzing performance examinations and the <b>fair</b> <b>average</b> method of setting criterion standards. The multidimensional nature of performance examinations requires that multiple and often different facets {{elements of a}} candidate's examination form be accounted for in the analysis. After this is accomplished, all candidate ability estimates are located on the same scale. The <b>fair</b> <b>average</b> standard setting method, while substantially different from more traditional methods, provides a criterion standard in a score metric that is easy for most people to understand. Yet, it accounts for {{the influence of the}} particular facets elements in each test form, and can be used to establish a pass point that applies appropriately to all candidates regardless of the raters or tasks or problems on each candidate's examination.

A monopoly platform {{is more likely to}} exclude low-quality users when users place more value on <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> and less value on total quantity. With competing platforms, the effect of user preferences for quantity is reversed. Furthermore, exclusion incentives depend in a non-trivial way on the proportion of high-quality users in the overall population and on their opportunity cost of joining the platform relative to low-quality users. The net effect of these two parameters depends on whether they have a stronger impact on the gains from exclusion (higher <b>average</b> <b>quality)</b> or on its costs (lower quantity) ...|$|R

The denomination and vintage of a wine {{as well as}} the specific characteristics of a particular wine will be used. However, the specific characteristics of a wine are difficult to ascertain ex ante given the enormous product variety. The reputation of a denomination will thus be an important guide for consumers. Reputation is a function of <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> as revealed by past performance of producers in a specific geographically defined denomination. The impact of past performance increases over time, since producers associate improved <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> as an important factor in enhancing the price, but this necessitates monitoring of members in the denomination.

Furthermore Tuscan red wines are easily comparable because of great similarities in climate and choice of grape varieties, soil and exposure to sun etc. We show that new denominations have a lower <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> score and that price differentials between denominations roughly correspond to differences in <b>average</b> <b>quality,</b> althoug...|$|R
