5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and <b>fibrinolysis.</b> The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} marked by the {{problems}} of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered blood clotting. These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial glycocalyx, which acts as a molecular filter of blood components. Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) {{are thought to be}} caused by an immune system response. Other processes of interest include infected cells that become necrotic—which affect both coagulation and <b>fibrinolysis</b> (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced <b>fibrinolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of <b>fibrinolysis,</b> is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fibrinolysis</b> is the {{physiological}} breakdown of blood clots by enzymes such as plasmin.|$|E
25|$|Aprotinin is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of several serine proteases, specifically trypsin, chymotrypsin and plasmin at {{a concentration of}} about 125,000 IU/ml, and kallikrein at 300,000 IU/ml. Its action on kallikrein leads to the inhibition {{of the formation of}} factor XIIa. As a result, both the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and <b>fibrinolysis</b> are inhibited. Its action on plasmin independently slows <b>fibrinolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{deficiency}} of PAI-1 has been reported; as <b>fibrinolysis</b> is not suppressed adequately, {{it leads to}} a hemorrhagic diathesis (a tendency to hemorrhage).|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{blood clots}} are reorganised and resorbed {{by a process}} termed <b>fibrinolysis.</b> The main enzyme {{responsible}} for this process (plasmin) is regulated by various activators and inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|The cause(s) of {{dry socket}} are not {{completely}} understood. Normally, following extraction of a tooth, blood is extravasated into the socket, and a blood clot (thrombus) forms. This blood clot is replaced with granulation tissue which consists of proliferating fibroblasts and endothelial cells derived from remnants of the periodontal membrane, surrounding alveolar bone and gingival mucosa. In time this in turn is replaced by coarse, fibrillar bone and finally by mature, woven bone. The clot may fail to form because of poor blood supply (e.g., secondary to local factors such as smoking, anatomical site, bone density and conditions which cause sclerotic bone to form). The clot may be lost because of excessive mouth rinsing, or disintegrate prematurely due to <b>fibrinolysis.</b> <b>Fibrinolysis</b> is the degeneration of the clot and {{may be caused by}} the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and formation of kinins. Factors which promote <b>fibrinolysis</b> include local trauma, estrogens, and pyrogens from bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Tranexamic {{acid and}} aminocaproic acid inhibit <b>fibrinolysis,</b> {{and lead to}} a de facto reduced {{bleeding}} rate. Before its withdrawal, aprotinin was used in some forms of major surgery to decrease bleeding risk and need for blood products.|$|E
25|$|Circulation or {{clotting}} conditions, such as peripheral vascular disease, polycythemia vera, sickle-cell anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation, antiphospholipid antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, plasminogen or <b>fibrinolysis</b> disorders, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, or antithrombin III deficiency.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1 is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) that functions {{as the principal}} inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA), the activators of plasminogen and hence <b>fibrinolysis</b> (the physiological breakdown of blood clots). It is a {{serine protease}} inhibitor (serpin) protein (SERPINE1).|$|E
25|$|Under homeostatic conditions, {{the body}} is {{maintained}} in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and <b>fibrinolysis.</b> The activation of the coagulation cascade yields thrombin that converts fibrinogen to fibrin; the stable fibrin clot being the final product of hemostasis. The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down fibrinogen and fibrin. Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin (in the presence of thrombin), {{which is responsible for}} the lysis of fibrin clots. The breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin results in polypeptides called fibrin degradation products (FDPs) or fibrin split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis, the presence of plasmin is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is also necessary for the breakdown of clots, or <b>fibrinolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{inflammatory}} {{conditions in}} which fibrin is deposited in tissues, PAI-1 appears to {{play a significant role}} in the progression to fibrosis (pathological formation of connective tissue). Presumably, lower PAI levels would lead to less suppression of <b>fibrinolysis</b> and conversely a more rapid degradation of the fibrin.|$|E
25|$|Plasmin is a serine {{protease}} that acts to dissolve fibrin blood clots. Apart from <b>fibrinolysis,</b> plasmin proteolyses proteins in various other systems: It activates collagenases, some mediators of the complement system and weakens {{the wall of}} the Graafian follicle (leading to ovulation). It cleaves fibrin, fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor. Plasmin, like trypsin, belongs to the family of {{serine protease}}s.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} {{endotoxin}} is the {{mechanism by which}} Gram-negative sepsis provokes DIC. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, treatment causes the destruction of leukemic granulocyte precursors, resulting in the release of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes from their storage granules, causing microvascular damage. Other malignancies may enhance the expression of various oncogenes that result in the release of TF and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which prevents <b>fibrinolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of proteases is inhibited by protease inhibitors. One example of protease inhibitors is the serpin superfamily. It includes alpha 1-antitrypsin (which protects {{the body from}} excessive effects its own inflammatory proteases), alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (which does likewise), C1-inhibitor (which protects the body from excessive protease-triggered activation of its own complement system), antithrombin (which protects the body from excessive coagulation), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (which protects the body from inadequate coagulation by blocking protease-triggered <b>fibrinolysis),</b> and neuroserpin.|$|E
25|$|Thromboelastometry (TEM), {{previously}} named rotational thromboelastography (ROTEG) or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), is {{an established}} viscoelastic method for hemostasis testing in whole blood. It is {{a modification of}} traditional thromboelastography (TEG). TEM investigates the interaction of coagulation factors, their inhibitors, anticoagulant drugs, blood cells, specifically platelets, during clotting and subsequent <b>fibrinolysis.</b> The rheological conditions mimic the sluggish flow of blood in veins. TEM is performed with the ROTEM whole blood analyzer (Tem Innovations GmbH, Munich) and is an enhancement of thrombelastography, originally described by H. Hartert in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Impaired liver {{synthesis}} of clotting factors, low-grade <b>fibrinolysis,</b> and intravascular coagulation {{are typical of}} ALF. Thrombocytopenia is common and may also be dysfunctional. Replacement therapy is recommended only {{in the setting of}} bleeding or prior to an invasive procedure. Vitamin K can be given to treat an abnormal prothrombin time, regardless of whether there is poor nutritional status. Administration of recombinant factor VIIa has shown promise; however, this treatment approach requires further study. The use of gastrointestinal hemorrhage prophylaxis with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker, proton pump inhibitor, or sucralfate is recommended.|$|E
25|$|Several toxins and {{secreted}} enzymes {{have been}} identified in Streptococcus dysgalactiae, including the haemolysins Streptolysin O (SLO) and Streptolysin S (SLS), and a correlation between the expression of SLO and SLS and disease severity has been inferred. speGdys, a homolog of the S.pyogenes superantigen speG, has been documented in some S.dysgalactiae strains. However, it only appears to possess superantigen-capabilities in animals, and its relevance in human disease has yet to be elucidated. Streptokinase appears to be ubiquitous in S.dysgalactiae, enabling <b>fibrinolysis</b> and aiding in bacterial spreading through tissues.|$|E
25|$|Coagulopathy {{is another}} {{cardinal}} feature of ALF. The liver has {{the central role}} in the synthesis of almost all coagulation factors and some inhibitors of coagulation and <b>fibrinolysis.</b> Hepatocellular necrosis leads to impaired synthesis of many coagulation factors and their inhibitors. The former produces a prolongation in prothrombin time which is widely used to monitor the severity of hepatic injury. There is significant platelet dysfunction (with both quantitative and qualitative platelet defects). Progressive thrombocytopenia with the loss of larger and more active platelets is almost universal. Thrombocytopenia with or without DIC increases risk of intracerebral bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, excess {{circulating}} thrombin {{assists in}} {{the conversion of}} plasminogen to plasmin, resulting in <b>fibrinolysis.</b> The breakdown of clots results in an excess of FDPs, which have powerful anticoagulant properties, contributing to hemorrhage. The excess plasmin also activates the complement and kinin systems. Activation of these systems leads {{to many of the}} clinical symptoms that patients experiencing DIC exhibit, such as shock, hypotension, and increased vascular permeability. The acute form of DIC is considered an extreme expression of the intravascular coagulation process with a complete breakdown of the normal homeostatic boundaries. DIC is associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy-induced {{hypercoagulability}} {{is probably}} a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent post partum hemorrhage. Pregnancy changes the plasma levels of many clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, which can rise up to three times its normal value. Thrombin levels increase. Protein S, an anticoagulant, decreases. However, the other major anticoagulants, protein C and antithrombin III, remain constant. <b>Fibrinolysis</b> is impaired {{by an increase in}} plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 or PAI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), the latter synthesized from the placenta. Venous stasis may occur {{at the end of the}} first trimester, due to enhanced compliance of the vessel walls by a hormonal effect.|$|E
25|$|Urokinase is used {{clinically}} as a thrombolytic {{agent in}} the treatment of severe or massive deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and occluded intravenous or dialysis cannulas. It is also administered intrapleurally to improve the drainage of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. Urokinase is marketed as Abbokinase or Kinlytic and competes with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (e.g., alteplase) as a thrombolytic drug in infarction. However, urokinase is not very selective for clot-bound plasminogen, unlike tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which preferentially interacts with clot-bound plasminogen. Because urokinase binds about equally to freely circulating plasminogen and clot-bound plasminogen, it causes significant fibrinogenolysis and clot <b>fibrinolysis</b> making its use less favorable than TPA.|$|E
25|$|Heavy metals such as {{lead and}} cadmium have {{been implicated in}} osteoporosis. Cadmium and lead {{promotes}} the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) which is the major inhibitor of <b>fibrinolysis</b> (the mechanism by which the body breaks down clots) and {{shown to be a}} cause of hypofibrinolysis. Persistent blood clots can lead to congestive blood flow (hyperemia) in bone marrow, impaired blood flow and ischaemia in bone tissue resulting in lack of oxygen (hypoxia), bone cell damage and eventual cell death (apoptosis). Of significance {{is the fact that the}} average concentration of cadmium in human bones in the 20th century has increased to about 10 times above the pre-industrial level.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria may {{secondarily}} colonize the socket, {{and lead}} to further dissolution of the clot. Bacterial breakdown and <b>fibrinolysis</b> are widely accepted as a major contributing factors {{to the loss of}} the clot. Bone tissue is exposed to the oral environment, and a localized inflammatory reaction takes place in the adjacent marrow spaces. This localizes the inflammation to the walls of the socket, which become necrotic. The necrotic bone in the socket walls is slowly separated by osteoclasts and fragmentary sequestra may form. The bones of the jaws seem to have some evolutionary resistance to this process. When bone is exposed at other sites in the human body, this is a much more serious condition.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1's main {{function}} entails the inhibition of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), an enzyme {{responsible for the}} cleavage of plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin mediates the degradation of the extracellular matrix either by itself or in conjunction with matrix metalloproteinases. In this scenario, PAI-1 inhibits uPA via active site binding, preventing the formation of plasmin. Additional inhibition is mediated by PAI-1 binding to the uPA/uPA receptor complex, resulting in the latter's degradation. Thus, PAI {{can be said to}} inhibit the serine proteases tPA and uPA/urokinase, and hence is an inhibitor of <b>fibrinolysis,</b> the physiological process that degrades blood clots. In addition, PAI-1 inhibits the activity of matrix metalloproteinases, which {{play a crucial role in}} invasion of malignant cells through the basal lamina.|$|E
25|$|Prognosis {{depends on}} the amount of lung that is {{affected}} and on the co-existence of other medical conditions; chronic embolisation to the lung can lead to pulmonary hypertension. After a massive PE, the embolus must be resolved somehow if the patient is to survive. In thrombotic PE, the blood clot may be broken down by <b>fibrinolysis,</b> or it may be organized and recanalized so that a new channel forms through the clot. Blood flow is restored most rapidly in the first day or two after a PE. Improvement slows thereafter and some deficits may be permanent. There is controversy over whether small subsegmental PEs need treatment at all and some evidence exists that patients with subsegmental PEs may do well without treatment.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} types of {{distributive}} shock. The most common, septic shock, is caused by an infection, most frequently by bacteria, but viruses, fungi and parasites have been implicated. Infection sites most {{likely to lead to}} septic shock are chest, abdomen and genitourinary tract. In septic shock the blood flow in the microvasculature is abnormal with some capillaries underperfused and others with normal to high blood flow. The endothelial cells lining the blood vessels become less responsive to vasocontrictive agents, lose their glycocalyx (normal coating) and negative ionic charge, become leaky and cause extensive over-expression of nitric oxide. The coagulation cascade is also disrupted. Tissue factor that initiates the clotting cascade is produced by activated monocytes and the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels while antithrombin and <b>fibrinolysis</b> are impaired. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can result from the thrombin produced in the inflammatory response. The ability of red blood cells to change shape decreases and their tendency to clump together increases, inhibiting their flow through the microvasculature.|$|E
25|$|Lp(a) is {{assembled}} at the hepatocyte {{cell membrane}} surface, while other scenarios exist {{with regard to}} the location of assembly. It mainly exists in plasma. Lp(a) contributes to the process of atherogenesis. Because of its structural similarity to plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, competitive inhibition leads to reduced <b>fibrinolysis,</b> {{and as a result of}} the stimulation of secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, Lp(a) leads to thrombogenesis. It may also enhance coagulation by inhibiting the function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Lp(a) carries cholesterol and binds atherogenic proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids as a preferential carrier of oxidized phospholipids in human plasma, which attract inflammatory cells to vessel walls and leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, Lp(a) is also hypothesized to be involved in wound healing and tissue repair, interacting with components of the vascular wall and extra cellular matrix. Apo(a), a distinct feature of the Lp(a) particle, binds to immobilized fibronectin and endows Lp(a) with the serine-proteinase-type proteolytic activity.|$|E
25|$|In DIC, the {{processes}} of coagulation and <b>fibrinolysis</b> are dysregulated, {{and the result is}} widespread clotting with resultant bleeding. Regardless of the triggering event of DIC, once initiated, the pathophysiology of DIC is similar in all conditions. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of a transmembrane glycoprotein called tissue factor (TF). TF is present on the surface of many cell types (including endothelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes) and is not normally in contact with the general circulation, but is exposed to the circulation after vascular damage. For example, TF is released in response to exposure to cytokines (particularly interleukin 1), tumor necrosis factor, and endotoxin. This {{plays a major role in}} the development of DIC in septic conditions. TF is also abundant in tissues of the lungs, brain, and placenta. This helps to explain why DIC readily develops in patients with extensive trauma. Upon exposure to blood and platelets, TF binds with activated factor VIIa (normally present in trace amounts in the blood), forming the extrinsic tenase complex. This complex further activates factor IX and X to IXa and Xa, respectively, leading to the common coagulation pathway and the subsequent formation of thrombin and fibrin.|$|E
25|$|Its use is {{endorsed}} by the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms {{as long as there}} are not other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome. When administered within the first three hours thrombolysis improves functional outcome without affecting mortality. 6.4% of people with large strokes developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus part of the reason for increased short term mortality. Additionally, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine states that objective evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and applicability of tPA for acute ischemic stroke is insufficient to warrant its classification as standard of care. Intra-arterial <b>fibrinolysis,</b> where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.|$|E
500|$|<b>Fibrinolysis</b> {{syndrome}} (defibrinating syndrome, hypofibrinogenemia) ...|$|E
500|$|... thrombin-activatable <b>fibrinolysis</b> inhibitor, and {{decreased}} levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Activated protein C resistance {{that is not}} attributable to factor V mutations is probably caused by other factors and remains {{a risk factor for}} thrombosis.|$|E
500|$|DVT often {{develops}} in the calf veins and [...] "grows" [...] {{in the direction}} of venous flow, towards the heart. When DVT does not grow, it can be cleared naturally and dissolved into the blood (<b>fibrinolysis).</b> Veins in the calf or thigh are most commonly affected, including the femoral vein, the popliteal vein, and the iliofemoral vein (as with May–Thurner syndrome). Extensive lower-extremity DVT can reach into the iliac vein of the pelvis or the inferior vena cava. Occasionally the veins of the arm are affected, as after central venous catheter placement and with the rare Paget–Schrötter disease.|$|E
500|$|The rare {{forms of}} {{congenital}} thrombophilia are typically {{caused by a}} deficiency of natural anticoagulants. They are classified as [...] "type I" [...] and are more severe in their propensity to cause thrombosis. The main ones are antithrombin III deficiency, protein C deficiency and protein S deficiency. Milder rare congenital thrombophilias are factor XIII mutation and familial dysfibrinogenemia (an abnormal fibrinogen). It is unclear whether congenital disorders of <b>fibrinolysis</b> (the system that destroys clots) are major contributors to thrombosis risk. Congenital deficiency of plasminogen, for instance, mainly causes eye symptoms and sometimes problems in other organs, but the link with thrombosis has been more uncertain.|$|E
