60|$|Man named Gebhart shot <b>here</b> <b>yesterday</b> {{while trying}} to defend a claim on Last Chance Hill. Expect he will die.|$|E
60|$|DEAR AND NEVER-TO-BE-FORGOTTEN FRIENDS. I arrived <b>here</b> <b>yesterday</b> morning without accident, and {{am about}} to proceed to my home by railway.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would you arrest Teddy when he {{has been}} in this house ever since you left <b>here</b> <b>yesterday</b> morning?" [...] Mrs. Hargreaves cried.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is not right, you know, waiter. Look <b>here!</b> <b>here's</b> <b>yesterday's</b> sherry, one and eightpence, {{and here}} we are again, two shillings. And what does sixpence mean?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will {{you look}} here? This {{is worse than}} before. DO you understand? <b>Here's</b> <b>yesterday's</b> sherry, one and eightpence, {{and here we are}} again two shillings. And what the devil does ninepence mean?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' said Mr. Cocker, {{with his}} fire {{surprisingly}} quenched by this apparition; 'I wished {{to ask about}} this bill of mine, because {{it appears to me}} that there's a little mistake here. Let me show you. <b>Here's</b> <b>yesterday's</b> sherry one and eightpence, and here we are again two shillings. And how do you explain ninepence?' ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{very fine}} weather <b>here</b> <b>yesterday</b> and to-day. The {{hospitals}} are very full; {{they are putting}} up hundreds of hospital tents.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a most}} {{extraordinary}} thing," [...] said the inspector, [...] "I could swear that these marks were not <b>here</b> <b>yesterday</b> evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|I stared askance at him, {{in utter}} silence. Then I smiled half tolerantly. [...] "But father, {{yesterday}} {{they were all}} <b>here.</b> <b>Yesterday</b> was..." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{send you}} this, madam, {{to let you}} know that we arrived <b>here</b> safely <b>yesterday</b> afternoon, and that we are going to-day to Jone's mother's farm where Corinne is.|$|R
6000|$|She {{hastened to}} interpose. [...] "Let me do that, daddy, Mr. Norcross is badly used up. You see, we started down <b>here</b> late <b>yesterday</b> afternoon. It was raining and horribly muddy, and I took the wrong trail. The {{darkness}} caught {{us and we}} didn't reach the station till nearly midnight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hear {{rumors of}} bad work. But facts told by ranchers an' {{men who were}} <b>here</b> only <b>yesterday</b> make little of the rumors. All that burnin' of wheat an' timber, an' the {{destruction}} of machines an' strikin' of farm-hands, haven't hit Golden Valley yet. We won't need any militia here, you can bet on that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't have me {{ask them}} to pull it down? Packer was <b>here</b> <b>yesterday,</b> {{and said that the}} {{framework}} of the roof was up." ...|$|E
60|$|He and {{his wife}} lunched with us <b>here</b> <b>yesterday.</b> They have been abroad in Havana 4 months, and they sailed for England this morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{in any way}} special, sir," [...] Perkins replied. [...] "The cricket {{team from}} Romney Court were over <b>here</b> <b>yesterday,</b> sir, for the day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{rather a}} big question;" [...] and Gordon's tone was serious. [...] "In fact, I fancy it's one that neither you nor I can throw much light upon. Anyway, I {{may as well}} point out that I arrived <b>here</b> only <b>yesterday,</b> and I'm going on again in the morning. As to the other matter, Laura Waynefleet has friends who will stand by her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] Mr. Magg replied. [...] "I know of your {{presence}} <b>here</b> very simply. <b>Yesterday</b> I cabled my refusal {{to accept a}} commission on the other side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will be just}} in time," [...] one said. [...] "We have {{news that}} the sultan has just moved, with his army, to Seringapatam. Officers came <b>here,</b> only <b>yesterday,</b> to buy up cattle and grain. These are to be {{retained}} here, until orders are received where {{they are to be}} sent, so I should say that he is coming this way, and will be going down the passes, as Hyder did.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, ma'am," [...] {{said she}} to Euphemia, [...] "that if I had come <b>here</b> <b>yesterday,</b> that dog {{would have had}} my life's blood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "That {{must have}} blown in since I was <b>here</b> <b>yesterday.</b> We can't have {{anything}} like that in our nice spring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{came along}} <b>here</b> <b>yesterday</b> afternoon," [...] the chief said to Luka. [...] "There {{is one big}} stag, and one young one, and three females." ...|$|E
6000|$|He comes {{even now}} [...] From sacrilege. I learn that, since the fight, [...] In marching <b>here</b> by Potsdam <b>yesterday,</b> [...] Sans-Souci Palace drew his curious feet, [...] Where even great Frederick's tomb was bared to him.|$|R
6000|$|We arrived <b>here</b> at ten <b>yesterday</b> evening. I don't {{think the}} journey shook me at all. Dolby {{provided}} a superb cold collation and [...] "the best of drinks," [...] and we dined in the carriage, and I made him laugh all the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a matter}} {{perfectly}} {{well known to}} me--and, I fear, to all our servants also--that somebody is making clandestine visits to our garden. I would not trouble you before, until I ascertained the object of these visits. It is quite plain to me now that Dona Rosita is that object, and that communications are secretly carried on between her and some unknown stranger. He has been here once or twice before; he was <b>here</b> again <b>yesterday.</b> Ezekiel saw him and saw her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We had dear little Mrs. MacAnder <b>here</b> <b>yesterday,</b> {{just back}} from Paris. And whom d'you think she saw there in the street? You'll never guess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Looks {{something}} like a horse was <b>here</b> <b>yesterday</b> and the day before," [...] continued the man, following Dick up. [...] "I reckon you remember him?" ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAREST LOVE,--I arrived <b>here</b> <b>yesterday</b> a.m. at 2 o'clock. It is a wild, untamable place, full of lionhearted boys. I speak tonight. See small bills.|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Daily Oklahoman newspaper. Caption: "Carlos P. Romulo - former Philippine Ambassador to U. S. and {{one-time}} president of the United Nations Assembly, arrived <b>here</b> from manila <b>yesterday</b> with a jubilant smile after aiding in the successful presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your master, Mr. James Smith," [...] he went on, [...] "came <b>here</b> {{unexpectedly}} <b>yesterday</b> evening, {{and slept}} {{in this house}} last night. Before he retired to rest he and your mistress had high words together, which ended, I am sorry to hear, in a threat of a serious nature addressed by Mrs. James Smith to her husband. They slept in separate rooms. This morning you went into your master's room and saw no sign of him there. You only found his nightgown on the bed, spotted with blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You'd hardly think, {{would you}} now,' said Price, turning towards Mr. Pickwick, 'that that chap's been <b>here</b> a week <b>yesterday,</b> and never once shaved himself yet, because he feels so certain he's {{going out in}} half an hour's time, thinks he may as well put it off till he gets home?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Again Miss Stackpole held him--with an {{intention}} of perfect kindness--in suspense. [...] "She came <b>here</b> <b>yesterday,</b> {{and spent the}} night. But this morning she started for Rome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how is it," [...] {{he asked}} severely, [...] "that {{you were not}} <b>here</b> <b>yesterday?</b> My niece's letter led me to expect that you would arrive yesterday." ...|$|E
60|$|Your letter reached me <b>here</b> <b>yesterday.</b> I {{have sent}} you a {{telegram}} (addressed to the theatre) this morning, and I write this by the earliest return mail.|$|E
60|$|Topic V.--You {{demand that}} I shall {{show you the}} man whose soul is dead and then mark him. I am awfully sorry; the man was around <b>here</b> all day <b>yesterday,</b> and if I had only known I could easily have marked him {{so that we could}} pick him out again.|$|R
40|$|We asked {{readers of}} the blog and our Twitter {{followers}} to submit their own tips and examples for academic tweeting, to accompany the guide on using Twitter in university research, teaching and impact activities that we launched <b>yesterday.</b> <b>Here</b> {{are some of the}} best suggestions. Add your tips in the comments section...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Wantridge however, after all, easily {{overlooked}} it. [...] "I {{only knew}} {{he was one of}} your odd Americans. That's why, when I heard <b>yesterday</b> <b>here</b> that he was up there awaiting your return, I didn't let that prevent me. I thought he might be. He certainly," [...] her ladyship laughed, [...] "IS." ...|$|R
