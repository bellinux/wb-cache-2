25|$|When {{a mineral}} is broken <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> does not {{correspond}} to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; {{an example of this}} property is found in native copper.|$|E

25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) {{between the two}} surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not}} the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E
25|$|An {{electromagnetic}} wave {{consists of two}} waves that are oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields. An {{electromagnetic wave}} travels <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> is {{at right angles to}} the oscillation direction of both fields. In the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell showed that, in vacuum, the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the wave equation both with speed equal to that of the speed of light. From this emerged the idea that light is an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves can have different frequencies (and thus wavelengths), giving rise to various types of radiation such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and Gamma rays.|$|E
25|$|The {{solar wind}} and {{magnetosphere}} consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It {{is well known}} (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> the conductor cuts across (or is cut by), rather than along, {{the lines of the}} magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process ("the dynamo effect"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1992, the UN {{responded to}} Serbian offensives {{in the former}} Yugoslav {{republic}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina by declaring a full embargo on trade with Serbia by all member nations. The sanctions placed Greece, which had recognized the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina shortly after its declaration in 1992, in a difficult position. Serbia was an important trading partner with strong religious and historical ties to Greece, and Serbia had initially supported the Greek position on the Macedonia naming dispute. Beginning in 1992, the Konstantinos Mitsotakis and Andreas Papandreou governments, fearing that the Bosnian war would spread <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> would involve Turkey, Albania and Greece, undertook long series of peace-negotiations with Serbia's president, Slobodan Milošević, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić, and the Bosnian government without results. Meanwhile, food, oil, and arms were reported moving from Greece into Serbia {{in violation of the}} UN embargo. Before, during, and after its 1994 presidency of the EU, Greece was the only EU nation to back the Serbian position that Serbian forces had entered Bosnian territory. In early 1994, Greece incurred the displeasure of its European allies by voting against NATO air strikes on Serbian positions. Greece also refused the use of its NATO air bases at Preveza on the Ionian Sea for such attacks and refused to supply Greek troops to the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. In NATO, Greece's position was diametrically opposed to that of Turkey, which supported the Bosnian government.|$|E
25|$|Doughty's main {{inspiration}} for her advocacy work was the frequent {{absence of the}} decedents' families in the process, which she attributed to the Western death anxiety and death phobia. She wanted to encourage death acceptance, {{and a return to}} such practices as memento mori, reminders of one's own mortality, resulting in healthier grieving, mourning, and closure after the inevitable deaths of people around us, as well as starting a movement to broaden the funeral industry to offer more funeral options, such as natural burial, sky burial, alkaline hydrolysis (liquid cremation), or promession. Embalming began to dominate in the US after the Civil War. A century later, in the 1960s, Americans began to turn away from embalming and burial, as cremation became increasingly popular, so that today it is used in almost half of deaths in urban areas. Cremation is seen {{as a threat to the}} traditional funeral industry, but has a reputation as the more environmentally friendly option. This change can be traced to the lifting of the ban on cremation by Pope Paul VI in 1963, and to the publication in the same year of The American Way of Death by Jessica Mitford, documenting abuses in the funeral industry and criticizing the excessive cost of funerals. Mitford's book, and the movement it started, was one of Doughty's inspirations, but Doughty feels that while Mitford had the right target, the profit-driven funeral industry, Mitford erred in sharing the industry's, and the public's, unhealthy desire to push out of sight and avoid thinking about the corpse itself. Doughty seeks to build on Mitford's reforms but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> embraces the reality of death and returns to funeral and mourning practices that include spending time with and having contact with the dead body itself.|$|E

500|$|My Truth was {{released}} in Sweden on 17 May 1999 through BMG Sweden. Around this time, RCA Records, Robyn's international label, were formulating the marketing plans for the album in the United States; the initial reports anticipated the release of an airplay single in September 1999, followed by the album in January 2000. Due to the inclusion of two songs that reflected on the abortion incident, RCA asked Robyn to re-record portions of the album for the American market and pop radio. On top of this, American music magazine Billboard published an article in June 1999 that falsely claimed she had a miscarriage rather than an abortion. Ultimately, Robyn refused to alter the record and a compromise was not reached. The negotiations {{came to an end}} after six months and the plans to release My Truth abroad were cancelled. Robyn's manager Alex Strehl said, [...] "I guess Robyn had moved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> [...] didn't expect." [...] According to Robyn, the label wanted an album like Robyn Is Here and thus were not interested in investing in My Truth. In 2001, she parted ways with RCA and entered a new record deal with Jive Records and Zomba.|$|E

500|$|Despite their differences, Piłsudski praised Sikorski in his reports, recommending him for Chief of the General Staff and Minister of War positions; only generals Kazimierz Sosnkowski and Edward Rydz-Śmigły {{received}} better evaluations from him. Sikorski {{was popular}} among many soldiers, and in politics, particularly appealing to Polish conservatives and liberals. On 1 April 1921 Sikorski replaced general Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski {{as the chief}} of the Polish General Staff. Between 1922 and 1925 he held a number of high government offices. Based on his analysis, the Polish Council of Ministers adopted new foreign policy that would remain roughly unchanged until the late 1930s (preserving the status quo in Europe, and treating Germany and Russia as equal sources of potential threat). On 12 December 1922 he issued a general order, stressing the need for the military to stay out of politics. After the assassination of President of Poland Gabriel Narutowicz on 16 December 1922, the Marshal of the Sejm (Sejm being the Polish parliament), Maciej Rataj, appointed Sikorski prime minister. [...] From December 18, 1922, to May 26, 1923, Sikorski served as Prime Minister and also as Minister of Internal Affairs, and was even considered as possible President. [...] During his brief tenure as prime minister, he became popular with the Polish public and carried out essential reforms in addition to guiding the country's foreign policy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> gained the approval and cooperation of the League of Nations and tightened Polish-French cooperation. He obtained recognition of Poland's eastern frontiers from the UK, France and the United States during the Conference of Ambassadors on 15 March 1923 He aided Treasury Minister Władysław Grabski's reforms aiming at curtailing inflation and reforming the currency, and supported ethnic minorities. His government nonetheless lost support in the Sejm and resigned on 26 May 1923.|$|E
