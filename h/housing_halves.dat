40|$|Freudenberg Sealing Technologies has {{developed}} a new concept for the manufacture of diaphragm accumulators. Its advantages are a reduced need for components, fewer process steps, shorter assembly times, {{a higher level of}} product cleanliness, and an expansion of the product portfolio into additional fields of application. These diaphragm accumulators also weigh significantly less. This is opening up new opportunities for applications in the automotive and industrial fields. The assembly concept is based on a hermetically sealed pressure chamber in which the joining of the two <b>housing</b> <b>halves</b> with the help electromagnetic pulse technology (EMPT) as well as the filling of the gas side with nitrogen takes place in a single operation. In this way, downstream filling to generate the initial gas charge is no longer necessary...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a thesis}} {{presents}} a differential gear which {{is found in}} a tracked vehicle called BvS 10. The tracked vehicle is manufactured by BAE Systems Hägglunds AB in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. The differential gear has a bolted house. The differential meets the requirement specifications, {{but the problem is}} that the bolts are sheared off because of the extreme torque that the differential is exposed to resist. Previous report on the differential show pictures of bolts which have been sheared off at the threads. This report is also includes three lists that explain seven different proposals which some are approved and some are not, and the report also presents the force, tensile, and shear stress. In a bolted connection there is both axial tension stress and radial shear stress, which can lead to wear out and broken bolts. To solve the problem, better bolts are need for the differential gear <b>housing</b> <b>halves.</b> The bolts are from M 8 to M 10 and all bolts are not directly compatible, so geometric modifications might have to be done. This reports proposes several solutions to this complex problem and also analyzes the proposed solutions. The report also describes various theories from a technical and a historical point of view. Two flow charts have been created to show the work towards the presented solution. Although the analysis to welded joints and wedge joints have been included in the proposed solution. The report propose a tight-fit bolt with a tolerance specially made for the differential gear, so the shear stress occurs at the non-threaded part of the bolt. The tight-fitted bolt is recommended to be M 8 12. 9 UNB because of it’s safety factor. Larger bolts may not directly fit in the differential <b>housing</b> <b>halves</b> due to there is no enough material...|$|E
50|$|Other {{upgrades}} {{made during}} the retrofit include the application of heat-reflective paint, insulating plaster, and phase changing material to improve the house's thermal performance, the use of light-reflective particles in interior paint to reduce lighting needs, and various other green and energy-efficient features, such as double-glazed doors and windows, ducted skirting, and reclaimed timber floors. In all, the upgrades made to the <b>house</b> <b>halved</b> its carbon emissions and increased its energy efficiency by 50%, while also upgrading the building's Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating from E to A/B.|$|R
50|$|Overall the Pennyland Area 2 <b>houses</b> {{demonstrated}} a <b>halving</b> in gas consumption for space and water heating {{compared to the}} 'normal' Neath Hill houses.|$|R

50|$|In other words, the {{resources}} diverted {{for this project}} effectively <b>halved</b> <b>housing</b> construction rates. On the other hand, the new construction plants, built for this project (like Kuchino Ceramics), were fundamental to Khrushchev's residential program {{just a few years}} later.|$|R
50|$|It was an {{unstable}} period for Scriabin, {{who had been}} moving around Europe for several years. In July 1905, his eldest daughter Rima died in Switzerland, {{and the birth of}} Ariadna finalized his separation with a legitimate wife. In December, he broke his longstanding relations with Belyayev's publishing <b>house,</b> which <b>halved</b> their fees shortly after the death of the founder, Mitrofan Belyaev. As a result, Scriabin lost his source of income for a year, until the new owners reconsidered their offer.|$|R

[...] ATOM, a British publishing <b>house,</b> printed these <b>halves</b> ( [...] and [...] ) the following March.|$|R
50|$|The Grimke-Fraser Tenements {{were built}} in about 1762 on land that Frederic Grimke {{purchased}} in 1747. The thick brick wall that divides the <b>house</b> into two <b>halves</b> and which projects through the roof is evidence of the house's early use as a rental property made of two side-by-side units.|$|R
50|$|The Type 44 was {{produced}} in three variations (referred to as First, Second, and Third variations). The major differences between variations was in the folding bayonet housing, which increased the length and durability with each variation. The changes to the bayonet housing was because of accuracy issues and to strengthen the stock. A minor difference between variations {{may be found in}} the cleaning rod compartment found beneath the buttplate. First variation stocks had two holes drilled for each half of the cleaning rod, while second and third variations had a single larger hole to <b>house</b> both <b>halves</b> of the cleaning rod.|$|R

5000|$|This text, {{known as}} [...] "First Grenelle Act", sets the general policy and {{describes}} the choices made while not specifying their practical implementation or funding. It simply reflects the legislative commitments made in October 2007. This first bill focuses on climate {{and seeks to}} divide, by four, all {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} by 2050. The industrial sectors most affected are construction and transport, which together account for 40% of total emissions. The bill includes construction of 1,500 km of public transport, and the rehabilitation of 800,000 <b>housing</b> units to <b>halve</b> their energy consumption by 2020. Other provisions are related to energy (promotion of renewable energy), products incorporating nanomaterials, agriculture (increase in the share of organic agriculture to 20% by 2020, halving the amount of pesticides).|$|R
60|$|The whole ranch showed {{many years}} of toil and the {{perseverance}} of man. The brook irrigated the verdant valley between the ranch and the village. Water for the house, however, {{came down from the}} high, wooded slope of the mountain, and had been brought there by a simple expedient. Pine logs of uniform size had been laid end to end, with a deep trough cut in them, and they made a shining line down the slope, across the valley, and up the little hill to the Auchincloss home. Near the <b>house</b> the hollowed <b>halves</b> of logs had been bound together, making a crude pipe. Water ran uphill in this case, one of the facts that made the ranch famous, as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small boys of Pine. The two good women who managed Auchincloss's large household were often shocked by the strange things that floated into their kitchen with the ever-flowing stream of clear, cold mountain water.|$|R
60|$|Now the {{cantonment}} {{in which}} the 195th lay was bounded on the north by a river--dry in the winter. From his earliest years, Wee Willie Winkie had been forbidden to go across the river, and had noted that even Coppy--the almost almighty Coppy--had never set foot beyond it. Wee Willie Winkie had once been read to, out of a big blue book, {{the history of the}} Princess and the Goblins--a most wonderful tale of a land where the Goblins were always warring with the children of men until they were defeated by one Curdie. Ever since that date {{it seemed to him that}} the bare black and purple hills across the river were inhabited by Goblins, and, in truth, every one had said that there lived the Bad Men. Even in his own <b>house</b> the lower <b>halves</b> of the windows were covered with green paper on account of the Bad Men who might, if allowed clear view, fire into peaceful drawing-rooms and comfortable bedrooms. Certainly, beyond the river, which was the end of all the Earth, lived the Bad Men. And here was Major Allardyce's big girl, Coppy's property, preparing to venture into their borders! What would Coppy say if anything happened to her? If the Goblins ran off with her as they did with Curdie's Princess? She must at all hazards be turned back.|$|R
5000|$|The {{presence}} of the green squares on the roulette wheel and {{on the table is}} technically the only house edge. Outside bets will always lose when a single or double zero comes up. However, the house also has an edge on inside bets because the pay outs are always set at 35 to 1 when you mathematically have a 1 out of 38 (1 out of 37 for French/European roulette) chance at winning a straight bet on a single number. To demonstrate the house edge on inside bets, imagine placing straight $1 wagers on all inside numbers (including 0 and 00) to assure a win: you would only get back $36, having spent $38. The only exceptions are the five numbers bet where the house edge is considerably higher (7.89% on an American wheel), and the [...] "even money" [...] bets in some European games (French Roulette) where the <b>house</b> edge is <b>halved</b> because only half the stake is lost when a zero comes up. This is commonly called the [...] "la partage" [...] rule, and it is considered being the main difference of European and French roulette. There is also modification of this rule, which is called [...] "en prison" [...] rule. These rules cut the house edge into half (1.35%) in French roulette, when playing even-money bets, as half of the even-money bets are given back for player if the zero is draw in the wheel.|$|R
