5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> various {{accusations of}} foul play by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} {{reason for the}} lack or absence of a refractory period in men may be an increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} acute changes of extracellular osmolality on whole body protein and glucose metabolism, we studied 10 male subjects during three conditions: hyperosmolality was induced by fluid restriction and intravenous infusion of hypertonic NaCl [2 - 5 %; (wt/vol) ] during 17 h; hypoosmolality was produced by intravenous administration of desmopressin, liberal water drinking, and infusion of hypotonic saline (0. 4 %); and <b>the</b> isoosmolality <b>study</b> consisted of ad libitum oral water intake by the subjects. Leucine flux ([1 - 13 C]leucine infusion technique), a parameter of whole body protein breakdown, decreased <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hypoosmolality <b>study</b> (P textless 0. 02 vs. isoosmolality). The leucine oxidation rate decreased <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hypoosmolality <b>study</b> (P textless 0. 005 vs. isoosmolality). Metabolic clearance rate of glucose during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamping increased less <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hypoosmolality <b>study</b> than <b>during</b> <b>the</b> isoosmolality <b>study</b> (P textless 0. 04). Plasma insulin decreased, and plasma nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol, and ketone body concentrations and lipid oxidation increased <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hypoosmolality <b>study.</b> It is concluded that acute alterations of plasma osmolality influence whole body protein, glucose, and lipid metabolism; hypoosmolality results in protein sparing associated with increased lipolysis and lipid oxidation and impaired insulin sensitivity...|$|R

25|$|Max Weber {{and some}} schools of {{modernization}} theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success.
