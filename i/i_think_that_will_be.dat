2500|$|At [...] below {{sea level}} and [...] below the {{mountains}} {{on either side of}} the scorching Jordan Valley, here for weeks at a time, the shade temperature rarely dropped below [...] and occasionally reached at the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead [...] was recorded. Coupled with the heat, the tremendous evaporation of the Dead Sea which keeps the still, heavy atmosphere moist, adds to the discomfort and produces a feeling of lassitude which is most depressing and difficult to overcome. In addition to these unpleasant conditions the valley swarms with snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes, great black spiders, and men and animals were tormented by day and night by swarms of every sort of fly. Trooper R. W. Gregson 2663, described the Jordan Valley to his family, [...] "...it's a terrible place. I will never tell anyone to go to hell again; I will tell him to go to Jericho, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> bad enough!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Slope, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> best; {{and you may}} be {{sure that}} any little that I can do to forward your views shall be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None of us; though {{several of}} the men-at-arms had gashes from the rascals' weapons, but naught, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] replied Ratcliffe; [...] "I {{shall be}} on that lay nae mair--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> save your folk some trouble, Mr. Sharpitlaw?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Splendid," [...] he muttered, as an {{absolutely}} appalling burst of discord rent {{the surrounding air}} and left it in tatters. [...] "Magnificent! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> do." ...|$|R
60|$|Stranger {{things we}} were {{presently}} to see, but that airless, star-dusted sky! Of all things, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{one of the}} last I shall forget.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed it will," [...] {{cried the}} other; [...] "and if you don't mind helping {{a little about}} the cooking, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fun too. Perhaps you can tell me some things I don't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{first thing}} I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered {{about in the}} wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; {{and the second thing}} is to find my way into that lovely garden. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the best plan.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> do,” Will said, “and {{to aid the}} {{deception}} I will, as I go in, use my handkerchief and pretend to have a bad cold.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, my feline friend! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> {{teach you}} a {{wholesome}} lesson; and as punishment {{is intended to}} be reformatory, you ought to be grateful to me for deigning to administer it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; I believe I may stay till Friday, and I should {{delight in}} the feast, thank you, Miss Ross,--I want to study such things. A bit more matting, Amy, if you please. There, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No indeed!" [...] exclaimed Willy, {{her mind}} involuntarily running towards Nancy Shott, to whom a voyage to the West Indies would doubtless {{be of great}} service. [...] "Don't let's bother about {{anything}} of that kind! Let's make the first trip by ourselves! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> glorious!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{am going}} to learn to write first," [...] said Mary Erskine. [...] "I have been {{thinking}} about it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> best. I have got the plan all formed. I shall want you to set me a copy, and then this evening I shall write it." ...|$|E
6000|$|MR. PENNE (dictates)--"Cortland, in Kate's {{presence}} heard faintly {{the voice}} of caution. Thirty years had not cooled his ardor. It was {{in his power to}} bestow great gifts upon this girl. He still retained the beliefs that he had at twenty." [...] (To Miss Lore, wearily) <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> enough for the present.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought as}} much," [...] rejoined the Antiquary, drily; [...] "and I, in the meanwhile, without any divining-rod, {{will show you}} an {{excellent}} venison pasty, {{and a bottle of}} London particular Madeira, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> match all <b>that</b> Mr. Dousterswivel's art is like to exhibit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{you take}} up that ax and {{look as if}} you were ready to use it?" [...] she said. [...] "Oh, no! That is far too much like a waxwork! Hold up your head a little! Now, don't move any more than you can help! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My girl, I've {{some news}} for you," [...] began Belding. [...] "Mr. Gale is leaving to-day with his family. I'm {{going to send}} you with them--part way, anyhow. You're invited to visit them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>'d</b> be great for you--help you to forget. But the main thing is--you're going East to join mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am faithful!' cried Charlotte. 'I {{never cared}} for that traitor, Delaford, and his guitar; but I {{could not get}} rid of him. And I'll tell you what--I'll seal up his fine red book, and all his verses; and you shall leave them in London as you go through, with my compliments. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> proper and scornful.' ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR MR. MALLESON,--I am so very {{grateful}} for your proposal to edit the letters without further reference to me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> exactly the right way; and I believe I can put you at real ease in the doing of it by explaining as I can in very few words the kind of carte-blanche I should rejoicingly give you.|$|E
60|$|Our {{boys will}} try to be there first in the morning--in which case they may get {{possession}} and keep it. Now you understand the shooting scrape in which Gebhart was killed the other day. The Clemens Company--all of us--hate to resort to arms in this matter, {{and it will not}} be done until it becomes a forced hand--but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the end of it, never-the-less.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should think}} her {{a much more}} {{comfortable}} companion than Mr. White,' said Lady Merrifield. 'I can't believe it will come to anything. Whatever the riches or the castle at Rocca Marina may be, Ada would, in a worldly point of view, give up a position of some consideration here, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> weigh with her.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The album {{itself is}} one which I know I'll be revisiting {{to listen to}} again, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> apply {{to a lot of}} people. Distorted, heavy, melodic but {{throughout}} allowing you relate what you're hearing to your own experiences, this album {{is more than just a}} moment in music, it's a moment in life which everyone should experience." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Sun {{has risen}} {{every day in}} the past, {{therefore}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>will</b> not rise tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you {{may have}} the Advertiser" [...] he said, handing it over the table to her. [...] "I was down first, and I got both the papers. I'm not really obliged to make any division, but I've seen the Advertiser, and I'm willing to behave unselfishly. If you're very {{impatient}} for the police report in the Sunrise I'll read it aloud for you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a very good test of its quality, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, yes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{the best}} plan. You've {{some kind of}} {{hereditary}} influence with the little chaps, and they may listen to you when a glimpse of our uniforms would drive them wild. You've never been {{in that part of}} the world before, have you? Take care they don't send you to your family vault in your youth and innocence. I believe you'll be all right if you can get 'em to listen to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am ready, Mother," [...] the boy said, earnestly. [...] "I {{have been}} hoping, for some time, {{that you would}} say you would start soon; and though I have not, of course, the {{strength}} of a man, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more than made up by the advantage I should have, as a boy, in looking for my father; and at any rate, from what you tell me, I should think that I am quite as strong as an average native of your country.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> do {{this without}} {{difficulty}} (lit. [...] "I think {{to be going to}} do this").|$|R
5000|$|... "The UEFA Cup is a {{consolation}} prize and the Cup Winners' Cup has been destroyed. Who plays in that now? Nobody. The fact is, the Champions' League is all-important. It {{is turning into}} a European League {{and over the next}} three or four years <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> become more and more clear." [...] Arsène Wenger on the climate of European football, October 1997 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I read Bessie's {{letter about}} a couple of hours ago, and I congratulate you both very much. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you <b>will</b> have the sweetest and loveliest wife in South Africa, Captain Niel; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Bessie <b>will</b> have a husband any woman might be proud of;" [...] and she half bowed and half curtseyed to him as she said it, with a graceful little air of dignity that was very taking.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, my dear, {{you have}} done nothing amiss. I only {{intended}} {{to tell you to}} be cautious for fear you should get into a way of going on which might not look well. Don't make any great difference, I only meant that there should not be quite so much singing and gardening alone with him, or walking in the garden in the evening. You can manage to draw back a little, so as to keep more with me or with Laura, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the best way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Probate has issued!" [...] {{echoed the}} great James, {{struggling}} with his rising contempt; [...] "and {{is the law}} so helpless that probate which {{has been allowed to}} issue under an erroneous apprehension of the facts cannot be recalled? Most certainly not! So soon as the preliminary formalities are concluded, a writ must be issued to revoke the probate, and claiming that the Court should pronounce in favour of the later will; or, stay, there is no executor--there is no executor!--a very important point--claiming a grant of letters of administration with the will annexed: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the better course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{might go}} {{and look at the}} men with the clap nets," [...] Chebron answered. [...] "They have several sorts in use, and take numbers of pigeons and other birds. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> enough for to-morrow. We have had four days' hard work, and a quiet day will be pleasant, and if we find the time goes slowly, we can take a boat across the lake and look at the Great Sea beyond the sandhills that divide the lake from it; beside, I hope we shall get my father's answer, and I should like some further talk with that old Israelite. It is {{interesting}} to learn about the religion that his forefathers believed in, and in which it seems that he and his grandchild are now the last who have faith." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think, Lady Marrabel," [...] Saton said slowly, [...] "that you {{can tell}} me, if you <b>will.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you <b>will</b> tell me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you must!" ...|$|R
