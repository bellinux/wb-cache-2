25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E
2500|$|In Avengers: Children's Crusade, Cassie {{is killed}} by Doctor Doom, and Iron Lad decides {{to take her}} body into the future to be revived. [...] "Jonas" [...] protests, {{reasoning}} that such an action is {{more in line with}} Kang's manipulation of time than what Cassie would want, and Iron Lad murders him in a fit of jealous anger. Although his teammates contemplate rebuilding him, they decide against it, both because they lack the 30th-century technology to do so and because, even with their access to his back-ups, the lack of a back-up immediately prior to his death would mean that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about Cassie's death all over again. Kate, Cassie's best friend, prefers to believe that he and Cassie are somehow together wherever they are now.|$|E

2500|$|In 1956, eighteen-year-old Charles Starkweather was {{introduced}} to 13-year-old Caril Ann Fugate by Caril's older sister, whom he had previously dated, but who had chosen to end their relationship. After Caril's sister introduced the two, they continued to talk, even after the relationship of Charles and her sister had ended. Starkweather {{had dropped out of}} Lincoln High School in his senior year and became employed at a Western Union newspaper warehouse. He sought employment there because the warehouse was located near Whittier Junior High School in Lincoln, where Fugate was a student. His employment allowed him to visit her every day after school. Starkweather was considered a poor worker and his employer later recalled, [...] "Sometimes you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> something two or three times. Of all the employees in the warehouse, he was the dumbest man we had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here comes Colonel Morris," [...] went on Twyford, still {{speaking}} to Symon. [...] "One {{of us will}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how the light went out. Will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He will. But I feel {{at present}} that I would rather change places with the poorest gentleman I know than <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> I {{have done with}} races, Lupton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We 'ad {{another long}} argyment about it, and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'im</b> plain at last that when I wanted to smell 'is fist, I'd say so.|$|R
6000|$|She had got {{herself into}} it; she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that he wasn't just a {{business}} man; {{that she had}} [...] "just meant" [...] he was so practical.|$|R
6000|$|I was joking, but {{she said}} seriously, [...] "Yes; he must go away. And I don't envy you <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> I suppose you will bungle it, of course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Adelaide Chadd bitterly. [...] "I {{suppose we}} shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about this. I thought that no good fortune would ever come easily to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, don't you {{understand}} that that's exactly what I'm working for? You'll have to tell him--about the way you've let it all drop: you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> a tremendous lot!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he'll be all right, {{but if he}} wouldn't, and I knew it, I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> all the same. Now, good-night. Well, there, then; and there! Now, let me go!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He had us hauled {{up before}} him--guess {{the other man}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> who we were--and when I wouldn't answer he slashed me with a sled-dog-whip across the face." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lines {{and phrases}} from singer-songwriter Stan Rogers are worked into the text, e.g. [...] "You never <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> twice or find him work to do" [...] from White Squall.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] I interrupted, [...] "your {{father knew}} all the scroll <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> else {{he could not have}} copied it on Gumbo. So why was he in such a rage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The exultation {{with which}} he uttered this helped me somehow, for the instant, to meet him rather more. [...] "And how much will YOU, Miles, <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him?</b> There are things he'll ask you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he were to}} {{come back}} again this instant, I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> just the same, or else tell him about that--that--and you know I couldn't do that if I lived a {{thousand}} years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the truth, Spud, {{although}} we'll have {{to smooth}} over Mr. Sanderson's manner {{as much as}} we can. There's no use in hurting Songbird's feelings, especially now when he's broken up physically as well as mentally." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't care, Ben--I {{just felt}} I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> It's {{a shame to}} let Nat cotton to fellows like Jasniff and Merwell. They will drag him down as sure as fate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know now," [...] I said, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how I {{knew before}} he would answer another question. Then I became listener, and you who read know to what {{alarming}} story.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{sooner or}} later, Mrs. Munger!" [...] said Mrs. Gerrish, with overweening {{pleasure}} in her acquaintance {{with both of}} these superior people. [...] "He'll {{get it out of}} you anyway." [...] Her husband looked at her, and she fell silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he is," [...] said Hartley, sitting up, with {{a sudden}} air of determination. [...] "But then, so am I. I {{am not going to}} be {{dictated}} to in this fashion. My private affairs are nothing to do with him. Iâ€”I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of {{that the}} way I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> I should begin by giving him a scolding. Of course, he meant well by it, but can't you see that it wasn't very flattering! How did he expect it would change me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{ought to}} help us," [...] he said--and {{then he gave}} an {{attentive}} ear (looking all the while at the poor creature in the corner) to what Mrs. Crosscapel <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just had}} a talk with Mr. Compton," [...] he replied. [...] "He sent for me and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{something}} that I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> although he's got to find it out sooner or later anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{beautiful}} bedside," [...] he said, [...] "one of {{the most}} edifying that I have ever attended. I knew that Doomer was failing {{and of course the}} time came when I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Hetty trembled a little. [...] "It {{is going}} to be the hardest thing I ever did. He is just dreadful in his {{quietness}} when he is angry--and I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I had been meeting Larry and sending him dollars. You know what he would fancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Lew is different," [...] replied Colonel Zane with a shudder. [...] "If I {{told him}} to take an ax and clean out Metzar's place--God! what a wreck he'd make of it.

60|$|Our {{conversation}} at that first encounter would do {{very little to}} develop the Modern Utopia in my mind. Inevitably, it would be personal and emotional. He would tell me how he stood in his world, and I how I stood in mine. I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> things, I should have to explain things----.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody there?" [...] cried Westover, {{and they}} fell upon the coachman with wild {{question}} and reproach; the policeman <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> at last that the carriage must move on, {{to make way}} for others.|$|R
60|$|She paused, {{for what}} she now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{was very hard to}} say, and she knew what a terrible blow she would be dealing to his heart, from the wild beating of her own.|$|R
