40|$|Axillary {{dermatitis}} is {{a common}} problem, particularly in individuals with contact allergy to fragrances. Many individuals suspect their deodorant to be the causal product of their fragrance allergy. It {{has been shown that}} deodorants containing cinnamic aldehyde (cinnamal) can elicit axillary dermatitis in patients sensitized to this substance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the importance of <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> used in deodorants for the development of axillary dermatitis, when applied by individuals with and without contact allergy to this fragrance chemical. Patch tests with deodorants and ethanolic solutions containing <b>hydroxycitronellal,</b> as well as repeated open application tests (ROAT) with roll-on deodorants with and without <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> at different concentrations, were performed in 14 dermatitis patients, 7 with and 7 without contact allergy to <b>hydroxycitronellal.</b> A positive ROAT was noted only in the patients hypersensitive to <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> (P < 0. 001) and only in the axilla to which the deodorants containing <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> had been applied (P < 0. 001). Deodorants containing <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> in the concentration range of 0. 032 - 0. 32 % used twice daily on healthy skin in individuals hypersensitive to <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> can elicit axillary dermatitis in a few weeks. status: publishe...|$|E

Our investigation was aimed at the design and synthesis of substitutes for <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> and other compounds of similar odour, currently employed in perfumery and cosmetics. In order to approach this problem in a systematic way, we have synthesised a great number of tetrahydropyranyl and tetrahydrofuranyl derivatives, as well as other cyclic compounds, that could help modelling the interactions between odorant and receptor proteins, and define the role of each molecular parameter in eliciting the characteristic olfactory note. The compounds exhibiting the best olfactory notes have been used in a conformational analysis, by means of NMR in two different solvents and molecular modelling.

40|$|TRPM 8 (CMR 1) is a Ca 2 +-permeable channel, {{which can}} be {{activated}} by low temperatures, menthol, eucalyptol and icilin. It belongs to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, and therefore is related to vanilloid receptor type- 1 (VR 1, TRPV 1). We tested whether substances which are structurally related to menthol, or which produce a cooling sensation, could activate TRPM 8, and compared the responses of TRPM 8 and VR 1 to these ligands. The effects of 70 odorants and menthol-related substances on recombinant mouse TRPM 8 (mTRPM 8), expressed in HEK 293 cells, were examined using a FLIPR® assay. In all, 10 substances (linalool, geraniol, <b>hydroxycitronellal,</b> WS- 3, WS- 23, FrescolatMGA, FrescolatML, PMD 38, CoolactP and Cooling Agent 10) {{were found to be}} agonists. The EC 50 values of the agonists defined their relative potencies: icilin (0. 2 ± 0. 1 μM) >FrescolatML (3. 3 ± 1. 5 μM) > WS- 3 (3. 7 ± 1. 7 μM) >(−) menthol (4. 1 ± 1. 3 μM) >frescolatMAG (4. 8 ± 1. 1 μM) > cooling agent 10 (6 ± 2. 2 μM) >(+) menthol (14. 4 ± 1. 3 μM) > PMD 38 (31 ± 1. 1 μM) > WS- 23 (44 ± 7. 3 μM) > Coolact P (66 ± 20 μM) > geraniol (5. 9 ± 1. 6 mM) > linalool (6. 7 ± 2. 0 mM) > eucalyptol (7. 7 ± 2. 0 mM) > <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> (19. 6 ± 2. 2 mM). Known VR 1 antagonists (BCTC, thio-BCTC and capsazepine) were also able to block the response of TRPM 8 to menthol (IC 50 : 0. 8 ± 1. 0, 3. 5 ± 1. 1 and 18 ± 1. 1 μM, respectively). The Ca 2 + response of hVR 1 -transfected HEK 293 cells to the endogenous VR 1 agonist N-arachidonoyl-dopamine was potentiated by low pH. In contrast, menthol- and icilin-activated TRPM 8 currents were suppressed by low pH. In conclusion, in the present study, we identified 10 new agonists and three antagonists of TRPM 8. We found that, in contrast to VR 1, TRPM 8 is inhibited rather than potentiated by protons...|$|E

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{widespread}} use, fragrances {{are among the}} most common causes of contact allergic dermatitis, second only to nickel. During a five-year period 3, 065 patients with contact dermatitis were patch tested using a specific mix of fragrances. 509 (16. 6 %) patients were allergic to the fragrance mix, while 258 (8. 4 %) patients exhibited an allergic reaction to Myroxylon pereirae (balsam of Peru). Between those 509 patients, 157 were patch tested with eight individual substances contained in the fragrance mix: cinnamal, cinnamyl alcohol, eugenol, isoeugenol, geraniol, <b>hydroxycitronellal,</b> alpha-amyl cinnamal and Evernia prunastri (oak moss). The most frequent allergens were isoeugenol 57. 9 % (91 / 157), eugenol 55. 4 % (87 / 157), cinnamyl alcohol 34. 4 % (54 / 157) and Evernia prunastri (oak moss) 24. 2 % (38 / 157).

40|$|Abstract: Some {{medicinal}} plants, {{which are}} known to produce allergic reactions, are also specifically used as anti-inflammatory agents. Among the more relevant plants, we report species with cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic alcohol, geraniol, <b>hydroxycitronellal,</b> eugenol and isoeugenol are all potential allergens. In addition, fragrances, which are mixtures of small-molecular-weight compounds, may induce allergic contact dermatitis due to fragrance-specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes. Plants from the Asteraceae family used in folk medicine as anti-inflammatories can cause allergic contact dermatitis because of its content in sesquiterpene lactones, which have been reported as the anti-inflammatory principles in this species. Species with flavonoids, iridoids, terpenoids and alkaloids {{have been described as}} inhibitors of contact dermatitis.,,, and all showed activity in different experimental protocols of contact dermatitis, thus justifying the potential use of these medicinal plants as anti-allergens and inhibitors of contact dermatitis reactions produced by allergens and chemicals. Hydroquinone derivatives such as 1 [...] -glucopyranosyl- 2 -(3 ’-hydroxymethyl- 3 ’-methylallyl) hydroquinone and arbutin, flavonoids such as kaempferol, apigenin and genistein, sesquiterpene lactones such as helenalin, diterpenes such as triptonide, triterpenes such as tripterine and bryonolic acid, iridoids such as scrovalentinoside, alkaloids such as indirubin, dehydrocorydaline, magnoflorine hydroxide and phellodendrine acetate, and polysaccharides such as fucoidin have been reported as inhibitors of contact dermatitis reactions...|$|E
40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} (ACD) and photo-ACD are cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity {{reactions of the}} skin caused by {{a wide range of}} substances. Topical ketoprofen (KP), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can induce ACD and photo-ACD. Patients with ACD and/or photo-ACD to KP frequently show concomitant sensitization to other substances. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the substances most frequently associated with sensitization to KP, and to evaluate, by means of computerized conformational analysis, whether this association could be due to cross-allergy. 15 subjects with ACD and photo-ACD to KP were tested with the SIDAPA (Società Italiana di Dermatologia Allergologica Professionale ed Ambientale) patch test standard series, including fragrance mix and its components (eugenol, isoeugenol, oak moss, geraniol, <b>hydroxycitronellal,</b> amylcinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol and cinnamaldehyde) and with the SIDAPA photopatch test series. Allergic reactions to cinnamyl alcohol were noted in all patients, whereas some patients also showed positive reactions to fenticlor, octocrylene and benzophenone- 10. Computerized conformational analysis demonstrated that the structure of cinnamyl alcohol is similar to that of KP, whereas the structures of benzophenone- 10, octocrylene and fenticlor are completely different. These results suggest that in patients with contact allergy to KP, concomitant positive reactions to cinnamyl alcohol are due to cross-sensitization, whereas simultaneous allergic reactions to fenticlor, octocrylene and benzophenone- 10 should be regarded as co-sensitizations...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{we showed}} that 10. 2 % of {{consecutively}} patch-tested hand eczema patients had a positive patch test to a selection of fragrances containing fragrances relevant to hand exposure. In this study, we used repeated skin exposure to a patch test-positive fragrance allergen in patients previously diagnosed with hand eczema to explore whether immersion of fingers in a solution {{with or without the}} patch-test-positive fragrance allergen would cause or exacerbate hand eczema on the exposed finger. The study was double blinded and randomized. All participants had a positive patch test to either <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> or Lyral(R) (hydroxyisohexyl 3 -cyclohexene carboxaldehyde). Each participant immersed a finger from each hand, once a day, in a solution containing the fragrance allergen or placebo. During the first 2 weeks, the concentration of fragrance allergen in the solution was low (approximately 10 p. p. m.), whilst during the following 2 weeks, the concentration was relatively high (approximately 250 p. p. m.), imitating real-life exposure to a household product like dishwashing liquid diluted in water and the undiluted product, respectively. Evaluation was made using a clinical scale and laser Doppler flow meter. 3 of 15 hand eczema patients developed eczema on the finger immersed in the fragrance-containing solution, 3 of 15 on the placebo finger and 3 of 15 on both fingers. Using this experimental exposure model simulating real-fife exposure, we found no association between immersion of a finger in a solution containing fragrance and development of clinically visible eczema on the finger in 15 participants previously diagnosed with hand eczema and with a positive patch test to the fragrance in question...|$|E
40|$|Contact allergy (delayed hypersensitivity) {{may develop}} {{as a result}} of skin {{exposure}} to contact allergens (haptens) and can lead to allergic contact dermatitis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate some predictive animal test methods for contact allergens. It was done with the aim that the test methods giving the clinically most relevant results should be used in risk assessment of chemicals and in research. A slightly modified multi-dose-response induction protocol was evaluated with two model contact allergens when applied to three guinea pig predictive test methods. The protocol was easily applied to the cumulative contact enhancement test (CCET) and the Freund's complete adjuvant test (FCAT), which have only one induction route. However, for the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT) with two induction routes, the topical doses at induction interacted with the logistic model. The protocol would benefit from further development and some modifications are suggested. Calculations of the estimated concentration sensitizing 50 % of the animals (EC 50) improves the possibility for proper ranking of contact allergens and augments the information used in risk assessment. The calculated EC 50 -values for the model allergens were: 0. 00045 % in the FCAT, 0. 0025 % in the GPMT and 0. 0042 % in the CCET for potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7), and 0. 068 % in the GPMT, 0. 89 % in the FCAT and 1. 8 % in the CCET for <b>hydroxycitronellal</b> (HC). A multi-dose-response induction protocol was applied on a modified mouse ear swelling test (MEST) and evaluated with four contact allergens and one irritant. This protocol could detect the moderate to strong contact allergens as sensitizers, but not one (HC) of the two weak contact allergens. The irritant (negative control) gave a Ônegative' response. The EC 50 -values calculated for the three detected allergens were 0. 002 % for oxazolone, 0. 03 % for K 2 Cr 2 O 7 and 0. 7 % for methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN). The murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is a predictive test method, but its ability to discriminate between allergens and irritants has been questioned. Eight contact allergens and six irritants were investigated in the evaluation of the LLNA. The moderate to strong allergens gave clearly Ôpositive' results (stimulation index (SI) = 12. 8 - 39. 9), but one weak allergen (benzocaine) was not classified as a sensitizer (SI< 3). The irritants tested, i. e. chloroform/methanol, methylsalicylate, nonanoic acid, oxalic acid, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Triton X- 100, however, gave also Ôpositive' results (SI = 5. 0 - 10. 7), not distinguishable from the results with weak and moderate contact allergens (SI = 3. 4 - 17. 1). The addition of 10 % SDS could not be used to reduce the induced proliferation due to irritation from the test chemicals, nor could an alternative choice of vehicle. The allergenicity of a preservative, i. e. Euxyl K 400, and one of its ingredients, MDBGN, was investigated in three different animal predictive test methods, and patch testing in dermatitis patients was performed for comparison. The CCET using 57 a multi-dose-response induction protocol (EC 50 = 1. 9 % for MDBGN) and the LLNA (SI = 7. 4 - 7. 9 for MDBGN and 8. 4 - 12. 0 for Euxyl K 400) confirmed the sensitization potential of the substance based on dermatitis patients patch test results (total frequency varied between 0. 9 - 1. 8 %). However, the results from the GPMT were not statistically significant. In conclusion, even though the LLNA and the MEST have some advantages compared to the guinea pig test methods concerning speed, labor-intensiveness and cost, and the use of an objective end point, the methods are at present not capable of replacing the predictive guinea pig test methods. Both the LLNA and MEST gave a lower sensitization rate with the weak and moderate contact allergens tested than the guinea pig test methods did. The MEST is judged to be less capable of detecting potential contact allergens than the LLNA, but on the other hand no false Ôpositive' reactivity with the irritant tested was seen. Dose-response designs of predictive test methods increase the amount of information obtained from each sensitization study and should be considered for inclusion in the protocols used when the sensitizing potential of a substance is investigated. Investigators are advised to select the predictive test method with the induction procedure that is most relevant for the prospected use of the substance being tested. A test method with a particular induction route may be more suitable for testing a substance than one of the recommended methods, so there is also a possibility to use other available standardized predictive animal test methods. However, that predictive test methods have a varying capacity to detect the sensitizing potential of a substance is evident...|$|E
