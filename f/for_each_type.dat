5|$|The Scout is {{required}} to achieve six different interest badges from the Scout Badge Book. While Scouts are encouraged to achieve as many interest badges as possible, they are only required to achieve the six that is needed for their Explorer badge. There are three compulsory badges <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of Explorer badge.|$|E
5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of function.|$|E
5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, {{certain forms of}} birth control may require further investigations. For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam—including birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms. For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of birth control.|$|E

5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E

25|$|The new gear {{had several}} {{advantages}} over all mechanical gears: {{the rate of}} fire was greatly improved, the synchronization was much more accurate, and above all it was readily adaptable to any type of engine and airframe, instead of needing a specially designed impulse generator <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of engine and special linkages <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of aircraft. In the long run (provided it was properly maintained and adjusted) it also proved far more durable and less prone to failure.|$|E

25|$|GPS signals {{can also}} be {{affected}} by multipath issues, where the radio signals reflect off surrounding terrain; buildings, canyon walls, hard ground, etc. These delayed signals cause measurement errors that are different <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of GPS signal due to its dependency on the wavelength.|$|E
25|$|The earlier establishments {{had merely}} {{laid out the}} {{principal}} dimensions <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of warship from the 100-gun first rates down to the 20-gun sixth rates (although with effect from the 1719 Establishment this was augmented by defining the sizes and thicknesses of wood {{to be used in}} the construction), and had left the actual design of each vessel to the Master Shipwright in each Naval Dockyard, with the Surveyor of the Navy responsible only for common designs for those ships built by contract by mercantile shipbuilders. However, under the new 1745 Establishment the responsibility for preparing designs ("draughts") for all ships was given to the Surveyor of the Navy, with the Master Shipwrights now responsible only for constructing ships to those common Surveyor's designs <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of vessel.|$|E

25|$|Unicode {{deals with}} the issue of {{simplified}} and traditional characters as part of the project of Han unification by including code points for each. This was rendered necessary {{by the fact that the}} linkage between simplified characters and traditional characters is not one-to-one. While this means that a Unicode system can display both simplified and traditional characters, it also means that different localization files are needed <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{are covered by}} a blanket type rating which is applicable to a grouping of aircraft types. For example, the aeroplanes blanket type rating covers all non-high performance, single engine aeroplanes that have a minimum flight crew requirement of one pilot. Examples {{of this type of}} {{aircraft are}} the Cessna 172 and the Piper Cherokee. These are considered similar enough that specific ratings are not required <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
