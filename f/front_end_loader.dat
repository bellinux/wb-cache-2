500|$|The Afghan company {{contracted}} to bring heavy construction equipment delayed its arrival to until 13 July. It {{was decided that}} soldier labor {{with the aid of}} an engineer squad and a Bobcat <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> already at Bella would be good enough to prepare an initial defense in the six days until heavier equipment arrived. The number of men at the base was judged enough to defend against intelligence estimates that placed the insurgent forces in the local area at only about 150 experienced fighters, though they did not know that attackers would be backed up by other guerrilla groups from neighboring regions as far away as Pakistan and Kashmir. While they thought it was possible the base might be attacked while the camp was being prepared, they thought it unlikely. Platoon Sergeant Dzwik later remarked [...] "I was expecting harassing fire from any one of the high ground in every direction. I did not think the village itself would let the AAF [...] turn their village into a battle zone.|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the level}} of {{resource}} recovery, material can be put through an air classifier which separates light organic material from heavy organic material.

50|$|A {{snowplow}} (also snow plow, snowplough or snow plough) is {{a device}} intended for mounting on a vehicle, used for removing {{snow and ice}} from outdoor surfaces, typically those serving transportation purposes. Although this term {{is often used to}} refer to vehicles mounting such devices, more accurately they are known as winter service vehicles, especially in areas that regularly receive large amounts of snow every year, or in specific environments such as airfields. In other cases, pickup trucks and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> are outfitted with attachments to fulfill this purpose. Some regions that do not frequently see snow may use graders to remove compacted snow and ice off the streets. Snowplows can also be mounted on rail cars or locomotives to clear railway tracks.|$|R
50|$|The Haulpak line {{of mining}} and quarry trucks was the best-performing sector for Wabco {{for the entire}} time they owned it and {{eventually}} the scrapers, wheel dozers, graders and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> would be discontinued from the Wabco catalogue. In 1968 Wabco had become part of American Standard Company (known for bathroom fittings) {{and then it would}} become part of Dresser Industries in 1984. After a Komatsu Limited-Dresser joint venture (KDC) in 1988 was formed, the Haulpak truck line was again (partly) under new ownership, although by 1994 Komatsu had purchased all remaining shares of KDC, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The Haulpak name was quietly discontinued around 1998 - 1999 and the new trucks were then known as Komatsu machines.|$|R
50|$|Erskine {{continues}} {{as the home}} of Erskine Attachments, formerly known as Erskine Manufacturing Company, established in 1948. The company began as a manufacturer of heavy equipment snowblowers and grain hitch elevators before changing its name to Erskine Attachments when it began manufacturing a line of Skid Steer Attachments for the Ingersoll Rand Bobcat company. Now private, Erskine Attachments manufactures more than 40 skid steer attachments including brush mowers, snowblowers, blades, buckets, grapples, post drivers, stump grinders, tree shears, and others that fit all skid steers and some <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> that utilize the skid steer style quick attach mechanism. Erskine Attachments was used as a pilot for the Minnesota JOBZ incentive program to revitalize Minnesota's manufacturing opportunities and has been referenced for its continuance as a viable success story.|$|R

50|$|Assembling the HESCO bastion entails {{unfolding}} it {{and filling}} it with sand, soil or gravel, usually using a <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loader.</b> The placement of the barrier is generally {{very similar to the}} placement of a sandbag barrier or earth berm except that room must generally be allowed for the equipment used to fill the barrier. The main advantage of HESCO barriers, strongly contributing to their popularity with troops and flood fighters, is the quick and easy setup. Previously, people had to fill sandbags, a slow undertaking, with one worker filling about 20 sandbags per hour. Workers using HESCO barriers and a <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> can do ten times the work of those using sandbags.|$|E
50|$|LHD (Load, Haul, Dump machine) {{is also a}} <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> but {{meant to}} be used for mine compact conditions, can handle various range of loads with varying size of buckets, and can be driven with {{electric}} motors as well as diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|Miners utilize {{equipment}} {{strong enough}} to break through extremely hard layers of the Earth's crust. This equipment, combined with the closed work space in which underground miners work, can cause hearing loss. For example, a roof bolter (commonly used by mine roof bolter operators) can reach sound power levels of up to 115 dB. Combined with the reverberant effects of underground mines, a miner without proper hearing protection is at a high risk for hearing loss. By age 50, nearly 90% of U.S. coal miners have some hearing loss, compared to only 10% among workers not exposed to loud noises. Roof bolters are among the loudest machines, but auger miners, bulldozers, continuous mining machines, <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders,</b> and shuttle cars and trucks are also among those machines most responsible for excessive noise in mine work.|$|R
50|$|The Sarawagi {{group has}} {{altogether}} {{a total of}} 12 mines, 8 of which are functioning. As mining extends deeper into the mines, the greater amount of material is lumps; {{it is expected that}} 80% of the estimated 20,000 mt monthly production will be lumpy ore.At present the company {{is in the process of}} acquiring prospecting licenses for new 6 concessions from the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh, which is in the final stages of clearances and expected to be granted in 2015. The company has an inventory of mining machinery which includes: 150 Mercedes Benz dumpers, 40 Komatsu 450 hydraulic excavators, 20 Liugong <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders,</b> 22 bulldozers of various capacities, and many Mercedes trucks and lorries.The company has a total resources of the current lease hold area of 5 million Tons and their current monthly production is 10,000 Tons.|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) classifies {{hearing loss}} as a {{separate}} illness category. Hearing loss accounted for 11 % of all illnesses in 2005 (U. S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2006 a). According to occupational data for coal mining provided by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) from 2000 to 2005, operators that exceeded 100 % noise dosage were from only seven types of machines: auger miners, bulldozers, continuous mining machines, <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders,</b> roof bolters, shuttle cars (electric) and trucks (Title 30 CFR Part 62, 2000 - 2005). Roof bolting machine operators rank second among all underground machine operators that exceed 100 % noise dose. There are approximately 600 underground coal mines with 3, 930 roof bolting machine operators (U. S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, 2005; U. S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics...|$|R
