Today's pole vaulters benefit from poles produced by wrapping pre-cut sheets of fiberglass that contains resin around a metal pole mandrel, to produce a slightly curved pole that bends more easily under the compression caused by an athlete's take-off. The shape of the fiberglass sheets {{and the amount of}} fiberglass used is carefully planned to provide the desired length and stiffness of pole.

500|$|Although pure silica is a {{perfectly}} viable glass and glass fiber, it must be worked with at very high temperatures, which is a drawback unless its specific chemical properties are needed.

The first type of glass used for fiber was soda lime glass or A-glass ("A" [...] for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A newer, alkali-free (<2%) type, <b>E-glass,</b> is an alumino-borosilicate glass. C-glass was developed to resist attack from chemicals, mostly acids that destroy <b>E-glass.</b> T-glass is a North American variant of C-glass. AR-glass is alkali-resistant glass. Most glass fibers have limited solubility in water but are very dependent on pH. Chloride ions will also attack and dissolve <b>E-glass</b> surfaces.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{reinforcement}} {{material for}} this process is glass-fibre rovings, which are chopped to a length of 10 to 40 mm and then applied on the mould.
