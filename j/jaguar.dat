5|$|Based on {{morphological}} evidence, British zoologist Reginald Pocock {{concluded the}} <b>jaguar</b> is most {{closely related to}} the leopard. However, DNA evidence is inconclusive and the position of the <b>jaguar</b> relative to the other species varies between studies. Fossils of extinct Panthera species, such as the European <b>jaguar</b> (Panthera gombaszoegensis) and the American lion (Panthera atrox), show characteristics of both the lion and the <b>jaguar.</b> Analysis of <b>jaguar</b> mitochondrial DNA has dated the species' lineage to between 280,000 and 510,000 years ago, later than suggested by fossil records.|$|E

5|$|Although in {{operational}} theatres {{such as the}} Gulf War the <b>Jaguar</b> {{proved to}} be mechanically more reliable than the Panavia Tornado, the aircraft's avionics were a hindrance to conducting missions.

The <b>Jaguar</b> provided a valuable component of the campaign, the RAF detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft lost.|$|E
5|$|Ecotourism setups {{are being}} used to {{generate}} public interest in charismatic animals such as the <b>jaguar,</b> {{while at the same time}} generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts.
