25|$|Kendall awakes {{from her}} coma {{days after her}} transplant. She is told of having been {{recently}} comatose, about her heart transplant, that Josh is dead and she has his heart, and of Bianca's engagement to Reese. Kendall is naturally overwhelmed by all the news, but handles it well. When she is told of Zach having fathered Bianca's second child, she seems numb to this news also. Her family <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would take this particular news badly, but Kendall seems okay with it. Greenlee (Kendall's best friend) and Erica, however, {{are the only ones}} to believe that Kendall is not okay with Zach being the father.|$|E
60|$|Billie stiffened. She <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{had been}} talking rather well.|$|E
60|$|Her father <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{was with}} her sister. Her sister <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was 'somewhere or other.' They had all trusted to finding her, as they had always done, quietly {{in the right place}} at the right moment. This going away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives that they had got through without her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I should <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> been {{as deeply}} {{offended}} at the presumption as poor Gillian {{was with the}} valentine.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Sharon Tate, such a {{beautiful}} girl, you would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> all the confidence in the world. But she had none." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{she brought}} the baby," [...] exclaimed Ethel. [...] "I should <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would not <b>have</b> taken her out before her christening." ...|$|R
60|$|It was odd {{to see her}} here. He <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was at Newnham.|$|E
6000|$|Still weeping, but not sadly--joyfully! And clasped {{in my arms}} as she {{had never}} been, as I <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> never was to be! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} the clock and jumped up. It was very much later than I <b>had</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>She</b> gave me her hands a little wistfully.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{does not}} understand,' said Siegmund to himself. 'And {{whatever}} I do I must not tell her. I should <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would understand.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is {{very odd}} {{that she should have}} let you learn to ride, which one would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> dreaded most of all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘A most {{impulsive}} lady!’ said Sir John. ‘Who would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{cared for}} him?’ And before {{the words were}} uttered, he was struggling in the Prince’s grasp.|$|R
60|$|Lemuel <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{was talking}} about him; but now a pang of jealousy went through him, and showed at the eyes he fixed on her.|$|E
60|$|Grizel laughed happily, {{for that}} {{explained}} it. Tommy {{had not had}} time to tell her yet. She laughed again at Elspeth, who <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{had so much to}} tell and did not know half the story.|$|E
60|$|Laura {{gave him}} a keen glance and got a jar. He frowned and his mouth was tight. She <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> could move Jimmy, but now she doubted, and because she was proud she dared not try.|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{gave him}} a look; he might <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> coloured; and for a little she made no rejoinder. “Does it strike you that I’m always talking about your place?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A most {{impulsive}} lady!" [...] said Sir John. [...] "Who would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{cared for}} him?" [...] And before {{the words were}} uttered, he was struggling in the Prince's grasp.|$|R
60|$|Cherry spoke very simply; {{she hoped}} it was better for Long, and {{believed}} Susan would make him a good wife. Ethel would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> did not feel, but Margaret knew better.|$|R
6000|$|I {{assured the}} man from the dingle that I had meant no disrespect to his wife. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was a mort," [...] said I; [...] "but the ria of a Romany chal is always sacred to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Grace {{turned her}} head. This {{was worse than}} she <b>had</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>She</b> was angry, and would not let Kit think she approved. Her eyes sparkled as she looked up. [...] "Ah," [...] she said, [...] "you {{deserved}} something very different! I wish you had not told me!" ...|$|E
60|$|Thus it must be. The revelation {{was indeed}} come. Presentiment {{had not been}} mistaken in her impulse: {{there is a kind}} of presentiment which never is mistaken; it was I who had for a moment miscalculated; not seeing the true bearing of the oracle, I <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> muttered of vision when, in truth, her {{prediction}} touched reality.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} how I could <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> looked white, or anything but burning red, when she answered {{that she had}} had it safe, a little while ago, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> but it was not worth looking for.|$|R
60|$|She {{had risen}} to her feet, with her arms folded across her breast, in an {{attitude}} of such Puritan composure that the distant spectators might <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was delivering an exordium to the prostrate man.|$|R
6000|$|... "My wife's work," [...] {{said the}} Colonel. [...] "Although I value it, I <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was mistaken in this drawing. My {{son is a}} man of action, and this is the face of a sentimentalist." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Scatcherd {{saw that}} she had nothing for it but to make the whole matter intelligible. Moreover, seeing that she {{appreciated}} more thoroughly the smallness of Dr Fillgrave's person than she did the peculiar greatness of his demeanour, she began to be a shade less afraid of him than she <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> should have been.|$|E
60|$|There {{was in this}} {{suggestion}} a quality of Tedham's old insinuation, but coarser, inferior, as if his insinuation had degenerated into something like mere animal cunning. I felt rather ashamed for him, but to my surprise, my wife seemed only to feel sorry, and did not repel his suggestion in the way I <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would.|$|E
60|$|Maryanne {{the while}} looked on, as ladies of yore did look on when knights {{slaughtered}} {{each other for}} their smiles. And perhaps of yore the hearts {{of those who did}} look on were as cold and callous as was hers. For one moment of enthusiasm she <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> loved, but now again she was indifferent. It might be settled as well this way as any other.|$|E
50|$|Hessler says AIP {{insisted he}} use Hilary Dwyer.:I don't {{know what the}} {{situation}} was, but they liked her and they kept pushing you to use certain actors. I guess the management must <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was star material or something like that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Leaving Rosamund to pine, perchance. Oh, {{could we}} {{be sure that}} she had no mind toward either of us, that would be best--to begone together. But, Wulf, we cannot be sure, since at times, to be honest, I <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> loves you." ...|$|R
6000|$|There! That's what I {{meant when}} I {{said that about}} the cheek of Woman as a sex. What I mean is, after what had happened, you'd <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> {{preferred}} to let the dead past bury its dead, and {{all that sort of}} thing, what? ...|$|R
60|$|Next morning an {{old woman}} from the town four miles away brought back Babette {{at the end of}} a string. Oh, such a soaked, bedraggled Babette! The old woman had found her {{crouching}} in a doorway, a bewildered little heap of palpitating femininity; and, reading the address upon her collar, and may be scenting a not impossible reward, <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might as well earn it for herself.|$|E
6000|$|A dusky shape came padding {{through the}} trees a little way off, another--two donkeys loose from somewhere, who stood licking each other's necks and noses. Those two humble beasts, so friendly, made her feel ashamed. Why should she be sorry for herself, she who had {{everything}} in life she wanted--except love--the love she <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would never want? Ah, but she wanted it now, wanted it at last with all her being! ...|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps men only {{begin to}} love when they {{cease to be}} dazzled and admire. He <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might reproach him, he had felt and feared she might set herself to stir his senses, and both these {{expectations}} had been unjust to her he saw, now that he saw her beside him, a brave, rather ill-advised and unlucky little struggler, stung and shamed. He forgot the particulars of that first lunch of theirs together and he remembered his mother's second contemptuous [...] "STUFF!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Hinijer, the Vicar's housekeeper, {{looked at}} the Angel suspiciously when she brought in the tea. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> him rather a [...] "queer customer." [...] What <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> seen him in saffron no one can tell.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are drawing}} in upon her fast," [...] he said, [...] "but she is {{travelling}} well, too; {{much better than}} I should <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> done with that rig. I think she has got a better wind than we have. She has only made one short tack in {{for the last two}} hours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I can {{remember}} that," [...] said Kate, her face growing sad as her mind travelled back to years gone by. What would that same father <b>have</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>she</b> wondered, <b>had</b> he known how this man opposite to her had treated her! What {{did it matter}} now, though, when she would so soon be out of his power! ...|$|R
