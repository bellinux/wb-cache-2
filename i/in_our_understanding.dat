5|$|The duality {{represents}} a major advance <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of string theory and quantum gravity. This {{is because it}} provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions {{and because it is}} the most successful realization of the holographic principle, an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by Gerard 't Hooft and promoted by Leonard Susskind.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One {{of the major}} unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that {{may be useful in}} the long run. (See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).|$|E
5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army {{have to contend with}} a {{dramatic}} diminution of the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely because almost all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, there was a huge {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of military units on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend should probably not be seen as indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows that military units continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due to organic decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} The Midnight Sun, Alford {{drew on the}} work of J.P. Allen to {{elucidate}} the 'physics' of the ancient Egyptian creation myth. He argued, following Allen, that the creation myth provided a coherent and consistent account of the creation of the cosmos, albeit on a geocentric view, and accordingly proposed a central role for this myth <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of ancient Egyptian religion. He further argued, contra Allen and others, that the sun-god was secondary to the creator-god in Egypt, being tasked (alongside the pharaoh) with re-enacting the creation myth in order that the cosmic order (ma'at) be made to endure for ever. Alford thus held that the traditional cults of Egyptian religion were facets of a unifying 'cult of creation'.|$|E

They were essential in establishing the foundations of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as the quark model of hadrons and the theory of quark mixing (the latter was acknowledged by a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2008). Kaons have played a distinguished role <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of fundamental conservation laws: CP violation, a phenomenon generating the observed matter–antimatter asymmetry of the universe, was discovered in the kaon system in 1964 (which was acknowledged by a Nobel Prize in 1980).

25|$|The {{chronology}} of this era is particularly uncertain due to difficulties <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of the text, {{our understanding of}} the material culture of the Early Dynastic period and a general lack of radiocarbon dates for sites in Iraq. Also, the multitude of city-states made for a confusing situation, as each had its own history. The Sumerian king list is one record of the political history of the period. It starts with mythological figures with improbably long reigns, but later rulers have been authenticated with archaeological evidence. The first of these is Enmebaragesi of Kish, c. 2600 BC, said by the king list to have subjected neighboring Elam. However, one complication of the Sumerian king list is that although dynasties are listed in sequential order, some of them actually ruled at the same time over different areas.|$|E

2500|$|New {{scientific}} knowledge rarely results in vast changes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding.</b> According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, {{it may be}} the media's overuse of words like [...] "breakthrough" [...] that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false. While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap. Theories vary in {{the extent to which they}} have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community. For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name [...] "theory" [...] even though, in practice, they are considered factual.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{contacts}} on a social platform is sometimes considered {{an indicator of}} social capital.

Indeed, people tend to add friends to compensate low self-esteem {{and there is a}} high correlation between the number of [...] "friends" [...] on social media platforms and feeling social anxiety, leading to symptoms of major depression and dysthymia. [...] If we consider this aspect with regards to the relationships maintained through social media platforms, we can easily point out a change <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> of friendship. As a matter of fact, online platforms and social media services altered the old definition of friendship. Indeed, friendship [...] "redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves" [...] as stated by Francis Bacon. However, nowadays we see that Facebook friends for instance encourage negative feelings, such as envy, revenge and sadness.|$|E
2500|$|Structural {{violence}} is often embedded in longstanding social structures, ubiquitous throughout the globe, that are regularized by persistent institutions and regular experience with them. These social structures seem so normal <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> {{of the world}} that they are almost invisible, but inequality in resource access, political power, education, healthcare, and legal standing are all possible perpetrators of structural violence. Structural violence occurs [...] "whenever persons are harmed, maimed, or killed by poverty and unjust social, political, and economic institutions, systems, or structures" [...] Structural violence can contribute to worse health outcomes through either harming or killing victims, just like armed violence can have these effects. This type of unintended harm perpetuated by structural violence progressively promotes misery and hunger that eventually results in death, among other effects. Ehrlich and Ehrlich reported in 1970 that between 10 and 20 million of the 60 million annual deaths across the globe result from starvation and malnutrition. Their report also estimated that structural violence was responsible for the end of one billion lives between 1948 and 1967 in the third world.|$|E
