A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the [...] "bar keel", which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries. Where grounding is possible, this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings, but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity. If a double bottom is fitted, the keel is almost inevitably of the <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> type, bar <b>keels</b> often being associated with open floors, where the <b>plate</b> <b>keel</b> may also be fitted.|$|R
