Paris, 1784) contain experiments on moisture, evaporation and the indications of hygrometers and thermometers. He applied the barometer to the determination of heights. The Philosophical Transactions published his account of a new hygrometer, which resembled a mercurial thermometer, with an ivory bulb, which expanded by moisture, and caused the mercury to descend. He later devised a whalebone hygrometer which sparked a bitter controversy with Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, himself inventor of a <b>hair</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> He gave the first correct rules for measuring heights {{with the help of}} a barometer. Deluc advocated the use of mercury, instead of alcohol, in thermometers.|$|E

Klinkerfues had developed a bifilar-hygrometer which was widely used but did not prove in laymen's hands. After that Lambrecht built a <b>hair</b> <b>hygrometer,</b> [...] "Model Klinkerfues". In 1873, after separation from Klinkerfues, Lambrecht started to build new meteorological instruments such as polymeters, dew point monitors, and aspiration psychrometers. His weather telegraphs, weather columns and combinations of different meteorological instruments were in use at several bigger cities and foreign health resorts before World War I. Lambrecht also built medical thermometers. At the same time he developed the so-called minimum thermometer with a narrowing of the lumen of the capillary which is placed above the mercury container. His precision instruments are well-known all over the world.|$|E

40|$|The German {{cardinal}} Nicolaus Cusanus (1401 – 1463) {{proposed the}} determination of the humidity of air using a balance loaded with wool. Several years later the Italian architect and painter Leo Battista Alberti (1404 – 1472) recommended a sponge as the absorbing material. From Leonardo da Vinci (1452 – 1519), we have drawings of gravimetric hygrometers, equipped with either a sponge or cotton. Using an electromagnetic vacuum microbalance, we measured water vapour absorption and desorption isotherms in order to estimate whether these instruments could be used as hygrometers. Our investigations include measurements with human hair for comparison of the mass effect of the water absorption with the length variation, as used in de Saussure's <b>hair</b> <b>hygrometer...</b>|$|E
40|$|Moisture is an {{essential}} parameter in the behaviour of capillary-porous construction materials such as timber and concrete. It affects liquid and gas transport phenomena, chemical and biological degradation processes, mechanical properties and, {{in the case of}} concrete, hydration. From a scientific point of view, moisture monitoring is essential in order to improve the understanding of material behaviour. Moisture measurements may increase the predictive accuracy of established material behaviour models. In practice, the increased knowledge of material behaviour improves structural maintenance planning. The main objective of this work is to propose a measurement method for non-destructive, in-depth moisture monitoring of construction materials. In this context, an intrinsic point and an averaging fibre optic relative humidity sensor have been developed and tested. The sensors are based on optical fibres that are coated with a hygroscopically swelling transducer polymer. When wet, the swelling of the coating strains the fibre (analogy with the <b>hair</b> <b>hygrometer).</b> The induced strain is assessed with conventional fibre optic strain sensing techniques such as fibre Bragg gratings and Michelson interferometry. Theoretical and experimental studies lead to a detailed understanding of the influence of humidity and temperature on the steady and transient state sensor behaviour. The sensors have an accurate, linear, reversible and reproducible response to relative humidity between 5 and 95 %RH and between 13 and 60 °C, at least. The sensor response time is in the order of 20 minutes. However, when packaged, the sensor responds slower. The temperature cross-sensitivity of the fibre Bragg grating sensor may be compensated with an additional non-hygroscopic grating, while the Michelson interferometric sensor provides an auto-compensation of temperature effects. Tests in mortar and timber samples demonstrate that the sensors preserve their sensing ability when embedded. These tests have also clarified the multiplexing potential of fibre Bragg gratings for forming a multi-point RH sensor. Multi-point sensors are particularly useful for profile measurements...|$|E
