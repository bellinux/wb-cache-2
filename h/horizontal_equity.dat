50|$|The {{principle}} of user pay {{supports the idea}} of <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity,</b> which states that those in similar wealth and income positions should be treated equally by the tax system. The basic idea is that {{those who do not}} use a service should not be obligated to pay for it. As long as the beneficiary aligns exactly with the user, the user pay principle works. Those who do not go to a movie are not obligated to pay for someone else to attend.|$|E
50|$|When {{discussing}} what a {{fair and}} optimal tax level would be, the principle of equity, both horizontal and vertical, is important. Equity is determined by first assessing an individual’s ability-to-pay. The idea of the ability-to-pay principle considers {{whether or not it}} is fair to tax someone higher just because that person has the ability and resources to pay. If it is decided that they should be required to pay more, the question of how much more arises. These questions can be analyzed through horizontal and vertical equity which are subsets of the ability-to-pay principle. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> suggests it is fair if people who have equal ability-to-pay actually do pay the same amount in taxes. Vertical equity is the idea that people who have a higher ability-to-pay should actually pay more than those who have a lower ability-to-pay, as long as the increase in tax level is considered to be reasonable.|$|E
50|$|Problems with <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> {{consist of}} the idea that taxing {{individuals}} with the same ability to pay implies that two individuals earning the same income should be taxed equally. However, Randall Holcombe depicts a scenario where one of these people is single while the other married with children, and that charging these people the same amount does not correctly reflect their ability to pay. Conversely, this situation can also support the opposite argument. In this same example, if one individual chooses to spend his income to support his family, and another to travel, each individual now has less money to pay taxes with. However, this raises the question on how the government should treat these choices differently if at all for taxation purposes. As Holcombe showed through his examples, it is possible to apply different tax principles to the same situation and reach a different logical solution, but as these are normative issues, {{it can be difficult to}} reach a solution. So it is up to individual societies to determine what tax structure to implement.|$|E

50|$|A tax {{expenditure}} program is government spending through the tax code. Tax expenditures alter the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>equity</b> {{of the basic}} tax system by allowing exemptions, deductions, or credits to select groups or specific activities.

40|$|The current {{differences}} in the global economic literature have been taken into consideration and definitions are formulated for tax neutrality as opposed to tax expenses (tax privileges). The issues concerning the borderline between these two principles are outlined, {{as well as the}} opposition between the ideal concepts of the theory and the unavoidable compromises of the practice. The key obvious forms of tax expenses are revealed as deviations from the <b>horizontal</b> tax <b>equity</b> principle. The advantages and the disadvantages of the tax neutrality and the tax expenses are analyzed as contradictory approaches according to the contemporary economic theories. An attempt was made to contribute to the clarification and alignment of the terms of the available theoretical points of view, and to create a “coordinate system” in support of the practical tax policy aiming at a better implementation of the tax <b>equity</b> principle (<b>horizontal</b> and vertical). ...|$|R
50|$|Faced with {{problems}} {{inherited from the}} previous administration, {{the most important of}} which being the large fiscal deficit heightened by the low tax effort due to a weak tax system, Aquino enacted the 1986 Tax Reform Program (TRP). The aim of the TRP was to “simplify the tax system, make revenues more responsive to economic activity, promote <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> and promote growth by correcting existing taxes that impaired business incentives”. One of the major reforms enacted under the program was the introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT), which was set at 10%. The 1986 tax reform program resulted in reduced fiscal imbalance and higher tax effort in the succeeding years, peaking in 1997, before the enactment of the 1997 Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP). The share of non-tax revenues during this period soared due to the sale of sequestered assets of President Marcos and his cronies (totalling to about ₱20 billion), the initial efforts to deregulate the oil industry and thrust towards the privatization of state enterprises. Public debt servicing and interest payments as a percent of the budget peaked during this period as government focused on making up for the debt incurred by the Marcos administration. Another important reform enacted during the Aquino administration was the passage of the 1991 Local Government Code which enabled fiscal decentralization. This increased the taxing and spending powers to local governments in effect increasing local government resources.|$|E
5000|$|One {{example of}} a {{positive}} internality is the long run effect of exercising. Future benefits that an individual may not take into consideration include a diminished {{risk of heart disease}} and higher bone density. [...] A common {{example of a}} negative internality is the effect of smoking cigarettes on those who smoke. For the effect of secondhand smoke, see externality. Statistically, 80% of smokers want to quit, and 54% of people who are serious about quitting fail in a week or less. [...] This implies that they do not act in their long-term best interest due to short-term discomfort, also known as a self-control problem. If the demand for cigarettes has a high price elasticity of demand, which evidence seems to suggest, the government can combat the negative internality by raising taxes. [...] It {{is important to note that}} elasticity might change based on location and knowledge about the harmful health effects of smoking. [...] In traditional economic theory, a tax diminishes the welfare of the poor because the tax burden shifts to low-income communities, as fewer can afford the good (cigarettes), and <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> (economics) is distorted. However, behavioral economic theory suggests that the tax is not regressive if low-income communities have higher (healthcare) costs and more price sensitivity than individuals with higher incomes. [...] Taxes imposed to combat internalities are most effective when they target a specific good. A tax on junk food could apply to a large variety of goods that are widely consumed, and the cost of the tax might be perceived as more detrimental than beneficial for society. [...] A major issue with creating effective legislature against negative internalities is that the tax imposed should only reflect the cost that individuals do not factor into their consumption decisions. [...] The difficulty in measuring individual knowledge is an obstacle to developing new policies. Another point of concern is that the group benefitting from the tax, such as smokers who want to quit, must be sizable enough to offset any backlash from tobacco companies and lobbyists.|$|E

We find that implementable <b>horizontal</b> and proportional <b>equity</b> schemes are Pareto efficient. The green equity scheme, however, is generally inefficient. Unlike the others, our proposed proportional equity scheme is necessarily implementable – all nations always choose to participate.

Introduction [...] Methodology [...] Was the {{enactment}} of the CGT regime actuated by a perception that it will satisfy the policy objective of <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity?</b> [...] Is the perception that the CGT regime will satisfy the policy objective of <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> a perception that is largely correct? [...] What reasons could (in theory) cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that fail to satisfy <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity?</b> [...] What reasons in practice cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity?</b> [...] Is there reasons to expect outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> (caused by the CGT regime) to be widespread? [...] Overall conclusions, policy implications of them, and delimitations of the research. The research problem addressed in this thesis is: Does the Australian regime of income tax on capital gains cause widespread violation of <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity?</b> The conclusion drawn in this thesis is that there is reason to expect that the Australian regime of income tax on capital gains ("the CGT regime") can cause widespread violation of <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity.</b> That conclusion is reached by seeking answers to five questions: Question 1. Was {{the enactment}} of the CGT regime, and the continuance of it after enactment, actuated by a perception (of respectively the government which enacted it, and subsequent governments which yielded to its continuance) that the regime will satisfy the policy objective of <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity?,</b> and, if it was, Question 2. Is that perception largely correct?, and, if it is, Question 3. What reasons could (in theory) cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that fail to satisfy <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> (that is, outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity)</b> ?, and, if such reasons exist, Question 4. Do those reasons (or any other) in practice cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity?,</b> and, if they do, Question 5. Is there reason to expect those outcomes to be widespread? [...] This thesis argues that only any one of four reasons can (in theory) cause the CGT regime to potentially produce outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity.</b> Those four reasons (designated as respectively Reason A, Reason B, Reason C and Reason D) are: Reason A. The best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant legislative provisions can result in outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity.</b> Reason B. Though the best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant legislative provisions does not result in outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity,</b> the Australian judiciary's interpretation of those legislative provisions, not being compatible with the best interpretation of those legislative provisions (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary), can result in outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity.</b> Reason C. Though the best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant legislative provisions does not result in outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity,</b> the Commissioner's interpretation of those legislative provisions (generally, as evinced in rulings) can result in outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity.</b> That would occur where the Commissioner's interpretation of relevant legislative provisions is not compatible with their best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary). Reason D. Though the Australian judiciary's interpretation of relevant legislative provisions (despite not being the best interpretation of those legislative provisions, based on the current approach of the Australian judiciary) does not result in outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity,</b> the Commissioner's interpretation of those legislative provisions (generally, as evinced in rulings) can result in outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity.</b> That would occur where the Commissioner's interpretation of relevant legislative provisions is not compatible with their interpretation by the Australian judiciary (albeit, based on the current approach of the Australian judiciary, such interpretation of the Australian judiciary not being compatible with the best interpretation of those legislative provisions). [...] In the arrangements pursuant to which legislative provisions imposing CGT are enacted and implemented, there is an absence of systematic sensitivity to those four reasons. In those arrangements, there is also an absence of institutionalised processes (mandated by legislation or otherwise) for the identification of outcomes that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity,</b> and effecting legislative amendments to prevent such outcomes. Due to those absences, in this thesis, the conclusion is reached that there is reason to expect outcomes from the detailed working of the CGT regime that violate <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> to be widespread. [...] Those four reasons can be effectively addressed through: a consequentialist approach to interpreting legislative provisions imposing CGT, buttressed by legislative directives to the Australian judiciary and other means necessary for making such an approach practicable; post-implementation reviews of CGT measures enacted to ensure that those measures do not cause violation of horizontal equity; and enacting explicit legislative directives essentially precluding the Commissioner from issuing rulings (or any like pronouncements) which are inconsistent with judicial authority. [...] A status quo where there is reason to expect widespread violation of <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> caused by the CGT regime may be perpetuated if those four reasons are not addressed. Such an outcome will retard sound tax administration because the public's willingness to optimally comply with a tax will not be fostered unless the public views that tax as one which satisfies <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity.</b> An absence of optimal compliance will make a tax inefficacious. The CGT may become a tax relegated to such a status if those four reasons are not addressed. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 293...|$|E

First, it studies a political economy model of family taxation using a household economics approach to behaviour; {{the nature of the}} winning policy is found to depend on whether i) the parents control their fertility or not, ii) they value their children or not. Second, it investigates the question whether the winning policy is capable to achieve <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> (i. e. the requirement that all agents who are in all relevant senses identical should be treated identically); it turns out that under endogenous fertility, any winning policy trivially satisfies <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity,</b> but if fertility is exogenous for some of (or all) the parents, <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> is virtually impossible to satisfy.

The <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> constraint requires that individuals with the same ability have to pay the same amount of taxes regardless of their preferences for leisure. Contrary to normal findings, we find that a good that is complementary to leisure need not be discouraged by the tax system, and that a good that normally should be discouraged by the tax system need not be taxed at a positive rate even if the economy is composed of only two private commodities plus leisure. Similarly, the marginal effective tax rate need not be equal to zero at the top when the tax mix obeys the <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> constraint. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> is the {{principle}} that people who earn equal income should owe equal tax. It has gotten a bad name. Although <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> remains a textbook criterion of tax fairness, scholarly literature is largely hostile. Scholars ranging from the legal theorist Louis Kaplow to philosophers Thomas Nagel and Liam Murphy question its conceptual coherence and normative significance. The crux of the case against <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> is that it seems irrational {{to worry about the}} relationship between pre-tax income and tax obligations rather than determining tax policy in light of what our best theory of distributive justice tells us is the best post-tax outcome. I argue that <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> is best understood as a compromise principle for people who disagree about deeper principles of distributive justice. The debate over <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> reflects two distinct ways of thinking about fairness. One approach starts with principles that specify a just distribution of income, resources or utility and uses these principles to derive appropriate tax laws. A second approach analyzes fairness norms as stable and mutually advantageous compromises between people who have conflicting interests and differing moral commitments. Proponents and opponents of redistributive taxation can agree that at any given level of redistribution they will each be better off if taxes are horizontally equitable. Horizontally equitable taxation can thus prevent rent-seeking and ideological conflict over tax policy from generating a wasteful patchwork of narrow taxes and tax subsidies. Observing <b>horizontal</b> <b>equity</b> may be unimportant when people agree on ideal principles of justice and the relevant empirical facts. But under more usual conditions of deep moral and empirical disagreement over tax policy, treating pre-tax income as a normative baseline can prevent conflict over distributive questions from leading to wasteful and inequitable tax policy...|$|E
