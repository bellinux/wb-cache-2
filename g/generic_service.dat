40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for sharing {{interactive}} and dynamic 3 D models that are collaboration-unaware, i. e., models {{that have not been}} designed to be used by multiple users at the same time. This functionality is an essential requirement for the inclusion of arbitrary 3 D models, as generated by standard CAD or animation software, into teleconferencing sessions. A key aim of this work is to show that {{a large part of the}} required functionality can be developed in a way so that it is reusable for other applications such as shared whiteboards or networked computer games. Our method therefore consists of both an application dependent part that handles the specific tasks required for sharing 3 D models, and of a number of <b>generic</b> <b>services</b> such as synchronization, scalable support for latecomers, and the ability to record and replay sessions. The <b>generic</b> <b>services</b> are based on an abstract media model and the RTP/I application level protocol for distributed interactive media. Any other application for a medium that shares this model and that uses RTP/I may reuse these <b>generic</b> <b>services.</b> We have implemented a prototype called TeCo 3 D demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|NFV and SDN are {{nowadays}} {{seen as a}} solid opportunity by telecom {{operators to}} reduce costs {{while at the same}} time providing new and better services. Recently, the Unify project proposed a multi-layered architecture that, leveraging different levels of abstraction, can orchestrate and deploy <b>generic</b> network <b>services</b> on the physical infrastructure of the telecom operator. In this paper, we exploit such an architecture to deliver end-to-end <b>generic</b> <b>services</b> in presence of multiple concurring players (e. g. network operator, end-users), leveraging a new simple data model. Particularly, we propose a description-based approach allowing the deployment agile, implementation-independent and high-level network services over a distributed set of resources. The resulting data model can abstract <b>generic</b> <b>services,</b> including both middlebox-based (e. g., firewalls, NATs, etc.) and traditional LAN-based ones (e. g., a BitTorrent client). Finally, two distinct prototypes, originated by different design principles, are implemented in order to validate our proposal with the aim of demonstrating the adaptability of our approach to different context...|$|R

50|$|The ASP {{model is}} often {{compared}} with Software as a Service (SaaS), {{but while the}} latter typically delivers a <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> at scale to many users, the former typically involved delivering a service to {{a small number of}} users (often using separate single-tenant instances). This meant that the many benefits of multi-tenancy (cost sharing, economies of scale, etc.) were not accessible to ASP providers, and their services were more comparable to in-house hosting than to true multi-tenant SaaS solutions like Salesforce.com.|$|E

Application activity monitoring allows organizations to associate specific database transactions with particular application end-users, {{in order to identify}} unauthorized or suspicious activities.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{identify}} the <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> quality dimensions of technology-based banking and to {{examine the effect of}} these dimensions on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Design/methodology/approach – The <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> quality dimensions are identified using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Next {{the reliability and validity of}} the factors and customer satisfaction and customer loyalty are established through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using AMOS 16. 0 s/w. The related hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling using AMOS 16. 0. Findings – The paper identifies four <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> quality dimensions in the technology-based banking services – customer service, technology security and information quality, technology convenience, and technology usage easiness and reliability. It was found that customer service and technology usage easiness and reliability have positive and significant impact on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. It was also found that technology convenience and customer satisfaction have significant and positive impact on customer loyalty. Practical implications – These dimensions of service quality should be viewed as the levers of improving perceived service quality with respect to technology-based banking in the minds of its current customers. Examining the service quality dimensions' impact on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty for technology-based banking can offer banks valuable insights regarding which aspects of the service to focus on in order to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty towards the firms. Originality/value – This paper introduces the concept of <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> quality and its significance for customer satisfaction and loyalty in case of technology-based banking wherein technology is used to deliver services...|$|E

At the same time, the specialist services have difficulty providing a comprehensive range of services to all children and families in need, and cannot easily arrange access for children and families to the <b>generic</b> <b>services</b> that they need.

Evidence regarding the effectiveness of the various forms of system organisation is presented, and potential barriers to effective co-ordination outlined. The problems involved in catering for children and families with special needs within a universal system are addressed. Key issues considered include the need for effective ways of identifying child and family needs as early as possible, and of deploying specialist resources t...|$|R
