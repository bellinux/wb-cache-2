25|$|Harold Fraser-Simson (15 August 1872 – 19 January 1944) was an English {{composer}} {{of light}} music, including songs and the scores to musical comedies. His most famous musical was the World War <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>The</b> Maid of the Mountains, and he later set numerous children's poems to music, {{especially those of}} A. A. Milne.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Smith to earn {{recognition}} in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out {{in the top of}} the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, [...] "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill {{attended}} {{his first}} boat drag racing event in 1974 at Austin, Texas. He thought the drivers were [...] "crazy" [...] after {{he saw a}} driver being thrown from his boat during a crash. Less than a month later, Hill had stopped motorcycle racing to drag race boats, despite {{not being able to}} swim. [...] "Once <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> water with the boat, I never went back to motorcycles," [...] Hill recalled. [...] "The power, speed, and acceleration were all things that I had missed since I quit drag racing." [...] He began racing in a non-blown hydroplane, winning in his first event. In his third race he set the class top speed. In 1975, he set the Southern Drag Boat Association (SDBA) speed record at [...] In 1976, he switched to nitromethane fuel and set the SDBA record with a [...] run. He was the SDBA top pointgetter and won the National Drag Boat Association (NDBA) World Fuel & Gas championship. He repeated as champion in both series in 1977, setting the NDBA record with a [...] run.|$|E

500|$|Although Steven {{said the}} horse [...] "rated himself", sportswriters speculated that once in front, the {{experienced}} Stevens had slowed the pace, leaving Oxbow with enough reserves {{for the final}} push. Turning for home, Oxbow [...] "exploded off the turn" [...] and led by three lengths. Never seriously challenged, he recorded a 15–1 upset victory by one and three quarter lengths in front of runner-up Itsmyluckyday. Mylute finished third and Derby champion Orb was fourth. Oxbow earned a career-high speed figure of 112, which was higher than Orb's {{had been in the}} Derby. In post-race interviews, Stevens said, [...] "His mind was right", [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> half-mile pole... The race was over at that point", and [...] "hey gave me a free three-quarters of a mile today." [...] Stevens later tweeted that Oxbow was the [...] "most intelligent horse I have ever ridden". He noted the horse was not particularly tired after the race and described him as a [...] "happy horse" [...] in the winner's circle. Lukas said, [...] "He never even broke a sweat." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E

[...] Then on May 4, whilst playing a DJ set at a club in Frankfurt (Germany), Guetta premiered his extended remix.

International promotion for the song began a week later with live UK debut of [...] "Commander" [...] at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend. This was followed up on June 15 with a live performance and interview on The Graham Norton Show and a medley performance on June 25 in Singapore. Rowland has subsequently appeared three more times in the UK on GMTV, an acoustic performance on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge; as well as The 5 O'Clock Show. [...] "Commander" [...] was performed in acoustic {{for a second time}} on Radio 2's Saturday Sessions with Dermot O'Leary. In August 2010 the Canadian dance show, So You Think You Can Dance Canada used the song for their season three promotion TV clips. The music was also used in the presentation of delegates and opening number of the live telecast of Miss Universe 2010 in Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas.|$|E

2500|$|Based {{partly on}} this promise, Hall was {{selected}} in the West Indian squad to tour England in 1957. Despite great enthusiasm, Hall struggled in the unfamiliar surroundings, unable to pitch the ball anywhere near the wicket. Hall remarked later [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> softer wickets I was like a fish out of water." [...] Hall did not play {{in any of the}} Test matches and in first-class matches on the tour as a whole took 27 wickets at an average of 33.55. Hall's lack of success in England saw him overlooked for the entire home Test series against Pakistan in 1957–58.|$|E

After his release from prison in 2009, he was introduced by his manager, Pete Farmer, to music executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine at Geffen and Interscope Records. DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, [...] "we put a plan together and the minute I stepped into the studio I was so nervous, but I felt so much power just coming through me soon as <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> microphone it was like, it was still there".

Ed O'Brien said: [...] "That's the sound of Jonny trying to fuck the song up. He really didn't like it the first time we played it, so he tried spoiling it. And it made the song." [...] During the song's outro, Jonny Greenwood plays a piano figure.

[...] The crew were pinned down by accurate fire from AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), with five to seven RPGs flying over their heads by just a metre and bullets passing inches from their heads and hitting the ground either side of them. It was speculated that a sniper had targeted Kemp possibly because they knew they were journalists, or because their blue protective clothing looked unusual, and the camera may have looked like a weapon. The crew were pinned down for [...] "about seven to ten minutes" [...] with return fire commencing after [...] "three or four minutes" [...] after the soldiers had got into cover.
