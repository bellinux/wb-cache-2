5000|$|Tetrachords were {{classified}} in ancient Greek theory into genera {{depending on the}} position of the third note lichanos (the indicator) <b>from</b> the <b>bottom</b> of the lower tetrachord (in the upper tetrachord, referred to as the paranete). The interval between this note and the uppermost define the genus. A lichanos a minor third <b>from</b> the <b>bottom</b> and one whole (major second) from the top, genus diatonic. If the interval was a minor third, about one whole tone <b>from</b> the <b>bottom,</b> genus chromatic. If the interval was a major third with the 4/3 (or a semitone <b>from</b> the <b>bottom),</b> genus enharmonic [...] In Archytas's case, only the lichanos varies.|$|R

Motherwell enjoyed another successful season, finishing second in the 201314 Scottish Premiership. The position was achieved by winning on the final day against nearest rivals Aberdeen. After a bad start to the 201415 season left Motherwell second <b>from</b> <b>bottom,</b> McCall resigned as manager on 2 November.|$|E

The club also reached the playoff final the {{following}} year, losing 4–3 to Swindon Town, having come back from 3–0 down. In 1993–94 City were promoted from the playoffs, beating Derby County 2–1 in the final. Little quit as Leicester manager the following November to take charge at Aston Villa, and his successor Mark McGhee was unable to save Leicester from finishing second <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> in the 1994–95 season.|$|E
5|$|Dover Athletic F.C. {{was formed}} in 1983 after the town's {{previous}} club, Dover, folded due to its debts. The new club took Dover's place in the Southern League Southern Division, with former Dover player Alan Jones as manager and a team consisting mainly of reserve players from the old club. Initially Athletic struggled, finishing second <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> of {{the table in the}} 1984–85 season. In November 1985 Steve McRae, who had succeeded Jones a year earlier, was sacked and replaced by Chris Kinnear.|$|E

In {{his first season}} in charge, 1999–2000, Robson led the club to an 11th-place finish, with 14 wins from his 32 matches in charge. In late 2000, following the resignation of ex-Magpies boss Kevin Keegan as England manager, the FA asked Newcastle club chairman Freddy Shepherd to permit Robson to take over in a part-time caretaker capacity, but the request was refused. Robson guided Newcastle <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> of the Premier League to a fourth-place finish in the 2001–02 season.

5|$|Luton Town {{moved to}} Kenilworth Road in 1905, leaving their {{previous}} home at Dunstable Road after their landlord sold {{the site for}} housing at short notice. The club's directors quickly procured a new site, and the club's first match at the new ground came on 4 September 1905—a 0–0 draw against Plymouth Argyle. Watford player C. Barnes scored the first ever goal at the stadium, in a reserve match. Originally known as Ivy Road, the new ground brought success with it—in their last season at Dunstable Road, Luton had finished second <b>from</b> <b>bottom,</b> but in the first at Kenilworth Road, Luton finished fourth in the Southern League.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Brian Horton, {{his former}} captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh's {{services}} in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> with eleven Premier League games left {{to play and}} Walsh's strike partner Uwe Rösler was also a new signing – and had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding however, {{and the arrival of}} wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking firepower to steer clear of the relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals between them in the final ten games.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s did {{not start}} well for the club; having avoided relegation in the 1950–51 and 1951–52 seasons, Stoke succumbed in 1952–53, {{finishing}} second <b>from</b> <b>bottom.</b> Bob McGrory resigned as the club's manager in February 1952 after 17 years in the role. His successor, Frank Taylor, consolidated the club's position in the Second Division {{but was unable to}} mount a sustained challenge for promotion, although Stoke came close in the 1954–55 season, missing by two points. Taylor's failure to deliver promotion led to his dismissal in June 1960, after a 17th-place finish in the 1959–60 season.|$|E

5|$|The club, Thames Ironworks {{were the}} first ever winners of the West Ham Charity Cup in 1895 contested by clubs in the West Ham locality, then won the London League in 1897. They turned {{professional}} in 1898 upon entering the Southern League Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division at the first attempt. The following year they came second <b>from</b> <b>bottom,</b> but had established themselves as a fully fledged competitive team. They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals Fulham in a relegation play-off, 5–1 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status.|$|E
5|$|Though {{extremely}} rare, the {{bigeye sand tiger}} {{has been}} reported from scattered locations around the world, suggesting a wide and possibly disjunct global distribution in tropical and warm-temperate oceanic waters.

The only evidence for its presence in the Indian Ocean is a set of jaws that may have originated from the Seychelles, though the South China Sea is another possibility. The existence of this species in the Pacific Ocean was first suspected in 1970 from teeth recovered <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> sediments, which was confirmed over a decade later by captures from the Marshall Islands and Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Kit changes {{had been}} {{introduced}} in the late 1930s. The 1937 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and celebrating twenty-five years in League Football by applying for re-election for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1951, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in {{the bottom half of}} the table until the League was restructured in 1958, requiring re-election a third and final time in 1956, with only Swindon keeping them <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> spot that season.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{suggested the}} discovery and subsequent positive exposure and good morale {{around the city}} contributed to Leicester City F.C.'s shock Premier League victory in 2016. A {{few days after the}} burial, Leicester City began a winning streak to take them <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> of the league to comfortably avoiding relegation, and they {{went on to win the}} league the following year. Mayor Peter Soulsby said:For too long, people in Leicester have been modest about their achievements and the city they live in. Now - thanks first to the discovery of King Richard III and the Foxes' phenomenal season - it's our time to step into the international limelight.and:It has been said that we are somehow being repaid for burying Richard with honour in our cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The club {{appointed}} Ian Holloway {{as their}} new manager on 6 January 2014, {{with the club}} sitting 21st in the table. He was given the priority of maintaining their Football League Championship status, which he achieved. Millwall went unbeaten {{in the last eight}} games of the 2013–14 season and finished in 19th place, four points above the relegation zone. The following season, Holloway was sacked on 10 March 2015 with the team second <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> in the Championship, and Neil Harris was reinstated as caretaker manager {{until the end of the}} season. He was unable to ensure survival, however, as Millwall's relegation to League One was confirmed on 28 April with one game of the 2014–15 season still to play. Harris was confirmed as Millwall's permanent manager the next day. In his first full season in charge, Harris led Millwall to a fourth-place finish in League One and a play-off final at Wembley, which the Lions lost 3–1 to Barnsley.|$|E
