5|$|A serious {{accident}} with radioactivity release {{occurred in the}} 3026-D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954. After {{the dissolution of the}} third batch of uranium slugs, the liquid in the dissolver tank did not completely cover the slugs for about 29 hours, which overheated due to decay heat. When the acid was added for the fourth batch, the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading chute and the pipes. The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels {{on the third floor of}} the building reached 100roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100mR/h by 7 am the next day.

5|$|Louis Alexander Slotin (1 December 1910– 30 May 1946) was a Canadian {{physicist}} and chemist {{who worked on}} the Manhattan Project. During World War II, Slotin conducted research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values. On 21 May 1946, Slotin was conducting a demonstration when he accidentally initiated a fission reaction, which released a burst of <b>hard</b> <b>radiation.</b> He received a lethal dose of radiation and died of acute radiation syndrome nine days later. Slotin was the second person to die from a criticality accident, following the death of Harry Daghlian, who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin. Slotin was publicly hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly and preventing his accident from killing any colleagues. He was later criticized for failing to follow protocol during the experiment.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} explorations {{about the real}} world {{possibility}} of Hulk's gamma-radiation based origin. In The Science of Superheroes, Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk’s powers, explaining the scientific flaws in them. Most notably, {{they point out that}} the level of gamma radiation Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him, or if not, create significant cancer risks for Banner, because <b>hard</b> <b>radiation</b> strips cells of their ability to function. They go on to offer up an alternate origin, in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with adrenal glands and GFP. Charles Q. Choi from LiveScience.com further explains that unlike the Hulk, gamma rays are not green; existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe. He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful (the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10,000 times more powerful than visible light) that they can even convert energy into matter– a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations. [...] "Just as the Incredible Hulk 'is the strongest one there is,' as he says himself, so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to an {{expected}} increase in radiation damage in LHC, we propose to transform CMS Hadronic EndCap calorimeters to <b>radiation</b> <b>hard</b> quartz plate calorimeters. Quartz is {{proved to be}} <b>radiation</b> <b>hard</b> by the <b>radiation</b> damage tests with electron, proton, neutron and gamma beams. However, the light produced in quartz comes from Cerenkov process, which yields drastically fewer photons than scintillation. To increase the light collection efficiency we pursue two separate methods: First method; is to use wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers, which {{have been shown to}} collect efficiently the Cerenkov light generated in quartz plates. A quartz plate calorimeter prototype with WLS fibers has been constructed and tested at CERN to show that this method is feasible. Second proposed solution is to treat the quartz plates with <b>radiation</b> <b>hard</b> wavelength shifters, p-terphenyl, or doped zinc oxide. Another calorimeter prototype has been constructed with p-terphenyl deposited quartz plates, and showed superior calorimeter capabilities. Here, the test beam, bench test and simulation efforts on these methods are reported. We also outline the future directions on these possible upgrade scenarios for the CMS HE calorimeter...|$|R

The major interaction of concern is differential charging of various parts of a spacecraft, leading to high electric fields and arcing between spacecraft components. This can be resolved with well placed plasma contactor. However, there is no solution yet for when plasma contactors are turned off to allow maintenance work on the hull. Long term space flight at interstellar velocities causes erosion of the rocket's hull due to collision with particles, gas, dust and micrometeorites.
