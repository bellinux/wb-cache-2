5000|$|Traditionally, the English Canadian tart {{consists}} of butter, sugar, and <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pastry <b>shell,</b> {{similar to the}} French-Canadian sugar pie, or {{the base of the}} U.S. pecan pie without the nut topping. The butter tart is different from pecan pie in that it has a [...] "runnier" [...] filling due to the omission of corn starch. Often raisins, walnuts or pecans are added to the traditional butter tart. However purists contend that such additions should not be allowed.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "dessert" [...] {{comes from}} the Old French desservir, [...] "to clear a table", {{literally}} [...] "to un-serve", and originated during the Middle Ages. It would typically consist of dragées and mulled wine accompanied by aged cheese, and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in sugar, honey or syrup and boiled-down fruit pastes. Sugar, from its first appearance in Europe, was viewed {{as much as a}} drug as a sweetener; its long-lived medieval reputation as an exotic luxury encouraged its appearance in elite contexts accompanying meats and other dishes that to modern taste are more naturally savoury. There was a wide variety of fritters, crêpes with sugar, sweet custards and darioles, almond milk and <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pastry <b>shell</b> that could also include fruit and sometimes even bone marrow or fish. German-speaking areas had a particular fondness for krapfen: fried pastries and dough with various sweet and savory fillings. Marzipan in many forms was well known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s and is assumed to be of Arab origin. Anglo-Norman cookbooks are full of recipes for sweet and savory custards, potages, sauces and tarts with strawberries, cherries, apples and plums. The English chefs also had a penchant for using flower petals such as roses, violets, and elder flowers. An early form of quiche can be found in Forme of Cury, a 14th-century recipe collection, as a Torte de Bry with a cheese and egg yolk filling.|$|R

40|$|Nicarbazin {{is being}} {{investigated}} as an infertility agent for the control of non-migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis L) populations. Nicarbazin is presently registered {{for use as a}} coccidiostat for poultry. Geese fed sufficient quantities of nicarbazin will lay non-viable eggs. We established nicarbazin consumption by measuring the concentration of a component of the formulation, 4, 4 ’-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) <b>in</b> the <b>egg</b> contents (yolk, albumin) <b>in</b> non-viable <b>eggs.</b> To estimate the nicarbazin consumption of birds that laid viable eggs (eggs that hatched or contained an embryo), a high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed to measure the concentration of DNC <b>in</b> <b>egg</b> <b>shells.</b> <b>A</b> statistically significant correlation was established using linear regression between the mean concentrations of DNC <b>in</b> the <b>egg</b> shell and <b>in</b> the <b>egg</b> contents <b>in</b> non-viable <b>eggs.</b> Viable eggs were estimated to contain lower levels of DNC than non-viable <b>eggs.</b> DNC concentrations <b>in</b> both the <b>egg</b> contents and the egg shell increased with increases in nicarbazin dose in feed. Our method allows for the estimation of nicarbazin consumption and DNC dose <b>in</b> <b>eggs</b> under field conditions, which is important <b>in</b> developing <b>an</b> effective infertility agent for over-abundant non-migratory goose populations...|$|R
