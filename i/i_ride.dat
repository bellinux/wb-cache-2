2500|$|Landis {{rode the}} 2006 Tour with the {{constant}} pain from the injury, which he described: [...] "It's bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone. Sometimes it's a sharp pain. When I pedal and walk, it comes and goes, but mostly it's an ache, like an arthritis pain. It aches down my leg into my knee. The morning {{is the best}} time, it doesn't hurt too much. But when I walk it hurts, when <b>I</b> <b>ride</b> it hurts. Most {{of the time it}} doesn't keep me awake, but there are nights that it does." [...] During the Tour, Landis was medically approved to take cortisone for this injury, a medication otherwise prohibited in professional cycling for its known potential for abuse. Landis himself called his win [...] "a triumph of persistence" [...] despite the pain.|$|E

Corbyn has described himself as frugal, telling Simon Hattenstone of The Guardian, [...] "I don't spend a lot of money, I lead a very normal life, <b>I</b> <b>ride</b> a bicycle and I don't have a car".

60|$|I {{know that}} <b>I</b> <b>rode</b> away hurriedly without even {{stopping}} to inquire into whose hands the farm had passed.

6000|$|All day {{and many}} days <b>I</b> <b>rode,</b> [...] My horse's head set toward the sea; [...] And as <b>I</b> <b>rode</b> a longing {{came to me}} [...] That I might keep the sunset road, [...] Riding my horse right on and on, [...] O'ertake the day still lagging at the west, [...] And so reach boyhood from the dawn, [...] And be with all the days at rest.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>rode</b> past an orchard, an apple, {{loosened}} by the rainstorm, {{came down}} with a thud.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can <b>I</b> <b>ride</b> {{over to see}} {{how they}} are at home? They will have heard of the battle. Mother and {{grandmother}} must be terribly anxious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>ride</b> with you, granted your goodwill, for I must {{needs to}} Tours, and I have overmuch {{treasure}} in my wallet to ride alone." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{the head}} of the column <b>I</b> <b>rode</b> beside the great Thark while at the heels of my mount trotted my beloved Woola.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I do. I never refuse a good offer. Why shouldn't <b>I</b> <b>ride</b> the man's horse? Did {{you never}} hear before {{of a young}} lady {{borrowing}} a gentleman's horse?" ...|$|E
