Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy {{is dominated by the}} service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce. However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector, in which the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components.|$|E

Batman tracks Scarecrow to a hideout where he rescues the imprisoned Poison Ivy, who {{had refused to}} join Batman's other rogues in Scarecrow's plot. Batman meets with Oracle, who identifies Ace Chemicals {{as the source of}} Scarecrow's toxin. Batman investigates the facility but encounters the Arkham Knight and his heavily armed militia. Batman overcomes the forces and locates Scarecrow, who <b>has</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>the</b> entire building into a toxin bomb. Scarecrow reveals that he has kidnapped Oracle, and exposes Batman to the toxin before escaping. Batman inhibits the bomb's blast radius before he is confronted by the Joker.|$|E

However, these examples are only a small representation of new media. The use of digital computers <b>has</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>the</b> remaining 'old' media, as suggested by the advent of digital television and online publications.

Corporate marketing machines promote early detection of breast cancer, while also opposing public health efforts, such as stricter environmental legislation, that might decrease the incidence rate of breast cancer. These critics believe {{that some of the}} breast cancer organizations, particularly the highly visible Susan G. Komen for the Cure, have become captive companies that support and provide social capital to the breast cancer industry, including pharmaceutical companies, mammography equipment manufacturers, and pollution-causing industries, as well as large corporations, creating or exacerbating other problems.|$|E
25|$|The Rajasthan Canal {{system is}} the major {{irrigation}} scheme of the Thar Desert and is conceived to reclaim it and also to check spreading of the desert to fertile areas. It is world's largest irrigation which is being extended {{in an attempt to}} make the desert arable. It runs south-southwest in Punjab and Haryana but mainly in Rajasthan for a total of 650 kilometers and ends near Jaisalmer, in Rajasthan. After the construction of the Indira Gandhi Canal, irrigation facilities were available over an area of 6770km² in Jaisalmer district and 37km² in Barmer district. Irrigation had already been provided in an area of 3670km² in Jaisalmer district. The canal <b>has</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>the</b> barren deserts of this district into rich and lush fields.

Dendrochronology for panel paintings and radio-carbon dating for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and {{available on the internet}} or by other means, <b>has</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>the</b> study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as illuminated manuscripts and Persian miniatures, and many types of archaeological artworks.|$|E
25|$|A tape ball is {{a tennis}} ball wrapped in {{electrical}} tape and is used in playing street cricket. This modification of the tennis ball gives it greater weight, speed and distance while still being easier to play with than the conventional cricket ball. The variation was pioneered in Karachi, Pakistan and is credited with Pakistan's famous production of fast bowlers as children are brought up playing the game using a tape ball in which various skills are developed. The increasing popularity of the tape ball in informal, local cricket <b>has</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>the</b> way games are played in cricket-loving nations such as India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh but most famously Pakistan. Such has been the impact of tape ball {{that in recent years}} some companies have introduced tennis balls designed to act like cricket balls. These balls are quite popular in South Asia where tape ball cricket {{is one of the most}} popular forms of the sport.|$|E
25|$|Arlington {{during the}} 1960s was {{undergoing}} tremendous change after the huge {{influx of newcomers}} in the 1950s. The old commercial districts did not have ample off-street parking and many shoppers were taking their business to new commercial centers, such as Parkington and Seven Corners. Suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding, and Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar {{to what happened in}} other downtown centers. With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington. However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the Washington Metro, which included two lines in Arlington. Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County. Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon. A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority. Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods. With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit. Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City and Pentagon City. Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as Little Saigon, and now is a vibrant urban village. Arlington's careful planning for the Metro <b>has</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>the</b> county and has become a model revitalization for older suburbs.|$|E

500|$|Perry {{observes that}} [...] "the {{passage of time}} <b>has</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>the</b> Jarrow Crusade... into a potent talisman with which many {{apparently}} seek association". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as [...] "a badge of credibility". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view {{in an era of}} high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group from Jarrow and other towns along the way retraced the route to London. At that time of industrial recession, Jarrow once again had the highest level of unemployment in the country. The 75th anniversary in 2011 was marked by a [...] "March for Jobs", that drew the ire of a Conservative MP, Robert Goodwill, who noted the high level of withdrawals in its early stages and dismissed it as [...] "an insult to the memory of the Jarrow marchers... They are not fit to walk in [...] footsteps".|$|E
