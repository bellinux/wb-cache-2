The susceptibility can be expressed well in terms of the ratio of the elongation to fracture in a corrosive environment to that in dry nitrogen gas.

40|$|In {{addition}} {{to a change in}} silicon morphology, modification of aluminium-silicon alloys with strontium or sodium increases the size of the eutectic grains. To determine the mechanism responsible, eutectic solidification in commercial purity and ultra-high purity aluminium-si I icon alloys, with and without strontium additions, was examined by a quenching technique. In the commercial unmodified alloy, nucleation was prolific while in the high-purity unmodified alloy few eutectic grains nucleated. The addition of strontium to the commercial alloy reduced the number of eutectic grains that nucleated. Addition of strontium to the <b>high-purity</b> <b>alloy</b> did not significantly alter nucleation. It is concluded that commercial purity alloys contain a large number of potent nuclei that are susceptible to poisoning by impurity modification. The flake-to-fibre transition that occurs with impurity modification is shown to be independent of any change in eutectic nucleation mode and frequency. (C) 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|The tensile and {{compressive}} {{properties of}} six NiAl-base single-crystal alloys {{have been investigated}} at temperatures between 77 and 1200 K. The normalized critical resolved shear stresses (CRSS/E) and work-hardening rates (Theta/E) for these alloys generally decreased with increasing temperature. However, anomalous peaks or plateaus for these properties were observed in conventional purity (CPNiAl), Si-doped (NiAl-Si), C-doped low Si (UF-NiAl 1), and Mo-doped (NiAl-Mo) alloys at intermediate temperatures (600 to 1000 K). This anomalous behavior was not observed in high-purity, low interstitial material (HP-NiAl). Low or negative strain-rate sensitivities (SRS) also were observed in all six alloys in this intermediate temperature range. Coincident with the occurrence of negative strain-rate sensitivities was the observation of serrated stress-strain curves in the CPNiAl and NiAl-Si alloys. These phenomena {{have been attributed to}} dynamic strain aging (DSA). Chemical analysis of the alloys used in this study suggests that the main specie responsible for strain aging in NiAl is C but indicate that residual Si impurities can enhance the strain aging effects. The corresponding dislocation microstructures at low temperatures (300 to 600 K) were composed of well-defined cells. At intermediate temperatures (600 to 900 K), either poorly defined cells or coarse bands of localized slip, reminiscent of the vein structures observed in low-cycle fatigue specimens deformed in the DSA regime, were observed in conventional purity, Si-doped, and in Mo-doped alloys. In contrast, a well-defined cell structure persisted in the low interstitial, <b>high-purity</b> <b>alloy.</b> At elevated temperatures (greater than or equal to 1000 K), more uniformly distributed dislocations and sub-boundaries were observed in all alloys.

40|$|Recent {{numerous}} studies demonstrated {{the advantages of}} producing bulk metals with submicrometer grain sizes which provide the opportunity to demonstrate improved mechanical characteristics including superplastic properties. Besides the effort, although the impurity may cause low ductility due to grain boundary segregation, there are limited studies {{to date on the}} influence of general impurities upon flow behavior of conventional superplastic materials. Accordingly, the present report demonstrates the significance of Si impurity on superplastic properties in an ultrafine-grained high-purity Zn- 22 %Al eutectoid alloy at room temperature. The alloy was prepared to include different levels of Si contents up to 1500 ppm in the <b>high-purity</b> <b>alloy</b> and the consistent fine grain sizes of similar to 0. 60 mu m were introduced through a series of solutionizing followed by cold rolling. Tensile testing showed an occurrence of excellent room-temperature superplasticity and the maximum elongation of 500 % was recorded at an optimal superplastic strain rate of 1. 0 x 10 (- 3) s(- 1) in the alloy with less Si. Increasing Si contents reduced ductility without changing the strain rate sensitivity, thereby implying the consistency in the deformation mechanism for superplastic flow but the difference in the fracture mode. The present analysis estimates a threshold stress and demonstrate the validity of applying the conventional superplastic relationship for depicting the room-temperature superplastic flow in the high-purity Zn- 22 %Al alloy. Moreover, the separate fracture modes are proposed for the alloy with increasing Si impurity contents by taking fractographs after superplastic elongations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{emphasis}} of the work lies on finding out how impurities {{and the addition of}} Sr influence the formation of Fe-rich intermetallic phases and the formation of the eutectic Si phase in Al-Si casting alloys. A further objective of this study was the understanding of the influence of the cooling rate on the formation of intermetallic phases. For this purpose, four Al- 10 Si- 0. 3 Fe-based casting alloys (<b>high-purity</b> <b>alloy</b> with and without addition of 200 ppm Sr and corresponding commercial alloys) have been chosen for this study. The experimental work was focused on the three-dimensional analysis of Fe-rich intermetallic phases using tomographic methods on the micrometer scale such as serial slicing with a Focused Ion Beam and Scanning Electron Microscopy imaging as well as synchrotron X-ray tomography. The three-dimensional analyses were supported by two-dimensional studies using a combination of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Besides the well-known phases, i. e. the α intermetallic phase, the tetragonal δ phase and the β phase, a new γ phase was found. The composition of the γ phase is Al 4. 35 FeSi, which is close to that of the β phase (Al 4. 5 FeSi), but the morphology of the γ phase looks like the one of the α intermetallic phase. It features a trigonal R-centered crystal structure with hexagonal lattice parameters a = 1. 034 (5) nm, c= 1. 983 (8) nm and V= 1. 836 (25) nm 3. The α intermetallic phase is dominant in the <b>high-purity</b> <b>alloy,</b> while in the modified alloy Sr promotes the formation of the δ phase. Additionally, Sr was found to suppress the formation of the β phase in the commercial alloy. Impurities play an effective role in the nucleation of the eutectic grains, which lead to an advantage for the formation of the coarse β phase. Cooling conditions influence the formation of intermetallics. Their formation is suppressed and refined during fast solidification. In contrast, a slow cooling rate promotes the formation of the coarse β phase. Focused Ion Beam tomography and synchrotron X-ray tomography have been used to characterize the three-dimensional morphologies, the locations and the volume fractions of the intermetallic phases formed in each investigated alloy. In-situ synchrotron X-ray tomography allowed for the observation of phase separation from the melt during solidification in real time. The nucleation of β and δ phases was observed and the phase solidification sequence has been clarified. β plates nucleate on or near the dendrite whereas the δ phase was observed to nucleate on the eutectic Si. Der Schwerpunkt der Arbeit liegt darin, herauszufinden, wie Verunreinigungen und der Zusatz von Sr die Bildung von Fe-reichen intermetallischen Phasen und die Bildung der eutektischen Si-Phase in Al-Si-Gusslegierungen beeinflussen. Ein weiteres Ziel dieser Studie war das Verständnis des Einflusses der Abkühlgeschwindigkeit auf die Bildung intermetallischer Phasen. Für diese Studie wurden vier Al- 10 Si- 0. 3 Fe-basierte Legierungen (hochreine Legierung mit und ohne Zugabe von 200 ppm Sr und entsprechende kommerzielle Legierungen) ausgewählt. Die experimentelle Arbeit konzentrierte sich auf die dreidimensionale Analyse von Fe-reichen intermetallischen Phasen mit tomographischen Methoden auf der Mikrometerskala, wie z. B. serielles Slicing mit Focused Ion Beam und Rasterelektronenmikroskopie sowie Synchrotron-Röntgentomographie. Die dreidimensionalen Analysen wurden durch zweidimensionale Untersuchungen unter Verwendung einer Kombination aus optischer Mikroskopie, Rasterelektronenmikroskopie und Transmissionselektronenmikroskopie unterstützt. Neben den bekannten Phasen, d. H. Der α-intermetallischen Phase, der tetragonalen δ-Phase und der β-Phase, wurde eine neue γ-Phase gefunden. Die Zusammensetzung der & gamma; -Phase ist Al & sub 4; ​​ 35 FeSi, die nahe derjenigen der & beta; -Phase (Al & sub 4; 5 FeSi) ist, aber die Morphologie der & gamma; -Phase sieht wie die der intermetallischen Phase aus. Es besitzt eine trigonale R-zentrierte Kristallstruktur mit hexagonalen Gitterparametern a = 1, 034 (5) nm, c = 1, 983 (8) nm und V = 1, 836 (25) nm 3. Die α-intermetallische Phase ist in der hochreinen Legierung dominant, während in der modifizierten Legierung Sr die Bildung der δ-Phase fördert. Zusätzlich wurde gefunden, daß Sr die Bildung der & beta; -Phase in der kommerziellen Legierung unterdrückte. Verunreinigungen spielen eine wirksame Rolle bei der Keimbildung der eutektischen Körner, die zu einem Vorteil für die Bildung der groben β-Phase führen. Kühlbedingungen beeinflussen die Bildung von intermetallischen Verbindungen. Ihre Bildung wird unterdrückt und verfeinert während der schnellen Verfestigung. Im Gegensatz dazu fördert eine langsame Abkühlgeschwindigkeit die Bildung der groben & bgr; -Phase.

A Sn-Zn (99. 99 %) <b>high-purity</b> eutectic <b>alloy</b> was melted in a graphite crucible under vacuum atmosphere. This eutectic alloy was directionally solidified upward with a constant growth rate V (8. 30 µm/s) and different temperature gradients G (1. 86 - 6. 52 K/mm), and also with a constant temperature gradient (6. 52 K/mm) and different growth rates (8. 30 - 165. 13 µm/s) in a Bridgman-type directional so-lidification furnace. The lamellar spacings were measured from both transverse and longitudinal sections of the specimen. The values from the transverse section were used for calculations and comparisons with the previous works. The undercooling values T were obtained using growth rate and system parameters K 1 and K 2. It was found that the values of decreased while V and G increased. The relationships between lamellar spacing and solidification parameters V and G were obtained by linear regression analysis method. The 2 V, T, TV− 0. 5, and 3 G values were determined using, T, V, and G values. The experimentally obtained values for the broken-lamellar growth (Sn-Zn eutectic system) were in good agreement with the theoretical and other experimental values...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium-air {{cells are}} high-energy density (< 400 W h kg- 1), primary {{batteries}} first {{developed in the}} 1960 s. The review shows how {{the performance of the}} battery is influenced by the choice of materials, including the type of aluminium alloy, oxygen reduction catalyst and electrolyte type. Two continuing issues with these batteries are (a) the parasitic corrosion of the aluminium, at open-circuit and under discharge, due to the reduction of water on the anode surface and (b) the passive hydroxide layer that forms on the aluminium surface in alkaline solutions, which inhibits dissolution and shifts its potential to more positive values. One method to overcome these two issues is the use of super-pure (99. 999 wt%) aluminium alloyed with trace amounts of ‘activating’ elements such as Mg, Sn, In and Ga, to either inhibit corrosion or break down the passive hydroxide layer. Since the manufacture of <b>high-purity</b> aluminium <b>alloys</b> is expensive an alternative approach is to add solution phase inhibitors or additives directly to the electrolyte. The effectiveness of alloying elements, in binary and ternary alloys, and the effectiveness of different electrolyte additives are evaluated. Novel methods to overcome the self-corrosion problem include using anionic membranes and gel electrolytes or identifying alternative solvents, such as alcohols or ionic liquids, to replace aqueous solutions. The air cathode side of the battery is also considered. Future opportunities and directions for the development of aluminium-air cells are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Steels {{are among}} the most widely used {{construction}} materials as their mechanical properties can be tuned over a very wide range of desired combinations of strength formability and other properties. However, when exposed for long times to high temperatures steel components can exhibit premature and low-ductility creep fracture, which arises from the formation, growth and coalescence of (initially) nanoscale pores. Self-healing of such defects is regarded as a promising new approach to enhance the component lifetime. In principle, it could be achieved by nanoscale precipitation on the creep cavity surface preventing further growth. Earlier work has shown that Cu may be a suitable alloying element to induce such a healing behaviour in stainless steels. In the present work the high temperature precipitation behaviour of Cu on deformation inducted defects is studied for a number of <b>high-purity</b> Fe-Cu-B-N-C <b>alloys</b> using positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) and hardness tests. Samples with 0 % and 8 % cold pre-strain are utilized to study the influence of prior tensile deformation on the precipitation kinetics of copper. The time evolution of the S-W points derived from Coincidence Doppler Broadening spectra indicates that deformation-induced defects enhance the Cu precipitation kinetics. A clear reduction in open volume defects is accompanied by a strong increase of Cu signature during the initial stage of aging, demonstrating the self-healing potential in the Fe-Cu-B-N-C alloy. A comparison between the hardness behaviour of Fe-Cu, Fe-Cu-B-N, and Fe- Cu-B-N-C indicates the added carbon counteracts the acceleration of Cu precipitation caused by the addition of B and N...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, soft materials, such as Al- 4 Mg <b>alloy,</b> <b>high-purity</b> Al and pure Mg pins were slid against hard steel plates of various surface textures {{to study the}} {{response}} of materials during sliding. The experiments were conducted using an inclined pin-on-plate sliding apparatus under both dry and lubricated conditions in an ambient environment. Two kinds of frictional response, namely steady-state and stick-slip, were observed during sliding. In general, the response was dependent on material pair, normal load, lubrication, and surface texture of the harder material. More specifically, for the case of Al- 4 Mg alloy, the stick-slip response was absent under both dry and lubricated conditions. For Al, stick-slip was observed only under lubricated conditions. For the case of Mg, the stick-slip response was seen under both dry and lubricated conditions. Further, {{it was observed that}} the amplitude of stick-slip motion primarily depends on the plowing component of friction. The plowing component of friction was the highest for the surfaces that promoted plane strain conditions and was the lowest for the surfaces that promoted plane stress conditions near the surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{processing}} of metals {{through the application}} of high-pressure torsion (HPT) provides the potential for achieving exceptional grain refinement in bulk disks. Numerous reports are now available describing the application of HPT to a range of pure metals and simple alloys. Excellent grain refinement was achieved using this processing technique with the average grain size often reduced to the nanoscale range. By contrast, the development of microstructure and local hardness is different depending upon the material properties. In order to make HPT processing more practical, it is indispensable to investigate the nature of the sample characteristics immediately after conventional HPT processing. Accordingly, this report demonstrates the different models of hardness evolution using representative materials of AZ 31 magnesium <b>alloy,</b> <b>high-purity</b> aluminum, and Zn– 22 % Al eutectoid alloy processed by HPT. Separate models are described for the evolution of hardness with equivalent strain, and the correlation between these models is suggested by the homologous temperature of HPT processing. A special emphasis is placed on examining the numerical expression of the level of strain hardening or softening of these metals with increasing equivalent strai...|$|R
40|$|Reduced {{activation}} high-chromium ferritic/martensitic steels are candidate {{materials for}} Generation IV fission and fusion reactors. To gain {{knowledge about the}} radiation resistance of these steels in such environments, {{the first step is}} to study the Fe-Cr matrix of this material. For that purpose and to understand ballistic damage by neutrons, self-ion irradiations, with and without simultaneous He injection, were performed on a series of <b>high-purity</b> Fe-Cr binary <b>alloys</b> at 773 K. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed "displacement fringe contrast" inside the dislocation loops. This was attributed to the presence of Cr-enriched zones on their habit plane, which is a defect-free region for body-centered cubic Fe-based alloys. A plausible mechanism is discussed to explain the phenomenon, the first step of which would be the radiation-induced segregation of Cr atoms on the dislocation loop core. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in scanning TEM mode and atom probe tomography (APT) gave a coherent quantitative estimate of the Cr concentration in these enriched areas. APT study showed that the enrichment was heterogeneous on the loop plane. Upon in situ annealing up to 900 K, the loops and the fringes disappeared completely, without leaving a secondary-phase particle, such as carbide, at their position. Fringes were present until the loop disappeared...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium (Al) -air cell holds a high {{volumetric}} capacity density of 8. 05 Ah cm- 3, {{benefit from the}} trivalence of Al ions. Additional benefits of Al-air cell are low price and environmental friendliness. Furthermore, the Al energy conversion process is characterized of 100 % recyclability in theory. Along with a large base of raw material reserve, Al attracts considerable attentions as a promising material to be integrated within the global energy system. However, despite the early successful applications in military services, several problems exist that prevent the Al-air cells from widely civilian use. The most serious issue is the parasitic corrosion of Al when contacts with electrolyte. To overcome this problem, super-pure Al alloyed with various traces of metal elements are used to increase the corrosion resistance. Nevertheless, <b>high-purity</b> Al <b>alloys</b> are costly and require high energy consumption during production process. An alternative approach is to add inexpensive inhibitors directly into the electrolyte. However, such additives would increase the internal ohmic resistance and hamper the cell performance. So far these methods have not provided satisfactory solutions for the problem within Al-air cells. For the operation of alkaline Al-air cell, there are still other minor problems. One {{of them is the}} formation of aluminium hydroxide in the electrolyte. This process decreases ionic conductivity of electrolyte. Another one is the carbonation process within the gas diffusion layer of cathode, blocking the porosity of gas diffusion. Both these would hinder the performance of cells. The present work optimizes the above problems by building an Al-air cell operation system, consisting of four components. A top electrolyte tank containing fresh electrolyte is located at a high level, so that it can drive the electrolyte flow by gravity force. A mechanical rechargeable Al-air cell is fabricated with low-cost materials including low grade Al, carbon paper, and PMMA plates. An electrolyte waste tank with elaborate channel is designed to separate the hydrogen generated from the corrosion, which would be collected by gas collection device. In the first section of the research work, we investigated the performance of the mechanical rechargeable Al-air cell with a constant flow rate of electrolyte, to ensure the repeatability experiments. Then the whole system was assembled together and the feasibility of operating was demonstrated. During experiment, pure hydrogen is collected by collection device, which holds potential for various applications. By collecting this by-product, high utilization efficiency of aluminum is achieved. Considering both electricity and hydrogen generated, an overall utilization efficiency of around 90 % or even higher under different working voltages are achieved. Fluidic electrolyte could remove aluminum hydroxide precipitate and solve the electrolyte deterioration problem. This operation system provides a low-cost strategy for harvesting energy from the abundant secondary Al. The system could also be applied into other metal-air cells and is suitable for emergency power supply, power plant and other applications. The low cost feature implies great potential for commercialization. Further optimization, such as scaling up and optimization of fabrication, will help to refine the technology into practical market offerings...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{confusion}} evident in the literature {{in terms of the}} influence of impurity elements on grain refinement of magnesium alloys. This thesis addresses how impurity elements such as iron, manganese, carbon and beryllium affect grain refinement in magnesium alloys. The thesis starts with an investigation into the effect of the uptake of iron on grain refinement of Mg-Zr alloys. The highly detrimental influence of the uptake of iron on grain refinement in Mg-Zr alloys has been confirmed. The gradual loss of grain refinement of Mg-Zr alloys partly arises from the consumption of Zr by the formation of Fe 2 Zr via the reaction between soluble Zr and Fe picked up from mild steel crucibles. (Settling of undissolved Zr particles also partly attributes to the gradual loss of grain refinement.) The morphological evolution of Zr-rich cores from circular to rosette-like has been reported here for the first time. In contrast to the detrimental effect in Mg-Zr alloys, a positive effect of iron has been observed in grain refinement of Mg-Al based alloys. The addition of iron {{in the form of an}}hydrous FeCl 3 produces significant grain refinement of <b>high-purity</b> Mg-Al <b>alloys.</b> Obvious grain refinement was also achieved through the uptake of iron from steel crucible surfaces; however, the addition of Fe powder in the form of an ALTABTM Fe 75 powder compact (75 %Fe, 15 %Al and 10 % Na-free flux) did not give rise to grain refinement. The results obtained from both the grain refinement tests conducted in aluminium titanite crucibles and an ultra-low carbon 316 L stainless crucible indicate that the grain refinement of Mg-Al alloys by iron inoculation has little to do with the Al 4 C 3 hypothesis. The nucleant particles have been clarified to be Fe- and Al-rich intermetallics. The effect of manganese on the grain refinement of high purity Mg-Al based alloys and commercially available AZ 31 alloys has been investigated using an Al- 60 %Mn master alloy splatter at 730 aC in aluminium titanite crucibles. Grain refinement was readily achievable in these alloys. Electron microprobe analyses revealed that prior to the addition of extra manganese the majority of the intermetallic particles found in AZ 31 are of the Al 8 Mn 5 type. However, after the addition of extra manganese in the range of 0. 1 % to 1. 0 %, the predominant group of intermetallic particles changed to the metastable AlMn type. This leads to a hypothesis that the metastable AlMn intermetallic particles are more effective than Al 8 Mn 5 as nucleation sites for magnesium grains. The hypothesis was supported by the observation that a long period of holding at 730 aC led to an increase in grain size, due probably to the transformation of the metastable AlMn to the stable Al 8 Mn 5. Native grain refinement in magnesium alloys has been clarified. Based on the fact that native grain refinement is an exclusive feature of high purity Mg-Al alloys, it is hypothesized that Al 4 C 3 particles act as nucleation centres. This is also the mechanism of carbon grain refinement of Mg-Al alloys. A trace of beryllium leads to dramatic grain coarsening in Mg-Al alloys at normal cooling rates. Apart from Mg-Al alloys, a trace of beryllium also causes considerable grain coarsening in Mg-Zn, Mg-Ca, Mg-Ce, Mg-Nd and also hinders grain refinement of magnesium alloys by Zr. Modelling grain refinement to predict the final grain size has been made on the basis of understanding of existing models. The modified model has resolved a fundamental gap in the relative grain size model using a more universal expression of solute concentration in the liquid...|$|R
