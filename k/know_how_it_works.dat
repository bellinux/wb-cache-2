5000|$|It was {{revealed}} that Ex Nihilo {{was the one who}} rescued Squid from falling through half-formed worlds and ephemeral realities in order to bring Abyss to them. Ex Nihilo tries to merge with Abyss which doesn't work. Baroness Resin and Manteau {{try to find a way}} to attack Abyss where Manteau ends up throwing a chair at Abyss making him disappear. Squid then knocks out Manteau as Baroness Resin regresses back to Nelson Jent. As Squid drags Manteau away, Ex Nihilo reveals her true identity as Dr. Wald to Nelson as she stated that she has been understanding the nature of magic for thirty years trying to find a way to bring Abyss to her. Squid then shoots ink onto Nelson's face as Dr. Wald is shown to have an H-Dial. After Dr. Wald and Squid escape, Nelson has survived Squid's ink attack and must find a way to rescue Manteau from Ex Nihilo. Manteau then wakes up strapped to a gurney in Ex Nihilo's laboratory where Ex Nihilo demands to know from Manteau on what she knows about Abyss despite Squid stating that she might not know about Abyss. Ex Nihilo then turns her attention towards Manteau's H-Dial wanting to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>works.</b> Nelson watches Abyss' destructiveness on the TV, recalling an old quotation: [...] "Gaze long into an abyss, and the abyss also gazes into you." [...] Suddenly, a new hero appears, obviously a creation of the H-Dial. From behind him, Nelson is startled to hear the Squid's voice. Squid points out that there is a portion of that quote that is too often left out: one who fights with monsters should see that he doesn't become a monster himself. The hero that is on the scene now is one such monster he claims. He admits that his ink was not poisonous back at the hotel. He let Nelson live because he regrets killing Darren. He got the address from Manteau's torture session. He came looking for help. He has been wounded by Abyss and Ex Nihilo has refused to help him. All he ever wanted was to go home and maybe, Nelson is the kind of man who would help him do that. Squid tells Nelson that his race were herders and wranglers of nothingness in a region called Unplace until he stumbled upon Abyss. Squid tells Nelson that Ex Nihilo must be stopped before she angers Abyss even further. Nelson tells Squid that they first must rescue Manteau from Vernon Boyne's men. Squid helps to free Manteau as he is shot in the back by Vernon. Nelson uses a hammer to knock out Vernon as he helps Manteau and Squid (who is leaning on them for support) to escape. Meanwhile, Ex Nihilo confronts Abyss where she desperately shouts and tries to convince it to join her. Abyss shows Ex Nihilo that Squid is with Manteau and Nelson (who is in the form of one of his heroes) as Ex Nihilo leaps into Abyss to pursue them.|$|E
40|$|Background. Over {{the last}} few years there have been {{concerns}} regarding the health effects of electromagnetic waves (EMW) produced by mobile phone base transmitter stations (BTS). Data on possible health effects of EMW in developing countries are rare. This study was conducted to determine the awareness and self-reported health hazards of EMW from the mobile phone BTS in Dhaka city. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 220 respondents living around BTS in Dhaka city. Data was collected on sociodemographic characteristics, mobile phone use, BTS and EMW awareness, and self-reported health problems. Results. The majority of respondents (92. 7 %) reported to have seen a BTS but only 29. 5 % <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> and 74. 5 % had no knowledge about the EMW. 49 % respondents experienced sleeping disturbances while recent episodes of headache or dizziness were reported by 47 % and mood change or anxiety or depression by 41 %. About 22 % complained about other physical or mental symptoms. Conclusion. Awareness about the possible health hazards from EMW of BTS is low among the inhabitants of Dhaka city. A number of respondents mentioned recent health effects but the association with BTS could not be established...|$|R

40|$|Stories form an {{integral}} part of models. An economic model can not be fully characterized simply by knowing its structure: the model can only be completely described when we <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> and what it can do. This activity of manipulating a model requires a narrative device, such as a question, which sets off a story told with the model. The structure or system portrayed in the model constrains and shapes the stories that can be told, but without stories showing how the structure works, we cannot tell what might happen in specific cases. Without these narrative elements, we cannot apply model-structures directly onto the facts of the economic world, nor demonstrate outcomes about the hypothetical world represented in the model.
