40|$|Abstract Background <b>Activated</b> <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (human <b>activated</b> protein C, rhAPC), is {{produced}} by recombinant DNA technology, and purports to improve clinical outcomes by counteracting the inflammatory and thrombotic consequences of severe sepsis. Controversy exists around the clinical benefits of this drug and an updated economic study that considers this variability is needed. Methods A systematic literature review was performed using Medline, Embase and the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) databases to determine efficacy, safety and previous economic studies. Our economic model was populated with systematic estimates of these parameters and with population life tables for longer term survival information. Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and variance for the decision analytic models. Results Two randomized clinical trials (RCTS) of <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> in adults with severe sepsis and 8 previous economic studies were identified. Although associated with statistical heterogeneity, a pooled analysis of the RCTs did not show a statistically significant 28 -day mortality benefit for <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> compared to placebo either for all patients (RR: 0. 93, 95 % CI: 0. 69, 1. 26) or those at highest risk as measured by APACHE II ≥ 25 (RR: 0. 90, 95 % CI: 0. 54, 1. 49).

40|$|<b>Drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (Xigris, {{recombinant}} <b>activated</b> protein C) is an anticoagulant {{developed and}} launched by Eli Lilly & Co {{for the treatment}} of sepsis [333781], [339372], [430133], [436271]. The FDA and the EMEA accepted the brand name Xigris for <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> in June 2001. This trade name had been proposed by Lilly in place of the previous brand name, Zovant, which was deemed unacceptable by the EMEA due to concerns that the name could be confused with hospital-based drugs [412512]. Filings for sepsis were made in the US, EU and Australia in February 2001 [398514], [447870] and in March 2001, the US FDA assigned <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> Priority Review status [403435]. The FDA extended the action date from July 27 to October 27, 2001 for completion of its review of the biologics license application (BLA) for <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> to assess further supplementary data submitted by Lilly [412512]. At the October 16, 2001 meeting (postponed from September 12), the FDA Advisory Committee on Anti-Infective Drugs split 10 to 10 over whether to recommend approval [425873], [425940]. In late October 2001, Lilly received an approvable letter from the FDA {{for the treatment of}} severe sepsis.

40|$|Care of {{patients}} with sepsis has improved over the last decade. However, in the recent two years, {{there was no significant}} progress {{in the development of a}} new drug for critically ill patients. In January 2011, it was announced that the worldwide phase 3 randomized trial of a novel anti-Toll-like receptor- 4 compound, eritoran tetrasodium, had failed to demonstrate an improvement in the mortality {{of patients}} with severe sepsis. In October 2011, Xigris (<b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa,</b> a recombinant <b>activated</b> protein C) was withdrawn from the market following the failure of its worldwide trial that had attempted to demonstrate improved outcome. These announcements were disappointing. The recent failure of 2 promising drugs to further reduce mortality suggests that new approaches are needed. A study was published showing that sepsis can be associated to a state of immunosuppression and loss of immune function in human. However, the timing, incidence, and nature of the immunosuppression remain poorly characterized, especially in humans. This emphasizes the need for a better understanding of sepsis as well as new therapeutic strategies. Many clinical experiences of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) treatment for adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, which is caused by the H 1 N 1 influenza A virus, were reported.

40|$|Background: <b>Drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated),</b> or {{recombinant}} human activated protein C, has antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, and profibrinolytic properties. In a previous study, <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> produced dose-dependent {{reductions in the}} levels of markers of coagulation and inflammation in patients with severe sepsis. In this phase 3 trial, we assessed whether treatment with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> reduced the rate of death from any cause among patients with severe sepsis. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients with systemic inflammation and organ failure due to acute infection were enrolled and assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either placebo or <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> (24 microg per kilogram of body weight per hour) for a total duration of 96 hours. The prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days {{after the start of}} the infusion. Patients were monitored for adverse events; changes in vital signs, laboratory variables, and the results of microbiologic cultures; and the development of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C. Results: A total of 1690 randomized patients were treated (840 in the placebo group and 850 in the <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> group). The mortality rate was 30. 8 percent in the placebo group and 24. 7 percent in the <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> group. On the basis of the prospectively defined primary analysis, treatment with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of death of 19. 4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6. 6 to 30. 5) and an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 6. 1 percent (P = 0. 005). The incidence of serious bleeding was higher in the <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> group than in the placebo group (3. 5 percent vs. 2. 0 percent, P = 0. 06). Conclusions: Treatment with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis and may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

40|$|<b>Drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> {{is a new}} {{agent that}} may {{substantially}} affect the treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Despite its therapeutic promise, treatment with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> represents a new challenge for many clinicians and health care centers.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effects of <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> therapy, a {{recombinant}} human activated protein C, across clinically relevant subpopulations in a randomized, phase 3, placebo-controlled study of patients with severe sepsis (recombinant human activated protein C worldwide evaluation in severe sepsis [PROWESS]). Design: Univariate and multivariable analysis of prospectively defined subgroups from the PROWESS study. Setting. A total of 164 medical centers in 11 countries. Patients. A total of 1, 690 patients with severe sepsis. Measurements and Main Results., We report observed 28 -day mortality rates for <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> and placebo patients for subgroups prospectively defined by demographic data, surgical status, type and site of infection, and clinical and biochemical measures of disease severity. We performed subgroup analyses to explore {{the consistency of the}} mortality benefit observed in the overall population and performed tests for both quantitative and qualitative interactions. To examine the magnitude of the treatment benefit with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> across the underlying predicted risk of mortality spectrum, we used stepwise logistic regression on PROWESS placebo patients to generate a predicted risk of mortality model that simultaneously included many clinical and biochemical markers of mortality risk. Because <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> has anticoagulant properties, we also present analyses of bleeding and thrombotic events. Actual mortality rates were lower with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> compared with placebo for nearly all prospectively defined subgroups. Both univariate and multivariable regression analyses showed a consistent relative risk reduction in 28 -day mortality rates for <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated).</b> Larger absolute risk reductions were found with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> in patients with a higher baseline predicted risk of mortality, and actual mortality rates were lower with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> in all subgroups defined by disease severity measures where a {{greater than or equal to}} 20 % placebo mortality was observed. Although discriminatory power was limited by few observed events, the increased absolute risk of experiencing a serious bleeding event with treatment did not seem to vary according to the baseline predicted risk of mortality. Conclusions. The administration of <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> to patients with severe sepsis was associated with a significant survival benefit that tended to increase with higher baseline likelihood of death.

40|$|Severe sepsis and {{septic shock}} {{are common in}} the {{critically}} ill patient and account for considerable morbidity and mortality {{not to mention the}} high associated costs. Advances in our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and in the important link between the inflammatory response to sepsis and activation of coagulation led to the development and licensing of the first ever, specific, immunomodulatory anti-sepsis drug. <b>Drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated),</b> a recombinant version of activated protein C, was shown in a large randomized controlled clinical trial to reduce mortality rates from 30. 8 % in the placebo group to 24. 7 % in the treatment group, which equated to one additional life saved for every 16 patients treated.

Some preparations involving protease have undergone successful clinical trials and have regulatory authorization; and some further ones have shown apparently useful effects in experimental medical studies. [...] Proteases have also been used by proponents of alternative therapies, or identified in materials of traditional or folk medicine. A serine protease of human origin, activated protein C, was produced in recombinant form and marketed as <b>Drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (also known as Xigris (TM)) and licensed for intensive-care treatment of severe sepsis.

40|$|Objective: In the {{multinational}} PROWESS trial, <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> significantly reduced mortality rate {{in patients with}} severe sepsis compared with placebo. The use of large multiple-enter trials can potentially complicate interpretation of results in severe sepsis populations because of variability in medical attitudes and practices {{and the frequency of}} confounding events such as protocol violations. The objective {{of this study was to}} perform a blinded, critical, integrated review of data from the 1, 690 severe sepsis patients from 164 medical centers enrolled in the PROWESS trial using a Clinical Evaluation Committee. Design: Blinded, critical, integrated review of data. Setting: Participating sites. Patients: The 1, 690 severe sepsis patients from 164 medical centers enrolled in the PROWESS trial. Interventions: We performed analyses of the optimal cohort, defined as patients who had full compliance with the protocol, had evidence of an infection, and received adequate anti-infective therapy. We also performed other analyses, including significant underlying disorders, life support measures, and causes of death. Measurements and Main Results: The optimal cohort of 81. 4 % of the intention-to-treat population [drotrecogin alfa (activated), n = 695; placebo, n = 680] had similar baseline severity of illness between the two groups, a similar pharmacodynamic effect, and a relative risk of death estimate consistent with that observed in the overall PROWESS trial (0. 83, 95 % confidence interval 0. 69 - 0. 99 vs. 0. 806, 95 % confidence interval 0. 69 - 0. 94). A beneficial effect of <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> similarly was observed in patients with significant underlying disorders (0. 73, 95 % confidence interval 0. 57 - 0. 93) who were more severely ill and had a higher percentage of patients forgoing life-sustaining therapy. In contrast with the original investigator determinations, a benefit associated with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> treatment in urinary tract infection adjudicated by the Clinical Evaluation Committee was observed. Conclusions: The survival benefit associated with <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> use was consistent with the results of the overall trial regardless of whether patients met criteria of the optimal cohort or had a significant underlying disorder...|$|E

40|$|Sepsis and {{septic shock}} accountfor {{approximately}} 5 %– 15 % ofall {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) ad-missions and constitute the second most frequent {{cause of death in}} the ICU after primary cardiovascular dis-eases (1 – 3). The incidence of sepsis in the United States has been estimated to be 660, 000 – 750, 000 cases per year (1, 2, 4, 5). Data from several large clinical trials in severe sepsis (i. e., sepsis with new on-set organ failure) indicate that the inci-dence of septic shock approaches 435, 000 cases annually (6). The mortality rate as-sociated with severe sepsis is approxi-mately 25 %– 50 %, whereas mortality in septic shock ranges between 40 % and 75 % (1, 2, 4 – 6). The pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock involves a systemic inflammatory response to the presence of an uncon-trolled infection (7). If excessive, this host response can develop into septic shock with severe cardiovascular instability, multiorgan dysfunction, coagulopathy, and death. Experimental models suggest that sepsis is not only associated with systemic inflammation, but also repre-sents a pro-coagulant state with profound deficiencies in circulating endogenous anticoagulants including antithrombin, protein C, activated protein C, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (5, 8, 9). Because of their anticoagulant and anti-inflamma-tory properties, these circulating glyco-proteins have been investigated as poten-tial therapies in sepsis (8). To date, only human recombinant <b>activated</b> protein C (<b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa)</b> {{has been shown to be}} of benefit in a single phase III trial (5). Long-term follow-up data and the results of two trials examining <b>drotrecogin</b> <b>alfa</b> Background: Sepsis and septic shock represent a systemic inflammatory state with substantial pro-coagulant elements. Un-fractionated heparin is a known anticoagulant, which also pos-sesses anti-inflammatory properties. Unfractionated heparin has been shown to increase survival in experimental models of septic shock.

40|$|Identification of good {{surrogate}} end-points {{can greatly}} facilitate the design of clinical trials. Using data from PROWESS and ENHANCE, Shorr and colleagues explore the potential value of several plasma biomarkers for treatment trials of activated protein C for severe sepsis. Based on the framework proposed by Vasan, they tested the utility of several factors (protein C, interleukin- 6, antithrombin III, prothrombin time, protein S, and d-dimers) as type 0, 1 and 2 biomarkers. Only protein C had acceptable performance characteristics as a type 2 biomarker, or surrogate end-point. The utility of protein C as a surrogate end-point for studies of severe sepsis must be validated in future prospective studies.
