The frames appear out of focus as they move, as if unawares, from locating the first true artist to the first true modern artist. And then (as Giles Deleuze, the great philosopher of cinema has taught that cinema is at its most cinematic when it frees us from the idea of time as a connected order or sequence) the disruption of a linear sequence between modern art and post modern art leads to a host of montages, jump cuts, irrational cuts and multiple view points...|$|E
