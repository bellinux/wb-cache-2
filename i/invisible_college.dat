40|$|<b>Invisible</b> <b>colleges</b> - researchers’ {{networks}} of communicating academic work – are power-generating actors shaping research fields. A key question concerns {{the relation between}} local research communities and their dependence on global actors. A key arena is articles and citations in academic journals. An actor-network-inspired empirical investigation of the geographical origin of articles and references in the journal “Studies in the Education of Adults” and a check of references to journals in “Adult Education Quarterly” was made. The origin of articles and study objects in the International journal of Lifelong education was also analysed. Some conclusions {{can be drawn from}} the material. One is the heavy impact of “real” geographical location, i. e. the origins of texts and references are located in very specific areas on the map, i. e. in spite of the possibilities of cyberspace and global mobility. Another conclusion is the unilateral relation between an Anglo-American centre and a periphery in the distribution systems of texts. Adult education is faced with a contradictory situation between culturing <b>invisible</b> <b>colleges</b> in adult education and getting resources in the emerging economy of publications and citations through membership in other <b>invisible</b> <b>colleges.</b> (DIPF/orig. ...|$|R

40|$|Michel Foucault's {{works have}} been {{referenced}} in several {{fields of knowledge}} and such influence has also been noticed in accounting. The objective {{of this paper is}} to find at what point in time Foucault’s work started to be used in accounting literature, how it was accepted or refused by researchers and identify <b>invisible</b> <b>colleges.</b> This study contributes to identify the development of a new area of research through the movements of theories between fields. It identifies how foucaultian researches have been utilized to explain power and disciplinary aspects in accounting. The first level of analysis is based on Bourdieu’s theory and descriptive research. A total of 68 accounting journals were analyzed and 123 articles with reference to Foucault were identified. 40 % are based in his theory and 60 % are incidental appropriation according to Chartier’s typology. The second level was a bibliometric analysis and revealed a significant presence of Foucault’s ideas in Critical Accounting and a productivity behavior according to Lotka’s Law. The third level of analysis is based on Social Network Theory. It aimed to identify <b>invisible</b> <b>colleges</b> dealing with this subject.

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{of intellectual property}} as an academic issue opens a big gate to a cross-disciplinary field. Different disciplines start a dialogue {{in the framework of}} the international multilateral treaties in the early 90 's. As global economy demands new knowledge on intellectual property, Science grows at its own pace. However, the degree of consolidation of cross-disciplinary academic communities is not clear. In order to know how closely related are these communities, this paper proposes a mixed methodology to find <b>invisible</b> <b>colleges</b> in the production about intellectual property. The articles examined in this paper were extracted from Web of Science. The analyzed period was from 1994 to 2016, taking into account the signature of the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights in the early 90 's. A total amount of 1580 papers were processed through co-citation network analysis. An especial technique, which combine algorithms of community detection and defining population of articles through thresholds of shared references, was applied. In order to contrast the <b>invisible</b> <b>colleges</b> that emerged with the existence of formal institutional relations, it was made a qualitative tracking of the authors with respect to their institutional affiliation, lines of research and meeting places. Both methods show that the subjects of interest can be grouped into 13 different issues related to intellectual property field. Even though most of them are related to Laws and Economics, there are weak linkages between disciplines which could indicate the construction of a cross-disciplinary field.

Only in the pharmacological strategy was an organized knowledge translation process identified, which, however, is monopolized by the liposomal doxorubicins. In the case of MNs, subnetworks are not differentiated by the type of therapeutic strategy, and the content of the documents is still basic research.

40|$|Objective: Many professions {{use some}} form of {{internship}} in professional education. Social work has utilized field instruction throughout much of its history. Recently, the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) designated field instruction as social work’s signature pedagogy. A systematic review was undertaken to examine evidence related to this designation. Method: Twenty-five primary databases, three grey literature sources, a research university library (for monographs and collections) were searched {{in addition to a}} survey of the <b>invisible</b> <b>colleges</b> and hand searching of journals. The goal was to uncover quantitative studies of social work field instruction in the United States. Results:None of the studies that passed the initial review and were acquired for full examination met the inclusion criteria, precluding a meta-analytic integration. Conclusion: The assertion that field instruction is the signature pedagogy of social work would be more credible if supported by stronger evidence...|$|R

The present paper was developed under this perspective, considering the importance that the theme “education for sustainability” has been acquiring, especially from the last decade on. This was considered as {{a great opportunity to}} characterize the production on the mentioned subject, showing to the scientific community how it is being developed. The results show that there is a growing interest from the applied social sciences and from the environmental sciences on “education for sustainability, as well as from many other science fields. The practical implication of the present study is to be a reference for researchers, helping them to explore not only the available bibliography but showing them the best way to convey their production.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to {{the debate on the}} influence of electronic communication on the informal exchange of information among scientists and practitioners. The research is focused on an empirical analysis of three specialised Newsgroups in "speech technology" (comp. speech, comp. speech. research and comp. speech. users), over the period 1992 - 2000. Looking at these discussion forums as electronic systems of social interaction, it is appropriate to ask whether they are extending the traditional social networks of "invisible colleges" into the digital age? This paper concludes that this is indeed occurring. First, to a significant extent these electronic environments support international and inter-sectoral remote collaboration. Secondly, these forums support the creation of key properties of "invisible colleges", persistent interaction among peers and a "division of labour" in the accumulation of expertise. Both of these properties are supported by a longitudinal network analysis of the forums. Further opportunities for inquiry are discussed in the concluding section.
