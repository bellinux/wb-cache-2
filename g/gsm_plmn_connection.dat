50|$|A GSM PLMN may be {{described}} by a limited set of access interfaces and a limited set of <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN</b> <b>connection</b> types to support the telecommunication services described in the GSM 02-series of specifications.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is used to}} {{exchange}} secured packets between an entity in a <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN</b> and an entity in the SIM. Secured Packets contain application messages to which certain mechanisms according to GSM 03.48 have been applied. Application messages are commands or data exchanged between an application resident in or behind the <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN</b> and on the Wapor MMS.|$|R
50|$|GSM {{architecture}} {{is basically the}} PLMN architecture itself as the subject is <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN.</b> Various interfaces between the GSM subsystems are to be considered, along with the signaling system and the various components (both hardware and software).|$|R
50|$|The <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN</b> {{is divided}} into {{signaling}} network and mobile network. Each of these has various subsystems, which are grouped under three major systems: the Network and Switching Subsystem (NSS), the Base Station Subsystem (BSS), and the operation and support system (OSS).|$|R
50|$|The general {{objective}} of a PLMN is to facilitate wireless communication and to interlink the wireless network with the fixed wired network. The PLMN was {{specified by the}} European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI) following up with their GSM specification. Even as times changed, the <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN</b> objectives conceptually remained the same.|$|R
40|$|Analog {{cellular}} phones and networks were designed with minimal security which soon {{turned out to}} be insufficient. The GSM system provides solutions to a few important aspects of security: subscriber authentication, subscriber identity confidentiality and confidentiality of voice and data over the radio path. This paper gives an overview of the security features provided in a <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN</b> and GPRS network. Also the SIM module, which {{plays an important role in}} GSM security, is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to provide {{end to end}} encryption within the fixed infrastructure of Home PubHc Land Mobile Network (Home PLMN) and link by link encryption within the <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN.</b> A new proposal for an authentication protocol for inter PLMN identity and technique for key distribution, achieves end to end encryption and link by hnk encryption across the GSM network. As a consequence of this, the GSM mobile phone user 2 Ì† 7 s voice can be completely protected from one point of communication to the other communication point. The receiving end may be within the same home mobile network or {{may be in a}} different network but within the GSM service area. We also propose a formal authentication protocol to set up inter PLMN calls, which solves the Border problem, as without the permission or awareness of the Home PLMN, no one can send any encrypted message. However it does provide complete encryption between different mobile networks within the GSM service area. Our proposal {{attempts to}} secure the location update between two Visitor Location Register (VLR) locations of a Home PLMN and also to secure international location update between inter <b>PLMN</b> of <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN,</b> by encrypting important subscriber data being transferred between them...|$|R
50|$|Each {{location}} {{area of a}} public land mobile network (PLMN) has its own unique identifier which is known as its {{location area}} identity (LAI). This internationally unique identifier is used for location updating of mobile subscribers. It is composed of a three decimal digit mobile country code (MCC), a two to three digit mobile network code (MNC) that identifies a Subscriber Module Public Land Mobile Network (SM PLMN) in that country, and a location area code (LAC) which is a 16 bit number with two special values, thereby allowing 65534 location areas within one <b>GSM</b> <b>PLMN.</b>|$|R
