50|$|Highly {{processed}} {{foods such as}} granola bars come in <b>individual</b> <b>packaging,</b> demanding high energy inputs and resulting in packaging waste. These products contribute up {{to a third of}} total energy inputs for food consumption, as their ingredients are shipped from all over, processed, packaged, trucked to storage, then transported to retail outlets. Bottled water is another example of a highly packaged, wasteful food product. It is estimated that Americans throw away 40 million plastic water bottles every day, and bottled water is often shipped trans-continentally. Carbonated water must be chilled and kept under pressure during storage and transport so as to keep the carbon dioxide dissolved. This factor contributes greater energy usage for products shipped longer distances. Drinking purified tap water treated with an active carbon filter for taste (most imp. chlorine), is a lower-carbon choice.|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} {{tells us}} that both the brand name and packaging of a product {{have an effect on}} the consumer and his or her individual purchasing decision. The following study attempts to further explore and explain how each one affects the other and in which situations, one has a greater influence on the consumer choice process. The research focuses on the comparison of what role brand name and packaging quality play in the consumer choice process. Specifically, the study looked at how the following factors, brand consciousness/familiarity, product experience and individual confidence/self-esteem of the buyer, influence the choice process as it relates to brand image and a product’s packaging. The data suggested that college consumers found <b>individual</b> <b>packaging</b> attributes attractive and eye catching but just simply weren’t influenced enough by these attributes to outweigh the perception of the importance of brand name, at least for relatively private, consumer products...|$|E
40|$|Independent of {{the ongoing}} {{acidification}} of surface seawater, {{the majority of the}} calcium carbonate produced in the pelagial is dissolved by natural processes above the lysocline. We investigate to what extent grazing and passage of coccolithophorids through the guts of copepods and the food vacuoles of microzooplankton contribute to calcite dissolution. In laboratory experiments where the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi was fed to the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, the heterotrophic flagellate Oxyrrhis marina and the copepod Acartia tonsa, calcite dissolution rates of 45 &ndash; 55 %, 37 &ndash; 53 % and 5 &ndash; 22 % of ingested calcite were found. We ascribe higher loss rates in microzooplankton food vacuoles as compared to copepod guts to the strongly acidic digestion and the <b>individual</b> <b>packaging</b> of algal cells. In further experiments, specific rates of calcification and calcite dissolution were also measured in natural populations during the PeECE III mesocosm study under differing ambient pCO 2 concentrations. Microzooplankton grazing accounted for between 27 and 70 % of the dynamic calcite stock being lost per day, with no measurable effect of CO 2 treatment. These measured calcite dissolution rates indicate that dissolution of calcite in the guts of microzooplankton and copepods can account for the calcite losses calculated for the global ocean using budget and model estimates...|$|E

40|$|Advances in {{information}} and communication technology have provided consumers the option of shopping on-line instead of driving to a traditional retail store for many products. E-commerce has now grown from less than 1 % of retail sales in 2000 to 3 % in 2008. The alternative retail channels have some distinct differences with regard to environmental costs, including overstock inventory, physical store space, and consumer transport in traditional retail stores and <b>individual</b> <b>packaging</b> and last mile delivery for e-commerce. We build on prior comparative research and conduct a streamlined Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify variations in energy use and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions for the alternative systems using data received from the e-commerce industry for an electronic product. This report reviews our assumptions and analysis and provides conclusions and offer recommendations to decrease logistics LCA uncertainties. Differences in Logistics Networks The major differences between the traditional retail model and the e-commerce model are the transportation from the warehouses to the retail store or the distribution center, data center energy usage, individual vs. bulk packaging, and the transportation, from the store or distribution center to the consumer, often called the “last mile ” of delivery. These differences vary in energ...|$|E
40|$|The {{alignment}} of the strategic and the operational level of packaging development {{in relation to the}} integration of sustainability is not addressed extensively in current research. This paper aims to address this, by focusing on the decision-making interrelations of key actors (marketing and packaging development) within multidisciplinary product-packaging development teams. The research is conducted by means of a qualitative approach, consisting of semi-structured interviews with <b>individual</b> <b>packaging</b> development team members, complemented with a newly developed visualization tool. The research builds upon eight cases within brand owners, packaging material suppliers and packaging development consultants. The main findings of the study include the decision-making trade-offs between sustainability considerations and other project indicators, such as costs, time-to-market and technical challenges. These trade-offs are linked to the strategic and operational roles of key actors, and to internal and external factors influencing sustainable development processes. This research’s contribution is to address the {{alignment of}} the strategic and the operational levels of sustainable packaging development, in relation to (1) decision making and interrelations within multidisciplinary development teams; and (2) the relevance of development-influencing factors. This provides opportunities for further development of sustainable packaging models and tools, in order to align the strategic and operational level of development.

40|$|The {{miniaturization}} {{of space}} applicable devices {{by means of}} MEMS technology is pursued by many research groups. MEMS devices are often designed as stand alone and require <b>individual</b> <b>packaging</b> which often makes them still quite large. Focusing on the integration of several MEMS components {{has the advantage of}} reducing size and mass much more. An integrated and miniaturized cold gas propulsion system for micro satellites is presented which consists of a valve, a particle filter, a pressure sensor, a nozzle and a gas tank. By selecting a convenient package first and adjusting the MEMS part to fit the package, costs are reduced and modularity is obtained. The baseline of the system is a glass tube bonded on a silicon disc which contains a valve seat as shown in Figure 1. The valve is normally closed by an embossed membrane which is stacked inside the glass tube. A piezo-disc is glued to the boss of the membrane to actuate the valve. The glass tube is functioning as hermetically sealed package as well as fluidic interconnect with the macro world. The pressure sensor and particle filter are suspended in the glass tube. This integrated system is connected to a pressurized N 2 gas tank which is developed by TNO [1]. The tank contains 8 cold gas generators which makes it possible to reduce the working pressure to 3. 4 bar withoutcompromising on the amount of gas. During the symposium the technical development and results will be presented...|$|E
