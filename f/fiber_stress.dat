By imaging live cells expressing fluorescently tagged cytoskeletal proteins, we observed that actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> undergo local, acute, force-induced elongation and thinning events that compromise their stress transmission function, followed by <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> repair that restores this capability. The LIM protein zyxin rapidly accumulates at sites of strain-induced <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> damage and is essential for <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> repair and generation of traction force. Zyxin promotes recruitment of the actin regulatory proteins α-actinin and VASP to compromised <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> zones. α-Actinin plays {{a critical role in}} restoration of actin integrity at sites of local <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> damage, whereas both α-actinin and VASP independently contribute to limiting <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> elongation at strain sites, thus promoting stabilization of the <b>stress</b> <b>fiber.</b> Our findings demonstrate a mechanism for rapid repair and maintenance of the structural integrity of the actin cytoskeleton...|$|R

We show that TGF-beta via Smad and p 38 Mapk up-regulates expression of actin-binding proteins including high-molecular-weight tropomyosins, alpha-actinin and calponin h 2. We demonstrate that, among these proteins, tropomyosins are both necessary and sufficient for TGF-beta induction of <b>stress</b> <b>fibers.</b> Silencing of tropomyosins with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) blocks <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> assembly, whereas ectopic expression of tropomyosins results in <b>stress</b> <b>fibers.</b> Ectopic-expression and siRNA experiments show that Smads mediate induction of tropomyosins and <b>stress</b> <b>fibers.</b> Interestingly, TGF-beta induction of <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> was not accompanied {{by changes in}} the levels of cofilin phosphorylation.

In the model we have considered anisotropy {{of the active}} and passive components of myocardial tissue, {{dependence of}} active stress on time, strain and strain rate, activation sequence of the LV wall and aortic afterload. Muscle fiber orientation in the LV wall is quantified by the helix fiber angle, defined as the angle between the muscle fiber direction and the local circumferential direction. In a first simulation, a transmural variation of the helix fiber angle from + 60 degrees at the endocardium through 0 degrees in the midwall layers to - 60 degrees at the epicardium was assumed. In this simulation, at the equatorial level maximum active muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> was found to vary from about 110 kPa in the subendocardial layers through about 30 kPa in the midwall layers to about 40 kPa in the subepicardial layers. Next, {{in a series of}} simulations, muscle fiber orientation was iteratively adapted until the spatial distribution of active muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> was fairly homogeneous. Using a transmural course of the helix fiber angle of + 60 degrees at the endocardium, + 15 degrees in the midwall layers and - 60 degrees at the epicardium, at the equatorial level maximum active muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> varied from 52 kPa to 55 kPa, indicating a remarkable reduction of the stress range. Moreover, the change of muscle fiber strain with time was more similar {{in different parts of the}} LV wall than in the first simulation.

The ratio of V(lv) to V(w) appeared {{to be the most important}} geometric parameter, whereas the actual LV shape was of minor importance. The relationships on fiber strain and stress were evaluated experimentally in six anesthetized open-chest dogs during normal and elevated (volume loading) end-diastolic LV pressure. Subepicardial fiber strain was measured simultaneously in 16 adjacent regions of the LV anterior wall, using optical markers that were attached to the epicardial surface and recorded on video. Changes in V(lv) were measured by use of four inductive coils sutured to the LV in a tetrahedric configuration. V(w) was measured postmortem. During control as well as hypervolemia the following results were found. At the anterior free wall of the LV, the slope of the estimated linear relationship between measured and calculated fiber strain was 1. 017 +/- 0. 168 (means +/- SD), which is not significantly different from unity. Calculated <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> corresponded qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental results reported on isolated cardiac muscle.

40|$|Background: Cells within tissues are {{subjected}} to mechanical forces caused by extracellular matrix deformation. Cells sense and dynamically respond to stretching of the matrix by reorienting their actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> and by activating intracellular signaling proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the mitogen-activated proteins kinases (MAPKs). Theoretical analyses predict that <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> can relax perturbations in tension depending on the rate of matrix strain. Thus, we hypothesized <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> organization and MAPK activities are altered to an extent dependent on stretch frequency. Principal Findings: Bovine aortic endothelial cells and human osteosarcoma cells expressing GFP-actin were cultured on elastic membranes and subjected to various patterns of stretch. Cyclic stretching resulted in strain rate-dependent increases in <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> alignment, cell retraction, and the phosphorylation of the MAPKs JNK, ERK and p 38.

The model is based on the premise that <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> are pre-stressed at a ?homeostatic? level so that <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> are extended beyond their unloaded lengths, and that perturbation in <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> length from the homeostatic level destabilizes the <b>stress</b> <b>fibers.</b> A deterministic model described experimentally measured time courses of <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> reorientation perpendicular to the direction of cyclic uniaxial stretch, as well as the lack of alignment in response to equibiaxial stretch. In the case of cyclic simple elongation with transverse matrix contraction, <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> oriented in the direction of least perturbation in stretch. Model analysis indicated the need for a time-dependent <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> mechanical property, however. Thus, a stochastic model was developed that incorporated the concept that <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> tend to self-adjust to an equilibrium level of extension when they are perturbed from their unload lengths with the turnover of <b>stress</b> <b>fibers.</b> The stochastic model successfully described experimentally measured time courses of <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> reorganization over a range of frequencies. At a frequency of 1 Hz, <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> predominantly oriented perpendicular to stretch, while at 0. 1 Hz the extent of <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> alignment was markedly reduced and at 0. 01 Hz there was no alignment at all. Both the deterministic and stochastic models accurately described the relationship between stretch magnitude and the extent of <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> alignment in endothelial cells subjected to cyclic uniaxial stretch. Parameter sensitivity analyses for each model were used to demonstrate the effects of each parameter on the characteristics of the system response. In summary, the mathematical models were capable of describing <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> reorganization in response to diverse temporal and spatial patterns of stretch. These models provide a theoretical framework to elucidate the mechanisms by which adherent cells sense the characteristics of matrix deformation and describe a mechanism by which the cells can then adapt to such deformations to maintain mechanical homeostasis...|$|R

In the model we have considered anisotropy {{of the active}} and passive components of myocardial tissue, {{dependence of}} active stress on time, strain and strain rate, activation sequence of the LV wall and aortic afterload. Muscle fiber orientation in the LV wall is quantified by the helix fiber angle, defined as the angle between the muscle fiber direction and the local circumferential direction. In a first simulation, a transmural variation of the helix fiber angle from + 60 ” at the endocardium through 0 ” in the midwall layers to- 60 ” at the epicardium was assumed. In this simulation, at the equatorial level maximum active muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> was found to vary from about 110 kPa in, the subendocardial layers through about 30 kPa in the midwall layers to about 40 kPa in the subepicardial layers. Next, {{in a series of}} simulations, muscle fiber orientation was iteratively adapted until the spatial distribution of active muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> was fairly homogeneous. Using a transmural course of the helix fiber angle of + 60 ” at the endocardium, + 15 ” in the midwall layers and-M) ” at the epicardium, at the equatorial level maximum active muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> varied from 52 kPa to 55 kPa, indicating a remarkable reduction of the stress range. Moreover, the change of muscle fib & strain with time was more similar i...|$|E

To account for {{the effect of the}} fibers, the Navier-Stokes equations are supplemented by the <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> tensor, which depends on the distribution function of fiber orientation angles. We have computed this function in turbulent channel flow, by solving the Fokker-Planck equation numerically. The results are used to validate an approximate method for calculating <b>fiber</b> <b>stress,</b> in which the second moment of the orientation distribution is solved. Since the moment evolution equations contain higher-order moments, a closure relation is required to obtain as many equations as unknowns. We investigate the performance of the eigenvalue-based optimal fitted closure scheme [J. S. Cintra and C. L. Tucker, J. Rheol. 39, 1095 (1995) ]. The closure-predicted stress and flow statistics in two-way coupled simulations are within 10 % of the “exact” Fokker-Planck solution. Multi-Scale PhysicsApplied Science...|$|E
40|$|Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) {{data was}} {{generated}} for a Ti- 15 V- 3 Cr- 3 Al- 3 Sn (Ti- 15 - 3) material reinforced with SCS- 6 silicon carbide fibers for both in-phase and out-of-phase thermomechanical cycling. Significant differences in failure mechanisms and fatigue life were noted for in-phase and out-of-phase testing. The {{purpose of the}} research is to apply a micromechanical model {{to the analysis of}} the data. The analysis predicts the stresses in the fiber and the matrix during the thermal and mechanical cycling by calculating both the thermal and mechanical stresses and their rate-dependent behavior. The rate-dependent behavior of the matrix was characterized and was used to calculate the constituent stresses in the composite. The predicted 0 degree <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> range was used to explain the composite failure. It was found that for a given condition, temperature, loading frequency, and time at temperature, the 0 degree <b>fiber</b> <b>stress</b> range may control the fatigue life of the unidirectional composite...|$|E
40|$|Actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> are dynamic {{structures}} in the cytoskeleton, which respond to mechanical stimuli and affect cell motility, adhesion and invasion of cancer cells. In nonmuscle cells, <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> have been subcategorized to three distinct <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> types: dorsal and ventral <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> and transverse arcs. These <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> are dissimilar in their subcellular localization, connection to substratum {{as well as in}} their dynamics and assembly mechanisms. Still uncharacterized is how they differ in their function and molecular composition. Here, I have studied involvement of nonmuscle alpha-actinin- 1 and - 4 in regulating distinct <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> as well as their localization and function in human U 2 OS osteosarcoma cells. Except for the correlation of upregulation of alpha-actinin- 4 in invasive cancer types very little is known about whether these two actinins are redundant or have specific roles. The availability of highly specific alpha-actinin- 1 antibody generated in the lab, revealed localization of alpha-actinin- 1 along all three categories of <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> while alphaactinin- 4 was detected at cell edge, distal ends of <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> as well as perinuclear regions. Strikingly, by utilizing RNAi-mediated gene silencing of alpha-actinin- 1 resulted in specific loss of dorsal <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> and relocalization of alpha-actinin- 4 to remaining transverse arcs and ventral <b>stress</b> <b>fibers.</b> Unexpectedly, aberrant migration was not detected in cells lacking alpha-actinin- 1 even though focal adhesions were significantly smaller and fewer. Whereas, silencing of alpha-actinin- 4 noticeably affected overall cell migration. In summary, as part of my master thesis study I have been able to demonstrate distinct localization and functional patterns for both alpha-actinin- 1 and - 4. I have identified alpha-actinin- 1 to be a selective dorsal <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> crosslinking protein as well as to be required for focal adhesion maturation, while alpha-actinin- 4 was demonstrated to be fundamental for cell migration...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> components in cultured fibroblasts, we expressed α-actinin and the myosin II regulatory myosin light chain (MLC) as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein. Myosin activation was stimulated by treatment with calyculin A, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor that elevates MLC phosphorylation, or with LPA, another agent that ultimately stimulates phosphorylation of MLC via a RhoA-mediated pathway. The resulting contraction caused <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> shortening and allowed observation {{of changes in the}} spacing of <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> components. We have observed that <b>stress</b> <b>fibers,</b> unlike muscle myofibrils, do not contract uniformly along their lengths. Although peripheral regions shortened, more central regions stretched. We detected higher levels of MLC and phosphorylated MLC in the peripheral region of <b>stress</b> <b>fibers.</b> Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed more rapid exchange of myosin and α-actinin in the middle of <b>stress</b> <b>fibers,</b> compared with the periphery. Surprisingly, the widths of the myosin and α-actinin bands in <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> also varied in different regions. In the periphery, the banding patterns for both proteins were shorter, whereas in central regions, where stretching occurred, the bands were wider...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStress fibers are actomyosin-based bundles whose {{structural}} and contractile properties underlie numerous cellular processes including adhesion, motility and mechanosensing. Recent advances in high-resolution live-cell imaging and single-cell force measurement have dramatically sharpened {{our understanding of}} the assembly, connectivity, and evolution of various specialized <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> subpopulations. This in turn has motivated interest in understanding how individual <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> generate tension and support cellular structure and force generation. In this review, we discuss approaches for measuring the mechanical properties of single <b>stress</b> <b>fibers.</b> We begin by discussing studies conducted in cell-free settings, including strategies based on isolation of intact <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> and reconstitution of stress fiber-like structures from purified components. We then discuss measurements obtained in living cells based both on inference of <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> properties from whole-cell mechanical measurements (e. g., atomic force microscopy) and on direct interrogation of single <b>stress</b> <b>fibers</b> (e. g., subcellular laser nanosurgery). We conclude by reviewing various mathematical models of <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> function that have been developed based on these experimental measurements. An important future challenge in this area will be the integration of these sophisticated biophysical measurements with the field's increasingly detailed molecular understanding of <b>stress</b> <b>fiber</b> assembly, dynamics, and signal transduction.
