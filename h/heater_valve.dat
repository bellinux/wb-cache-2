A dynamic multi-configuration model of a concentrated solar power plant has been developed. The component model is meant to be used for power plant modeling with the ThermoSysPro library developed by EDF and released under open source license. The model is based on momentum and mass/energy conservation equations, as 1 -dimensionnal (1 D), partial differential equations. The model includes a water/steam cycle (economizer, evaporator, superheater, turbines, aerocondenser, water <b>heaters,</b> pumps, <b>valves,</b> tank, volumes and pipes), molten salt thermal storage system (temperature up to 565 °C with a capacity of 8 hours of electricity production without sunlight) and a cylindrical receiver. The distribution of the heat flux received by the receiver may be calculated by Tonatiuh tool (Ray Tracing tool). The primary aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the capability of said model to simulate the operating conditions of a solar power plant, and then the capability of the model to check the manufacturers design and targeted performances.

The 10, 000 BPD is split evenly between two types of crude: heavy and light. The heavy crude has the following inlet conditions: it will produce 1, 000 BPD of water, has an American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity of 16 degrees, a gas/oil ratio (GOR) of 150, a delivery temperature range of 20 - 30 degrees Celsius, a delivery pressure range of 250 to 450 psia, 13 % H 2 S in the gas phase, and a high salt content. The light crude has the following inlet conditions: it will produce 1, 000 BPD of water, has an API gravity of 37 degrees, a GOR of 600, a delivery temperature range of 18 to 40 degrees Celsius, a delivery pressure range of 250 to 700 psia, 23 % H 2 S in the gas phase, and a high salt content. Despite the differing inlet conditions, the product sales specifications are the same: a basic sediment and water (BS&W) content of less than 0. 5 weight percent, a relative vapor pressure (RVP) of less than 10 psia, an H 2 S concentration of less than 20 ppm, a salt concentration of less than 10 pounds per barrel (PTB), and an overall sulfur concentration of less than 2 weight percent. In order to achieve these specifications, the Team designed two processes that run in parallel, meaning that the light and heavy crudes remain separate. Within the process, the crude encounters a phase separator to extract the free flowing water and natural gas that enters from the well, two electrostatic coalescers (ECs) in series to remove emulsified water and salts, and a stripping tower to absorb hydrogen sulfide into nitrogen gas. Between these major pieces of equipment, additional features like <b>heaters,</b> mixers, <b>valves,</b> and flares are used to reduce the viscosity of the oil, mix in freshwater, control pressure drops, and burn excess gases, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{starts from}} the {{recognition}} that a hydronic heating system can be optimised, but can never be totally perfect. Sooner or later, in practice, deviations - caused {{by one or more}} components having slightly different characteristics or settings than they are assumed or supposed to have - arise. The aim of this work is to show how system design affects the overall sensitivity to deviations, in terms of the effect on performance and return water temperature. The systems that have been analysed are radiator systems and air <b>heaters</b> controlled by <b>valve</b> groups, both supplied by heat from district heating. In particular, the analysis has been concentrated on differences between high-flow and low-flow systems. Based on fundamental theory in this area, as well as on physical measurements made in test rigs, models have been developed and/or applied in order to investigate system function in the desired manner. The effect of deviations have then been shown and quantified, using results from simulations. The simulations show that thermostatic radiator valves are most effective in low-flow systems. Low-flow systems, too, produce the lowest return temperatures. However, incorrect or changed radiator valve settings can result in substantial increased return temperature and differences in room temperatures in such systems. A direct connection of an air heater (that is without recirculation) presents the least risk of control instability, which means that performance tends to be more stable. In this respect, there is no difference whether the system is balanced for a high flow or a low flow. However, balancing does have a considerable effect on the control performance of valve groups with a recirculation connection and with low-flow systems running a greater risk of instability...|$|R
40|$|When {{performing}} fast LC with 50 mm narrow-bore columns {{packed with}} small particles, the LC instrumentation can {{give rise to}} non-negligible band broadening. In the present study, the loss in chromatographic efficiency attributed to nine different mass spectrometers of various brands, ionization source geometries and types of analyzers was assessed. In their standard configurations, the extra-column variance of these UHPLC-MS systems was estimated to vary from 20 to > 100 μL(2). However, it was demonstrated that these differences arise exclusively from the chromatographic system (i. e., injector, tubing, <b>valves,</b> <b>heater)</b> and from the tubing employed to interface the UHPLC instrument with the MS device. By minimizing the tubing used for each UHPLC system, the extra-column variance was reduced to approximately 17 - 19 μL(2) at 600 μL/min, {{for all types of}} configurations. To achieve optimal chromatographic performance, it is therefore of prime importance to optimize the UHPLC configuration prior to conducting MS. The tubing located between the UHPLC system and the ionization source entrance was found to be particularly critical, as it contributes to band broadening even in the gradient mode. Using an optimized UHPLC-MS configuration, the loss in efficiency with a 50 × 2. 1 mm I. D. column was negligible for k> 7. However, the efficiency loss with 1 mm I. D. columns remained non-negligible for all current instrumentation, even for solutes with a value of k> 20. Indeed, for a mixture of isobaric substrates and metabolites analyzed in gradient mode, the peak widths decreased by approximately 50 % between a standard and optimized UHPLC-MS configuration, considering a 50 × 2. 1 mm, 1. 7 μm column. The peak broadening was changed by 230 % on a 50 × 1 mm, 1. 7 μm stationary phase, for the same system configurations...|$|R
