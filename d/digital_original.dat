The following year he directed his first feature film, Confessional, a political thriller mockumentary shot in Cebu City; he starred in it assuming the name David Barril. The film was the first installment in what Tarog has dubbed the Camera trilogy, explaining: [...] "It's three films wherein the protagonist in each movie has a camera, and it's about the contrast of life and truth {{in front of the}} camera and behind it. The stories of the movies are different from each other, they're not related, and they just have common plot elements." [...] It garnered a total of five awards at the 24th Star Awards for Movies, two of which were given to TarogDigital Movie Director (shared with co-director Ruel Antipuesto) and <b>Digital</b> <b>Original</b> Movie Screenplay. In 2009 he directed the drama film Mangatyanan (also known as The Blood Trail), starring Irma Adlawan, and was the second installment in the Camera trilogy. The film was an entry to the 2009 Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival where it won the Best Production Design award.|$|E

The ATA interface itself evolved in several stages from Western <b>Digital's</b> <b>original</b> Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) interface. As a result, many near-synonyms for ATA/ATAPI and its previous incarnations are still in common informal use, in particular Extended IDE (EIDE) and Ultra ATA (UATA).

The prototype's physical design is informed by mechanical reproduction devices (e. g. relief press, large format camera) and retrospective print processes (halftone, dot matrix). The concept is outlined for a wooden viewing frame with a miniature camera that enables viewers' selection and capture of a photograph. The subsequent print process onto Japanese paper using the Arduino-controlled matrix of stepper motors with paint-tipped sponges is then detailed. When presented in a gallery, Wet Pixels provides users with more sensory feedback (physical, visual, auditory), through tangible creative mark making on paper, than entirely digital processes...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic Programming {{is one of}} {{the main}} methods of line detection. It defines a cost, which depends on local information, and {{performs}} a summationminimization process in a graph or in the image. Fischler et al in particular presented an algorithm, called F*, which achieves important results (convergence, robustness, rapidity). In previous works, we proposed a mathematical formalization of the F*, which allowed us to extend the cost to cliques of more than two points, and to synthesize the needed information (contrast, grey-level, direction) in one unique cost function defined on the <b>digital</b> <b>original</b> image. In the present work, we show how to include curvature information in the cost by using neighborhoods of size larger than one, and we apply this energy to the recognition of roads and valleys in SPOT images. 1 Introduction Among the various algorithms of line detection, those based on dynamic programming have raised great interest for their rapidity, robustness to noise and precision [...] ...|$|E

The main objectives for the LongRec partners are: Objective 1 : To enable transition to <b>digital</b> <b>original</b> documents and digital work processes for information that must be available and in use over decades. Objective 2 : To explore the potential for commercial products/services in this area. Case studies addressed by LongRec include documentation for physical objects that are in use for decades (ships, oilrigs, power plants, and others) and documents in public registries. Results may be generalised to other cases, e. g. health information. LongRec goes beyond the “digital preservation ” area addressed by libraries and (public) archives in that documents {{also need to be}} used (retrieved, updated, verified) subject to constraints related to ownership and authorisations. All parts of a document’s environment (technology, processes, organisations, roles/people, and ownership) must be expected to undergo several changes during the lifetime of the document.
