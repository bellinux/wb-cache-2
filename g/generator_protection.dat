30|$|The three {{analysis}} methods, i.e. Markov, {{event tree}} and fault tree, have different characteristics of application in the effect analysis of relay-protection hidden failures on power grid. Compared with the probability method, Markov is more {{applicable to the}} relay protection system that is a repairable system [18, 19]. Currently, the probabilistic statistical method {{is often used to}} build hidden failure probability models of relay-protection, in terms of the state change of power system, like load-flow transfer. But it is not as accurate as Markov method in assessing the hidden failure probability of protection. However, Markov method needs lots of samples to ensure the accuracy of Markov, which must bear a heavy computation burden. In Markov method, the event’s current state depends only on the last state, while event tree obeying the time sequence starts from the primary event, reasons out possible outcomes and identify the hazard source. For an example, based on the analysis of the hidden failure triggering conditions of relay-protection by event tree, it starts from a certain initial event and reason out the malfunction probability model of associated relay-protection under different contingences [20]. However, the event tree requires confirming object firstly, which demands thorough knowledge of the system structure, occurrence & probability of relevant accidents and the severity of consequences caused by accidents. Similar to the analysis by event tree, the analysis by fault tree is intuitively, straightforward, clear and logical. E.g., the dynamic process of the cascading resulted from relay-protection hidden failures is analyzed by fault tree so as to find out the line or <b>generator</b> <b>protection</b> “pre-malfunction set” [21] (the “pre-malfunction set” means the set of line or <b>generator</b> <b>protection</b> associated with the removed lines).|$|E

30|$|The {{probability}} of relay-protection hidden failure {{is the first}} problem to be solved during the research, which can be solved now mainly by probability statistical method and probability model method. The probability value obtained by probability statistical method is a fixed value, {{which can be used}} to evaluate the cascading failure risk caused by hidden failures, but can’t reflect the change of hidden failure probability value along with the real-time operating-condition such as line power flow, bus voltage, and system frequency. By the probability model method, the hidden failure {{probability of}} a particular protection system or a particular protection scheme can be worked out under different operating conditions. So far, 4 probability models of relay protection hidden failure have been proposed: hidden failure probability model of zone III transmission-line distance protection [10, 11], hidden failure probability model of over-current protection [12], hidden failure probability model of line protection considered over-flow [13], and hidden failure probability model of <b>generator</b> <b>protection</b> considered terminal-voltage [14]. The hidden failure probability value of zone III transmission-line distance protection is decided by the impedance seen by protection devices; the hidden failure probability of over-current protection devices is related to the magnitude of line current; the hidden failure probability of line protection considered over-flow is related to the magnitude of active line-load-flow; the hidden failure probability of <b>generator</b> <b>protection</b> considered terminal-voltage is related to the magnitude of generator’s terminal voltage. The [15] catalogued protection’s failure to operation and second-type mal-operation as hidden failures in consideration of the types of relay protection failures. Taking the probability obtained from the above hidden-failure probability models as the probability of protection’s second-type mal-operation, a general hidden failure probability model is built on the basis of Markov, in which the protection system involves protective devices with associated circuit breakers.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{study how}} to {{configure}} protective relays for protection of generators in offshore {{oil and gas}} facilities. On the Norwegian continental shelf, most platforms have isolated power systems with local power generation by a few synchronous generators. Normally, these generators have very similar ratings, also from facility to facility. Due to the natural inherent safety hazards of operating an electrical system in offshore oil and gas facilities, special standards regulate the practice. This applies especially to relay protection of generators because of its essential role for the facility operation combined with its wide range of failure mechanisms. In addition, the electrical system design is also very similar between facilities. All this, {{makes it possible to}} find a standard setup for protective relays that are used in such facilities. The thesis identify present standards and regulations that applies to <b>generator</b> <b>protection</b> in these facilities. The underlying reasons for these are also explained. Based on this, the thesis propose functions in the ABB REG 670 relay that {{can be used as a}} standard solution for all generators in such facilities, to achieve optimal <b>generator</b> <b>protection</b> and full compliance with existing requirements. Relay setting tables for generators in five different facilities is studied to identify how relay protection for generators in these facilities is performed today.

This identifies current contributions from a single generator for different fault types and system configurations. The study showed that a generator relay is not able to detect short circuits on other buses than where it is connected.
