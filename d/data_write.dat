October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had [...] "a significant performance edge" [...] over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems {{also found that the}} Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to [...] "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that [...] "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone." [...] Bloomberg {{reported in}} November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that [...] "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that [...] " [...] don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better" [...] and that [...] "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product".|$|E

50|$|Bits 16-17 (DR0), 20-21 (DR1), 24-25 (DR2), 28-29 (DR3), define when {{breakpoints}} trigger. Each breakpoint has a two-bit entry that specifies {{whether they}} break on execution (00b), <b>data</b> <b>write</b> (01b), data {{read or write}} (11b). 10b is defined to mean break on IO read or write but no hardware supports it; for 64-bit mode, it has been repurposed to specify an 8 byte wide breakpoint area. Bits 18-19 (DR0), 22-23 (DR1), 26-27 (DR2), 30-31 (DR3), define how large an area of memory is watched by breakpoints. Again each breakpoint has a two-bit entry that specifies whether they watch one (00b), two (01b), eight (10b) or four (11b) bytes.|$|E
50|$|By far {{the most}} common usage of this term is in modern {{multiprocessor}} CPU caches, where memory is cached in lines of some small power of two word size (e.g., 64 aligned, contiguous bytes). If two processors operate on independent data in the same memory address region storable in a single line, the cache coherency mechanisms in the system may force the whole line across the bus or interconnect with every <b>data</b> <b>write,</b> forcing memory stalls in addition to wasting system bandwidth. False sharing is an inherent artifact of automatically synchronized cache protocols and can also exist in environments such as distributed file systems or databases but current prevalence is limited to RAM caches.|$|E
50|$|There are, however, {{limits to}} how far {{performance}} can scale {{on a single}} server ('scaling up'), so on larger scales, multi-server MySQL ('scaling out') deployments are required to provide improved performance and reliability. A typical high-end configuration can include a powerful master database which handles <b>data</b> <b>write</b> operations and is replicated to multiple slaves that handle all read operations. The master server continually pushes binlog events to connected slaves so {{in the event of}} failure a slave can be promoted to become the new master, minimizing downtime. Further improvements in performance can be achieved by caching the results from database queries in memory using memcached, or breaking down a database into smaller chunks called shards which can be spread across a number of distributed server clusters.|$|E

5000|$|First the FS-Zone1 data is {{recorded}} {{on the next}} writable address. To write the image following the FS-Zone1, the mode bit {{is set in the}} LabelTag mode page. The drive is now in LabelTag mode. The data in TAGWRITE commands contains the Label pixel data. The label starts on the Next Writable Address of the inserted disc. The application sends a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE to the drive to let the drive start the image burning. The application unsets the mode bit in the LabelTag mode page to let the drive go back in <b>data</b> <b>write</b> mode. Before the drive can add the FS-Zone2, the application has to inquire the Next Writable Address from the drive to know where the end address is of the Image Window. The application finishes the LabelTag writing by closing the Image Session.|$|E
5000|$|This {{principle}} is applied digitally, {{such as in}} hard disks, but in a different form. The magnetised data on the disk consists of 1s and 0s. Unlike DNA, it only has two types of information, rather than four types, however, it still has a polar concept of transfer. In this case, the read-write head acts as an intermediary. A data section reading [...] "1", can only trigger one type of response, and [...] "0" [...] for the other. These responses from reading are converted into an electrical form that gets carried through the circuits. Although this can be later converted and processed for other ways of using the data, which can be modified, if a file were being copied from one hard disk to another, the principle ensures that the data is transferred with high fidelity, because only each type of signal can only trigger one type of <b>data</b> <b>write,</b> {{in this case a}} 1 or a 0. This excludes exceptions where the data was written incorrectly or the existing data has been corrupted while on the disk such that no distinction can be made, but usually the hard disk returns the area as unreadable. The other concept that using digital copying is website copy http://www.carboncopyprosites.com, digital copying has more interpretation than just the basic concept of disk read and write itself. Digital Copy is a sample of interpretation of digital copying.|$|E

40|$|Graphics {{processing}} units (GPUs) {{have been}} widely used for general-purpose computation acceleration. However, cur-rent programming models such as CUDA and OpenCL can support GPUs only on the local computing node, where the application execution is tightly coupled to the physical GPU hardware. In this work, we propose a virtual OpenCL (VOCL) framework to support the transparent utilization of local or remote GPUs. This framework, based on the OpenCL programming model, exposes physical GPUs as de-coupled virtual resources that can be transparently managed independent of the application execution. The proposed framework requires no source code modifications. We also propose various strategies for reducing the overhead caused by data communication and kernel launching and demon-strate about 85 % of the <b>data</b> <b>write</b> bandwidth and 90 % of the data read bandwidth compared to <b>data</b> <b>write</b> and read, respectively, in a native nonvirtualized environment. We evaluate the performance of VOCL using four real-world applications with various computation and memory access intensities and demonstrate that compute-intensive appli-cations can execute with negligible overhead in the VOCL environment...|$|E

30|$|Case I: pre-declared {{embedded}} data pattern: The first case study uses a pre-declared {{embedded data}} pattern with 8 -bit data. The proposed controller tests the basic read/write operation for a Cannon 16 MB SD card using this data pattern. The same 8 -bit data pattern {{has been written}} repeatedly to the SD card for testing the single and multiblock <b>data</b> <b>write</b> operation. Later on, the same data pattern has been retrieved to validate the single as well as multiblock data read operation from the same SD card.|$|E
30|$|Card write module (CWM): The CWM {{has been}} {{designed}} to write the data block to the SDHC card. The right branch of the flow chart in Fig. 15 describes the write operation. On the way of execution, CU transfers the control to CWM along with the DTM signal to ensure a single block <b>data</b> <b>write</b> or a multiblock <b>data</b> <b>write.</b> In this implementation, both single and multiblock write operation have been taken into consideration. For single block write operation, the controller generates the command with the starting address and then it starts writing 512 bytes of data. For multiblock write, the controller writes the data block until the CMD 12 stop command is being issued. The CRC bits are appended to each data byte for the entire write operation. The card sends back the response pattern in the MISO line of the controller, where “XXX 00101 ” means the data block is accepted, “XXX 01011 ” means the data block is rejected due to the CRC error, and “XXX 01111 ” indicates that the data block is rejected due to the flash program error (in the pattern, “XXX” means do not care bits). The multiple block write improves the throughput as a single command is generated for bulk of data blocks write procedure.|$|E
