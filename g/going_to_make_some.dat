500|$|During {{the period}} between his junior and senior years, {{he played in the}} Cape Cod League, {{finishing}} sixth in the league in batting average. In his senior year in 2001 he repeated as second-team All-American. He set UC career records for home runs (56), walks (206), slugging percentage (.627), and on-base percentage (.499) with a batting average of [...]366. [...] "He had a great eye ... he hardly ever struck out looking", said Brad Meador, UC's associate head coach. [...] "When he did, you knew the ump missed the call." [...] Cleary, noting how driven Youkilis was to succeed, told his father: [...] "Your son's going to be a millionaire some day. I don't know if it's in baseball, but he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> money one of these days." [...] Youkilis was later inducted into UC's James Kelly Athletics Hall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|... "Till I Die" [...] {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Becky Bain of Idolator appreciated the [...] "nice blend of electro and R" [...] {{music in the}} song, writing that it [...] "has a unique sound that's both experimental and easy to lay back to". Andrew Martin of Complex magazine described [...] "Till I Die" [...] as a [...] "laid-back, summer-primed production", while Becca Longmire of Entertainment Wise viewed it as a potential hit. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush complimented the song for having a [...] "nice R groove" [...] and added that [...] "it will certainly get some spins on urban radio". Bene Viera of VH1 praised Brown's verse, writing that [...] "he's seriously <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> rappers step up their game". Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review magazine called {{it one of the}} many [...] "excellent collaborations" [...] on Fortune.|$|E
500|$|Since around 1968, Presley {{wanted to}} make some changes and hoped to do a world tour, he remarked: [...] "Before too long I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> {{personal}} appearance tours. I'll probably start out here in this country and after that, play some concerts abroad, probably starting in Europe. I want to see some places I've never seen before. I miss the personal contact with audiences." [...] However, throughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States—all of them in Canada (Toronto, Ottawa, and Vancouver), during brief tours there in 1957. Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. The real reason why Presley never toured abroad was probably because Parker feared that if he left the U.S., they would not let him back in again as it was later revealed that Parker was an illegal immigrant born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk in the Netherlands who left to go to the U.S. at the age of 29. Parker ultimately squelched any notions Presley had of working abroad, claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{most people}} who came to Gettysburg, the Rathvon family was aware that the {{president}} of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> remarks. [...] The family went to the town square where the procession was to form to go out to the cemetery that had not been completed yet. [...] At the head of the procession rode Abraham Lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen. [...] Rathvon describes Lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground; he also mentions the long eloquent speech given by Edward Everett of Massachusetts whom Rathvon accurately described as the [...] "most finished orator of the day." [...] Rathvon then goes on to describe how Lincoln stepped forward and [...] "with a manner serious almost to sadness, gave his brief address." [...] During the delivery, along with some other boys, young Rathvon wiggled his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of Mr. Lincoln and looked up into what he described as Lincoln's [...] "serious face." [...] Rathvon recalls candidly that, although he listened [...] "intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly," [...] he explains, [...] "boylike, I could not recall any of it afterwards." [...] But he explains that if anyone said anything disparaging about [...] "honest Abe," [...] there would have been a [...] "junior battle of Gettysburg." [...] In the recording Rathvon speaks of Lincoln's speech allegorically [...] "echoing through the hills." ...|$|E

5000|$|On June 7, 2013 U.S. President Barack Obama, {{referring}} to the PRISM program and the NSA's telephone calls logging program, said, [...] "What you've got is two programs that were originally authorized by Congress, have been repeatedly authorized by Congress. Bipartisan majorities have approved them. Congress is continually briefed on how these are conducted. There are {{a whole range of}} safeguards involved.

50|$|According to the 2006/2007 UN-HABITAT State of the World's Cities Report, the {{countries}} of Egypt, South Africa, Mexico, Tunisia, and Thailand stand out in their efforts towards slum upgrading. Indeed, their slum growth rates had fallen markedly in the various countries (though {{the fact that the}} growth rate is still positive speaks to the fact that slums are not going away or even shrinking). The report {{went on to say that}} in order to stem (or at least slow) the growth of slums in the world's cities, countries are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> hard choices and make major financial commitments (with the help of the World Bank, a major player in the worldwide effort to promote slum upgrading) in order to accomplish the Millennium Development Goals towards lifting significant number of slum dwellers out of poverty.|$|R

Then I just thought [...] "All my people right here, right now, d'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah." [...] Very vague, very ambiguous, that'll do. Look in the mirror and wink while you're singing it and it's quite saucy. And I fucking love that line, 'Coming in a mess, going out in style'. We were a bunch of scruffs from Manchester and we're going out in a Rolls Royce." ...|$|R

That will be quite sufficient. Say nothing about my having been born in India, or that my father was a native rajah. Some of these officials--and still more, their wives--are very prejudiced, and consider themselves to be quite different beings to the natives of the country.

50|$|Pope-Robinson {{was part}} of the Pope {{automobile}} group of companies founded by Colonel Albert Pope manufacturing Brass Era automobiles in Hyde Park, Massachusetts. The company could trace its roots back to Bramwell-Robinson who started as paper box machinery makers <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> single-cylinder 3-wheeled cars between 1899 and 1901. The two founders split up in 1902 <b>to</b> each <b>make</b> their own models under their own names, the Bramwell, which continued until 1904 and the Robinson which originally appeared in 1900. The Robinsons were originally made by John T Robinson and Company becoming the Robinson Motor Vehicle Company in 1902 before joining the Pope group later that year. The last cars were made in 1904.|$|R

The other morning,--I don't know whether there was {{anything}} in it,--but I fancied he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> change in the present arrangements. He did not do it, and it might have been fancy. Only think, Mr Palliser, what one word of his might do! If he says a word, he never goes back from it."

50|$|A {{short time}} later, Chow runs into some {{financial}} difficulties, and stops <b>going</b> out. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> extra money, {{he starts to}} write a science fiction series called 2046. The story {{is set in the}} distant future, about a group of heart sick individuals looking for love. The only place to find it is at a mysterious location called 2046. Virtually all of the characters in 2046 are based on people that Chow has met, such as Su Li-zhen, Lulu, or Wang Jing-wen. Whether 2046 is a place, a room, or a state of mind is never explicitly defined. Chow makes the story somewhat bizarre and erotic, and readers seem to take notice.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Archibald was {{a little}} tired with her journey of the day before, and {{contented}} herself with sitting in the shade in pleasant places, occupied with some needle-work she had brought with her, and trying to discipline her mind to habits of happiness in camp.

In this state of mind it pleased her to see Phil Matlack coming towards her.|$|R
5000|$|Snippet from Peggy Duvette's {{open letter}} of 6 Jan 2014; updated 24 Jan 2014:...maintaining social media {{platforms}} and tools {{comes at a}} cost. The software technologies that we are using need continual maintenance and upgrades. And to do this, they require constant funding, development and innovation. [...] After looking at budget projections, WiserEarth’s board, which helps run Wiser.org, has realized that it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> tough choices. Do they compromise their ethics by opening up to advertising? Do they continue to invest resources in fundraising {{just to keep the}} technical tools relevant? Or do they instead let go of the constant need {{to keep up with the}} latest, shiny new objects? At the same time, the WiserLocal program that was launched in 2009 continues to grow. How can they continue to protect and scale this program?The technical questions are made all the more challenging as Wiser.org has been fortunate enough to have funds put aside that could help keep the platform running for the next 7 years. However, it does not cover the necessary upgrades that would be needed for maintenance and staff costs.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{together}} quite enough," [...] said Lily. [...] "And as for mamma, I {{suppose she}} thinks--" [...] And then she stopped herself, catching the glance of Bell's imploring eye. She was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> indignant excuse for her mother, some excuse {{which would be}} calculated to make her uncle angry. It was her practice to say such sharp words to him, and consequently he did not regard her as warmly as her more silent and more prudent sister. At the present moment he turned quickly round {{and went into the}} house; and then, with a very few words of farewell, the two young men followed him. The girls went back over the little bridge by themselves, feeling that the afternoon had not gone off altogether well.|$|E
60|$|Disturbing {{thoughts}} spoiled Dick's {{visit to}} town and one morning soon after his return he {{went out on the}} sands when the tide was low. He took a note-book and a compass, and before he went walked up and down a measured distance on the lawn until he thought he knew the length of his stride. Since he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> investigations that he tried to hope would banish his doubts, it was necessary to be accurate. He found the spot where Jim had left his punt; there was a little runlet of water down the bank that fixed it, and he stepped off the distance to the level sand above. Then he smoked a pipe while he tried to recapture the footsteps as he had seen them in the moonlight, and when he was roughly satisfied, went across to the creek that ran into the main channel.|$|E

[...] Then he added, in a curious tone, this vague defence: [...] "As for Viola, she {{would be all right}} if they would leave her alone. She's gifted in a way I don't understand; but if she isn't twisted by Clarke's foolishness she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> man a good wife.

500|$|The Ford-powered M2B {{made its}} debut driven by McLaren at the world {{championship}} season-opening Monaco Grand Prix. There he qualified 10th on the grid and ran as high as sixth but retired after nine laps due to an oil leak. After Monaco McLaren decided [...] "it looks as though we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> fairly drastic moves in the engine room", and so for the next race in Belgium the Serenissima engine was used. The replacement unit did not provide an immediate solution though, terminally damaging its bearings in practice. With no spare, McLaren was unable to start the race. The team missed the next race in France, but at the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch the M2B finished sixth to score McLaren's first championship point. Another non-start resulted when the Serenissima failed again before the Dutch Grand Prix, and the entries for the German and Italian Grands Prix were withdrawn {{in anticipation of the}} improved Ford engine being readied. Thus equipped at the United States Grand Prix, McLaren drove to fifth place and two more points. At final event in Mexico, the rear bodywork was cut away to help prevent overheating but the engine failed during the race. McLaren had intended for Chris Amon, who was already racing sports cars for the team, to race a second car but the engine problems prevented this.|$|R

Military vehicles fitted with loudspeakers patrolled Rangoon's streets blaring: [...] "We have photographs. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> arrests."
