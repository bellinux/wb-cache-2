25|$|There are two bright spots. One: We {{can improve}} the quality of care and cut costs without rationing. There are models out there for how to do it right -- the Mayo Clinic, the Geisinger Clinic in Pennsylvania, the Cleveland Clinic and California's Kaiser Permanente {{are just a few of}} the {{organized}} group practices that are <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job for less. Their doctors are better than average at using the best medical evidence available. They're more likely to be using electronic medical records, which can help keep track of patients who have multiple physicians and need complex care. And they're less likely to provide unnecessary care.|$|E
