5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> abandon its Puritan values.|$|E

Transocean evacuated 11 nonessential workers late on August15 from an oil rig located about 160mi (260km) southeast of New Orleans. The company left about 125personnel on board the structure. A day later, Royal Dutch Shell evacuated 275 ancillary staff, following an evacuation of 188 due to Tropical Storm Erin.|$|E

5|$|On 9 November, Fraser {{contacted}} Whitlam {{and invited}} him to negotiations with the Coalition aimed at settling the dispute. Whitlam agreed, and a meeting was set for 9am on Tuesday 11 November, at Parliament House. That Tuesday was also the deadline for an election to be called <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be held before Christmas. Both Government and Opposition leaders were in Melbourne {{on the night of}} 10 November for the Lord Mayor's banquet. To ensure the Opposition leaders could reach Canberra in time for the meeting, Whitlam brought them back in his VIP aircraft, which arrived in Canberra at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 an {{exoplanet}} (47 UMa b) {{was announced}} in orbit around 47 Ursae Majoris by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made by observing the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum corresponding {{to changes in the}} star's radial velocity as the planet's gravity pulled it around. The planet was the first long-period extrasolar planet discovered. Unlike the majority of known such planets, it has a low-eccentricity orbit. The planet is at least 2.53 times the mass of Jupiter and takes 1,078 days or 2.95 years to orbit its star. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be located in the Solar System, it would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E
5|$|The M40 motorway, {{which was}} nearing {{completion}} {{at the time}} of production, doubled for the fictitious M104. In the run-up to the filming of the plane's near-miss with the bridge between Junctions 4 and 5, at Lane End on the High Wycombe Bypass, the Ministry of Transport and the local police ordered that in accordance with Ministry of Civil Aviation regulations, the manoeuvre be performed with the wheels in contact with the tarmac at all times. During a take, a crosswind sprang up and the drag caused by the dummies left Hughes concerned that she would lose control of the Tiger Moth <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> hit the ground. She therefore kept the plane in mid-air while passing under the bridge, clearing it by nine feet (2.7m) as originally planned. On another attempt, the continuing adverse conditions necessitated a second low-level glide, angering the Ministry of Transport official supervising the filming; subsequently, Hughes and production manager were arrested. Hughes, a pilot with more than three decades' flight experience by 1968, later commented that this dangerous stunt marked only {{the first time in her}} career that she had feared for her safety.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the original rumors of the eventual NHL expansion team in Las Vegas, ESPN writer Scott Burnside noted several obstacles that would be faced by the city <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> become a professional sports market, including the presence of legal sports betting, scheduling conflicts with {{the large number of}} residents who work nighttime and overnight shifts, and that the casinos would be unlikely to give away tickets to such events as a promotion, as they run contrary to a goal of encouraging patrons to remain in their facilities.|$|E
