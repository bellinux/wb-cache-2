5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} – The Classics Department sponsors an excavation at Castel Viscardo, a city near Orvieto in Italy. Faculty {{and students}} from the college are excavating a site that was occupied from the early Etruscan to the late Roman periods. The excavation <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> many historical and archaeological finds; Saint Anselm College sends over 25 students each summer to the Coriglia excavation, just outside town.|$|E
5|$|Like the Sun, 47 Ursae Majoris is on {{the main}} sequence, {{converting}} hydrogen to helium in its core by nuclear fusion. Based on its chromospheric activity, the star may be around 6,000 million years old, though evolutionary models suggest an older age of around 8,700 million years. Other studies <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> estimates of 4,400 and 7,000 million years for the star.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the moons}} of Saturn, {{including}} Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and {{prevent them from}} spreading out. Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> more reliable calculations of their masses.|$|E

5|$|Stem {{cell therapy}} is the {{replacement}} of damaged neurons by transplantation of stem cells into affected regions of the brain. Experiments <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> mixed results using this technique in animal models and preliminary human clinical trials. Whatever their future therapeutic potential, stem cells are already a valuable tool for studying Huntington's disease in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Two graves from a well-preserved {{sixth and}} seventh-century Anglo-Saxon {{cemetery}} at Finglesham <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> a bronze pendant and a gilt buckle with designs {{that are related}} to each other and may be symbolic of religious activity involving the Germanic deity Woden. These objects probably date from the period of the pagan reaction.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the fossil}} sites that <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> Velociraptor remains {{preserve}} an arid environment with fields of sand dunes and only intermittent streams, although the younger Barun Goyot environment {{seems to have}} been slightly wetter than the older Djadochta. The posture of some complete fossils, as well as the mode of preservation most show within structureless sandstone deposits, may show that a number of specimens were buried alive during sandstorm events common to the three environments.|$|E

Blue Beach near Hantsport, Joggins Fossil Cliffs, on the Bay of Fundy's shores, <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> {{an abundance of}} Carboniferous-age fossils. Wasson's Bluff, {{near the town of}} Parrsboro, <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> both Triassic- and Jurassic-age fossils.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals of {{the powerful}} Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) in a closed archaeological context, possibly indicating that the two were contemporary. If this is so, Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan {{or one of his}} predecessors, such as Sakir-Har, and would not have reigned over the Nile Delta. This conclusion is strongly debated at the moment since Sobekhotep IV and Khyan are separated by c. 100 years in the conventional Egyptian chronology.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{of several}} sites in Tamil Nadu and Kerala <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> remnants from the Sangam era, such as {{different kinds of}} pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as stratigraphy and paleography have helped establish the date of these items to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.|$|E
5|$|G-spot proponents are {{criticized for}} giving too much {{credence}} to anecdotal evidence, and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> positive {{evidence for a}} precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples. While {{the existence of a}} greater concentration of nerve endings at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina is commonly cited, some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation have shown no single area with a greater density of nerve endings.|$|E

5|$|Marsh rice rats from Paynes Prairie, Alachua County; Cedar Key, Levy County; and Lake Istokpoga, Highlands County, all in Florida, <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> A.forresteri. In Paynes Prairie, {{the type}} locality, 82 of 178 animals {{examined}} were infected with 1 to 50 (average 10) worms, but in Cedar Key {{only a single}} rat contained one worm. The worms {{were found in the}} front part, or fundus, of the stomach, with their front ends in the fundal tissue and their back ends projecting into the inside.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{raccoons}} in the Southeast <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> {{infection rates}} ranging from 47% to {{as low as}} 15.5%. Armadillo prevalence studies have been described in Louisiana, and range {{from a low of}} 1.1% to 28.8%. Additionally, small rodents, including squirrels, mice, and rats, are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal sources for the insect vectors. A Texas study revealed 17.3% percent T. cruzi prevalence in 75 specimens representing four separate small rodent species.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of accountable Pony Express history {{rests in the}} few tangible areas where records, papers, letters and mailings <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> the most historical evidence. Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express {{was the product of}} a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.|$|E

5|$|These {{excavations}} <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> {{different varieties}} of ceramics such as {{black and red}} ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds and shells provide clues {{about the nature of}} the settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in the material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{church in}} the capital, the Church of the Holy Apostles, which {{had been in a}} very poor state {{near the end of the}} 5th century, was likewise rebuilt. Works of embellishment were not confined to churches alone: excavations at the site of the Great Palace of Constantinople <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> several high-quality mosaics dating from Justinian's reign, and a column topped by a bronze statue of Justinian on horseback and dressed in a military costume was erected in the Augustaeum in Constantinople in 543. Rivalry with other, more established patrons from the Constantinopolitan and exiled Roman aristocracy (like Anicia Juliana) might have enforced Justinian's building activities in the capital as a means of strengthening his dynasty's prestige.|$|E
5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Carcharhinus species, {{attempts}} to analyze the finetooth shark's phylogenetic relationships <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> variable results. In 1988, Leonard Compagno grouped this species with the spinner shark (C. brevipinna), blacktip shark (C. limbatus), graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), and smooth tooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon), on the basis of morphological characters. Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found that the finetooth shark is the second-most basal member of the genus next to the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Mine Dosay-Akbulut's 2008 study, based on ribosomal DNA, suggested that the closest relative of the finetooth shark is the smalltail shark (C. porosus), and that the two species form a clade apart from other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen won the London Chess Classic on 8–15 December {{in a field}} {{comprising}} World Champion Anand, Vladimir Kramnik, Nakamura, and British players Adams, Nigel Short, David Howell, and Luke McShane. Carlsen had a rocky start, {{losing his}} games to McShane and Anand in rounds 1 and 3, but winning with white against Adams and Nakamura in rounds 2 and 4. He joined the lead with a win over Howell in round 5, and managed {{to stay in the}} lead following a harrowing draw against Kramnik in round 6, before defeating Short in the last round. Since the tournament was played with three points for a win, Carlsen's +4−2=1 score put him ahead of Anand and McShane who scored +2=5 (a more traditional two-points-for-a-win system would <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> a three-way tie, with Carlsen still on top, having the better tiebreaker due to four games with black—Anand and McShane played only three times with black).|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea is {{the only}} extinct carnivoran mammal known from Madagascar; {{recently}} extinct Madagascan animals also include at least 17species of lemurs, {{most of which are}} larger than the living forms, as well as elephant birds and Malagasy hippopotamuses, among others. Subfossil remains of the giant fossa have been found in Holocene cave sites from the northern end of Madagascar along the west coast to the far south, and in the central highlands. Some sites <b>have</b> <b>yielded</b> both C.spelea and smaller remains referable to the living species, C.ferox; however, lack of robust stratigraphic knowledge and no available radiocarbon dating on subfossil Cryptoprocta bones makes it uncertain whether the two species lived in the same region at the same time. The size ratio between the two species is within the range of ratios seen between similar-sized living cats and mongooses found in the same areas, suggesting that the two species may have been able to occur together.|$|E
