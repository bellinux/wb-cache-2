5|$|The division's <b>identification</b> <b>symbol</b> was the Albanian double-headed eagle. Despite its short existence, {{a collar}} patch {{depicting}} a goat-crested helmet was manufactured for the division {{but there is}} no evidence that it was ever used. Photographs exist of a machined-woven cuff band with the title Skanderbeg, but this was awarded to the 14th SS Volunteer Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the 7th SS Division in autumn 1944, and not to this division. Members of the cadre staff were photographed wearing an Albanian arm shield depicting a black Albanian double-headed eagle on a red field. Many of the division's Muslim members wore traditional grey-coloured skull caps instead of the standard SS field cap. Others wore the traditional Albanian highlander hat, the Qeleshe.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the name, Wolf Point, is unknown. In her 1856 memoir Wau-Bun, Juliette Kinzie states that 'the place was then called Wolf Point, from its having been the {{residence}} of an Indian named [...] "Moa-way," [...] or [...] "the Wolf."' Other alternate explanations are that it was so-named after the landlord of what would later be called the Wolf Point Tavern killed a ferocious wolf and hung a painted sign of a wolf outside his tavern to commemorate the event, or that it was named by a soldier at Fort Dearborn {{because it was a}} place where wolves would gather at night. Originally the term Wolf Point referred to {{the west bank of the}} Chicago River at the fork junction of its branches, but it gradually came to refer to the whole region around the forks and in modern usage is often more specifically used to mean the plot of land on the north side of the forks. The confluence of the three branches of the river near Wolf Point provided inspiration for Chicago's Municipal Device, a Y-shaped, city <b>identification</b> <b>symbol</b> that can be seen on many buildings in Chicago, and on city owned vehicles.|$|E

50|$|In former Yugoslavia the {{red star}} {{was not only}} {{considered}} a communist symbol, as were the hammer and sickle; {{but also as a}} symbol of resistance against fascist and Nazi occupation and associated ethnic policies. Tito's partisans, often including people with different political views, or even with a religious background, wore the red star as an <b>identification</b> <b>symbol.</b> As the use of the red star spread to communism in East Asia, it was adapted: while some states kept the star as it was, some used a yellow star, particularly on a red field, with the same symbolism. The Far Eastern Republic of 1920 to 1922 used a yellow star on its military uniforms, and the flag of the People's Republic of China has five yellow stars on a red field. The flag of Vietnam also has a yellow star on a red field. In Brazil, however, the red star remained as it was.|$|E

30|$|Based on kernel code reconstruction, {{this paper}} has {{proposed}} an adaptive approach for Linux memory analysis that can address a Linux memory image without information about the kernel version or System.map file. We implemented a prototype named RAMAnalyzer that {{is made up of}} five main components: kernel version <b>identification,</b> <b>symbol</b> table file recovery, kallsyms location symbol value recovery, live system information extraction, and database information extension. Our experimental results with a number of Linux memory images show that RAMAnalyzer can automatically identify the kernel version and recovery kernel symbols. Based on the kernel symbols, RAMAnalyzer then extracts live system information about the target system at the time of memory acquisition.|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} identification system and method are provided which employ a machine readable multiple layer label. The label has a plurality of machine readable marking layers stacked one upon another. Each of the marking layers encodes an <b>identification</b> <b>symbol</b> detectable using one or more sensing technologies. The various marking layers may comprise the same marking material or each marking layer may comprise a different medium having characteristics detectable by a different sensing technology. These sensing technologies include x-ray, radar, capacitance, thermal, magnetic and ultrasonic. A complete symbol may be encoded within each marking layer or a symbol may be segmented into fragments which are then divided within a single marking layer or encoded across multiple marking layers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{method of}} {{approximate}} channel identification is proposed {{that is based}} on a simplification of the correlation estimator. Despite the numerical simplification (no multiplications or additions are required, only comparisons and an accumulator), the performance of the proposed estimator is not significantly worse than that of the standard correlation estimator. A free (user selectable) parameter moves “smoothly ” from a situation with a small sum-squared channel estimation error but hard-toidentify channel peaks, to one with a larger sum-squared estimation error but easy-to-identify channel peaks. The proposed estimator is shown to be biased and its behavior is analyzed in a number of situations. Applications of the proposed estimator to sparsity <b>identification,</b> <b>symbol</b> timing recovery, and to the initialization of blind equalizers are suggested. I...|$|E
