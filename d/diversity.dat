5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans roughly 1500 to 2000years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early {{settlers}} quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as tavy), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000km2 (23,000sq mi). Today, the <b>diversity</b> and complexity of lemur communities increases with floral <b>diversity</b> and precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast, where precipitation and floral <b>diversity</b> are also at their highest. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their <b>diversity</b> has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17species in eight genera, known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most of the approximately 100species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E

True, power sharing is very essential to any accommodation of deep <b>diversities.</b> The goal {{of this paper is}} evaluate the system of power-sharing in Ethiopia in light of the Arend Lijphart’s theory of power sharing. It identifies power-sharing as the most fundamental conflict management strategy adopted to deal with <b>diversities.</b> The article argues that the Ethiopia’s power-sharing model, which is largely consociational, is less suitable to Ethiopia as compared to more centripetal model of power-sharing...|$|R
40|$|We have {{determined}} <b>diversities</b> exceeding 10 (12) different sequences in an annealing and melting assay using synthetic randomized oligonucleotides as a standard. For such high <b>diversities,</b> the annealing kinetics {{differ from those}} observed for low <b>diversities,</b> favouring the remelting curve after annealing as the best indicator of complexity. Direct comparisons of nucleic acid pools obtained from an aptamer selection demonstrate that even highly complex populations can be evaluated by using DiStRO, without the need of complicated calculations...|$|R
5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic <b>diversity</b> to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants that have a higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic <b>diversity</b> as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop <b>diversity</b> to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field <b>diversity</b> by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion planting.|$|E

40|$|Increased selfing and {{inbreeding}} and, consequently, depauperate genetic <b>diversities</b> {{are commonly}} expected for alien colonies. We compared RAPDs data for native (southern Europe) and alien (British Isles) populations of hoary mustard (Hirschfeldia incana). This species is normally out-breeding, {{but it is}} capable of self- fertilization. Contrary to the common expectations, genetic <b>diversities</b> in native and alien populations were similar, without any strong evidence of decreased levels of genetic <b>diversities</b> in alien populations. A variety of factors may have contributed to this observation, including high variation in founding groups, founders originating from multiple H. incana source populations, and high rates of past and/or current gene flow. A review of other studies showed that this pattern of similar genetic <b>diversities</b> in native and alien populations was not unusual but has been regularly observed in other invasive plant species...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a model for}} random-walking nodes on a periodic lattice, where the dynamic interaction network is defined from local interactions and E randomly-added long-range links.

If we apply this model to opinion dynamics, metastable states {{can be interpreted as}} sustainable <b>diversities</b> in our societies, and our result then implies that, while <b>diversities</b> decrease and eventually disappear with more long-range connections, another type of states of <b>diversities</b> can appear when networks are almost fully-connected.

25|$|Cooperative <b>diversity</b> is a {{cooperative}} multiple antenna technique for improving or maximising total network channel capacities {{for any given}} set of bandwidths which exploits user <b>diversity</b> by decoding the combined signal of the relayed signal and the direct signal in wireless multihop networks. A conventional single hop system uses direct transmission where a receiver decodes the information only based on the direct signal while regarding the relayed signal as interference, whereas the cooperative <b>diversity</b> considers the other signal as contribution. That is, cooperative <b>diversity</b> decodes {{the information from the}} combination of two signals. Hence, {{it can be seen that}} cooperative <b>diversity</b> is an antenna <b>diversity</b> that uses distributed antennas belonging to each node in a wireless network. Note that user cooperation is another definition of cooperative <b>diversity.</b> User cooperation considers an additional fact that each user relays the other user's signal while cooperative <b>diversity</b> can be also achieved by multi-hop relay networking systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diversity</b> coding {{techniques}} are used {{when there is}} no channel knowledge at the transmitter. In <b>diversity</b> methods, a single stream (unlike multiple streams in spatial multiplexing) is transmitted, but the signal is coded using techniques called space-time coding. The signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with full or near orthogonal coding. <b>Diversity</b> coding exploits the independent fading in the multiple antenna links to enhance signal <b>diversity.</b> Because there is no channel knowledge, there is no beamforming or array gain from <b>diversity</b> coding.|$|E
40|$|The {{democracy}} {{theory has}} renewed itself {{up to now}} with the suggested models {{that emerged in the}} face of social and political needs since ancient Greece. Nowadays, especially with post modernism paradigm effects, a new democracy need has been identified as a result of different identity demands.

New democracy model that has the potential to satisfy the needs emerged as a result of all kinds of <b>diversities</b> in accordance with post-modern approaches is radical democracy. In this article, ethnic, religious, cultural <b>diversities</b> in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and Middle East regions will be explained. Then, the relation between the democracy notion and differing needs will be taken into consideration. Finally, radical democracy will be focused in the theoretical context as a democracy proposal that will provide coexistence of all kinds of <b>diversities</b> by explaining new democratic paradigm needs...|$|R
