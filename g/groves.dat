5|$|In 2007 <b>Groves</b> {{was portrayed}} by Eric Owens in the Lyric Opera of Chicago's work Doctor Atomic. The opera follows Oppenheimer, <b>Groves,</b> Teller {{and others in}} the days {{preceding}} the Trinity test.

5|$|Brigadier General Leslie R. <b>Groves</b> Jr. became {{director}} of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited Berkeley to look at Lawrence's calutrons, and met with Oppenheimer, who gave him a report on bomb design on 8 October. <b>Groves</b> was interested in Oppenheimer's proposal to establish a separate bomb design laboratory. When they met again in Chicago a week later, he invited Oppenheimer to discuss the issue. <b>Groves</b> had to catch a train to New York, so he asked Oppenheimer to accompany him {{so that they could}} continue the discussion. <b>Groves,</b> Oppenheimer, and Colonel James C. Marshall and Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols all squeezed into a single compartment where they talked about how a bomb laboratory could be created, and how it would function. <b>Groves</b> subsequently had Oppenheimer come to Washington, D.C., where the matter was discussed with Vannevar Bush, the {{director of}} the OSRD, and James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). On 19 October, <b>Groves</b> approved the establishment of a bomb laboratory.|$|E

5|$|<b>Groves</b> and Parsons {{drafted a}} {{proposed}} organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to Eisenhower and Nimitz for approval in July 1947. <b>Groves</b> {{did not get}} everything that he asked for; he wanted a status {{equal to that of}} a deputy to the Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations, but the most that Eisenhower and Nimitz would allow was a status equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although <b>Groves</b> still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although <b>Groves</b> was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, <b>Groves</b> reported to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, who had worked on the Silverplate project during the war.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, <b>Groves</b> had {{met with}} J. Robert Oppenheimer, the University of California, Berkeley physicist, and {{discussed}} {{the creation of a}} laboratory where the bomb could be designed and tested. <b>Groves</b> was impressed with the breadth of Oppenheimer's knowledge. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced <b>Groves</b> and his deputy Kenneth Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area. These were features that <b>Groves</b> found lacking in other scientists, and he knew that broad knowledge would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics, but chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance and engineering.|$|E
50|$|A Black Methodist {{camp was}} founded in 1864 as Emory <b>Grove,</b> that predated Washington <b>Grove.</b> Less than a mile {{separated}} the two towns, {{and many of the}} residents of Emory <b>Grove</b> worked for the residents of Washington <b>Grove.</b> The superintendent of the Washington <b>Grove</b> grounds was a resident of Emory <b>Grove</b> named William A. Scott. Following an incident in 1892 where an Emory <b>Grove</b> native, Jessie Lancaster, ransacked homes in Washington <b>Grove,</b> William A. Scott was forced out. Subsequently, in 1897 the gates to Washington <b>Grove</b> were closed, thus preventing anyone from walking through Washington <b>Grove.</b> This closing severely hindered the ability of Emory <b>Grove</b> residents to reach the train stop {{on the other side of}} Washington <b>Grove.</b>|$|R
50|$|Union <b>Grove</b> is a {{township}} and unincorporated {{community in}} Iredell County, North Carolina, United States. At the 2000 census {{the population was}} 2069.

Within the Union <b>Grove</b> township is the Union <b>Grove</b> Milling Company, Union <b>Grove</b> School (formerly Union <b>Grove</b> elementary through high school), Union <b>Grove</b> Volunteer Fire House, and two Methodist churches.

5|$|The olive <b>groves</b> are {{no longer}} {{cultivated}} {{on the grounds of}} Beaumont House, but other notable additions by Davenport to the Romanesque style still remain.

5|$|Because the Manhattan Project was an Allied endeavor, <b>Groves</b> had {{to obtain}} {{permission}} from the British and American governments to publish the Smyth Report. A meeting was held on August 2, 1945 {{in the office of}} the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson. Accompanying Stimson were his two assistants, Harvey Bundy and George L. Harrison, and his military aide, Colonel William H. Kyle. <b>Groves,</b> Conant, and Tolman represented the Manhattan Project. James Chadwick, the head of the British scientific mission to the Manhattan Project, and Roger Makins from the British Embassy represented Britain. The meeting went on for two hours, as <b>Groves</b> and Conant sought to reassure Stimson that the report would not give vital secrets away to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{accounted}} for roughly 90 {{percent of the}} Manhattan Project's total cost. The day after <b>Groves</b> took over, he and Marshall took a train to Tennessee to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge. <b>Groves</b> was suitably impressed with the site, and steps were taken to condemn the land. Protests, legal appeals, and congressional inquiries were to no avail. By mid-November US Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.|$|E

He attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1935 and 1936, after which he was posted to Kansas City, Missouri, as assistant to the commander of the Missouri River Division.

5|$|In August 1943 Furman was put {{in charge}} of an {{intelligence}} effort formed by <b>Groves</b> in response to concerns raised by atomic bomb project scientists about the German nuclear energy project.

5|$|In December 1943, <b>Groves</b> sent Robert R.

5|$|Leslie Richard <b>Groves</b> Jr. {{was born}} in Albany, New York, on 17 August 1896, the third son of four {{children}} of a pastor, Leslie Richard <b>Groves</b> Sr., and his wife Gwen née Griffith. A descendant of French Huguenots who came to America in the 17th century, Leslie <b>Groves</b> Sr. resigned as pastor of the Sixth Presbyterian church in Albany in December 1896 to become a United States Army chaplain. He was posted to the 14th Infantry at Vancouver Barracks in Washington in 1897. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish–American War in 1898, Chaplain <b>Groves</b> was sent to Cuba with the 8th Infantry. On returning to Vancouver Barracks, he was ordered to rejoin the 14th Infantry in the Philippines; service in the Philippine–American War and the Boxer Rebellion followed. The 14th Infantry returned to the United States in 1901 and moved to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The family relocated to there from Vancouver, then moved to Fort Hancock, New Jersey, the next year, and returned to Vancouver in 1905. Chaplain <b>Groves</b> was hospitalized with tuberculosis at Fort Bayard in 1905. He decided to settle in southern California and bought a house in Altadena. His next posting was to Fort Apache, Arizona. The family spent their summers there and returned to Altadena where the children attended school.|$|E
