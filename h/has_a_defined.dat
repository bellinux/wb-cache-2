The Scoutmaster {{provides}} Troop Leadership Training (TLT) at the troop level. Youth leaders are encouraged to attend National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) at the council level and a select few may progress to National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience (NAYLE) at the national level. Those interested in staffing these courses may complete the Youth Staff Development Course (YSDC) at the regional level.|$|E

25|$|Senior auction is a {{variation}} on the all-pay auction, and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> loser in addition to the winner. The top two bidders must pay their full final bid amounts, and only the highest wins the auction. The intent is to make the high bidders bid above their upper limits. In the final rounds of bidding, when the current losing party has hit their maximum bid, they are encouraged to bid over their maximum (seen as a small loss) to avoid losing their maximum bid with no return (a very large loss).|$|E
25|$|Crystal habit {{refers to}} the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to {{describe}} this property. Common habits include acicular, which described needlelike crystals like in natrolite, bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in native copper), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.|$|E
25|$|VPg uridylylation {{may include}} the use of {{precursor}} proteins, allowing for the determination of a possible mechanism for the location of the diuridylylated, VPg-containing precursor at the 3â€™ end of plus- or minus-strand RNA for production of full-length RNA. Determinants of VPg uridylylation efficiency suggest formation and/or collapse or release of the uridylylated product as the rate-limiting step in vitro depending upon the VPg donor employed. Precursor proteins also have an effect on VPg-CRE specificity and stability. The upper RNA stem loop, to which VPg binds, has a significant impact on both retention, and recruitment, of VPg and Pol. The stem loop of CRE will partially unwind, allowing the precursor components to bind and recruit VPg and Pol4. The CRE loop <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> consensus sequence to which the initiation components bind, however; there is no consensus sequence for the supporting stem, which suggests that only the structural stability of the CRE is important.|$|E

2500|$|In {{probability}} and statistics, {{population mean}} and expected value are used synonymously {{to refer to}} one measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of the random variable characterized by that distribution. In {{the case of a}} discrete probability distribution of a random variable X, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and its probability P(x), and then adding all these products together, giving [...] An analogous formula applies to the case of a continuous probability distribution.

2500|$|Roger Wood, {{author of}} , said that [...] "determining exactly where to draw" [...] the {{boundaries}} of the Third Ward [...] "is not easily done" [...] due to the variety of opinions about what the Third Ward is. The redevelopment council <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> set of boundaries, with the Houston Belt & Terminal Railroad as the eastern boundary of the Third Ward area. Joe [...] "Guitar" [...] Hughes, a local musician, stated that the Third Ward's cultural southern boundary was Truxillo Street, regardless of any technical map divisions, due to the cultural division between the shotgun shack areas to the north and the houses to the south. According to Hughes, the eastern boundary is a low rent group of houses near Texas Southern University that he refers to as [...] "Sugar Hill." [...] Wood says that among area musicians, the Third Ward's boundaries are usually thought of as extending southward from the junction of Interstate 45 (Gulf Freeway) and Interstate 69/U.S. Route 59 (Southwest Freeway) to the Brays Bayou, with Main Street forming the western boundary.|$|E
2500|$|Kaohsiung's warm {{climate is}} very much {{dictated}} to its low latitude and its location with a year-round warm sea temperature, with the Kuroshio Current passing by the coasts of southern Taiwan, and the Central mountain range on the northeast blocking out the cool northeastern winds during the winter. The city therefore has a noticeably warmer climate than nearby cities located at similar latitudes such as Hong Kong, Guangzhou as well as various cities further south of northern Vietnam, such as Hanoi. But although the climate is classified as tropical, Kaohsiung <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> cooler season unlike most other cities in Asia classified with this climate but located closer to the equator such as Singapore or Manila. Daily maximum temperature typically exceeds [...] during the warmer season (April to November) and [...] during the cooler season (December to March), with the exception when cold fronts strikes during the winter months, when the daily mean temperature of the city can drop between [...] depending {{on the strength of}} the cold front. Also, besides the high temperatures occurring during the usual summer months, daytime temperatures of inland districts of the city can often exceed above [...] from mid March to late April before the onset of the monsoon season, with clear skies and southwesterly airflows. Average annual rainfall is around , focused primarily from June to August. At more than 2,210 hours of bright sunshine, the city is one of the sunniest areas in Taiwan.|$|E
