5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, Italian {{fishermen}} rescue {{an unconscious}} American (Matt Damon) floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, {{and when the}} man wakes, they find he suffers from <b>dissociative</b> <b>amnesia.</b> He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a safe deposit box in Zürich. Upon landing in Imperia (Italy), the man heads to the bank in Switzerland to investigate the deposit box. He finds it contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use {{the name on the}} American passport, Jason Bourne.|$|E
25|$|Traumatic {{events are}} more subjective. What is {{traumatic}} {{is dependent on}} what the person finds to be traumatic. Regardless, a traumatic event is an event where something so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress. A common example of amnesia that is caused by traumatic events is <b>dissociative</b> <b>amnesia,</b> which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them. An example would be a person forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones.|$|E
25|$|When {{acute stress}} {{disorder}} was introduced it was argued that {{its emphasis on}} dissociative symptoms in the acute phase after truama (such as emotional numbing, <b>dissociative</b> <b>amnesia,</b> and depersonalisation) are strongly predictive of chronic PTSD. Bryant's work challenged the fundamental premise of the initial conceptualisation that dissociative responses shortly after trauma are seminal in predicting PTSD, and {{this resulted in a}} major shift in the DSM-5 so that emphasis was not placed on dissociation and acute stress disorder was not intended to predict PTSD.|$|E
50|$|Although some <b>dissociative</b> {{disruptions}} involve <b>amnesia,</b> other <b>dissociative</b> events do not.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between traumatic experiences and dissociative phenomena in {{a large group of}} eating disorder patients (N = 98). Traumatic experiences were assessed by means of a self-report questionnaire and a clinical interview; dissociative experiences were assessed with the newly developed self-reporting Dissociation Questionnaire (DIS-Q). About 25 % of the patients reported to have experienced traumatic events in their personal life and this subgroup had significantly higher scores on the DIS-Q, compared with normal control subjects. About 12 % of our patient sample mentioned dissociative experiences to a degree as high as in a group of patients with <b>dissociative</b> disorders. <b>Amnesia</b> {{turned out to be the}} most specific characteristic in trauma-induced dissociation. These data suggest that trauma-induced dissociative experiences may play an important role in the development of a subgroup of patients with an eating disorder. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dissociative</b> or Psychogenic <b>Amnesia</b> {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with general amnesia, in which the sufferer is unable to recall whole periods of time, perhaps of several years' duration. In the dissociative version, there a disruption in recalling specific events, usually involving memories pertaining to the trauma itself. The disorder also relates to the person's emotional state while experiencing the trauma. While the person may be able to remember the verbal details of the events, the emotional and somatosensory sensations tied to the experience break down during the processing of the memory.|$|R
25|$|Past {{literature}} has suggested psychogenic amnesia can be 'situation-specific' or 'global-transient', the former referring to memory loss {{for a particular}} incident, and the latter relating to large retrograde amnesic gaps of up to many years in personal identity. The most commonly cited examples of global-transient psychogenic amnesia are 'fugue states', of {{which there is a}} sudden retrograde loss of autobiographical memory resulting in impairment of personal identity and usually accompanied by a period of wandering. Suspected cases of psychogenic amnesia have been heavily reported throughout the literature since 1935 where it was reported by Abeles and Schilder. There are many clinical anecdotes of psychogenic or <b>dissociative</b> <b>amnesia</b> attributed to stressor ranging from cases of child sexual abuse to soldiers returning from combat.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{symptoms}} such as poor {{memory and}} concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following ‘functional’ categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) “normal” cognitive symptoms that {{become the focus of}} attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith ‘normal’ but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde <b>dissociative</b> (psychogenic) <b>amnesia.</b> Other ‘non-dementia’ diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} “hysteria” {{comes from the}} Greek word “hystera” (uterus) and {{dates back to the}} time of Hippocrates, at least. Modern classifications differ {{regarding}} the area encompassed by the concepts of dissociation and conversion differ. Mental health professionals in the United States (DSM- 5) use a standard classification of mental disorders codifying dissociative disorders as a distinct class of disorders, but subsumes conversion disorders under “somatoform disorders”. The history of hysteria is as long as the history of mankind. Apparently, both the essence and mechanisms of dissociative disorders remain unchanged despite the fact that many years have passed. According to Owczarek et al., dissociative symptoms are caused by the malfunctioning of defence mechanisms and anxiety.

Emotional detachment, as well as dissociation or [...] "numbing out", can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Dissociation includes depersonalisation disorder, <b>dissociative</b> <b>amnesia,</b> dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, etc. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, cognitive and affective impairment.

40|$|Background: Dissociation – {{a pattern}} of general {{disruption}} in memory and consciousness – {{has been found to}} be an important cognitive component of children’s and adults coping with severe trauma. <b>Dissociative</b> experiences include <b>amnesia,</b> identity disturbance, age regression, difficulty with con-centration, and trance states. Stable individual differences in dissociative behaviors may represent a dissociative tendency trait that varies in the population independent of the influence of trauma. Method: In the current study, we examined genetic and environmental sources of variance in some of these behaviors by comparing 86 pairs of adoptive siblings and 102 pairs of full siblings from the Colorado Adoption Project (parents and teachers ratings), and 218 pairs of identical and 173 pairs of same-sex fraternal twins from the British Register for Child Twins (parents ratings). The study used a dissociation scale comprised of six CBCL items. Results: Developmentally, there was no change in mean dissociation scores across middle childhood and adolescence, and individual differences were moderately stable. Both parents and teachers ratings showed moderate to substantial amounts of genetic and nonshared environmental variance and negligible shared environmental variance, and most of the parent–teacher agreement in their ratings was accounted for by overlapping genetic vari-ance. Conclusions: The results support further research into possible genetic and environmenta...|$|R

2500|$|According to {{the fifth}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), DID {{symptoms}} include [...] "the presence {{of two or more}} distinct personality states" [...] accompanied by the inability to recall personal information, beyond what is expected through normal forgetfulness. Other DSM-5 symptoms include a loss of identity as related to individual distinct personality states, and loss referring to time, sense of self and consciousness. In each individual, the clinical presentation varies and the level of [...] functioning can change from severely impaired to adequate. [...] The symptoms of <b>dissociative</b> <b>amnesia</b> are subsumed under the DID diagnosis but can be diagnosed separately. Individuals with DID may experience distress from both the symptoms of DID (intrusive thoughts or emotions) and the consequences of the accompanying symptoms (dissociation rendering them unable to remember specific information). The majority of patients with DID report childhood sexual or physical abuse, though the accuracy of these reports is controversial. [...] Identities may be unaware of each other and compartmentalize knowledge and memories, resulting in chaotic personal lives. Individuals with DID may be reluctant to discuss symptoms due to associations with abuse, shame, and fear. DID patients may also frequently and intensely experience time disturbances.|$|E
2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is {{typically}} {{the result of}} physical or psychological trauma which manifests itself as the inability to remember information preceding the traumatic event. [...] It is usually accompanied by some type of anterograde amnesia, or inability to acquire new knowledge. Focal retrograde amnesia (FRA), sometimes known as functional amnesia, refers {{to the presence of}} retrograde amnesia while knowledge acquisition remains intact (no anterograde amnesia). Memory for how to use objects and perform skills (implicit memory) may remain intact while specific knowledge of personal events or previously learned facts (explicit memory) become inaccessible or lost. Amnesia can result from a number of different causes, including encephalitis, severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin B1 deficiency as seen in Korsakoff's Syndrome, and psychotic episodes, or by witnessing an emotionally traumatic event (<b>Dissociative</b> <b>amnesia).</b> Dysfunction of the temporal and frontal lobes have been observed in many cases of focal retrograde amnesia, whether metabolic or the result of lesions. However, this evidence only appears to correlate with the symptoms of retrograde amnesia as cases have been observed where patients suffering from minor concussions, showing no visible brain damage, develop FRA. It has been suggested that FRA could represent a variety of different disorders, cognitive deficits, or conditions that result in disproportionate loss of explicit memory, hence Disproportionate Retrograde Amnesia.|$|E
