5|$|After the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> {{demonstration}} and {{validation of the}} prototypes, on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the YF-22 as {{the winner of the}} ATF competition. The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster, while the YF-22 was more maneuverable. The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was also more adaptable to the U.S. Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E

5|$|Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an {{effective}} method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and expensive {{for the protection of}} civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may also be used for high-altitude parachute jumps.|$|E
5|$|Flight {{testing of}} the F-22 began in 1997 with Raptor 4001, the first EMD jet, and eight more F-22s would {{participate}} in the EMD and <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> program. Raptor 4001 was retired from flight testing in 2000 and subsequently sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) for survivability testing, including live fire testing and battle damage repair training. EMD F-22s {{have been used for}} testing upgrades, and also as maintenance trainers. The first production F-22 was delivered to Nellis AFB, Nevada, in January 2003.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the Army's contract, the XR-1 was returned to the company, Platt-LePage believing that the design had potential as a civilian aircraft. The planned civilian version, the PL-9, {{would have been an}} enlarged, twin-engined aircraft; however Platt-LePage was by now in serious financial difficulty following {{the cancellation}} of its Army contract, and in mid 1946 the XR-1's <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> program was concluded, the aircraft being retired to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

40|$|The {{philosophy}} of the design of air-to-air missiles and hence of <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> them for flutter {{differs from that of}} manned aircraft. Primary emphasis is put on analytical and laboratory evaluation of missile susceptibility to aeroelastic and aero-servo-elastic instabilities and uses <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> for confirmation of the absence of such instabilities. <b>Flight</b> <b>testing</b> for flutter is accomplished by using specially instrumented programmed missiles, air or ground launched with a booster to reach the extreme flight conditions of tactical use, or by using guided missiles with telemetered performance data. The instrumentation and testing techniques are discussed along with the success of recent <b>flight</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
5|$|Having {{been given}} top {{priority}} by the Air Force, the first <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> of the Bold Orion missile {{was conducted on}} May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched the Bold Orion vehicle {{at the apex of}} a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the missile itself, allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests were conducted by the 40th <b>Flight</b> <b>Test</b> Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E
5|$|In {{presence}} of then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was {{rolled out of}} the final assembly line on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes from Toulouse. The <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> programme took 1,200 hours on 530 flights, European Joint Aviation Authorities certification was delivered on 26 February 1988. The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March 1988.|$|E

5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much, particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the crew}} {{successfully}} completed all fifty-four {{of the planned}} mission test objectives. While the INSAT deployment was a success, the satellite had problems unfolding its solar array once in geostationary orbit, and was not fully operational {{until the middle of}} September. Once functional, however, it provided satisfactory service for seven years, returning 36,000 images of Earth and broadcasting television to thousands of remote Indian villages. The Payload <b>Flight</b> <b>Test</b> Article evaluation found that the Canadarm remote manipulator system was capable of moving bulky masses with some accuracy, to a precision of 5cm and one degree of alignment.|$|E
5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a <b>Flight</b> <b>Test</b> Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The <b>Flight</b> <b>Test</b> Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{statements}} in early 2009 that <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> of RocketMotorTwo was planned for later in 2009, no <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> {{took place in}} 2009, 2010 or 2011, and only glide flight tests—with the engine installed in SS2—occurred in 2012.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{installation}} of a new flight computer in 2010, the X-48B was to continue a new phase of <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> to investigate controllability aspects. [...] The second phase of <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> with the X-48B began in September 2010.|$|R
50|$|All of the NATO {{requirements}} {{had been}} withdrawn by April 1967. Research <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> continued with the Dornier Do 31 until {{the project was}} cancelled in 1970, VAK 191B <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> continued into the early 1970s until the aircraft were retired.|$|R
5|$|The Glider Pilot Scholarship (GPS) {{program is}} a six-week course with an {{intensive}} programme of ground school and in-flight glider pilot training.

Upon attaining their licences, these pilots join their local headquarters to provide other cadets with glider familiarization flying during the spring and fall seasons.|$|E
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In the first <b>flight</b> <b>test,</b> between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine {{had to be}} shut down shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> {{program was}} {{conducted}} using {{the pair of}} prototypes produced, which had been assigned the serial numbers 94-0327 and 95-0001. Following a demonstration {{of its ability to}} meet certain key criteria, on 1June2000, it was announced that the RAH-66 had entered the $3.1billion engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase of the program. Through the early 2000s, the U.S. Army maintained its plans for the intended purchase of over 1,200 Comanches, which were to fill both the scout helicopter and light attack roles; as late as 2003, it was being anticipated that deliveries of operational RAH-66s would commence as scheduled during 2006.|$|E
