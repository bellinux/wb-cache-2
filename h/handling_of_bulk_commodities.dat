50|$|SACOME {{believes}} that the growth of iron ore mining in South Australia has been limited by the state's lack <b>of</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>commodities</b> port infrastructure. In 2011, SACOME's CEO Jason Kuchel publicly supported the chosen location for a future 3 km iron ore export wharf at Port Bonython, northeast of Whyalla in South Australia's upper Spencer Gulf region.
