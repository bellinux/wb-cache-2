5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> <b>plate,</b> which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> <b>plate</b> also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E

500|$|A parting line, sprue, gate marks, and <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> marks {{are usually}} {{present on the}} final part. [...] None of these {{features}} are typically desired, but are unavoidable {{due to the nature}} of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and <b>ejector</b> <b>pin</b> marks result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.|$|R

The definitive version is available from [URL] or at: doi: 10. 1016 /S 0261 - 3069 (99) 00015 - 1 The AIM™ process {{has been used to}} successfully produce short runs of injection moulded parts. One of the main drawbacks of the process is the tendency of the tools to be damaged during part ejection 1. At De Montfort University a successful AIM™ moulding cycle has been developed in which simple shapes from polypropylene are produced and the ejection forces required are measured. Two different ejection methods are used; one uses conventional <b>ejector</b> <b>pins</b> and the other uses a conformal ejector pad. The tool surface roughness is measured before and after moulding to observe any changes caused by ejection. Results show that <b>ejector</b> <b>pins</b> require a lower ejection force than a conformal ejector pad and this may contribute to longer tool life for the AIM™ process. Possible reasons for the results are discussed along with recommendations for further work...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{works is}} focused on design and fabrication of an automatic injection moulding tool for production of CAM BUSH which is used in electrical engines as a connector. An injection mould is a tool which is used for production of plastic components in large numbers in a short span of time. The moulding tool consists of the Top plate, Cavity plate, Core plate, Spacer blocks, Ejector plate and the Bottom plate. In this work, six core <b>pins</b> and six <b>ejector</b> <b>pins</b> are provided on injection mould because the required cam bush has six indexing holes. The material, Oil Hardened Non-shrinking Steel(OHNS) for the core and cavity, EN 353 for the guide pillar, guide bushes, core <b>pins,</b> <b>ejector</b> <b>pins,</b> locator ring and the sprue bush and Mild Steel for other plates are selected. The elements of injection moulding tool have been designed, fabricated and assembled. Submarine gate and Baffle circular hole cooling system has been provided in the moulding tool to increase the productivity and good surface finish. The required Nylon- 66 Cam bush component is produced with this moulding tool by properly controlling the various parameters of injection moulding machine...|$|R
