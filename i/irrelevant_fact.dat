He sustains vigorously the thesis, which {{in the last few}} years has gained increasing currency, that the courts have shown too great a dependence upon the executive, particularly in making their judgements as to the capacity of foreign governments to sue as to the legal effect to be given to laws and administrative acts of such governments, depend upon the <b>irrelevant</b> <b>fact</b> of the political recognition or non-recognition of these governments by the executive of the forum.

40|$|After a long {{season in}} which the need for {{reordering}} the justice system resulted in multiple decriminalising laws, the persisting need for renovating the penal system seems to require something different than mere radical elision of penal sanctions, that is, of the instruments through which {{the response of the}} penal system should be adjusted to the peculiarity of the typified act in its concrete realisation. We wanted, therefore, to assess, in the first place, whether in the logic of a penal system inspired to the principle of necessary harmfulness, whereby the crime shall consist of harm to a legal good, significant margins of functioning of the penal irrelevance of the fact were possible. The study of the irrelevance clauses already established in our penal system, in juvenile trial and in the proceedings before the justice of the peace, together with the solutions adopted in other European systems, allowed us to develop a critical analysis of the new cause of exclusion of punishability for particular triviality of the fact, as introduced in the penal code. The legislator located the new cause of non-punishability in a context certainly characterised by harmfulness, save the following punitive waiver by the judge. The triviality of the criminal fact is therefore assumed as criterion of selection, on a concrete level, of facts not deserving to be penalized. The research, therefore, moved on to the analysis of the several "indexes of triviality" that characterise the fact as petty, in both the objective and subjective element. We noticed then how the "threads" of petty crimes and of the <b>irrelevant</b> <b>fact</b> are intertwined, precisely, in the logic of introducing in the penal system instruments to individuate in the lesser concrete seriousness of criminal offences the reason for giving up the application of a sanction through mechanisms of extinction of punishability. The research, also through a comparative approach, has been further extended to the exam of the influence of post-factum reparatory behaviours on the harmful dimension of crime, coming to detect in the practically inexistent consideration of such behaviours, the most lacking element of the present law. A missed occasion to pave the way to a conciliatory and reparative penal justice conceived as the most advanced frontier for an adequate response to crimes of low and medium seriousness, capable of remedying the penal inflation and of giving appropriate value to a gradualist conception of crime, {{as well as to the}} dimension of penal "triviality". ...|$|E
40|$|The author {{emphasizes}} the importance of understanding of the term »Style« for the art theory and preservationist’s praxis. The »style« is an abstraction derived from the individual, since only individual monuments really exist and problems arise when inadequate style cateogries intrude themselves upon the interpretation of monuments, which should not happen. In such cases it is usually disregarded that there are two style levels: the morphologic and the structural one. A number of monuments of the past is a »blanding« of two or more styles, and three variants thereof are characteristic: (1) a successive changing of style {{in the course of the}} nascent stage of the work of art; (2) a simultaneous action of two (or more) stylistic currents in the forming stage, and (3) a chronologically inverse style relationship – when a stylistically more progressive (»younger«) master builder is succeeded by another, not abreast the times, stylistically retarding (»order«) master. The bell tower of the Trogir cathedral (begun in the Romanesque style and completed in five stages, ending with mature Renaissance) is a paradigmatic example of (1), while the ancient Dubrovnik Custom House (»Divona«) is an example of (2), and the Dubrovnik Palace of the Rectors is an example of (3). In the polemics between Ljubo Karaman, who was adherent of the idea of »succession of styles« and CviRenaissance elements in the Dubrovnik Custom House appeared simultaneously, but also coined the term of »Gothico-Renaissance transition style« in Dalmatia of the second half of the 15 th and of the beginning of the 16 th century as an organic and complete stylistic expression. The genesis of that style sees Fisković in the Palace of Dubrovnik Rectors. Both of the two mentioned scholars gave their opinions with regard to the Šibenik Cathedral, classifying George the Dalmatian as a »late Gothic« master. Pleading for a correction of that deep-rooted classification, the author directs attention to the fact that the relationship of stylistic categories as regards the Šibenik Cathedral is much more complicated, since in its apsis, built by George the Dalmatian, Gothic and Renaissance characteristics parallelly appear as early as 1441. The one-sided definition of George the Dalmatian as a late-Gothic master is first of all due to Karaman’s interpretation, in which the attention centered not on George’s architecture but on decoration, although D. Frey, basing on the structural analysis, gave an excellent definition of George’s Gothico-Renaissance work as early as 1913. Frey’s opinion, however, that »the amount of Renaissance elements is insignificant« is too much restrained, since five important early Renaissance elements were introduced by George in the structures of Baptistry and apsis of the Šibenik Cathedral during the fifth decade of the 15 th century: a semicircular arch, a cannulated niche, a cannulated pilaster, fluted shells (semicircular and circular) and a bay-wreath. The cannulated niches and shells dominate in such a way that thCathedral, newly built by master George. Supposing that the project should have been complated in 1441, and the analyzes the master’s method of composition »outwards from within« and emphasizes that, in the Baptistry, the Renaissance style dominates ihe intermingling of these two styles is characteristic. The key for the understanding of the characteristic capriciousness of the master’s work may be found in the ceiling where a Renaissance bay wreath is covered by a Gothic band. The structural analysis, however, is more important than the morphological one, since on the level of style as strucure George the Dalamtian reveals himself as an early Renaissance master. By the analysis of the architectural design the author arrives to the conclusion that the Baptistry was designed as a central structure basing on a square and circle, which is typically Renaissance. It results, from the logic of the design, that the space should have been defined by a dome, which master George, locking space, solved in an »illusionistic« way, by perspectively narrowing the groins. By the analysis of chronology of the Renaissance architecture, the author concludes that before master George left italyt in 1441, barely ten odd Renaissance structures had been completed (Alberti did not realize by then any of the works, and most of Bruneleschi’s works, including the Pazzi Chapel, were still under construction) so that everything that bears the early Renaissance characteristic in George’s work is synchronous with the earliest works of the pioneers of the Renaissance. The »blended Gothico-Renaissance style« however, ist not a phenomenon limited to Dalmatia only, nor to the master George’s work. It has a wider signification in the European Renaissance. A blended style is revealed by works of the indisputably »Renaissance« master such as Michelozzo, even by those created before George left: the façade of St. Augustine Church at Montepulciano and the Brancacci Chapel in Naples. For the interpretation of a monument is more important to visualize its real existence in space, not abstractly separated in photographs and books: Nani di Banco and Donatello have placed their early Renaissance sculptures in Gothic niches of the Campanile and Or san Michele in Florence – why could not master George do the ssme with his sculptures? It is an <b>irrelevant</b> <b>fact</b> for the onlooker that this blending of styles – Gothic and Renaissance – came as a succession in space. Finally, the terms »Florentine Renaissance« and »Venetian late Gothic« should be more critically used: master George could have received Gothic stimuli in Florence and Renaissance ones in Venice. The florid late Gothic decorations of the Šibenik Baptistry have much in common with the »Trecento« arches etc. of the Or san Michele in Florence, while the problems of Renaissance perspective and illusionism probably has master The Renaissance component of master George’s design of the Šibenik Cahtedral may be noticed not only in the design, but also in morphology and solutions of perspective, which is particularly evident in the innovation of iconography. Instead of representing the scene of baptism (a medieval sheme founded as early as in the 6 th century A. D.), master George solves the space of the Baptistry as a scene: God the Father and the Holy Ghost are represented surrounded by angels the vault, but nowhere there is Christ, who is personified by every nowborn baby being christened in the water of the basin (signifying the Jordan River), while the bishop plays the part of John the Baptist. The baptism of Christ is the prefiguration of each baptism, but this substitution of the divine figure with a human one is hardly to be imagined in the freeing of sculptures from the architecture (the three putti group) not so interpreted before. Basing on a detailed analysis, the author concludes: (1) George Matejev the Dalmatian, architect and sculptor, was the founder of the »blended« Gothico-Renaissance style in Dalmatia. (2) The first practical application of the »blended« Gothico-Renaissance style in Dalmatia was the Baptistry of the Šibenik Cathedral built during the fifth decade of the 15 th century (the time and place of the appearance of this double style is thus shifted from the Rector’s Palace and the seventh decade of the 15 th century to the Cathedral Baptistry and the fifth decade of that century, i. e. to the first half of the Quattrocento. (3) The »blended« Gothico-Renaissance style is an important conception for the European Renaissance: it is one of the forms of existence of early=Renaissance architecture in general, worthy examples whereof are S. Maria del Fiore, Campanile, and Or san Michele in Florence. The blending of the Gothic and Renaissance morphology appeared in the first half of the 15 th century in a series of buildings, either as »succession« (Donatello’s sculptures on the Campanile and Or sam Michele) or »simultaneous« a s in the case of Michelozzo. (4) Although the Baptistry of the Šibenik Cathedral morphologically belongs to the »blended« Gothico-Renaissance style, according to his method of treating problems of design and solving the questions of form, his innovations in iconography and placing sculpture in space, its author, George Matejev the Dalmatian is an early Renaissance architect and sculptor, and should be placed among the first generation of those »Quattrocento« artists who created and developed the system of the new style. (5) The Baptistry of the Šibenik Cathedral, as well as the whole design of the Cathedral is a pioneer accomplishment of the European early Renaissance architecture in the fifth decade of the 15 th century, when only a few structures in the »pure« Renaissance style were erected. (6) The Cathedral in Šibenik – the Dalmatian city that not even symbolically is indebted to the Roman tradition for its mediaeval urbanity, since it was founded by the Croatian King Petar Krešimir in the 11 th century – was designed by the master George, a Slav, encouraged and donated exclusively by the Croatian nobility and citizens, and it in no way belongs to a »porvincial« or »peripheral« art, but represents the first monument by which the Renaissance in Croatia became part of the European Renaissance art, not in a passive form of taking over, but in the genuine crative sense...|$|E

Even if effective algorithms are available to estimate HHMM parameters from sequences, little {{has been done in}} order to automatize the construction of the model architecture. The primary focus of this paper is on a multi-strategy algorithm for inferring the HHMM structure from a set of sequences, where the events to capture are present in a relevant portion of them. The algo-rithm follows a bottom-up strategy, in which elementary facts in the sequences are progressively grouped, thus building the abstraction hierarchy of a HHMM, layer after layer. In this process, clustering algorithms and sequence alignment algorithms, widely used in do-mains like molecular biology, are exploited. The induction strategy has been designed {{in order to deal with}} events characterized by a sparse structure, where gaps filled by <b>irrelevant</b> <b>facts</b> can be inter-mixed with the relevant ones. <b>Irrelevant</b> <b>facts</b> are modeled by ”gaps”, i. e., HMMs of the noise.

30|$|The {{notion of}} {{relevancy}} {{provides a good}} way of narrowing down the definitions. Cartwright (1989 : 187) and McMullin (1985 : 258) both argue that abstraction only occurs in cases where <b>irrelevant</b> <b>facts</b> about the system under study are omitted. We can see links here as well to one of the meanings of abstraction identified by Saitta and Zucker (2013), through the link to the retention of relevant information, and by extension, the omission of irrelevant information. Jones (op. cit.: 190) alters this perspective slightly, by arguing that the term can refer to the omission of relevant factors, but only in cases where this occurs on some idealised basis, that is, factors that seem irrelevant in the model, whereas in the real case they are not. With these subtleties in mind, this work will define one facet of abstraction as the omission of irrelevant information, but not in cases where this amounts to an explicit misrepresentation of the system (which would be called an idealisation).|$|R

40|$|Turkey's {{spontaneous}} settlements (gecekondus) house {{half the}} urban population and face infrastructure deficiencies that reduce {{quality of life}} and economic productivity while increasing the vulnerability of the urban poor. This article reports on research that used the new institutional economics to examine the formal and informal institutional frameworks for infrastructure provision in gecekondus. In theory, formal rules should create incentives that produce behaviour. However, a key finding was that rules are generally <b>irrelevant.</b> In <b>fact,</b> in the absence of credible formal rules, pressures arise that help shape informal rules which then result in behaviour. This has important implications for both institutional theory and daily practice. ...|$|R

This thesis investigates how an assisted annotation process can help and explores the hypothesis that it is only with respect to full-text publications that a system can tell relevant and <b>irrelevant</b> <b>facts</b> apart by studying their frequency. A semi-automatic annotation process was developed for a particular database - the Nuclear Protein Database (NPD), based on a set of full-text articles newly annotated with regards to subnuclear protein localisation, along with eight lexicons. The annotation process is carried out online, retrieving relevant documents (abstracts and full-text papers) and highlighting sentences of interest in them. The process also offers a summary Table of the facts found clustered by type of information. Each method involved in each step of the tool is evaluated using cross-validation results on the training data as well as test set results. The performance of the final tool, called the “NPD Curator System Interface”, is estimated empirically in an experiment where the NPD curator updates the database with pieces of information found relevant in 31 publications using the interface. A final experiment complements our main methodology by showing its extensibility to retrieving information on protein function rather than localisation. I argue that the general methods, the results they produced and the discussions they engendered are useful for any subsequent attempt to generate semi-automatic database annotation processes. The annotated corpora, gazetteers, methods and tool are fully available on request of the author (catherine. canevet@bbsrc. ac. uk) ...|$|R
40|$|Astronomy is {{becoming}} a forgotten science, which is evident by its relatively low enrollment figures compared to biology, chemistry, and physics. A portable inflatable planetarium brings relevance back to astronomy and offers support to students and educators by simulating realistic astronomical environments. This study sought to determine if learning is improved in an inflatable planetarium by adhering to the design principles of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML), specifically the coherence principle, in an authentic classroom. Two groups of 5 th grade students of similar ability were purposefully assigned using a 1 -teacher-to-many-students format with mean lesson lengths of 34 minutes. The experimental group was differentiated with seductive details, defined as interesting but <b>irrelevant</b> <b>facts</b> that can distract learning. The control group (n = 28), with seductive details excluded, outperformed the experimental group (n = 28), validating the coherence principle and producing a Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s effect size of medium practical significance (d = 0. 4). These findings suggest that CTML, when applied to planetarium instruction, does increase student learning and that seductive details do {{have a negative effect}} on learning. An adult training project was created to instruct educators on the benefits of CTML in astronomy education. This study leads to positive social change by highlighting astronomy education while providing educators with design principles of CTML in authentic settings to maximize learning, aid in the creation of digital media (astronomical simulations/instructional lessons for planetariums) and provide valuable training for owners of inflatable planetariums with the eventual goal of increasing student enrollment of astronomy courses at the local level...|$|R
