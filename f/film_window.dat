40|$|Solutia Performance Films, {{utilizing}} {{funding from}} the U. S. Department of Energy's Buildings Technologies Program, completed research to develop, validate, and commercialize a range of cost-effective, low-emissivity energy-control retrofit <b>window</b> <b>films</b> with significantly improved emissivity over current technology. These films, sold under the EnerLogic® trade name, offer the energy-saving properties of modern low-e windows, with several advantages over replacement windows, such as: lower initial installation cost, a significantly lower product carbon footprint, {{and an ability to}} provide a much faster return on investment. EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>films</b> also offer significantly greater energy savings than previously available with <b>window</b> <b>films</b> with similar visible light transmissions. EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>films</b> offer these energy-saving advantages over other <b>window</b> <b>films</b> due to its ability to offer both summer cooling and winter heating savings. Unlike most <b>window</b> <b>films,</b> that produce savings only during the cooling season, EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>film</b> is an all-season, low-emissivity (low-e) film that produces both cooling and heating season savings. This paper will present technical information on the development hurdles as well as details regarding the following claims being made about EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>film,</b> which can be found at www. EnerLogicfilm. com: 1. Other <b>window</b> <b>film</b> technologies save energy. EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>film's</b> patent-pending coating delivers excellent energy efficiency in every season, so no other film can match its annual dollar or energy consumption savings. 2. EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>film</b> is a low-cost, high-return technology that compares favorably to other popular energy-saving measures both in terms of energy efficiency and cost savings. In fact, EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>film</b> typically outperforms most of the alternatives in terms of simple payback. 3. EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>film</b> provides unparalleled glass insulating capabilities for <b>window</b> <b>film</b> products. With its patent-pending low-e technology, EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>film</b> has the best insulating performance of any film product available. The insulating power of EnerLogic® <b>window</b> <b>film</b> gives single-pane <b>windows</b> the annual insulating performance of double-pane windows - and gives double-pane windows the annual insulating performance of triple-pane windows...|$|R

50|$|First teased in April 2016, The Silver Case HD Remaster is a high-definition {{remake of}} The Silver Case. Co-developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and Active Gaming Media, {{it is set}} for a {{worldwide}} digital release in Autumn 2016 for Microsoft Windows through Steam and Playism, {{in addition to other}} unspecified platforms. Active Gaming Media approached Suda about localizing the game in 2014, several years after the DS port was cancelled. Having been keen to release The Silver Case overseas, Suda agreed to the collaboration, acting as producer for the project: Active Gaming Media handled the high-definition assets and localization, while Grasshopper Manufacture acted as general supervisor and supplied the original assets. The remaster was developed using the Unity 5 game engine, so porting to multiple platforms would be simplified. While updating the original version's engine, its age made such an approach impractical. According to the programmer Yuki Yamazaki, while some algorithms such as those related to videos and scene changes were completely redone, others such as the <b>film</b> <b>window</b> system were kept as intact as possible to maintain the original atmosphere. The main problem with the port was that the original source code had been lost, so the audio data needed to be extracted from the PlayStation disc version using a converter. The localization was directed by Douglas Watt, while the main translator was James Mountain. Suda felt that Mountain took the majority of the load during the game's difficult translation and localization process.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{understand}} the transpiration rate of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce and select appropriate packaging material for regulating moisture and minimising condensation inside the package. Experiments were conducted by conditioning the sample at 2, 6 and 10 °C and 76, 86, 96 and 100 % RH. TR was recorded during 7 days of storage. Packaging design optimization (with a cellulose-based <b>film</b> <b>window</b> on polymeric film) was performed using TR predicted at temperature of 6 °C and 98 and 99 % of RH, respectively, in order to establish the desired WVTR of packaging materials. TR ranged from 0. 04 to 2. 36 g kg− 1 h− 1 over all the combinations of temperature and RH tested. Based on package design optimization both pure materials (polymer or cellulose-based) didn't satisfy WVTR requirement for fresh-cut iceberg lettuce. Among combined packages, the use of a surface ratio between 5 % and 15 % could prevent moisture condensation inside the package. Results from validation experiment confirmed the goodness of the package design procedure and showed that the package film with 15 % of cellulose <b>film</b> <b>window</b> area on polymeric film {{was the only one that}} prevent water vapour condensation inside the package and avoid an excessive weight los...|$|E

30|$|With {{the concern}} of device {{reliability}} for high temperature measurement, we provided our referred experiments with high-energy lasers, whose heat focusing on the junction is enough to offset the thermal dissipation. Figure 2 c shows our Pd-Cr TFTC devices made on a 400 -nm-thick freestanding Si 3 N 4 thin <b>film</b> <b>window.</b> The Pd-Cr TFTC made with the same process parameter of Pt-Cr TFTC {{was used to measure}} the Medical laser by our teammates, instead of Pt-Cr TFTC, and significant results were referred here to confirm the high temperature reliability of this type device [47]. With irradiation at the focal point of a 79  mW (power), 785  nm (wavelength) laser for 2  s, two Pd-Cr junctions were burnt (highlighted with white arrows). At the meantime, the device showed an output peak near 50  mV. By using our calibration results obtained at room temperature which was around 20  μV/K, this represents a nominal peak temperature of ~[*] 2400  K, as shown in Fig. 2 d. But 2400  K is higher than the melting point of the Pd film, 1825  K. We attributed this error to a changing Seebeck coefficient of Pd and Cr at high temperatures. Nevertheless, our results indicated that our TFTC sensors made on Si 3 N 4 thin <b>film</b> <b>window</b> were applicable for measuring local temperatures up to a value close to the melting points of the metallic stripes, i.e., 1800  K.|$|E
30|$|We {{showed that}} TFTC on a {{freestanding}} Si 3 N 4 thin <b>film</b> <b>window</b> {{resulted in an}} enhanced sensitivity {{by a factor of}} 10 – 30 times, and we showed that a 1 -μm-wide TFTC sensor had a sensitivity higher than that of a 5 -μm-wide TFTC by a factor of five times. This is because thick substrate and wide leads both dissipated a large amount of local heat. For precise measurement of local surface temperature at the nano- and micro-scales, ideally one should fabricate TFTC sensors as small as possible, and make them on thermal isolation layers, such as freestanding Si 3 N 4 thin film windows or Parylene layers.|$|E
40|$|The surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) {{technique is}} a well-known optical method {{that can be used}} to measure the refractive index of organic nano-layers adsorbed on a thin metal film. Although there are many configurations for measuring biomolecular interactions, SPR-based techniques play a central role in many current biosensing experiments, since they are the most suited for sensitive and quantitative kinetic measurements. Here we give some results from the analysis and numerical elaboration of SPR data from integrated optics experiments in a particular borosilicate glass, chosen for its composition offering the rather low refractive index of 1. 4701 at 633 nm wavelength. These data regard the flow over the sensing region (metal window) of different solutions with refractive indexes in the range of interest (1. 3 ÃƒÂ· 1. 5) for the detection of contaminants in aqueous solutions. After a discussion of the principles of SPR, of the metal window design optimization by means of optical interaction numerical modeling, and of waveguide fabrication techniques, we give a description of system setup and experimental results.

40|$|AbstractBoron-doped (p-type) μc-Si:H thin <b>film</b> <b>window</b> layers {{are widely}} used in silicon thin film solar cell {{fabrication}} due to their low optical absorption and high doping efficiency compared with their amorphous counterparts.

To investigate {{the influence of the}} type of substrate, p layers are deposited onto planar glass and textured glass (bare or coated with ZnO:Al thin film). The crystalline volume fraction (crystallinity) and conductivity of the deposited p layers are measured to characterise the films’ properties. We find that by increasing the number of hydrogen plasma treatment steps and their duration, the films’ crystallinity and electrical properties improve strongly. We also find that the substrate surface roughness strongly influences the film properties.
