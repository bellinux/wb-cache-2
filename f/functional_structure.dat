25|$|Adaptationist {{perspectives}} on religious belief suggest that, like all behavior, religious behaviors are {{a product of}} the human brain.

Like other organs and tissues, this <b>functional</b> <b>structure</b> should be universally shared amongst humans and should have solved important problems of survival and reproduction in ancestral environments. However, evolutionary psychologists remain divided on whether religious belief is more likely a consequence of evolved psychological adaptations, or is a byproduct of other cognitive adaptations.|$|E

25|$|Movement on {{appendages}} is {{the most}} common form of terrestrial locomotion, it is the basic form of locomotion of two major groups with many terrestrial members, the vertebrates and the arthropods. Important aspects of legged locomotion are posture (the way the body is supported by the legs), the number of legs, and the <b>functional</b> <b>structure</b> of the leg and foot. There are also many gaits, ways of moving the legs to locomote, such as walking, running, or jumping.|$|E
25|$|As a whole, a {{functional}} organization is best suited {{as a producer}} of standardized goods and services at large volume and low cost. Coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in a <b>functional</b> <b>structure,</b> which makes producing {{a limited amount of}} products or services efficient and predictable. Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost. For instance, a small business could make components used in production of its products instead of buying them.|$|E

40|$|The nuclei {{of growing}} spermatocytes in Drosophila hydei and D. neohydei are {{characterized}} {{by the appearance of}} phase-specific, paired, loop-shaped structures thought to be similar to the loops in lampbrush chromosomes of amphibian oocytes. In X/O-males of D. hydei spermatogenesis is completely blocked before the first maturation division. No spermatozoa are formed in such testes. In the nuclei of X/O-spermatocytes, paired loop formations are absent. This shows the dependence of these chromosomal <b>functional</b> <b>structures</b> upon the Y chromosome. The basis of this dependence could be shown through an investigation of males with two Y chromosomes. All loop pairs are present in duplicate in XYY males. This proves that the intranuclear formations are structural modifications of the Y chromosome itself. These <b>functional</b> <b>structures</b> are species-specific and characteristically different in Drosophila hydei and D. neohydei. Reciprocal species crosses and a backcross showed that the spermatocyte nuclei of all hybrid males possess the <b>functional</b> <b>structures</b> corresponding to the species which donated the Y chromosome. This shows that the morphological character of the <b>functional</b> <b>structures</b> is also determined by the Y chromosome...|$|R
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, a geographically based command-and-control system was considered outmoded, and calls came to replace it with a system based on function. Bostock, who found the area boundaries [...] "arbitrary", proposed a <b>functional</b> <b>structure</b> consisting of operational, maintenance, and training commands. With hindsight, the area commands were judged adequate for the organisation of the Air Force {{in the early years of}} World WarII, but not for the rapid response times and concentration of force necessary to properly prepare for attacks on Australia following the start of the Pacific War, nor for conducting offensive operations from 1943 onwards. [...] Air Marshal Jones, who had retained his position as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) following the war, resisted pressure to replace the area structure. He was persuaded by his staff to set up a conference to discuss the possibility of change, but participation by the CAS, who had been satisfied with the wartime system, and the area commanders themselves, whose positions were on the line, was half-hearted at best. Jones did suggest reducing the number of area commands to three (Northern Area to cover Queensland and the Northern Territory, Eastern Area to cover New South Wales, and Southern Area to encompass Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania) as part of a much larger proposal to restructure the post-war RAAF, but this never eventuated.|$|E

These are the external dimensions of the sefirot, describing their functional roles in channelling the Divine, creative Ohr (Light) to all levels. As the sefirot are viewed to comprise both metaphorical [...] "lights" [...] and [...] "vessels", their structural role describes the particular identity each sefirah possesses from its characteristic vessel. Underlying this <b>functional</b> <b>structure</b> of the sefirot, each one possesses a hidden, inner spiritual motivation that inspires its activity. This forms the particular characteristic of inner light within each sefirah.|$|E

40|$|Most {{retinitis}} pigmentosa (RP) mutations arise in rodÂ photoreceptor genes, leading to diminished peripheral and nighttime vision. Using a pig model of autosomal-dominant RP, we show glucose becomes sequestered in the {{retinal pigment epithelium}} (RPE) and, thus, is not transported to photoreceptors. The resulting starvation for glucose metabolites impairs synthesis of cone visual pigment-rich outer segments (OSs), and then their mitochondrial-rich inner segments dissociate. Loss of these <b>functional</b> <b>structures</b> diminishes cone-dependent high-resolution central vision, which is utilized for most daily tasks. By transplanting wild-type rods, to restore glucose transport, or directly replacing glucose in the subretinal space, to bypass its retention in the RPE, we can regenerate cone <b>functional</b> <b>structures,</b> reactivating the dormant cells. Beyond providing metabolic building blocks for cone <b>functional</b> <b>structures,</b> we show glucose induces thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) to regulate Akt signaling, thereby shunting metabolites toward aerobic glucose metabolism and regenerating cone OS synthesis...|$|R

2500|$|According to Lutz (1993), while AMC had {{its share}} of problems, it was far from being a bunch of [...] "brain-dead losers". He {{describes}} the [...] "troops" [...] at AMC as more like the Wake Island Marines in battle, [...] "with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy, they were able to roll out an impressive succession of new products". After first reacting with anger to the purchase, Chrysler managers soon anticipated the benefits. To further solidify the organizational competencies held by AMC, Lee Iacocca agreed to retain former AMC units, such as engineering, completely intact. In addition, AMC's lead engineer, FranÃ§ois Castaing, was made head of all engineering at Chrysler. In an unthinkable strategic move, Castaing completely dismantled the entrenched Chrysler groups. In their place AMC's [...] "platform team" [...] was implemented. These were close-knit cross-functional groups responsible for the whole vehicle, as contrasted with Chrysler's highly <b>functional</b> <b>structure.</b> In this capacity, Castaing's strategy was to eliminate the corporate administrative overhead bureaucracy. This move shifted corporate culture and agitated veteran executives who believed that Chrysler's reputation as [...] "the engineering company" [...] was being destroyed. Yet, according to the popular press, by the 1980s Chrysler's reputation was totally shot, and in Lutz's view only dramatic action was going to change that. In summary, Chrysler's purchase of AMC laid the critical foundation to help re-establish a strategy for its revival in the 1990s.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{preceding}} cases {{we have found}} Lepidoptera imitating other species of the same order, and such species only as we {{have good reason to}} believe were free from the attacks of many insectivorous creatures; but there are other instances in which they altogether lose the external appearance of the order to which they belong, and take on the dress of bees or wasps--insects which have an undeniable protection in their stings. The SesiidÃ¦ and Ã†geriidÃ¦, two families of day-flying moths, are particularly remarkable in this respect, and a mere inspection of the names given to the various species shows how the resemblance has struck everyone. We have apiformis, vespiforme, ichneumoniforme, scoliÃ¦forme, sphegiforme (bee-like, wasp-like, ichneumon-like, &c.) and many others, all indicating a resemblance to stinging Hymenoptera. In Britain we may particularly notice Sesia bombiliformis, which very closely resembles the male of the large and common humble bee, Bombus hortorum; Sphecia craboniforme, which is coloured like a hornet, and is (on the authority of Mr. Jenner Weir) much more like it when alive than when in the cabinet, from {{the way in which it}} carries its wings; and the currant clear-wing, Trochilium tipuliforme, which resembles a small black wasp (Odynerus sinuatus) very abundant in gardens at the same season. It has been so much the practice to look upon these resemblances as mere curious analogies playing no part in the economy of nature, that we have scarcely any observations of the habits and appearance when alive of the hundreds of species of these groups in various parts of the world, or how far they are accompanied by Hymenoptera, which they specifically resemble. There are many species in India (like those figured by Professor Westwood in his [...] "Oriental Entomology") which have the hind legs very broad and densely hairy, so as exactly to imitate the brush-legged bees (Scopulipedes) which abound in the same country. In this case we have more than mere resemblance of colour, for that which is an important <b>functional</b> <b>structure</b> in the one group is imitated in another whose habits render it perfectly useless.|$|E

These requirements specify underlying <b>functional</b> <b>structures</b> in courtroom floors, which affect the form and layout of the courthouse building. It is the purpose of this research to identify these <b>functional</b> <b>structures</b> in order to discover commonalities between them and establish them as functional genotype. The research proceeded by selecting twenty-five courtroom floors in different courthouses, and through archival and architectural analysis, the research identified underlying <b>functional</b> <b>structures.</b> The research found that within the analyzed sample 16 courtroom floors adhered to a typical genotype while others followed slightly varied genotypes. It was concluded that courtroom floors adhere to a generic genotype with regard to accessibility and pattern of circulation. Future investigation can investigate how these genotypes can be realized in different geometrical arrangements and accordingly can be used in the design of future courthouses...|$|R
