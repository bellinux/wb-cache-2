40|$|A {{method for}} obtaining a high-contrast visible-light signal from {{infrared}} absorption in low-absorbance samples is described. This method {{is based on}} a beam-fanning optical limiter in photorefractive BaTiO 3. The resulting signal is not linear but does exhibit an enhanced signal-to-background ratio that is 4 to 6 orders of magnitude better than that of conventional <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrophotometry</b> in the shot-noise limit. A simple model for the beam-fanning, optical-limiter-based, pulsed-laser-excited photothermal spectroscopy detector is found to describe the experimental data adequately. This technique using photothermal spectroscopy detection may have advantages for rapid signal analysis and for two-dimensional visible imaging of infrared absorption...|$|E

The resulting powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction, <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrophotometry,</b> transmission electron micrographs and surface area. The X-ray diffraction revealed that there was formation of a pure crystalline phase, consisting only of anatase for all conditions of synthesis.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit potential (OCP) tests, which were performed on SAE 1020 carbon steel plates coated with epoxy and ZnO_NPs/PPy, have shown that epoxy paints have their efficiency as anticorrosive coatings significantly improved when ZnO_NPs/PPy hybrid nanocomposites are added to them...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} {{to reveal the}} {{substance}} {{as the source of}} offensive odor of the fish from the sea facing petroleum and petrochemical industries, analyses have been made on the sea water, industrial wastes, offensive odor fish meat and the eels kept in the sea or industrial waste for a certain period, by means of gas chromatography, <b>infrared,</b> and ultraviolet <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrophotometries</b> and mass-spectrometry. Observations revealed toluene as a possible main source responsible for the bad smelling of the fish. Finally, by analysing the meat extract of the fish kept in the sea water containing toluene and by the same smell as that of the offensive odor fish from the off-shore of the industries, it has been definitely confirmed that toluene is the very substance that imparts the offensive odor to fish. The activated sludge process proved to be an effective method to remove toluene from the industrial wastes. A discussion was made on the aliphatic carbohydrate as the possible source of the offensive odor of fish. </p...|$|R

40|$|Nanocrystalline TiO 2 was {{synthesized}} by controlled hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide. The anatase {{phase was}} converted to rutile phase by thermal treatment at 1023 K for 11 h. The catalysts {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Fourier-transform <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrophotometry</b> (FT-IR) and N 2 adsorption (BET) at 77 K. This study compare the photocatalytic activity of the anatase and rutile phases of nanocrystalline TiO 2 for the degradation of acetophenone, nitrobenzene, methylene blue and malachite green present in aqueous solutions. The initial rate of degradation was calculated to compare the photocatalytic activity of anatase and rutile nanocrystalline TiO 2 for the degradation of different substances under ultraviolet light irradiation. The higher photocatalytic activity was obtained in anatase phase TiO 2 for the degradation of all substances as compared with rutile phase. It is concluded that the higher photocatalytic activity in anatase TiO 2 is due to parameters like band-gap, number of hydroxyl groups, surface area and porosity of the catalyst...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} different gamma irradiation doses on PEGd,lPLA and PEG-PLGA multiblock copolymers. The behaviour of the multiblock copolymers to irradiation was {{compared to that of}} PLA, PLGA polymers. PEGd,lPLA, PEG-PLGA, PLA and PLGA polymers were irradiated by using a 60 Co irradiation source at 5, 15, 25 and 50  kGy total dose. Characterization was performed on all samples before and after irradiation, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrophotometry</b> (FTIR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The effect of gamma irradiation on polymer stability was also evaluated. Results of NMR and FTIR suggest an increase in -OH and -COOH groups, attributed to scission reactions induced by irradiation treatment. Data of GPC analysis showed that the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of polymer samples decreased with increasing irradiation dose. The extent of Mw degradation expressed as percentage of Mw reduction was more prominent for polymers with high molecular weight as PEGd,lPLA and PLA. The dominant effect of gamma-irradiation on both polymer samples was chain scission. The multiblock copolymer PEGd,lPLA presented higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment with respect to PLA, likely due to the presence of PEG in the matrix. The effect of gamma irradiation continues over a much longer period of time after gamma irradiation has been performed. It is suggested that the material reacts with oxygen to form peroxyl free radicals, which may further undergo degradation reactions during storage after irradiation...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{the authors}} have {{experienced}} the autopsy of a female victim who died of organophosphorus pesticide intoxication. Therefore, {{for the purpose of}} clarifying the dead cause, we carried out the separation and identification of organophosphorus pesticide from the specimens such as the stomach contents, cardiac blood and urine of this cadaver and further the measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity in the blood. The results were as follows. 1. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the serum and erythrocytes. The serum and erythrocytes were separated by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm and subjected to the assay of acetylcholinesterase activity on the basis of Pilz's method. Acetylcholinesterase activities were 0. 312 μAq in the erythrocytes and 0. 078 μAq in the serum, respectively. These values abruptly lowered in comparison with those in the serum and erythrocytes of healthy human adults and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity was clearly observed. 2. Separation and identification of organophosphorus pesticide Unknown organophosphorus pesticide was first extracted from the stomach contents, cardiac blood and urine with ethanol according to Stas-Ott's method and then the crude materials purified by use of both the silicagel column and thin-layer chromatographies. Subsequently the qualitative analysis of organophosphorua pesticide was undertaken by means of ρ-nitrophenol and Averell-Norris color reactiton, ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry, <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrophotometry,</b> thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography.
