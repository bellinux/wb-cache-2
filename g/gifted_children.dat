5|$|Responsibility for {{educational}} supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual federal states. Optional kindergarten education is provided {{for all children}} between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years. Secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the Gymnasium enrols the most <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> and prepares students for university studies; the Realschule for intermediate students lasts six years and the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education. The Gesamtschule unifies all secondary education.|$|E

Meanwhile, Marge attempts to stimulate Bart with a little culture by taking the family to the opera. However, this proves disastrous as Bart and Homer are quite disruptive, much to Lisa's joy. Ostracized by his brilliant classmates, Bart visits his former school, where his old friends reject {{him because of his}} perceived intelligence. On the bright side, he enjoys newfound attention from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another attempt to stimulate Bart's brain by taking them to a film festival. After Bart's chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Dr. Pryor that he switched tests with Martin. Dr. Pryor realizes that he was never a genius and has him readmitted to Springfield Elementary.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made {{reform of the}} Arkansas {{education}} system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for <b>gifted</b> <b>children,</b> vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E
5|$|The Mozart family grand {{tour was}} {{a journey through}} western Europe, {{undertaken}} by Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria, and their musically <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> Maria Anna (Nannerl) and Wolfgang Amadeus from 1763 to 1766. At {{the start of the}} tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{presents a}} case study of a <b>gifted</b> <b>child</b> under six years old entering a school. The aim is to identify the positive and negative aspects of a child's adaptation to school. My project focuses on the following research questions: 1. How a child under six years old adapts to a social group in the first class? 2. How does a child under six years old manage the demands of learning in the first class? To this purpose, I record the personality traits and social manifestations of the <b>gifted</b> <b>child</b> and relate them to the school teaching. Furthermore, I monitor the child's adaptation to the new environment, school work, teacher and peers. In the given case study, I observed the child in the classroom during the period September to December 2011 (in total 30 teaching hours) and conducted interviews with the classroom teacher, <b>gifted</b> <b>child,</b> and his parents. The data were processed qualitatively using grounded theory approach. The obtained findings were further analysed and confronted with the scientific literature. Data analysis showed that the observed child managed the learning requirements well and that his case resulted in successful premature training. The research also showed that the <b>gifted</b> <b>child</b> under six years old adapts well to the first grade social group, despite some minor [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1990 This {{investigation}} {{determines the}} extent to which Vocational Guidance for junior secondary gifted pupils is effectively administered in the Transvaal. Authoratative literature on Vocational Guidance for the <b>gifted</b> <b>child</b> serves as theoretical background. The characteristics, needs and developmental possibilities of the <b>gifted</b> <b>child</b> are investigated in terms of a vocational guidance programme. The function of the home, school and "world of work" regarding the <b>gifted</b> <b>child's</b> vocational education and guidance are considered. The emphasis, however, is placed {{on the role of the}} school, and in particular the role of the Head of Department: Educational Guidance; subject teachers and the Educational Advisor: Vocational matters. In the empirical investigation, a questionnaire was completed by Heads of Department: Educational Guidance, in a number of Afrikaans-medium and double-medium Secondary Schools. The SAS computer programme is applied to determine the average of the responses for each question. The results of the investigation indicate that certain aspects of the existing Vocational Guidance programme are effective. There are however, a number of areas what deserve more attention, and possibly need to be revised. For the Vocational Guidance programme to be really effective, the existing programme needs to be implemented maximally, while comprehensive involvement of a committed teaching staff is essential. It is important to consider the latest developments regarding the vocational education of the <b>gifted</b> <b>child</b> In order to revise the present programme periodically. Master...|$|R

25|$|There is a {{constant}} public debate about tracking students by ability into several types of secondary school (i.e. Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule). Opponents of streaming by ability claim that streaming is unfair, that parents from higher socio-economic groups are more effective in sending children of similar aptitude to higher-level schools (Gymnasium). Proponents of streaming claim that it limits income segregation {{between rich and poor}} areas, as wealthier parents in poor neighborhoods may still send their <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> to a fairly good public school due to streaming, giving them less motivation to move to a wealthier area. They also say that potential access to a Selective school would allow <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> of lower-class parents living in poor neighborhoods better educational opportunities than if they were confined to schools with the average pupil population of their neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 National Conference on Education also {{recognized}} the importance of special education, in the form of programs for <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> and for slow learners. <b>Gifted</b> <b>children</b> were allowed to skip grades. Slow learners were encouraged to reach minimum standards, although those who did not maintain the pace seldom reached the next stage. For the most part, children with severe learning problems and those with handicaps and psychological needs were the responsibilities of their families. Extra provisions were made for blind and severely hearing-impaired children, although in 1984 special schools enrolled fewer than 2 percent of all eligible children in those categories. The China Welfare Fund, established in 1984, received state funding and had the right to solicit donations within China and from abroad, but special education has remained a low government priority.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. (Subject Didactics) It is {{important}} that allowances {{be made for the}} Mathematics gifted pupil, who is seen as the problem solver of the future. Mathematics gifted pupils, on the average, use half their time to work thoroughly through the average syllabus and achieve 90 % plus. The average subject teacher does not always have the necessary time for the gifted pupil. He is thus left to his own devices. The lack of facilities, sufficient qualified teachers, support from like-minded people, stimulating opportunities, resource centres and other stimulating factors add further to the pupils' frustrations. Enrichment of syllabi is seen {{as one of the most}} prominent provisional possibilities for the <b>gifted</b> <b>child.</b> The reason for this is found in the fact that the <b>gifted</b> <b>child</b> does not constitute even 5 % of the population. They are kept mainly in the mainstream and are in no way identified as a group for any type of special educational need, like acceleration.
