Since the late 19 th century it is known, that bloodsucking insects can serve as vectors of pathogens, causative agents of many infection diseases. As climate change, the distribution and abundance of arthropods including bloodsucking insects can be affected.

In recent years, several vector- borne diseases affecting humans and domestic animals have (re) emerged and spread in Europe with major health, ecological and socio-economical consequences.

Here output from a new, dynamic disease model [the Liverpool RVF (LRVF) model], driven by downscaled, bias-corrected climate change data from an ensemble of global circulation models from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project run according to two radiative forcing scenarios [representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5], is combined with results of a spatial assessment of social vulnerability to the disease in eastern Africa. The combined approach allowed for analyses of spatial and temporal variations in the risk of RVF {{to the end of the}} current century. Results for both scenarios highlight the high-risk of future RVF outbreaks, including in parts of eastern Africa to date unaffected by the disease. The results also highlight the risk of spread from/to countries adjacent to the study area, and possibly farther afield, and the value of considering the geography of future projections of disease risk.

40|$|Crimean Congo {{hemorrhagic fever}} virus (CCHFV) {{is one of}} the most severe viral zoonozes. It is {{prevalent}} throughout Africa, Asia and southern Europe. Limited availability of sequence data has hindered phylogeographic studies. The complete genomic sequence of all three segments of 14 Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strains isolated from 1958 - 2000 in Russia, Central Asia and Africa was identified. Each genomic segment was independently subjected to continuous Bayesian phylogeographic analysis. The origin of each genomic segment was traced to Africa about 1, 000 - 5, 000 years ago. The virus was first introduced to South and Central Asia in the Middle Ages, and then spread to China, India and Russia. Reverse transfers of genomic segments from Asia to Africa were also observed. The European CCHFV genotype V was introduced to Europe via the Astrakhan region in South Russia 280 - 400 years ago and subsequently gradually spread westward in Russia, to Turkey and the Balkans less than 150 years ago. Only a few recombination events could be suggested in S and L genomic segments, while segment reassortment was very common. The median height of a non-reassortant phylogenetic tree node was 68 - 156 years. There were reassortment events within the European CCHFV lineage, but not with viruses from other locations.

In general, human cases are related to direct contact with sick cattle {{but there is a}} lack of {{information}} about human-to-human transmission of VACV during BV outbreaks. In this study, we epidemiologically and molecularly show a case of VACV transmission between humans in São Francisco de Itabapoana County, Rio de Janeiro state. Our group collected samples from the patients, a 49 -year-old patient and his son. Our results showed that patients had developed anti-OPV IgG or IgM antibodies and presented neutralizing antibodies against OPV. The VACV isolates displayed high identity (99. 9 %) and were grouped in the same phylogenetic tree branch. Our data indicate that human-to-human VACV transmission occurred during a BV outbreak, raising new questions about the risk factors of the VACV transmission chain.

In this study a total number of 87 spleen samples of wild ruminants carcasses from Central Italy, and 77 Ixodes ricinus collected from the same dead animals were screened for Anaplasma phagocytophilum by using Real Time PCR.

40|$|AbstractRickettsia felis is an <b>emerging</b> <b>zoonosis,</b> causing flea-borne {{spotted fever}} (FBSF). Serological {{diagnosis}} is typically confounded by cross-reactivity with typhus group rickettsiae and {{prior to the}} development of specific serological methods, cases of FBSF in Australia were misdiagnosed. Patient sera tested between August 2010 and December 2013 and known to be seropositive to R. typhi by immunofluorescence antibody testing (IFAT) were subsequently retested against R. felis using an R. felis-specific IFAT. Sera of 49 patients were of a sufficient quality to be included in re-analysis. A classification of FBSF and murine typhus (MT) was attributed to fourteen and seven patients respectively, based on a minimum four-fold higher antibody titre to R. felis than to R. typhi and vice versa. Twenty-eight patients were classified as indeterminate for either R. felis or R. typhi (antibody titres within two-fold of one another). Historically, it is likely that Australian patients clinically ill with FBSF were misdiagnosed. It is important that medical practitioners consider FBSF as part of their differential diagnoses, and obtain relevant history with regard to patient's exposure to domestic pets and their fleas. Australian microbiology diagnostic laboratories should include serological testing for R. felis as part of the diagnostic panel for febrile diseases.

40|$|Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an <b>emerging</b> viral <b>zoonosis</b> that is {{responsible}} for devastating outbreaks among livestock and is capable of causing potentially fatal disease in humans. Studies have shown that upon infection, certain viruses have the capability of utilizing particular cellular signaling pathways to propagate viral infection. Activation of p 53 is important for the DNA damage signaling cascade, initiation of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and transcriptional regulation of multiple genes. The current study focuses on the role of p 53 signaling in RVFV infection and viral replication. These results show an upregulation of p 53 phosphorylation at several serine sites after RVFV MP- 12 infection that is highly dependent on the viral protein NSs. qRT-PCR data showed a transcriptional up-regulation of several p 53 targeted genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation following RVFV infection. Cell viability assays demonstrate that loss of p 53 results in less RVFV induced cell death. Furthermore, decreased viral titers in p 53 null cells indicate that RVFV utilizes p 53 to enhance viral production. Collectively, these experiments indicate that the p 53 signaling pathway is utilized during RVFV infection to induce cell death and increase viral production...|$|R

We describe a probable third congenital case of babesiosis in a 26 -day-old infant; transmission was determined {{on the basis}} of a blood smear from the infant (15 % parasitemia) and serologic results from the infant and mother. Victor Babes first described the pathogen of babesiosis in 1888 (1). Babesiosis is a tick-borne malaria-like illness transmitted by the same Ixodes spp. ticks that transmit Borrelia burgdorferi (2). It is endemic to the northeastern and northwestern United States and also occurs in Europe and parts of Asia. Babesiosis is an intraerythrocytic parasitic infection that ranges from subclinical to severe (possibly fatal) disease with fever, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Appropriate antimicrobial drug therapy, transfusion, and exchange transfusion remain the mainstays of treatment. Babesiosis occurs rarely among neonates, although it is gaining increasing attention as an <b>emerging</b> tick-borne <b>zoonosis.</b> In 1987, Esernio-Jenssen et al.

40|$|Background: Human monocytotropic {{ehrlichiosis}} is an <b>emerging</b> life-threatening <b>zoonosis</b> {{caused by}} obligately intracellular bacterium, Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensis is transmitted by {{the lone star}} tick, Amblyomma americanum, and replicates in mononuclear phagocytes in mammalian hosts. Differences in the E. chaffeensis transcriptome in mammalian and arthropod hosts are unknown. Thus, we determined host-specific E. chaffeensis gene expression in human monocyte (THP- 1) and in Amblyomma and Ixodes tick cell lines (AAE 2 and ISE 6) using a whole genome microarray. Methodology/Principal Findings: The majority (, 80 %) of E. chaffeensis genes were expressed during infection in human and tick cells. There were few differences observed in E. chaffeensis gene expression between the vector Amblyomma and non-vector Ixodes tick cells, but extensive host-specific and differential gene expression profiles were detected between human and tick cells, including higher transcriptional activity in tick cells and identification of gene subsets that were differentially expressed in the two hosts. Differentially and host-specifically expressed ehrlichial genes encoded major immunoreactive tandem repeat proteins (TRP), the outer membrane protein (OMP- 1) family, and hypothetical proteins that were 30 – 80 amino acids in length.
