5000|$|In calcium {{chloride}} transformation, the cells are prepared by chilling {{cells in the}} presence of [...] (in [...] solution), making the cell become permeable to plasmid DNA. The cells are incubated on ice with the DNA, and then briefly heat-shocked (e.g., at 42 °C for 30-120 seconds). This method works very well for circular plasmid DNA. Non-commercial preparations should normally give 106 to 107 transformants per microgram of plasmid; a poor preparation will be about 104/μg or less, but a good preparation of competent cells can give up to ~108 colonies per microgram of plasmid. Protocols, however, exist for making supercompetent cells that may yield a transformation efficiency of over 109. The chemical method, however, usually does not work well for linear DNA, such as fragments of chromosomal DNA, probably because the cell's native exonuclease enzymes rapidly degrade linear DNA. In contrast, cells that are naturally competent are usually transformed more efficiently with linear DNA than with plasmid DNA. The transformation efficiency using the [...] method decreases with plasmid size, and electroporation therefore may be a more effective method for the uptake of large plasmid DNA.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the amounts of fluoride and aluminum released from different restorative materials stored in artificial saliva and <b>double-distilled</b> <b>water.</b> Material and METHODS: Cylindrical specimens (10 x 1 mm) were prepared from 4 different restorative materials (Kavitan Plus, Vitremer, Dyract Extra, and Surefil). For each material, 20 specimens were prepared, 10 of which were stored in 5 mL artificial saliva and 10 of which were stored in 5 mL of <b>double-distilled</b> <b>water.</b> Concentrations of fluoride and aluminum in the solutions were measured using ion chromatography. Measurements were taken daily for one week and then weekly for two additional weeks. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range tests (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: The highest amounts of both fluoride and aluminum were released by the resin-modified glass ionomer cement Vitremer in <b>double-distilled</b> <b>water</b> (p< 0. 05). All materials released significantly more fluoride in <b>double-distilled</b> <b>water</b> than in artificial saliva (p< 0. 05).

No significant difference in the number of lesions was noted between the two groups. However, the lesions in group 1 animals were significantly larger than those in group 2 animals. These results suggest that, given this mucosally pathogenic strain of C. albicans, the establishment of a chronic infection of the rat tongue is apparently not influenced by tetracycline-treated drinking water as administered in this study.

In the aforementioned technique, this method aims to determine {{the diameter of the}} reduced core and show the evolution of the two different processes from the nanofiber regime to the fixed regime in which the mode was remote from the surrounding evanescent field, intensity can propagate outside the segment fiber when the core diameter is less than 500 nm.

40|$|Groundwater arsenic {{contamination}} {{has emerged}} as a major health threat to {{millions of people around the}} world. Studying the sorption process of As(III) and As(V) onto ferric hydroxide gel is important to understand the mobilization of arsenic under non-oxidizing conditions. Most of the previous adsorption studies were limited to single element or multi-element equilibrium in syn-thetic water. To investigate the effect of matrix and speciation in real groundwater systems, adsorption tests with added As(III) and As(V) separately and in mixture were conducted in both <b>double-distilled</b> deionized <b>water</b> (DDDW) and As-safe (< 3 µg L- 1) tubewell water. In DDDW, the As(III) /As(V) ratio in the mixture strongly influenced the sorption behaviour by shifting the adsorption edge and also the efficiency. For As(III) and As(V) mixture in 1 : 1 proportions in tubewell water, the adsorption of both the species decreased up to pH 8; in the alkaline ranges the adsorption extent was marginally increased in comparison to that in DDDW. When As(III) :As(V) was added in 3 : 1 proportions in tubewell water, the adsorption of both was enhanced in alkaline ranges compared to that in DDDW. When As(V) was predominant [As(V) :As(III) = 3 : 1] in tubewell water, no significant changes were observed for As(V), though adsorption of As(III) was notably retarded. The statistical analysis of the results indi-cates the concentration ratio of As species in the system has a definite impact on adsorption behaviour onto ferric hydroxide gel.

40|$|The stimuli used in taste {{research}} are usually {{considered to be}} odourless.

In the first experiment elderly and young subjects rated the intensity and pleasantness of three concentrations of the stimuli, while wearing or not wearing a noseclip. Saliva production was also measured. Blocking olfaction only influenced salivation for umami. It reduced taste intensity ratings, but as in an earlier experiment with the same compounds in food products, this effect was stronger in the young, who also liked the stimuli better wearing the noseclip. In the second experiment, another group of young people tried to detect the odours of the tastants dissolved in demineralized, <b>double-distilled</b> or Evian <b>water.</b> A considerable number of subjects could regularly detect seven of the ten tastants by olfaction {{and the extent to which}} they did correlated significantly with the reduction in taste intensity ratings for the different tastants found in the first experiment.

40|$|Industry surveys {{indicated}} {{that up to}} 16 percent of pork is pale, soft, and exudative (PSE); which has reduced functionality. Recently, the cost of sodium phosphates (SP) has escalated. SPs are used to improve water holding capacity (WHC), increase pH, and retard lipid oxidation. Alkaline non-meat ingredient addition could improve PSE pork functionality and replace SP in pork products. The objective was to examine effects of alkaline solutions on pH, color, WHC, and texture of PSE and normal pork gels. Normal (pH 5. 6 - 5. 9) and PSE (pH ? 5. 4) loins were obtained and homogenized. Treatment solutions were: no added solution (control); <b>double-distilled</b> deionized <b>water</b> (ddW); 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 pecent(w/v) SP; and 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 M potassium bicarbonate (PB), sodium bicarbonate (SB), potassium carbonate (PC), or sodium carbonate (SC). PSE gels had lighter color, lower pH, WHC, and cook yields, and higher TPA values than normal gels. Control and ddW gels had lower pH, and higher L*, a*, and b* values. As treatment levels increased, gels had higher pH, and lower L*, a*, and b* values. SP gels had lower pH, WHC, cook yields, and higher L*, a*, b*, and TPA values compared to PB, SB, PC, and SC gels. PC and SC gels had higher cook yields than normal control gels and PB and SB gels were intermediate. For both meat types, TPA values improved for PB and SB gels compared to normal control gels, but {{did not differ from}} SP gels. As levels of PC and SC increased, gels were softer, less cohesive, chewy, and lower in work 2 than other gels. Cooked PSE gels treated with 0. 2 or 0. 3 M PC or SC were less red and yellow and had cook yields that surpassed normal control and ddW gels. Normal and PSE gels treated with 0. 2 or 0. 3 M PC or SC did not differ in TPA measurements for hardness and work. PSE pork functionality was improved with PC or SC addition to be similar to or higher than normal samples.
