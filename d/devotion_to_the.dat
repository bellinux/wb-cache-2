5|$|Unlike the Veerashaiva {{movement}} which preached <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> god Shiva with an {{insistence on}} a classless society and had its {{inspiration from the}} lower classes of society, the haridasa movement started from the higher echelons and preached <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> god Vishnu in a more flexible caste-based society, eventually becoming popular among the common people. The beginnings of the haridasa tradition {{can be traced to}} the Vaishnava school of Dvaita philosophy pioneered by Madhvacharya. Its influence on Kannada literature in the early 14th century is seen in the earliest known compositions written by Naraharitirtha, a prominent disciple of Madhvacharya.|$|E
5|$|According to {{accounts}} from his life, he preached {{the importance of}} realization of the self, and criticized love towards perishable things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> God and guru. He {{stressed the importance of}} surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> historical, {{theological}} and spiritual links in Catholic <b>devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. <b>Devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two hearts are {{key elements of}} Catholic teachings, and terms such as Holy Heart, Agonizing Heart and Compassionate Heart have also been used in devotions.|$|R

5|$|In Catholicism, {{there has}} been a long {{tradition}} of veneration of the heart, stemming from worship of the wounds of Jesus Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century.

5|$|It is an energetic, free-spirited breed. Even {{though it}} is a gundog, it is also kept as a {{companion}} dog because of its easy-going nature and <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cause.

Russian Spaniels are trainable, can make a good watchdog, and are amiable with children.|$|E
5|$|Some relics, such as purported {{remnants}} of the Crown of Thorns, receive only a modest number of pilgrims, while the Shroud of Turin (which is associated with an approved Catholic <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Face of Jesus), has received millions, including popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.|$|E

5|$|For {{his work}} in Basutoland, Clarke drew praise from the {{economist}} John A. Hobson in his treatise Imperialism for his <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> education {{and development of the}} native people, while Viscount Bryce noted that his approach fostered goodwill amongst native people towards Britain. In Zululand, Clarke granted considerable authority and special judicial functions to the hereditary chiefs; and was commended by Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, for his action in the face of potential famine. He recommended to the Imperial Government the return from exile of Dinuzulu, the paramount chief. While in Southern Rhodesia, he was appointed to protect the interests of native people against the overarching ambitions of the British South Africa Company.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} {{incidents}} {{in the order of}} their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past.

5|$|Sai Baba {{encouraged}} his devotees to pray, chant God's name, {{and read}} holy scriptures.

He advised his devotees and followers to lead a moral life, help others, love every living being without any discrimination, and develop two important features of character: <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Guru (Sraddha) and waiting cheerfully with patience and love (Saburi). He criticised atheism.|$|E

50|$|Anglican <b>devotions</b> <b>to</b> Mary include <b>the</b> Anglican Rosary (similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Catholic rosary), votive candles, and pilgrimages to Walsingham and Lourdes.

5000|$|Although various <b>devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> face of Jesus {{have been}} practiced, the term [...] "Holy Face of Jesus" [...] as used today only relates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{specific}} <b>devotions</b> approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1895 and Pope Pius XII in 1958 in regards <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{image from the}} Shroud of Turin.|$|R
5|$|Teresa Cristina {{had grown}} to be {{a vital part of}} PedroII's family life and routine. She never filled the roles of romantic lover or {{intellectual}} partner, however.

She continued to appear with the Emperor in public, and he continued to treat her with respect and consideration. She was not rejected or slighted, but the relationship had changed. Pedro II treated her more as a close friend and companion than as a wife.|$|E
5|$|The earlier Saxon Kings were {{assigned}} a gold cross {{on a blue}} shield, but this did not exist until the 13th century. The arms of Saint Edward the Confessor, a blue shield charged with a gold cross and five gold birds, {{appears to have been}} suggested by heralds in the time of Henry III of England (Boutell, 18) based on a coin minted in Edward's reign (Neubecker, 30). These arms were later used by Richard II of England out of <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> saint (Fraser, 44).|$|E
5|$|With the British {{colonization}} of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies {{that would become}} the United States of America were established. All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ancient rights of Englishmen {{and a sense of}} self-government stimulating support for republicanism. With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed. The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.|$|E

2500|$|... how to {{understand}} {{not only how}} but why this [...] <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> Christ came into being both when and where it did, along with its corollary <b>devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist and <b>to</b> Mary; how {{to understand}}, in other words, both the making {{and the meaning of}} this new thing—if, in fact, it was a new thing and not simply a becoming visible of something already there (as Southern suggested it might be).|$|R
5|$|A major {{development}} of this period {{that would have a}} profound impact on Kannada literature even into the modern age was the birth of the Haridasa ("servants of Hari or Vishnu") movement. This devotional movement, although reminiscent in some ways of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12thcentury (which produced Vachana poetry and taught <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> god Shiva), was in contrast intimately devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme God. The inspiration behind this movement was the philosophy of Madhvacharya of Udupi. Naraharitirtha (1281) is considered the first well-known haridasa and composer of Vaishnava devotional songs in Kannada. Before his induction into the Madhva order, he had served as a minister in the court of Kalinga (modern Orissa). The Vaishnava poetry however disappeared for about two centuries after Naraharitirtha's death before resurfacing as a popular form of folk literature during the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire. Only three of Naraharitirtha's compositions are available today.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, apart from his <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sagrada Família, Gaudí participated only in minor {{projects}} which were not completed: in 1916, on the death of his friend bishop Josep Torras i Bages, he designed a monument in his honour, which he wanted to place in front of the Passion facade of the Sagrada Família. He made a sketch of the project, which ultimately was not carried out, and made a plaster bust of the bishop, the work of Joan Matamala under the instruction of Gaudí. It was put in the Sagrada Família, where it would have formed part of the church, but it was destroyed in 1936. Another commemorative monument project, also not carried out, was dedicated to Enric Prat de la Riba, which would have been situated in Castellterçol, birthplace of this Catalan politician. The project dates from 1918, and would have consisted of a tall tower with two porticos and a spire topped with an iron structure flying the Catalan flag. The sketch of the project was done by Lluís Bonet i Garí, Gaudí's assistant.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, the Transvaal {{government}} promulgated a new Act compelling {{registration of}} the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (<b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth), or nonviolent protest, {{for the first}} time. The idea of nonviolence was ultimately bolstered when Gandhi {{was inspired by a}} letter written to Tarak Nath Das by the Russian pacifist Leo Tolstoy on 14 December 1908, which introduced Gandhi to the ancient Indian moral literature of the Tirukkural. He urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. Gandhi's ideas of protests, persuasion skills and public relations had emerged. He took these back to India in 1915.|$|E
5000|$|Enheduanna {{has left}} behind a corpus of {{literary}} works, definitively ascribed to her, that include several personal <b>devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> goddess Inanna {{and a collection of}} hymns known as the [...] "Sumerian Temple Hymns" [...] (certain texts not ascribed to her might also be her works). This makes her first named author in world history.|$|R
25|$|Christians {{not only}} attach {{theological}} significance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> works of Jesus, {{but also to}} his name. New Testament Scriptures requisite the name of Jesus as <b>the</b> only way <b>to</b> be saved. <b>Devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> name of Jesus go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earliest days of Christianity. These exist today both in Eastern and Western Christianity—both Catholic and Protestant.|$|R
25|$|But <b>the</b> early <b>devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> saint {{were not}} limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} countries. In {{the sixth century}} Saint George as the Martyr of Cappadocia began to grow in popularity among Greek Egyptians and <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> spread <b>to</b> other parts of Europe. By the sixth century Saint George had become the ideal Christian knight. In the seventh and eighth centuries stained glass windows in churches across Europe depicted him.|$|R
5|$|The baby drifts downriver to {{a village}} of the Nelwyn (dwarves). She comes into the care of Willow Ufgood, a kind farmer and conjurer who hopes to become a real sorcerer; his wife Kiaya and his {{children}} {{fall in love with}} the baby immediately, and Willow too soon grows to love her as one of his own. During a town festival, the village is attacked by a Nockmaar hound which is quickly killed by the village warriors. The High Aldwin, the village sorcerer, learns about the baby and selects Willow, due to his <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> child, to accompany a party of volunteers returning the baby to the Daikini (human) people. At a crossroads, they find a human warrior named Madmartigan trapped in a crow's cage. The rest of the party want to give the baby to Madmartigan and go home immediately, but Willow and his friend Meegosh refuse, so the others leave. After spending the night at the crossroads and meeting an army led by Airk Thaughbaer, an old friend of Madmartigan's marching against Bavmorda, Willow reluctantly decides to free Madmartigan so that he can take care of the baby for them.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Veerashaivaism was revolutionary and {{challenged}} the prevailing Hindu caste system which retained royal support. The social {{role of women}} largely depended on their economic status and level of education in this relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation {{of women in the}} fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and Kalachuris of Kalyani queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty Vachana women poets included the work of the 12th-century Virashaiva mystic Akka Mahadevi whose <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bhakti movement is well known. Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals. Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of widowhood indicating that Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) though present was on a voluntary basis. Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the Jains who preferred to fast to death (Sallekhana), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes (Shoolabrahma) or walking into fire on an eclipse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart {{developed}} {{out of the}} <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Wounds, {{in particular}} to the Sacred Wound {{in the side of}} Jesus. The first indications of <b>devotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart are found in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in the fervent atmosphere of the Benedictine or Cistercian monasteries, in the world of Bernardine thought. But it is impossible to say with certainty what were its first texts or who were its first devotees.|$|E
50|$|Madonna dell’Udenzia is venerated {{elsewhere}} in Sicily: in Ciminna at the Church of St. John the Baptist, {{there is a}} triptych dating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1600s depicting the miracle; in Petralia Soprana, there is a replica statue, and church dedicated <b>to</b> Madonna dell’Udenzia <b>Devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Madona dell’Udenzia are also held in other villages in including Mezzojuso and Roccamena.|$|R
25|$|Common {{examples}} of Catholic devotions include the Rosary, the Stations of the Cross, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus, the various scapulars, the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Seven Sorrows of Mary, novenas to various saints, pilgrimages and <b>devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Sacrament, and the veneration of saintly images.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Devotions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Name {{continued}} {{also in the}} Eastern Church {{into the}} 19th and 20th centuries.
