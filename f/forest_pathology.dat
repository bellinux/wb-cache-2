2500|$|In {{the last}} months of his {{undergraduate}} education, Borlaug attended a Sigma Xi lecture by Elvin Charles Stakman, a professor and soon-to-be head of the plant pathology group at the University of Minnesota. The event was a pivot for Borlaug's future. Stakman, in his speech entitled [...] "These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops", discussed the manifestation of the plant disease rust, a parasitic fungus that feeds on phytonutrients in wheat, oats, and barley crops. He had discovered that special plant breeding methods produced plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug's job at the Forest Service was eliminated because of budget cuts, he asked Stakman if he should go into <b>forest</b> <b>pathology.</b> Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead. He subsequently enrolled at the University to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug earned a master of science degree in 1940, and a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics in 1942.|$|E

40|$|Onchocerciasis in savanna zones is {{generally}} {{more severe than}} in the <b>forest</b> and <b>pathologies</b> also differ geographically, differences often ascribed {{to the existence of}} two or more strains and incompatibilities between vectors and strains. However, flies in the forest transmit more infective larvae than their savanna counterparts, even in sympatry, contradicting expectations based on the forest and savanna strains paradigm. We analysed data on the numbers of Onchocerca volvulus larvae of different stages found in 10 different taxonomic categories of the Simulium damnosum complex derived from more than 48, 800 dissections of flies from Sierra Leone in the west of Africa to Uganda in the east. The samples were collected before widespread ivermectin distribution and thus provide a baseline for evaluating control measures. Savanna species contained fewer larvae per infected or per infective fly than the forest species, even when biting and parous rates were accounted for. The highest transmission indices were found in the forest-dwelling Pra form of Simulium sanctipauli (616 L 3 / 1000 parous flies) and the lowest in the savanna-inhabiting species S. damnosum/S. sirbanum (135) and S. kilibanum (65). Frequency distributions of numbers of L 1 – 2 and L 3 larvae found in parous S. damnosum/S. sirbanum, S. kilibanum, S. squamosum, S. yahense, S. sanctipauli, S. leonense and S. soubrense all conformed to the negative binomial distribution, with the mainly savanna-dwelling species (S. damnosum/S. sirbanum) having less overdispersed distributions than the mainly forest-dwelling species. These infection patterns were maintained even when forest and savanna forms were sympatric and biting the same human population. Furthermore, for the first time, levels of blindness were positively correlated with infection intensities of the forest vector S. yahense, consistent with relations previously reported for savanna zones. Another novel result was that conversion rates of L 1 – 2 larvae to L 3 s were equivalent for both forest and savanna vectors. We suggest that either a multiplicity of factors are contributing to the observed disease patterns or that many parasite strains exist within a continuum...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractKey messageIncreasing human {{impacts on}} forests, {{including}} unintentional movement of pathogens, climate change, and large-scale intensive plantations, {{are associated with}} an unprecedented rate of new diseases. An evolutionary ecology perspective can help address these challenges and provide direction for sustainable <b>forest</b> management. ContextForest <b>pathology</b> has historically relied on an ecological approach to understand and address the practical management of forest diseases. A widening of this perspective to include evolutionary considerations has been increasingly developed {{in response to the}} rising rates of genetic change in both pathogen populations and tree populations due to human activities. AimsHere, five topics for which the evolutionary perspective is especially relevant are highlighted. ResultsThe first relates to the evolutionary diversity of fungi and fungal-like organisms, with issues linked to the identification of species and their ecological niches. The second theme deals with the evolutionary processes that allow forest pathogens to adapt to new hosts after introductions or to become more virulent in homogeneous plantations. The third theme presents issues linked to disease resistance in tree breeding programs (e. g., growth-defense trade-offs) and proposes new criteria and methods for more durable resistance. The last two themes are dedicated to the biotic environment of the tree–pathogen system, namely, hyperparasites and tree microbiota, as possible solutions for health management. ConclusionWe conclude by highlighting three major conceptual advances brought by evolutionary biology, i. e., that (i) “not everything is everywhere”, (ii) evolution of pathogen populations can occur on short time scales, and (iii) the tree is a multitrophic community. We further translate these into a framework for immediate policy recommendations and future directions for research...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{workshop}} {{was to develop a}} range of fuel reduction prescriptions that integrate fuel and ecological objectives specifically related to northern spotted owl (NSO) conservation in dry forests of the Cascade Range in eastern Washington and Oregon and northern California. The workshop was held at the Eagle Crest Resort, Redmond, Oregon, from October 13 - 15, 2009. Over 200 managers and scientists attended from California, Oregon, and Washington. Most (82 %) of the 194 people who formally registered for the workshop worked for federal land management, research, or regulatory agencies. The rest were a mix of university faculty and graduate students (7 %), representatives of private non-governmental groups (6 %), staff from state resource or wildlife agencies (3 %), and staff of tribal governments (2 %). Most registrants were from Oregon (63 %), followed by California (19 %) and Washington (17 %). We attracted a mix of managers and scientists. Wildlife biologists made up 40 % of the registrants, followed by silviculturists (24 %) and fire specialists (14 %). Many people professed primary or secondary expertise in botany, ecology, <b>forest</b> health (entomology, <b>pathology),</b> or planning. The workshop began in the first afternoon with presentations on the scientific basis for dry-forest management and current management and ecological objectives and issues. The second full day was devoted to defining stand management objectives, learning about current management efforts in the region, and two group exercises to define objectives and treatment strategies. The AM of the last day started with 2 hours of discussion of the previous afternoon’s break-out discussions. Two talks on landscape planning followed. A final talk discussed options to best implement, test, and improve on the workshop outcomes. An adaptive management template and regional study network were proposed. The PM of the last day was a field trip to Pringle Falls Experimental Forest attended by about 100 people. A consensus developed that prescriptions most likely to successfully integrate ecological and fuel-management objectives in both mixed-conifer and pine-dominated forests should be based on emulating historic distributions of forest patch and gap sizes. Both scientists and field managers are anxious to participate in a coordinated management study network, recognizing this approach as the most efficient means for gaining reliable information. Key information needs include answers to the questions: (1) How do NSOs respond to different levels of dry forest treatment in both the short and long term?; and, (2) What methods (marking, logging systems, etc.) are most effective at producing the desired pattern of spatial heterogeneity within and among stands? The workshop results and networking will feature strongly in several ongoing research, management, and science delivery efforts across the region...|$|R
