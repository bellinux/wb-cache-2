500|$|Meanwhile, when Will (Eric McCormack) sprains his ankle, {{he begins}} taking painkillers, as {{prescribed}} by his doctor, to relieve {{himself from the}} pain. His friends, Grace (Debra Messing) and Jack (Sean Hayes), begin seeing changes in Will's personality, including him not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> not reacting to a messy apartment as [...] he is compulsively obsessed with cleanliness. One day, he notices that his pill bottle has gone missing and is searching for them, not knowing that Grace and Jack have taken it. They will not give him the bottle back as they believe he has a problem. At the end, Will admits to his problem and promises his friends he will stop taking them.|$|E
500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> then I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E
2500|$|Florence Blaustein, {{widow of}} the {{producer}} Julian Blaustein, said North {{had to pass}} a street called Baroda every day <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "I think that's how that was born." ...|$|E

2500|$|Director Joel Coen {{described}} {{the process of}} film making: [...] "I can almost set my watch by how I'm going to feel {{at different stages of}} the process. It's always identical, whether the movie ends up working or not. I think when you watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> <b>And</b> when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away. And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early January 2013, Willie Frazer {{said that}} he and a group of loyalists planned to hold a protest outside the Irish {{parliament}} building, Leinster House, in Dublin and [...] "sarcastically" [...] ask for the Irish flag to be taken down. Frazer said [...] "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. I would be very offended if I was living in Ireland and someone came and asked me to take the flag down. Thatâ€™s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag". In 2006, a march in Dublin, organised by Love Ulster, had sparked riots. The Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson condemned the clashes, while his colleague, Phil Hamilton, criticised the PSNI for not deploying enough officers to the Short Strand area on 12 January to prevent violence. The UDA's Jimmy Birch told the BBCs Radio Ulster: [...] "Every time they call a tune, we take to the streets. We are wrecking our own areas, we fight with the police, we are burning our own cars and we stop our own people <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> disrupt our own people's way of life. It is wrong, we need to step back and we need to stop being predictable." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then he {{let himself}} go, with unmasked bitterness. [...] "It's no sense at all. It's jest damn foolishness. Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> care in a muddle like this?

6000|$|... "That is {{the very}} question, my gentle coz," [...] {{answered}} the Earl. [...] "My mother sees but one way of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> that is by royal authority.

60|$|It is so {{with every}} case, where the {{relation}} of employer and employed subsists. You engage a carpenter to erect a house for you, and you present your plan; instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> executing your orders according to your wishes, he goes to criticising and condemning it: he finds fault with this, and ridicules that, and tells you, you ought to make such and such an alteration in it. It is perfectly right for him to give his opinion, in the tone and spirit of recommendation or suggestion, with a distinct understanding that with his employer rests {{the power and the}} right to decide. But how many teachers take possession of their school room as though it was an empire in which they are supreme, who resist every interference of their employers, as they would an attack upon their personal freedom, and who feel, that in regard to every thing connected with school, they have really no actual responsibility.|$|E
6000|$|Robert {{will have}} told you our schemes, and how we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> are to love you near for the future, I hope. You, who are wise, will approve of us, I think, for keeping on our Florentine apartment, so as to run no more risk than is {{necessary}} in making the Paris experiment. We shall let the old dear rooms, and make money by them, and keep them to fall back upon, in case we fail at Paris. 'But we'll not fail.' Well, I hope not, though I am very brittle still and susceptible to climate. Dearest Sarianna, it will do you infinite good {{to come over to}} us every now and then--you want change, absolute change of scene and air and climate, I am confident; and you never will be right till you have had it. We talk, Robert and I, of carrying you back with us to Rome next year as an English trophy. Meanwhile you will see Wiedeman, you and dear Mr. Browning. Don't expect to see a baby of Anak, that's all. Robert is always measuring him on the door, and reporting such wonderful growth (some inch a week, I think), that if you receive his reports you will cry out on beholding the child. At least, you'll say: 'How little he must have been to be no larger now.' You'll fancy he must have begun from a mustard-seed! The fact is, he is small, only full of life and joy to the brim. I am not afraid of your not loving him, nor of his not loving you. He has a loving little heart, I assure you. If anyone pricks a finger with a needle he begins to cry--he can't bear to see the least living thing hurt. And when he loves, it is well. Robert says I must finish, so here ends dearest Sarianna's ...|$|E
