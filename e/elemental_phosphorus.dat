Alternatively, the P and CO off-gases can be burned with air to produce phosphorus pentoxide and carbon dioxide.|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the x-ray transmission spectra of several biologically related samples in the phosphorus K-edge absorption region. These include <b>elemental</b> red <b>phosphorus,</b> hydrated sodium phosphate (Na 3 PO 4. 12 H 2 O), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), diolylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC), and Bacillus megaterium spores. <b>Elemental</b> red <b>phosphorus</b> essentially displays an edge-jump. All other spectra {{are similar in}} form and energy position. Each spectrum for these substances is dominated by a narrower, more intense first peak and a broader but less intense second peak. The corresponding K-edge absorption thresholds are shifted towards higher energy relative to that for <b>elemental</b> red <b>phosphorus,</b> as expected for increasing degrees of phosphorus oxidation. The B. megaterium spectrum has aspects common to both the phosphate and DNA spectra and is therefore interpreted as a composite of spectra arising from DNA/RNA and phosphates within the spore. The B. megaterium spore spectrum provides needed information for resonant radiation damage studies in the phosphorus K-edge absorption region by identifying candidate photoexcitations. In addition,the absorption spectra will be useful in macromolecular crystallography studies employing anomalous dispersion effects at the phosphorus K-edge...|$|R

30|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{phosphorus}} compounds that impart fire retardancy to polymers, due to the existence of several oxidation states of phosphorus, 0, + 3 and + 5 (Morgan and Gilman 2012) and the large number of possible structures that can be attached to an atom with five chemical bonds. <b>Elemental</b> red <b>phosphorus,</b> phosphonates and phosphinates are all typical fire retardants; in wood, phosphorus is most commonly used in an inorganic form, typically promoting char formation rather than gas-phase inhibition.|$|R
25|$|Very pure {{phosphoric acid}} is {{obtained}} by burning <b>elemental</b> <b>phosphorus</b> to produce phosphorus pentoxide, which is subsequently dissolved in dilute phosphoric acid. This route produces a very pure phosphoric acid, since most impurities {{present in the}} rock have been removed when extracting phosphorus from the rock in a furnace.

25|$|In 1844, Paul Thénard, {{son of the}} French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard, used a {{cold trap}} to {{separate}} diphosphine from phosphine that had been generated from calcium phosphide, thereby demonstrating that P2H4 is responsible for spontaneous flammability associated with PH3, and also for the characteristic orange/brown color that can form on surfaces, which is a polymerisation product. He considered diphosphine’s formula to be PH2, and thus an intermediate between <b>elemental</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> the higher polymers, and phosphine. Calcium phosphide (nominally Ca3P2) produces more P2H4 than other phosphides because of the preponderance of P-P bonds in the starting material.|$|E
25|$|Phosphorus is {{essential}} for life. Phosphates (compounds containing the phosphate ion, PO43−) are a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and the phospholipids, which form all cell membranes. Demonstrating the link between phosphorus and life, <b>elemental</b> <b>phosphorus</b> was first isolated from human urine, and bone ash was an important early phosphate source. Phosphate mines contain fossils, especially marine fossils, because phosphate {{is present in the}} fossilized deposits of animal remains and excreta. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some aquatic systems. The vast majority of phosphorus compounds produced are consumed as fertilisers. Phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil, and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population. Other applications include the role of organophosphorus compounds in detergents, pesticides, and nerve agents.|$|E

40|$|Sulfur and {{phosphorus}} are key elements for the functionality of lubricant additives used in extreme pressure applications, such as synchronizer systems in cars. To understand their {{mechanism of action}} we combine first principles calculations and gas phase lubrication experiments. The surface spectroscopy analysis performed in situ after the tribological test indicates that iron sulfide (phosphide) is formed by rubbing steel-on-steel {{in the presence of}} organo-sulfur (-phosphorus) molecules. We, thus, study the effects of <b>elemental</b> sulfur and <b>phosphorus</b> on the interfacial properties of iron by spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. The results show that both the elements are very effective in reducing the adhesion and shear strength of iron. Sulfur is predicted to be more effective than phosphorus, especially at high pressure. Gas phase lubrication experiments confirm these results, indicating that the friction coefficient of iron-sulphide is lower than that of iron-phosphide and both S and P dramatically reduce the friction of steel-on-steel. These results indicate that the release of <b>elemental</b> sulfur and <b>phosphorus</b> may be the key mechanism to controlling the tribological properties of the metal interface and elucidate that the underling microscopic phenomenon is metal passivation. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

30|$|Compared {{with the}} CVT method, {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) is more suitable for the large-scale growth of MPQ 3. In a modified CVD method for the synthesis of NiPS 3 [3], <b>elemental</b> sulfur and <b>phosphorus</b> are evaporated in the two-zoned tube furnace under Ar flow; Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets grown on various substrates as a metal source are simultaneously heated in another zone. The reaction time for this CVD process is only 1  h, which is greatly reduced {{when compared with the}} CVT method. Due to the non-exclusive reaction environment and the reduced reaction time, the CVD process is considered a safer and faster method for producing MPQ 3 nanosheets. However, the requirement for a highly pure inert atmosphere and complex reaction conditions may limit scalable production.|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{a method}} termed {{solid-state}} transformation (SST) {{was developed for}} the large-scale production of MPQ 3 materials [4]. In a typical SST process, metal hydroxides are chosen as starting materials, and <b>elemental</b> sulfur and <b>phosphorus</b> are directly ground with the hydroxides. The mixture is vacuum-sealed in a Pyrex or quartz tube and heated at a certain temperature. After removing the excess sulfur and phosphorus, the MPQ 3 materials can be obtained. Depending on the compositions and morphologies of the starting metal hydroxides, the products can be either nanosheets or other nanostructures. The reaction temperature of the SST method may be even {{lower than that of}} the CVT and CVD methods. With such a low reaction temperature and no requirement for the two-zone furnace, the SST method is regarded as a promising technique for mass production of MPQ 3.|$|R

The wafers wire sawed to 17 mil thicknesses were processed as reference cells. A baseline process which results in an n(+) -p cell structure, and two advanced processes which provide n(+) -p-p(+) structures were utilized. By using a p(+) enhancement layer on the solar cell back surface, the performance of the 7 mil wafers was increased to exceed that of the 17 mil solar cells with simple n(+) -p structures.

40|$|Chemical {{compositions}} {{of impact}} melt glass veins, called Lithology C (Lith C) in Martian meteorite EET 79001 {{were determined by}} electron microprobe analysis. A large enrichment of S, and significant enrichments of Al, Ca, and Na were observed in Lith C glass compared to Lithology A (Lith A). The S enrichment is due to mixing of plagioclase- enriched Lith A material with Martian soil, either prior to or during impact on Mars. A mixture of 87 % Lith A, 7 % plagioclase, and 6 % Martian soil reproduces the average elemental abundances observed in Lith C. Shock melting of such a mixture of plagioclase-enriched, fine-grained Lith A host rock and Martian soil could yield large excesses of S (observed in this study) and Martian atmospheric noble gases (found by Bogard et al., 1983) in Lith C.
