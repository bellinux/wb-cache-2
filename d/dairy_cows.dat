40|$|The {{objectives}} of study were {{to estimate the}} genetic superiority of <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> by using two methods and to test rank of genetic superiority. Milk yield records of 57 heads of <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> collected from 1992 to 2003 were used as experiment materials, which originated from PT Nakstra Kejora Temanggung – Central Java. Milk yield records were collected from <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> having lactation length around 240 to 360 days. The real milk yield was standardized to 305 days and mature equivalent. Two methods were used to estimate the genetic superiority, namely Estimated Real Producing Ability (ERPA) and Estimated Breeding Value (EBV). Rank of genetic superiority obtained from ERPA and EBV was tested by Spearman’s rank correla-tion.

5|$|Wool was New Zealand's major {{agricultural}} export {{during the}} late 19th century. Even {{as late as the}} 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues, but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers. In contrast dairy farming increased, with the number of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> doubling between 1990 and 2007, to become New Zealand's largest export earner. In the year to June 2009, dairy products accounted for 21% ($9.1 billion) of total merchandise exports, and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade. Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13.2%, wool 6.3%, fruit 3.5% and fishing 3.3%.

40|$|<b>Dairy</b> <b>cow</b> {{foot health}} {{is a subject}} of concern because it is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} welfare problem in dairy farming and causes economic losses for the farmer. In order to improve <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> foot health it is important to take into account the attitude and intention of dairy farmers. In our study the objective was to gain insight into the attitude and intention of dairy farmers to take action to improve <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> foot health and determine drivers and barriers to take action, using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Five hundred Dutch dairy farmers were selected randomly and were invited by email to fill in an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions about respondents' intentions, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control and was extended with questions about personal normative beliefs. With information from such a framework, solution strategies for the improvement of <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> foot health can be proposed. The results showed that almost 70 % of the dairy farmers had an intention to take action to improve <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> foot health. Most important drivers seem to be the achievement of better foot health with cost-effective measures. Possible barriers to taking action were labor efficiency and a long interval between taking action and seeing an improvement in <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> foot health. The feed advisor and foot trimmer seemed to have most influence on intentions to take action to improve <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> foot health. Most farmers seemed to be satisfied with the foot health status at their farm, which probably weakens the intention for foot health improvement, especially compared to other issues which farmers experience as more urgent. Subclinical foot disorders (where cows are not visibly lame) were not valued as important with respect to animal welfare. Furthermore, 25 % of the respondents did not believe cows could suffer pain. Animal welfare, especially the provision of good care for the cows, was valued as important but was not related to intention to improve <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> foot health. The cost-effectiveness of measures seemed to be more important. Providing more information on the effects of taking intervention measures might stimulate farmers to take action to achieve improvement in <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> foot health...|$|R

40|$|Comparative {{demonstrations of}} three methods (flux sampling, {{external}} tracer ratio, and internal tracer ratio), were mounted in four real farm situations. A flux sampling method was demonstrated at a commercial <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> house (slurry-based), at a commercial piggery (straw-based), at a full-scale above-ground cylindrical slurry store (<b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> slurry) and a full-scale earth-bank lagoon (pig slurry). An external tracer ratio method was demonstrated, {{in parallel with}} the flux sampling method, at the <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> house and at the above-ground slurry store. An internal tracer ratio method was demonstrated at the <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> house only. At the <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> house, the corrected emission rates from the flux sampling method and from the external tracer ratio method agreed to within the estimated experimental range, while the emission rate from the internal tracer ratio method was significantly lower. The overall conclusion {{of the study is}} that all three methods can have a useful role, the choice of which to deploy depending on the particular measurements needed in each case.

The material used in this research is 31 respondents, members of KUD “BATU” receiving the <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> credit, taken in random to be observed and interviewed directly. The resulted data are analyzed in description and coefficients regression with Dummy Variables and examined statistically with F and T pattern. From this research, it is noted that the average income of them is Rp. 592. 349, 46 /month with average of the venture scale 3 cow per man. It also shows that the <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> venture gives influence on the income level of those receiving the credit (P 0, 01, nilai P = 0, 15).
