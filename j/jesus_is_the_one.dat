At this boast, a bright white light lances down into {{the ruins of the}} headquarters, and begins dropping meteors of light upon the battlefield. All of Stone/Satan's soldiers are killed, while all of the allied survivors remained untouched, and are freed from their bonds. Stone's former Guardian is dismayed at Satan's defeat, and tries to run from the battlefield. A globe of light chases him and quickly impales him with swords of pure light, causing him to be vaporized. Satan himself is driven to his knees, and forced to admit that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> true Lord. The light then pulverizes the ground beneath him, dropping the Devil into a deep pit of molten lava, the Lake of Fire. There he finds he is chained, and screams in anguish, defeated. As David lies on the ground looking up into the sky, the light becomes brighter, and then fades away, revealing a scene of Earthly paradise. A declaration is revealed on screen that God has established his home with man, and that He shall reign forever, and ever.|$|E

5000|$|One can justifiably {{argue that}} Luke used 1 Kings 17:9-24 {{as a model}} for Luke 7:11-16 because it meets the {{criteria}} of mimesis criticism.

Criterion 2 (Analogy): Mark provides an analogous imitation of 1 Kings 17 with his story about the raising of Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:35-43). Criteria 3 (Density), 4 (Order), and 5 (Distinctive Traits) can be identified in the above table. The most important aspect for criterion 5 is the identical Greek wording for [...] "And he gave him to his mother." [...] Criterion 6 (Interpretability): Luke improves upon his model in the following ways.

The fact that many Christians have regarded dancing as a bit ungodly (in a church, at any rate) does not mean that Jesus did. The Shakers didn't. This sect flourished in the United States in the nineteenth century, but the first Shakers came from Manchester in England, where they were sometimes called the [...] "Shaking Quakers". They hived off to America in 1774, under the leadership of Mother Anne. They established celibate communities - men at one end, women at the other; though they met for work and worship. Dancing, for them, was a spiritual activity. They also made furniture of a functional, lyrical simplicity. Even the cloaks and bonnets that the women wore were distinctly stylish, in a sober and forbidding way. Their hymns were odd, but sometimes of great beauty: from one of these (Simple Gifts) I adapted this melody. I could have written another for the words of 'Lord of the Dance' (some people have), but this was so appropriate that it seemed a waste of time to do so. Also, I wanted to salute the Shakers.Sometimes, for a change I sing the whole song in the present tense. 'I dance in the morning when the world is begun...'. It's worth a try.|$|E
40|$|The central {{question}} {{of this research}} is the meaning of the impossibility of of Jesus to show himself openly in the city, and must be outside, in the desert instead, after the curing of the lepard (Mk 1 : 45). This question will be dealt with in a literrary way, with a focus on the used terminology. In the first place we notify a change {{in the role of the}} two figures of this story.

In between there is the discussion about how to re-enter the community, after being healed from leprosy. Mark uses this theme of being isolated from the community not only here.

This is also confirmed by the use of the word 'desert' (in opposition to 'city) ', which has a litterary function in the first chapter of Mark...|$|E
25|$|That some {{works are}} {{categorized}} as New Testament Apocrypha <b>is</b> indicative of <b>the</b> {{wide range of}} responses that <b>were</b> engendered in <b>the</b> interpretation of the message of Jesus of Nazareth. During the first several centuries of the transmission of that message, considerable debate turned on safeguarding its authenticity. Three key methods of addressing this survive to the present day: ordination, where groups authorize individuals as reliable teachers of the message; creeds, where groups define the boundaries of interpretation of the message; and canons, which list the primary documents certain groups believe contain the message originally taught by <b>Jesus.</b> There <b>was</b> substantial debate about which books should <b>be</b> included in <b>the</b> canons.

40|$|This article gives a {{historical}} {{overview of the}} main issues and problems facing Christian interpreters of the Bible. The Christian understanding of the Bible is influenced by two main factors. On the one hand, Christians believe that God revealed himself and was present in the life, ministry, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. In other words, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> Word of God. On the other hand, Christians believe that the Bible is inspired Holy Scripture, containing the revelation of God. There is a tension between these two approaches, as one locates the divine revelation {{in the person of}} Jesus of Nazareth, the other in the Holy Book. The article argues that this tension has been a major creative driving force in the history of Christian biblical interpretation. It traces the main strategies with which Christian interpreters have approached the Bible in order to reconcile these two elements, or in which they have allowed one to overrule the other. This will provide an introduction to the key approaches and methods in Christian biblical interpretation...|$|E
40|$|Izvještaji Posljednje večere nalaze se u Novom zavjetu kod Pavla (najstariji) te kod sinoptika. Pritom pokazuju određenu sličnost Pavlov i Lukin izvještaj te Markov i Matejev. Osobito je važno uočiti Isusove riječi ustanove euharistije: one koje prate uzimanje kruha te čaše s vinom. Uz čašu s vinom nalazimo izričaje: »novi Savez u mojoj krvi« (l Kor 11, 25 i Lk 22, 20) i »krv Saveza« (Mk 14, 24 i Mt 26, 28). Sklapa se Savez u Isusovoj krvi. I to novi. Očito da je onaj stari nedovoljan, ili razvrgnut. Upravo Isus popravlja taj narušeni saveznički odnos između Boga i čovjeka. Čovjek nije bio dosljedan u savezničkim obvezama. Isusova smrt je stoga okajnička. Ostvaruje konačno Božje pomirenje sa svojim narodom, tako da Isusova smrt, davanje njegova tijela i krvi, ispunjava sve ono na što je pomirbeni kult ciljao: pomirena zajednica ljudi s Bogom. Govorimo dakle o savezničkoj i okajničkoj krvi novoga Saveza. Accounts of the Last Supper in the New Testament {{are found}} in Paul 2 ̆ 7 s {{writings}} (the oldest), and in the Synoptic Gospels. Paul 2 ̆ 7 s and Luke 2 ̆ 7 s account are to some extent similar, as are Mark 2 ̆ 7 s and Matthew 2 ̆ 7 s. It is particularly important to note the words uttered by Jesus in {{the institution of the}} Eucharist - the words after the taking of the bread and the cup of wine. Besides the cup of wine we find expressions »new covenant in my blood« (1 Cor 11 : 25 and Lk 22 : 20) and »the blood of the covenant« (Mk 14 : 24 and Mt 26 : 28). The new covenant in Jesus 2 ̆ 7 blood has been entered. The old one was obviously insufficient, or dissolved. <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who restores this disrupted covenantal relationship between the God and man. Men did not keep their commitments imposed by the covenant. Therefore Jesus 2 ̆ 7 death is the death of atonement. It finally fulfils the ultimate reconciliation of God with his people, so that Jesus 2 ̆ 7 death, the giving of his body and blood, fulfils the target intended by the cult of reconciliation: a reconciled community of people with God. Therefore, we talk about the covenantal or atonement blood of the new covenant...|$|E
