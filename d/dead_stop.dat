5|$|The torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Giffen's {{ships in}} two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the heavy cruiser , causing heavy damage and bringing {{her to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent a tug to take Chicago under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to return to base the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort Chicago and the tugboat.|$|E
25|$|In October 2012, Lexus {{staged a}} {{race as a}} result of a charity bet between pilot Marc Arnold and Kent Stevinson to race a Lexus LFA against an Eclipse 500 jet. The top speed of the LFA is 203mph while the Eclipse 500 can reach speeds of 400mph. In order to make it a fair test to measure acceleration, handling, braking, {{according}} to Paul Williamson the race took place on a 4800 feet runway. The plane was given a head start of about 110mph with the Lexus LFA launching from a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> as the jet flew by at 110mph. As the race begun, the plane started accelerating from 110mph and Lexus LFA launched from a <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> Both accelerated to the end of the runway where the LFA will have to brake and turn around with the plane turning around as well. Then it was a race all the way back to the starting line with the LFA needing to brake before the plane in order for the Lexus LFA to win the race. The proceeds of the win were to benefit charities. Lexus decided to choose the Lexus LFA Nurburgring Edition for the race and professional race car driver and champion Scott Pruett was selected as the driver for the Lexus LFA. Once the race was complete, the Lexus LFA was able to win through completing the race including a full <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> at the end before the plane cleared the finish line 2 seconds ahead of the Eclipse 500 jet. The Lexus LFA hit a maximum speed of 171mph before it hit the braking zone.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} the Ohio had already become the primary focus for Axis attacks on the convoy, having been torpedoed by an Italian {{submarine}} and hit by successive waves of dozens of Stuka dive bombers which attacked continuously for five hours. The torpedo had caused catastrophic damage and initially brought the ship to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop,</b> while near misses from bombs caused further damage and put some of the ship's defensive armament out of action. The crew were twice forced to abandon ship as further air attacks caused yet more damage.|$|E

Harley recalled in 2014: [...] "Alan was great, he didn't try to dissuade me, he just said, 'Do it'." [...] On The One Show, Harley added: [...] "Suddenly it was swinging, and bopping, and ooh-la-la.

5000|$|The turn-of-the-century [...] "acid drought" [...] {{was likely}} due {{to a number of}} factors, perhaps {{including}} but not limited to the arrest of Pickard. According to Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America, additional factors included the 1996 arrest of longtime LSD chemist Nicholas Sand and the death of [...] "Dealer McDope", an important but mysterious man involved in the illicit sale of LSD precursor materials. Grateful Dead concerts provided a primary distribution network for LSD, and this network dissolved when the Grateful <b>Dead</b> <b>stopped</b> touring in 1995.|$|R

He had begun work at four that morning, and, with harvest drawing near, time was precious to him, {{but he was}} filled with a keen curiosity to see what progress Curtis had made in his search.

25|$|The {{other type}} of {{exchange}} {{is known as a}} bike-to-bike exchange. The only reason that a team would use this type of exchange is if the team members are not all approximately the same height. More often than not, it is because one member of the team is shorter than the rest because most cyclists in the race are fairly tall. This exchange is far simpler than the other. The first rider only has to come in and tap the next rider's shoulder or arm and then the other racer can begin. While this is much easier than the other exchange, it is significantly slower because the second racer is starting from a <b>dead</b> <b>stop,</b> while riders performing the man-to-man exchange have some forward momentum.|$|E
25|$|Stop {{signs are}} used globally. However, most {{countries}} see fewer {{of them than}} North America and South Africa, because all-way stops are never used and may even be legally prohibited. In a majority of European and Central Asian countries, as well as Cuba in North America, junctions without traffic lights or roundabouts are controlled by stop signs on minor roads and by white, yellow and black priority diamond signs on the major road. In the UK, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, New Zealand and Australia, stop signs are restricted to situations wherein coming to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> is actually necessary because of severely limited sight lines. At {{the vast majority of}} minor intersections in these countries Give Way signs and/or equivalent road markings are used. Finally, at the busier crossing streets, Give Way signs may be replaced by (mini) roundabouts, which also work on the give way (rather than stop) principle.|$|E

At 20:08, Giffen ordered his ships to reverse direction, to slow to , and to cease firing their anti-aircraft guns.

500|$|Although in {{the center}} of the Russian line during the battle, Sevastopol was only {{slightly}} damaged during the day. In the evening, the Russians massed their fire on the Japanese flagship , at that time [...] away. The Japanese battleships returned fire and Sevastopol suffered several shell hits to her superstructure, which killed one man and wounded 62 others. A few minutes later, Mikasa was hit by two [...] shells and one [...] shell from [...] and Sevastopol, which caused 40 casualties. Soon after that, when it seemed that the Russians would be able to escape to Vladivostok, two 12-inch shells from [...] penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the captain, and causing the ship to come to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> after executing a sharp turn.

500|$|Poltava was {{sixth in}} the column of Russian ships when the Japanese engaged them, and from her {{position}} started to bombard [...] at around 14:45.

The Russians scored several hits on Mikasa, including two by Poltava.

By 17:35 the Japanese were again closing on the Russian rear. Mikasa and three other battleships opened fire on Poltava and three armored cruisers, but problems with their turrets forced the Japanese battleships to break off the engagement. They returned at 18:30, with [...] and Asahi firing on Poltava.

The signal flags were only gradually recognized by Pobeda, Sevastopol, Pallada and Poltava and the other vessels took some time to re-form for the return voyage. Poltava was hit by 12 to 14 large-caliber shells during the battle that knocked out five of her 6-inch guns, as well as killing 12 crewmen and wounding 43.
