Ó Ceallaigh's minutes for this period reflect an atmosphere of general optimism: the SFPP was in contact with several suppliers of printing equipment, was recruiting personnel, and was actively looking for a new publishing office and a location for its printshop. Griffith was a prudent businessman, however, and the SFPP negotiated simultaneously with the Linotype Machine Co. for the purchase of a Cox <b>Duplex</b> <b>printing</b> press, and the manager of the Ireland's Own Publishing Co., Mr. Walsh, for the printing of the newspaper.

40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} a model allowing convenient {{calculation of the}} spectral reflectance and transmittance of <b>duplex</b> <b>prints.</b> It is based on flux transfer matrices and enables retrieving classical Kubelka-Munk formulas, as well as extended formulas for non-symmetric layers. By making different assumptions on the flux transfers, we obtain two predictive models for the duplex halftone prints: The "duplex Clapper-Yule model" which {{is an extension of}} the classical Clapper-Yule model, and the "duplex primary reflectance-transmittance model". The two models can be calibrated from either reflectance or transmittance measurements; only the second model can be calibrated from both measurements, thus giving optimal accuracy for both reflectance and transmittance predictions. The conceptual differences between the two models are deeply analyzed, as well as their advantages and drawbacks in terms of calibration. According to the test carried out in this study with paper printed in inkjet, their predictive performances are good provided appropriate calibration options are selected...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} for watermarking <b>duplex</b> <b>printed</b> pages is presented. The technique produces visible watermark patterns like conventional watermarks embedded in paper fabric. Watermark information {{is embedded in}} halftones used to print images on either side. The watermark pattern is imperceptible when images printed on either side are viewed independently but becomes visible when the sheet of paper is held up against a light. The technique employs clustered dot halftones and embeds the watermark pattern as controlled local phase variations. Illumination with a back-light superimposes the halftone patterns on the two sides. Regions where {{the front and back}}-side halftones are in phase agreement appear lighter in show-through viewing, whereas regions over which the front and back side halftones are in phase disagreement appear darker. The image printed on one side has a controlled variation of the halftone phase and the one printed on the other side provides a constant phase reference. The watermark pattern is revealed when the sheet is viewed in "show-through mode" superimposing the halftones on the two sides. Threshold arrays for the halftone screens are designed to allow incorporation of a variety of halftone patterns while minimizing artifacts in images printed using these halftones...|$|R

5000|$|The AFL {{concentrated}} {{its political}} efforts {{during the last}} decades of the Gompers administration on securing freedom from state control of unions—in particular {{an end to the}} court's use of labor injunctions to block the right to organize or strike and the application of the anti-trust laws to criminalize labor's use of pickets, boycotts and strikes. The AFL thought that it had achieved the latter {{with the passage of the}} Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914—which Gompers referred to as [...] "Labor's Magna Carta". But in <b>Duplex</b> <b>Printing</b> Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443 (1921), the United States Supreme Court narrowly read the Act and codified the federal courts' existing power to issue injunctions rather than limit it. The court read the phrase [...] "between an employer and employees" [...] (contained in the first paragraph of the Act) to refer only to cases involving an employer and its own employees, leaving the courts free to punish unions for engaging in sympathy strikes or secondary boycotts.|$|E
5000|$|The ruling {{deprived}} {{labor unions}} {{of an important}} and effective union tactic, and the decision to hold individual union members personally liable for damages had an adverse impact on union organizing efforts. That led the AFL to initiate an aggressive campaign to convince Congress to address labor concerns about the Sherman Act in the reform of antitrust laws. The push culminated {{with the passage of}} the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which provided that [...] "the labor of a human being is not a commodity or an article of commerce." [...] Section 20 of the act further stated that no injunctions should be granted by federal courts in labor disputes [...] "unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right." [...] The provisions, however, were narrowly interpreted by the Supreme Court, which ruled, in <b>Duplex</b> <b>Printing</b> Press Company v. Deering (1921), that the exemptions in the Clayton Act did not protect secondary boycotts from judicial control.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} towards the {{internalisation}} of the printing {{of the newspaper}} was taken on 5 October 1908, approximately {{two years after the}} setting up of the company, when the board launched a subscription for a daily edition of Sinn Féin. In spite of the reluctance of his friends to take such a financial risk, the astute Griffith was aware of a shift in Irish reading habits and was convinced that there was a market for a new daily newspaper. At the same time, the weekly Sinn Féin was finding it difficult to defend itself against attacks from its daily competitors. During the campaign for the North Leitrim by-election where Charles J. Dolan ran for the Sinn Féin party, this was perceived as a serious handicap. [...] Griffith decided to seize the moment. On 24 September 1908, 8,000 debentures at £1 each were put on sale. The reduced price was intended to allow as many supporters as possible {{to take part in the}} creation of the new newspaper. The promotional material accompanying the debenture application form explained why this was so important:No National newspaper exists in the daily Press of Ireland, and Irish affairs are therefore treated by the existing Press from the standpoints of rival English parties. A result of this denationalising attitude is political chaos and economic impoverishment. The directors are convinced that the time is ripe for the foundation of a daily organ in the Press of Ireland which, being free from the influence of any English party, will deal with the affairs of Ireland from the Irish standpoint, and whilst asserting the National distinctiveness and independence of Ireland will promote combination and agreement amongst all political sections in Ireland on the questions of Language, Land, Taxation, Industries, Transit, Poor Law. Supporters with limited budgets were allowed to pay in four instalments, but when a reader of the weekly newspaper, writing in the name of low-paid workers with large families, suggested the creation of savings clubs, Griffith encouraged the idea enthusiastically. The public response was more enthusiastic this time and by 7 May 1909, the Board had already received 3,386 applications. Ó Ceallaigh's minutes for this period reflect an atmosphere of general optimism: the SFPP was in contact with several suppliers of printing equipment, was recruiting personnel, and was actively looking for a new publishing office and a location for its printshop. Griffith was a prudent businessman, however, and the SFPP negotiated simultaneously with the Linotype Machine Co. for the purchase of a Cox <b>Duplex</b> <b>printing</b> press, and the manager of the Ireland's Own Publishing Co., Mr. Walsh, for the printing of the newspaper. If the printshop failed once again to materialise, the SFPP would still have the option of subcontracting to Walsh.This time, Griffith's gamble paid off and he succeeded in establishing his printing works in Middle Abbey Street, across the street from the Freeman's Journal and the newspaper wholesalers Eason & Son. The financial health of the SFPP remained, however, extremely fragile as payments for debentures trickled in over a six-year period. These sums came in handy for petty cash and to pay small bills but could not be used for any long-term investment. Griffith was therefore forced to make the daily newspaper as attractive as possible for the greatest number of readers, what might be called [...] "tabloidisation" [...] today. In contrast with the austerity of Griffith's previous publications, the Sinn Féin Daily was abundantly illustrated with cartoons, photographs and maps. We find large tables of national statistics, articles on industry or the language movement, and extracts from the Resurrection of Hungary side by side with descriptions of the latest Paris fashions, serialised novels and sensational news gleaned from the international press. It is a measure of Griffith's understanding of the market and his skill as an editor that the circulation of the two newspapers reached 64,515 during the month which followed the launch of the daily.|$|E

We also investigate how the more conventional method of encouraging people to save resources performs, and find it has no impact. Recent theoretical and empirical contributions indicate that the default effect works through recommendation, depends positively on the number of alternatives in the choice set, and is reinforced for difficult decisions.
