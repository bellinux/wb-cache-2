40|$|Abstract–The {{development}} of fast photodetectors and of fast, high light output scintillation crystals has placed an {{increased emphasis on}} the need for fast readout <b>electronics</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> Time-Of-Flight (TOF) PET detectors. These improvements have paralleled developments in analog sampling technology that makes fast waveform digitizing of photodetector signals an attractive alternative to custom PCB and IC designs. Waveform digitization offers a flexible means for evaluating and implementing more complex signal processing algorithms. We used a commercial 1 GHz 2 Gs/s waveform digitizing system to acquire coincident pulses from LYSO and LaBr 3 (5 %Ce) scintillator crystals coupled to a fast PMT. By measuring the time pickoff based on a linear fit to the rising edge of the pulse, we show an improvement in coincident timing resolution from ~ 200 ps to ~ 80 ps FWHM for LaBr 3 (5 %Ce) coupled to Photonis XP 20 D 0 PMTs, and from ~ 160 ps to ~ 80 ps Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) for LaBr 3 (5 %Ce) coupled to Hamamatsu H 4998 PMTs. Our results show a consistent improvement in timing resolution as well as reduced sensitivity to signal risetime as compared to leading edge (LE) pickoff techniques. Measurements with partial detector modules indicate that system timing resolution of < 200 ps is attainable with LaBr 3 (5 %Ce) pixelated detectors designed for TOF PET. I...|$|E

40|$|The 200 MHz RF {{system is}} an {{essential}} tool for the preparation of high-intensity beams in the CERN PS. Presently, six RF cavities are operated to control the longitudinal bunch emittance and rebunching of the beam before the transfer to the SPS. Cavities are selected for the various processes with a dedicated hardware matrix, switching the individual timing pulses and voltage programs per cavity. However, the <b>electronics</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the matrix hardware is obsolete and its reliability cannot be guaranteed {{due to a lack}} of spare modules and components. Instead of replacing the old hardware matrix by modern hardware, this note describes a new control structure for the 200 MHz RF system so that no dedicated hardware will be required anymore. The implementation of the new control structure is based on two main concepts. Firstly, linked timing trees per blow-up or rebunching are used to handle all related timing and to store one row of the matrix. Secondly, as a reflection of the RF signal generation for the 200 MHz system, where all units always receive the same RF signal, the new implementation features a single global voltage program function. Internal stops in the voltage program function are restarted by timings in the linked trees and assure inherent coherence between timings and voltage programs for the cavities. After a description of the requirements of the present hardware in terms of timing signals and functions, functional s pecification of the new application program is given...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{technological}} challenges {{related to the}} production of electrical power from offshore wind farms. Norwegian companies are working on different aspects of offshore wind power generation and the Norwegian Research Council has in this context supported a five year project called: ?High Voltage AC and DC Subsea Cables for Offshore Wind Farms and Transmission Grids?. This master thesis {{has been a part of}} that project. Power <b>electronics</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> HVDC converters will stress the cable with a HVDC component with overlaid transients. The effect of the DC component and the overlaid transients on the performance of the polymeric cable insulation is not yet known and the main purpose of this master thesis has been to investigate how transients can influence water tree growth within wet XLPE insulation. The effect of the DC component has also been evaluated. Laboratory experiments were conducted on Rogowski shaped test objects with an insulation thickness of 1. 1 mm. 20 sodium chloride particles were added on the lower semiconductor during the manufacturing process. This was done to facilitate the initiation of water trees. The finished test objects were preconditioned with demineralized water in a heating cabinet at 30 &# 176;C for four weeks to ensure that the insulation was saturated with water. An experimental setup capable of applying a DC voltage with a superimposed high frequency AC component was used to simulate the HVDC component and the overlaid transients that occur close to the power <b>electronics</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> AC to DC conversion. Two sets of experiments were conducted. The first set was conducted using a 15 kHz AC component, with resulting electrical field strength of &# 177; 2. 05 kV/mm. The second set of experiments was conducted combining the same high frequency AC component with a superimposed DC voltage, resulting in an electrical field strength of 12 &# 177; 2. 05 kV/mm. Nine Rogowski shaped test objects were aged in both sets of experiments. Three test objects were aged for one week, another three for two weeks, while the last three test objects were aged for three complete weeks. The test objects were kept in a heating cabinet at 30 &# 176;C during testing, and with the exception of the electrical field, treated identically during both sets of experiments. All test objects experienced water tree initiation and growth. The length of the longest water tree and the aggregated water tree density were observed to increase as a function of ageing time for both sets of experiments. All water trees were oblong and grew in the direction of the electrical field. The longest observed water tree, after three weeks of ageing exposed to an AC component only, was 607 &# 181;m, corresponding to 55 % of the total insulation thickness. Two out of three test objects, exposed to a DC voltage with a superimposed AC component, suffered breakdown before enduring three complete weeks of ageing. This was most likely the result of a water tree bridging the 1100 &# 181;m thick insulation. Test objects exposed to a DC voltage with a superimposed high frequency AC component were also observed to experience a higher aggregated water tree density, with vented water trees observed at the lower semiconductor constituting the main difference. As a result, it could be argued that the DC voltage, when combined with a superimposed high frequency AC component, increases water tree initiation and growth within wet XLPE insulation. The experiments also indicate that HVDC cables should be made water tight to prevent water tree degradation due to the transients originating from the switching of the power electronic converters. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{different}} {{physical and}} electrical aspects of silicon microstrip sensors and low-mass multi-line readout cables have been investigated. These silicon microstrip sensors and readout cables {{will be used}} in the Silicon Tracking System (STS) of the fixed-target heavy-ion Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment which is under development at the upcoming Facility for Antiproton and ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany. The highly segmented low-mass tracking system is a central CBM detector system to resolve the high tracking densities of charged particles originating from beam-target interactions. Considering the low material budget requirement the double-sided silicon microstrip detectors have been used in several planar tracking stations. The readout electronics is planned to be installed at the periphery of the tracking stations along with the cooling system. Low-mass multi-line readout cables shall bridge the distance between the microstrip sensors and the readout electronics. The CBM running operational scenario suggests that some parts of the tracking stations are expected to be exposed to a total integrated particle fluence of the order of 1 e 14 neq/cm 2. After 1 e 14 neq/cm 2 the damaged modules in the tracking stations will be replaced. Thus radiation hard sensor is an important requirement for the sensors. Moreover, to cope with the high reaction rates, free-streaming (triggerless) readout electronics with online event reconstruction must be used which require high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio (i. e., high signal efficiency, low noise contributions). Therefore, reduction in noise is a major goal of the sensor and cable development. For better insight into the different aspects of the silicon microstrip sensors and multi-line readout cables, the simulation study has been performed using SYNOPSYS TCAD tools. 3 D models of the silicon microstrip sensors and the readout cables were implemented which is motivated by the stereoscopic construction of the silicon microstrip sensors. For the evaluation of the performance of the silicon microstrip sensors in the harsh radiation environment during experimental operation, a radiation damage model has been included. It reproduces the behavior of the irradiated CBM prototype sensors. In addition to the static characteristics, the interstrip parameters relevant to understand strip isolation and cross-talk issues have been extracted. The transient simulations have been performed to estimate the charge collection performance of the irradiated sensors. The signal transmission in the readout cables has been evaluated with the finite element simulation tool RAPHAEL. Based on the performance of the front-end <b>electronics</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> early prototyping in the CBM experiment, capacitive and resistive noise contributions from the silicon microstrip sensors and multi-line readout cables have been extracted. To validate the aforementioned simulations, numerous tests have been performed both on the multi-line readout cables and silicon microstrip sensors. Characterizations of multi-line readout cables and silicon microstrip sensors in laboratory conditions have been found to agree reasonably well with the simulations. Considering the expected radiation environment the behavior of silicon microstrip sensors have been studied especially in terms of noise and charge collection efficiency. Source-scan of the silicon microstrip sensors using 241 Am is presented. In order to test a first system of detector stations including the data acquisition system, slow control and online monitoring software and for track reconstruction, in-beam tests have been performed at the COSY synchrotron of the Research Center Juelich, Germany. Further, different design parameters have been suggested to improve the sensor and readout cable design {{on the basis of the}} simulations and the measurements.
