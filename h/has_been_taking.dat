5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} (often also {{referred}} to as the Eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis) is a multi-year debt crisis that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> place in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E

5000|$|The above {{two forms}} can be combined, to {{indicate}} a present or past view of a prior (or prior and current) event that occurred with stative or progressive aspect ("I have/had been feeling well," [...] "I have/had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes"); here the construction is [...] "have/has/had" [...] + [...] "been" [...] + main verb + -"ing". There is a subtle difference in usage between the case where the viewpoint is from {{the present and the}} case where it is from a point in the past: <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes implies that the action is not only of present relevance but is continuing to occur; in contrast, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes indicates present relevance, allows but does not require the action to still <b>be</b> occurring (I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes but <b>was</b> not still doing so; I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes and still was).|$|R

5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E

After Harrison evades capture, Stabler and Benson ask for help from Zimmer, who said she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> care of Harrison since he lost his parents as a child.

The BP section of the site {{is a good way}} from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009.

Jameson begins to appear younger and full of energy, but has frequent pains {{as a result of the}} overdose. By the time they are nearing Mordan, Jameson now appears as a young adult.|$|E
