The coupling between Cr atoms {{is found to}} be ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 2. 69 μB at each Cr site. The magnetic moments of <b>Ga</b> <b>and</b> <b>N</b> <b>sites</b> are rather small, namely, 0. 025 μB and − 0. 025 μB, respectively, yielding a total moment of 6 μB per supercell. Parallel calculations done on small clusters of Cr-doped GaN also yield similar results indicating that magnetic coupling between Cr atoms results from a local phenomenon.

40|$|The {{electronic}} band {{structures of}} wurtzite GaN with <b>Ga</b> <b>and</b> <b>N</b> vacancy defects are investigated {{by means of}} the first-principles total energy calculations in the neutral charge state. Our results show that the band structures can be significantly modified by the <b>Ga</b> <b>and</b> <b>N</b> vacancies in the GaN samples. Generally, the width of the valence band is reduced and the band gap is enlarged. The defect-induced bands can be introduced in the band gap of GaN due to the <b>Ga</b> <b>and</b> <b>N</b> vacancies. Moreover, the GaN with high density of N vacancies becomes an indirect gap semiconductor. Three defect bands due to Ga vacancy defects are created within the band gap and {{near the top of the}} valence band. In contrast, the N vacancies introduce four defect bands within the band gap.

Unlike adsorbed CO on reduced passivated one, the adsorbed CO on fresh Mo 2 N/gamma-Al 2 O 3 behaves similarly to that of group VIII metals, suggesting that fresh nitride resembles noble metals. It is found that the surface of Mo nitrides slowly transformed into sulfide under hydrotreating conditions, which could be {{the main reason for}} the activity drop of molybdenum nitride catalysts in the presence of sulfur-containing species.

In {{spite of the}} realization of commercial devices and advances in processing of materials and devices, {{the understanding of the}} processing and epitaxial growth of these materials is incomplete. In this study, a rate equation based on physically sound surface processes to investigate the molecular beam epitaxial growth of GaN using an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma source is proposed. A surface riding layer of <b>Ga</b> <b>and</b> <b>N</b> plasma species is included in the model. The surface riding species are allowed to undergo several physical and chemical processes. Rates of all surface processes are assumed Arrhenius type. In the ECR plasma, the flux and reactivity of the active nitrogen are modeled based on plasma dynamics and used in our study. The necessary model parameters, which are unknown, were found by fitting results from simulation to experimental values. As the ECR power increases, the flux of active nitrogen <b>and</b> all other <b>N</b> species, which are by-products, increase almost linearly.

Electron concentration obtained from bulk vacancy concentrations of <b>Ga</b> <b>and</b> <b>N</b> decreases linearly with ECR power, unlike the experimental observation of exponential decrease.
