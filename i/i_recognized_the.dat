2500|$|According to Henry Wickham Steed, Herzl was {{initially}} [...] "fanatically {{devoted to the}} propagation of Jewish-German 'Liberal' assimilationist doctrine". However, Herzl came to reject his early ideas regarding Jewish emancipation and assimilation and {{to believe that the}} Jews must remove themselves from Europe. Herzl grew to believe that antisemitism could not be defeated or cured, only avoided, and {{that the only way to}} avoid it was the establishment of a Jewish state. In June, 1895, he wrote in his diary: [...] "In Paris, as I have said, I achieved a freer attitude toward anti-semitism... Above all, <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> emptiness and futility of trying to 'combat' anti-semitism." [...] Herzl's editors of Neue Freie Presse refused any publication of his Zionist political activities. A mental clash gripped Herzl, between the craving for literary success and a desire to act as a public figure. Around this time, Herzl started writing pamphlets about 'A Jewish State'. Herzl claimed that these pamphlets resulted in the establishment of the Zionist Movement, and they did play a large role in the movement's rise and success. His testimony before the British Royal Commission reflected his fundamental, romantic liberal view on life as the 'Problem of the Jews'.|$|E
2500|$|Her mad scene {{appeared}} to owe little to tradition and seemed {{almost like an}} improvisation, with several contemporary accounts remarking on her astonishing capacity for mime. Her performances produced an extraordinary reaction: men wept openly in the theater, and when they left were [...] "convulsed by uncontrollable emotion." [...] The twenty-five-year-old Alexandre Dumas, père, {{who was about to}} embark on a major career as a novelist and dramatist, was in the audience and found the performance revelatory, [...] "far surpassing all my expectations". The French composer Hector Berlioz was also present at that opening night performance and later wrote: [...] "The lightning flash of that sublime discovery opened before me at a stroke the whole heaven of art, illuminating it to its remotest depths. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> meaning of dramatic grandeur, beauty, truth." [...] Even the wife of the English ambassador, Lady Granville, felt compelled to report that the Parisians [...] "roar over Miss Smithson's Ophelia, and strange to say so did I". (The actress's Irish accent and the lack of power in her voice had hindered her success in London.) It wasn't long before new clothing and hair styles, à la mode d'Ophélie and modeled on those of the actress, became all the rage in Paris.|$|E
