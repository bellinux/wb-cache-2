25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>truly</b> grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>truly</b> thankful.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the light}} of this, Greco was quickly rearrested in February 1992 and put back behind bars to serve his freshly {{reinstated}} life-sentence. Greco never admitted his crimes nor his position in Cosa Nostra. In a letter sent to the press {{in the summer of}} 2007, he claimed he was [...] "as innocent as a newborn child." [...] He added that [...] "because of an injustice in the 1980s I have been buried alive and have been in prison for 22 years. The dampness of my cell has destroyed my health and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>truly</b> in a bad way." [...] He remained in prison in Rome until his death on 13 February 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tracks on}} I Need You {{were taken from}} various studio tracks {{released}} between 1999 and 2001, as well as B-sides tracks to help satisfy Rimes' recording contract obligations during litigation with the label and her management. During the litigation with her label, Rimes asked [...] "that Curb give Rimes the rights to all past recordings and videos, give up all publishing interests in her compositions and destroy all currently available recordings." [...] The album was publicly disowned by Rimes four days after its 2001 release, with Rimes stating that: [...] "his album was made without my creative input, it consists largely of unfinished material and songs that didn't make other albums ... I want to make abundantly clear to you that this album is not a reflection of myself as an artist but is solely the conception of Curb Records, and for that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>truly</b> and deeply sorry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Los Alamos National Laboratory {{scientist}} Wen Ho Lee {{was fired}} from his job, arrested, and held without trial for 278 days while his handling of sensitive nuclear information was investigated. Freeh accused him of downloading a [...] "portable, personal trove" [...] of US nuclear secrets. But ultimately Lee pleaded guilty to {{just one of the}} fifty-nine counts brought against him, after which he was freed from jail. At Lee's sentencing hearing, District Judge James A. Parker scolded the US government for its treatment of Lee, saying that the top decision makers in the case [...] "have embarrassed this entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of it" [...] and that they had been [...] "led astray" [...] by US government officials. Parker apologized to Lee, saying, [...] "Dr. Lee, you were terribly wronged by being held in pretrial custody in demeaning and unnecessarily punitive conditions. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>truly</b> sorry." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, after a {{long period}} of radio silence, the {{official}} Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale. Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET BUSINESS CONCERN wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties. [...] A message was also posted from Tim Smith's personal Facebook account: [...] Hello Kidz! (You will notice that I spelled the word kidz with a 'z'). I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. You have no idea what this means. Really though. While I would love to respond to each message, you are doubtlessly aware, my body is my enemy and my hands are cunts. Nonetheless it means the world to me, thank you all so much. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>truly</b> blessed.
