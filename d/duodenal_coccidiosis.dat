40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of Eimeria acervulina infection '(. <b>duodenal</b> <b>coccidiosis)</b> on cadmium<Cd) toxicity and zinc (Zn) status in the young chick. Additions of Cd (45 mg/kg) were made to diets that contained either 0 or 52 mg/kg supplemental Zn (from ZnC 03). <b>Duodenal</b> <b>coccidiosis</b> was produced by multiple crop inoculations of 4 X 10 s sporulated E. acervulina oocysts. Growth and efficiency of feed utilization were reduced by dietary Cd addition while concurrent coccidial infection reduced these parameters further. Addition of Cd also increased Cd content of liver and kidney and depressed hemoglobin, hematocrit, and plasma Zn content. Coccidial infection exacerbated tissue Cd deposition and depressed hematological parameters further. Although dietary Zn addition ameliorated some of the adverse effects of Cd toxicity, Cd administration tended to enhance tissue Zn deposition. Administration of Cd enhanced synthesis of metallothionein. (Key words: zinc, cadmium, <b>duodenal</b> <b>coccidiosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate the effects of Eimeria acervulina in-fection (<b>duodenal</b> <b>coccidiosis)</b> on the zinc (Zn) -calcium (Ca) -phytate interrelationship in the chick. Three supplemental levels of Ca (0,. 91, and 1. 82 %), two of Zn (0 or 52 mg/kg), and two of sodium phytate (0 or 1. 2 %) were evaluated as to their effects when added to completely adequate corn-soybean meal diets. <b>Duodenal</b> <b>coccidiosis</b> was produced by multiple crop inoculations of 4 X 10 s sporulated E. acervulina oocysts. Calcium supplementation depressed gain and efficiency of feed utilization, while Zn content of tissue and plasma was also lowered. Coccidial infection tended to reduce these values further. The addition of dietary phytate also depressed performance and deposition of Zn in tissue. Both excess dietary Ca and phytate addition to the diet markedly reduced plasma Zn concentration of birds fed corn-soybean meal diets unsupplemented with Zn. Addition of 52 mg/kg Zn, however, prevented excess Ca or phytate from exerting this effect. Parasitized chicks responded markedly with increased gain and gain/feed ratios when 52 mg/kg supplemental Zn was added to a 24 % protein corn-soybean meal diet containing 1. 82 % total dietary Ca. It is evident, therefore, that the Zn-antagonizing effect of excess Ca (in the presence of phytate) is exacerbated by <b>duodenal</b> <b>coccidiosis.</b> (Key words: calcium, zinc, phytate, chick growth, tissue mineral levels...|$|E
