40|$|Situated, {{interactive}} tutorial instructions give {{flexibility in}} teaching tasks, by allowing communication {{of a variety}} of types of knowledge in a variety of situations. To exploit this flexibility, however, an instructable agent must be able to learn different types of knowledge from different instructional interactions. This paper presents an approach to learning from flexible tutorial instruction, called situated explanation, that takes advantage of constraints in different instructional contexts to guide the learning process. This makes it applicable {{to a wide range of}} instructional interactions. The theory is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar, that learns new tasks and other domain knowledge from natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability: it can (A) take any command at each <b>instruction</b> <b>point,</b> (B) handle instructions that apply to either the current situation or a hypothetical one (e. g., conditionals), and (C) [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} refugee crises {{across the}} Middle East, Asia, and Africa {{have captured the}} world’s attention. Much of the existing discourse {{has focused on the}} humanitarian and security implications that this crisis will have, specifically for developed regions such as the European Union. This paper, on the other hand, seeks to explore this issue through a purely economic lens, focusing instead on the economic impacts that refugees have on the countries that receive them. Through exploring the existing academic and popular literature around historical and contemporary case studies, this paper has identified some of the key positive and negative economic effects that refugee crises can have on the host country. On the positive side, refugees can be a boon to the host country by (1) spurring long-term investment (2) filling needed demographic gaps (3) integrating effectively into the labor market (4) becoming productive economic consumers and producers and (5) by increasing bilateral trade with the country of origin. On the negative side, refugees can be a burden to the host country by (1) straining public and private services (2) causing physical and economic overcrowding and (3) increasing societal strife and the potential for civil conflict. The paper then turns to the contemporary refugee crisis in Lebanon by examining the relevance of these aforementioned positive and negative effects to the Lebanese case. Along the way, the paper provides policy recommendations that can be employed in the Lebanese case to amplify the positive benefits of refugees while mitigating the negative consequences. Ultimately, the paper hopes to use past refugee crises as an <b>instruction</b> <b>point</b> for how Lebanon can cope with its current crisis. By learning from past examples and applying existing literature to the current crisis, it is this author’s hope that the refugee crisis can be an eventual boon to the Lebanese economy...|$|E

40|$|Cet article est destiné à montrer que la méthode des Plans d'Expériences utilisée dans les {{laboratoires}} et les unités de fabrication est également applicable au calcul scientifique et en particulier, à la simulation informatique. Son emploi {{permet de}} réduire, dans une forte proportion, le nombre de passages informatiques. Il permet également d'écrire des modèles mathématiques empiriques qui orientent les recherches vers la bonne solution et qui fournissent une bonne image du phénomène étudié. The {{aim of this}} article is to show that Factorial Design, which is a commonly used method in laboratories and production units, can also be very successful for designing and computerized simulations. Computer runs can be reduced by a factor as great as four to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how a plant or a process runs. Simple models can then be constructed to provide a good image of the investigated phenomenom. The example given here is that of a plant processing raw Natural Gas whose outputs are a Sales Gas and an NGL which must meet simultaneously five specifications. The operator in charge of the simulations begins by defining the Experimental Range of Investigation (Table 1). Calculations (Table 1, Fig. 2) are set in a pattern defined by Factorial Design (Table 2). These correspond to the apices of the Experimental cube (Fig. 2). Results of the simulations are then reported on Table 3. These require analysis, using Factorial Design Theory, in conjunction with each specification. A graphical approach is used to define the regions for which each specification is met: Fig. 3 shows the zone authorized for the first specification, the Wobbe Index and Fig. 4 gives the results for the outlet pressure of the Turbo-Expander. Figs. 5, 6 and 7 show the zones allowed for the CO 2 /C 2 ratio, the TVP and the C 2 /C 3 ratio. A satisfactory zone is found, for this last ratio, outside of the investigated range. The results acquired so far enable us to define a whole new area where all specifications should simultaneously be met. This area has been found with the help of empirical mathematical models derived from the theory of Factorial Design. An <b>instruction</b> <b>point</b> is proposed (Fig. 8) and a confirmation run for these conditions has been made to show the validity of the model. With the use of Factorial Design, the computing budget was controlled with a number of simulations reduced by a factor of four compared to the more traditionnal approach. In addition to these savings, the engineer in charge now has a clear view of how the plant runs. He can now deal with various related problems without having to re-run simulations...|$|E
40|$|Objective – Part I of {{this paper}} aims to create a {{framework}} for an emerging theory of evidence based information literacy instruction. In order to ground this framework in existing theory, a holistic perspective views inquiry as a learning process that synthesizes information searching and knowledge building. An interdisciplinary approach is taken to relate user-centric information behavior theory and constructivist learning theory that supports this synthesis. The substantive theories that emerge serve as a springboard for emerging theory. A second objective {{of this paper}} is to define evidence based information literacy instruction by assessing the suitability of performance based assessment and action research as tools of evidence based practice. Methods – An historical review of research grounded in user-centered information behavior theory and constructivist learning theory establishes a body of existing substantive theory that supports emerging theory for evidence based information literacy instruction within an information-to-knowledge approach. A focused review of the literature presents supporting research for an evidence based pedagogy that is performance assessment based, i. e., information users are immersed in real-world tasks that include formative assessments. An analysis of the meaning of action research in terms of its purpose and methodology establishes its suitability for structuring an evidence based pedagogy. Supporting research tests a training model for school librarians and educators which integrates performance based assessment, as well as action research. Results – Findings of an historical analysis of information behavior theory and constructivist teaching practices, and a literature review that explores teaching models for evidence based information literacy <b>instruction,</b> <b>point</b> to two elements of evidence based information literacy instruction: the micro level of information searching behavior and the macro level of the learning task. On the micro level users are confronting information, and searching is seen as the entire process of the interaction of users with a series of information tasks, as described in Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process. The micro level is the level of deep understanding as critical thinking skills craft the connection between information and knowledge. On the macro level the learning task, designed by an instructional team, shapes the inquiry. It is the context for information tasks. The learning task is relevant, engaging, and rigorous to sustain the interest and interaction of the user with information and emerging knowledge. The macro level is the level of instruction whereby the learning task fosters self-reflection, self-correction, and self-regulation. The role of evidence, which is generated by performance assessment and action research, is critical to both levels. On each of these levels the learning task informs the information search. Conclusion – Evidence is the link between information and knowledge in the learning process called inquiry. Sources of this evidence are information tasks embedded in the learning task, which are nested in a teaching and learning culture of inquiry. In order to generate evidence continuously throughout the inquiry unit, the task is characterized by research-based tools such as performance-based assessment and action research. The synergy of these elements in Part 1 of this article establishes the foundation for building a theory that supports further research of evidence based information literacy instruction...|$|E
