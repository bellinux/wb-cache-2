50|$|Communication {{with the}} oral {{environment}} is maintained via {{the opening of}} the periodontal pocket. However, if the opening of a periodontal pocket becomes obstructed, as may occur if the pocket has become very deep (e.g. with furcation involvement), then plaque and calculus are trapped inside. Food packing may also obstruct a periodontal pocket. Food packing is usually caused by failure to accurately reproduce the contact points when dental restorations are placed on the interproximal surfaces of teeth. Another potential cause occurs when a periodontal pocket is scaled incompletely. Following this procedure, the gingival cuff tightens around the tooth, which may be enough to trap the bacteria left in the pocket. A <b>gingival</b> <b>retraction</b> cord which is accidentally left in situ is an occasional cause of a periodontal abscess.|$|E
50|$|The gingival cavity microecosystem, {{fueled by}} food {{residues}} and saliva, can support {{the growth of}} many microorganisms, of which some can be injurious to health. Improper or insufficient oral hygiene can thus lead to many gum and periodontal disorders, including gingivitis or periodontitis, which are major causes for tooth failure. Recent studies have also shown that anabolic steroids are also closely associated with gingival enlargement requiring a gingivectomy for many cases. Gingival recession is {{when there is an}} apical movement of the gum margin away from the biting (occlusal) surface. It may indicate an underlying inflammation such as periodontitis or pyorrhea, a pocket formation, dry mouth or displacement of the marginal gums away from the tooth by mechanical (such as brushing), chemical, or surgical means. <b>Gingival</b> <b>retraction,</b> in turn, may expose the dental neck and leave it vulnerable to the action of external stimuli, and may cause root sensitivity.|$|E
40|$|Fixed dental {{prosthesis}} success requires appropriate impression taking of the prepared finish line. This {{is critical in}} either tooth supported fixed prosthesis (crown and bridge) or implant supported fixed prosthesis (solid abutment).

Accurate marginal positioning of the restoration in the prepared finish line of the abutment is required for therapeutic, preventive and aesthetic purposes.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{two types of}} tests (tensile {{strength}} test and polymerization inhibition test) were performed to evaluate the {{physical and chemical properties}} of four impression materials &# 91;a polysulfide (Permlastic), a polyether (Impregum), a condensation silicone (Xantopren) and a polyvinylsiloxane (Aquasil) &# 9, 3; when polymerized in contact with of one conventional (Hemostop) and two experimental (Vislin and Afrin) <b>gingival</b> <b>retraction</b> solutions. For the tensile strength test, the impression materials were mixed and packed into a steel plate with perforations that had residues of the <b>gingival</b> <b>retraction</b> solutions. After polymerization, the specimens were tested in tensile strength in a universal testing machine. For the polymerization inhibition test, specimens were obtained after taking impressions from a matrix with perforations that contained 1 drop of the <b>gingival</b> <b>retraction</b> solutions. Two independent examiners decided on whether or not impression material remnants remained unpolymerized, indicating interference of the chemical solutions. Based on the analysis of the results of both tests, the following conclusions were reached: 1. The tensile strength of the polysulfide decreased after contact with Hemostop and Afrin. 2. None of the chemical solutions inhibited the polymerization of the polysulfide; 3. The polyether presented lower tensile strength after polymerization in contact with the three <b>gingival</b> <b>retraction</b> agents; 4. The polyether had its polymerization inhibited only by Hemostop; 5. None of the chemical solutions affected the tensile strength of the condensation silicone; 6. Only Hemostop inhibited the polymerization of the condensation silicone; 7. The polyvinylsiloxane specimens polymerized in contact with Hemostop had significantly lower tensile strength; 8. Neither of the chemical solutions (Afrin and Vislin) affected the tensile strength of the polyvinylsiloxane and the condensation silicone; 9.

Pieces of the cords were placed beside a metallic ruler and photographed standardly regarding to the distance and light. The measurements of the thickness were performed through imaging software (Adobe Photoshop CS 6 - Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA).

Retraction cords saturated with a 15. 5 % ferric sulfate solution were placed into the gingival sulcus and evaluated after 3 min and 10 min of exposure to the chemical agent. Excisional biopsies of the exposed gingival tissue were then obtained at intervals of 1 h, 24 h, and 7 days. For all specimens, histology evaluation was performed using light microscopy. Data collected from the microscopic images of all tissue specimens were analyzed by using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank and Kruskal-Wallis Tests. P value less than 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: Histopathologic examination of the biopsied gingival tissue revealed that the ferric sulfate solution caused significant tissue changes at the beginning of both the 3 -min and 10 -min gingival exposure time (P > 0. 05). However, the tissue returned to a normal histological appearance by the end of day 7 in all cases (P > 0. 05).

Material and Methods: The present study was a prospective, randomized, single-blind, clinical preliminary trial. Patients were randomized into two treatment groups. In Group A implants were placed immediately post-extrac - tion and in Group B six months after extraction. The following control time-points were established: one week, six months and twelve months after loading. Measurements were taken of peri-implant crevicular fluid volume, plaque index, <b>gingival</b> <b>retraction,</b> keratinized mucosa, probing depth, modified gingival index and presence of mucositis. Implant success rates were evaluated for the two groups. The study sample included fifteen patients (nine women and six men) with a mean average age of 63. 7 years. One hundred and forty-four implants were placed: 76 placed in healed sites and 68 placed immediately. Results: At the moment of prosthetic loading, keratinized mucosa width and probing depth were higher in im - mediate implants than delayed implants, with statistically significant differences.

Although the use of rubber-dam associated with a retractor clamp is a proper method for gingival separation—allowing operatory access to the cervical margin of the lesion [11]—attention might be taken to possible damage to the periodontal tissues.
