5|$|The 26 rongorongo texts with letter {{codes are}} <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> wooden objects, each with between 2 and 2320 simple glyphs and {{components}} of compound glyphs, for over 15,000 in all. The objects are mostly oblong wooden tablets, with the exceptions of I, a possibly sacred chieftain's staff {{known as the}} Santiago Staff; J and L, <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> reimiro pectoral ornaments worn by the elite; X, <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> various parts of a tangata manu ("birdman") statuette; and Y, a European snuff box assembled from sections cut from a rongorongo tablet. The tablets, like the pectorals, statuettes, and staves, were works of art and valued possessions, and were apparently given individual proper names {{in the same manner}} as jade ornaments in New Zealand. Two of the tablets, C and S, have a documented pre-missionary provenance, though others may be as old or older. There are in addition a few isolated glyphs or short sequences which might prove to be rongorongo.|$|E

5|$|Issues arose {{after the}} {{erection}} of the memorial concerning the names <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> the Cenotaph. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton men, {{and a number}} of women, who had died during the war and these had been <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> the Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument various relatives approached the committee requesting that additional names be added; after a newspaper campaign in the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, Kimber agreed to this and 203 additional names were inscribed in 1921. Another name was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of the Jewish war dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: one in ten adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. Following the final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, which featured a prominent Christian cross, Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial and only one Jewish name was finally <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> it.|$|E

40|$|Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage" (CICH) {{was adopted}} in the 32 nd Session of the UNESCO General Conference in 2003. This {{convention}} {{makes it possible to}} list the ICH for safeguarding. Satisfying some procedural criteria is required in order to <b>inscribe</b> <b>on</b> the list. In other words, the outstanding value of heritage isn 2 ̆ 7 t evaluated unlike the World Heritage Convention. We, therefore, should think how to make the effective list without evaluating the heritage value. In this point, this is one of valuable researches for the future of this convention. This paper discusses on the consent of communities, {{which is one of the}} required processes to <b>inscribe</b> <b>on</b> the several lists of CICH. A few issues are led through the analysis of existing state of the consent of communities. In conclusion, I suggest that each state parties should be required more awareness about the consent of communities and the guidelines for "free, prior and informed consent" (FPIC) related to ICH should be developed in order to make it more effective...|$|R
