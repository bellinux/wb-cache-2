They agree when faced with the threat of having to talk to each other, and arrive at a Fortune Megastore, a venture of wealthy Arthur Fortune (modelled on British {{entrepreneur}} Richard Branson). Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help him be loved by all.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to get Chris into Morningwood Academy, Peter is forced by Carter Pewterschmidt to appear in a remake of the 1997 comedy film Liar Liar. After Chris is {{accepted}} to Morningwood Academy, he is asleep in his bed for the night, and is suddenly attacked by a group of classmates, who stuff wads of <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> into their socks, and quickly begin beating him with the weapons. This scene is a parody of that of the infamous sequence shown in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket, in which the Marine recruits take turns striking Private Pyle with bars of soap wrapped in towels as punishment for frequently getting them in trouble.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a stencil drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were U.S. <b>dollar</b> <b>bills.</b> The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, <b>Dollar</b> <b>Bill</b> gets {{confronted by}} a man who works for St. Louis, a drug lord to whom <b>Dollar</b> <b>Bill</b> owes $60,000. He warns <b>Dollar</b> <b>Bill</b> if he doesn't make a payment of $10,000 to St. Louis, he will hunt him down. That same night, St. Louis comes to his club to collect. Little Man, who is the doorman of the club, tells St. Louis that <b>Dollar</b> <b>Bill</b> is not at the club and they leave. The next day as Dolla Bill tries to leave the club, he gets confronted by St. Louis' men, Brooklyn (Charlie Murphy) and KC (Terrence Howard). They beat him {{unconscious}} and throw him into the back of his car. Luckily for him, they are stopped by Freeman (John Amos) and Peters (Faizon Love), two crooked cops. <b>Dollar</b> <b>Bill</b> is found in the trunk and is arrested on warrants.|$|R
5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was filmed {{for the song}} and {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas. There are {{two versions of the}} video— one intercut with clips from the ABC series Dirty Sexy Money and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video. The video is set in a mansion, and starts with Gaga making her way down a hallway with several people who are either walking behind her, holding an umbrella over her, dancing in front of her, or tossing <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> around her. Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion. She is seen lying seductively on a table covered with money, crawling along a black grand piano and striking the keys with her leg several times, dancing around and later making out with a statue, and dancing in an elevator solo. There are also several close-up shots of her burning money and later stuffing it into her mouth. Over the course of the video, she undergoes numerous costume changes. Singer-songwriter Space Cowboy is also shown, most notably in scenes where he climbs a wall.|$|E
5|$|The coin, {{known as}} the Eisenhower dollar, proved unpopular with the public, and {{very few of the}} coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the Research Triangle Institute {{conducted}} a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, {{and the size of the}} dollar be reduced. Their report read in part: A conveniently-sized dollar coin would significantly broaden the capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means of balancing the half dollar, depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost-saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War economy catalyzed a {{shortage}} of United States coinage—gold and silver coins were hoarded given their intrinsic bullion value relative to irredeemable paper currency at the time. In late 1861, to help finance the Civil War, the U.S. government borrowed gold coin from New York City banks in exchange for Seven-thirties treasury notes and the New York banks sold them {{to the public for}} gold to repay the loan. In December 1861, the Trent Affair shook public confidence with the threat of war on a second front. The United States Department of the Treasury suspended specie payments and banks in New York City stopped redeeming paper money for gold and silver. In the absence of gold and silver coin, the premium for specie began to devalue paper currency. After the New York banks suspended specie payments (quickly followed by Boston and Philadelphia) the premium on gold rose from 1–3% over paper in early January 1862 to 9% over paper in June 1862, by which time one paper dollar was worth 91.69 cents in gold. This fueled currency speculation (e.g., redeeming banknotes for silver coin which was then sold at a premium as bullion), and created significant disruption across businesses and trade. Alternate methods of providing small change included the reintroduction of Spanish quarter dollars in Philadelphia, cutting <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> in quarters or halves, refusing to provide change (without charging a premium for providing silver coins), or the issuance of locally issued shinplasters (i.e., those issued by businesses or local municipalities) was forbidden by law in many states.|$|E
