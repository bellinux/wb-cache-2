5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E

500|$|The {{political}} climate in the United States and in Arizona {{in particular was}} pointed to by some observers as a possible contributing factor for the violent act. For example, Clarence Dupnik, Pima County Sheriff, initially expressed concern that overheated political rhetoric and violence may be related, observing, [...] "When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol {{that comes out of}} certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> outrageous." [...] He believed that Arizona had unfortunately become [...] "the capital" [...] of such feelings. [...] "We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry," [...] he said. But, Dupnik later said that he had no evidence that the killings were a result of anything particular which Loughner may have read or heard. International media referred to the {{political climate}} in the United States and the Palin map in particular. The French newspaper Le Monde said that the attack seemed to confirm [...] "an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right-wing opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence." [...] President Obama called the shooting an [...] "unspeakable tragedy", adding that [...] "such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society". Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the attack [...] "senseless and cruel violence" [...] and House Speaker John Boehner said, [...] "An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society". Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement noting, [...] "we in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own", with the death of Chief Judge John Roll.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said that}} [...] "The Break-Up" [...] was [...] "well put together", noting {{that it had}} [...] "ood set ups and good execution" [...] and that it [...] "gave us good comedy" [...] as it had [...] "plenty to work with." [...] In regards to the Liz and Dennis story, he admitted that while it was funny, it was [...] "fairly stereotypical." [...] Canning commented that Jack's relationship with Condoleezza Rice in the episode was a [...] "great concept" [...] and [...] "offered up {{a good number of}} chuckles", although [...] "it never became as clever as it appeared it was going to be." [...] Canning gave the episode a 6.5 out of 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich was complimentary towards the episode, reporting, [...] "Now this is what I'm talking about. Second-tier cast integration, multiple stories going on, intimations that Condoleezza Rice likes phone sex... Another winning week for NBC's 30 Rock." [...] Mitovich enjoyed the fact that Jack was in a relationship with Rice, writing that another show [...] "would build [...] whole episode around them" [...] but that 30 Rock [...] "made it that much funnier by playing it in the background and thus <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more outrageous with it." [...] Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that Alec Baldwin [...] "always knocks the ball out of the park on the acting front" [...] but noted that [...] "the best material" [...] in this episode belonged to the Tracy and Toofer story. [...] "The show does have a tendency to telegraph its punchlines, but it was nice to have the two men's differences resolved by finding the funny in a Star Jones/excessive vomiting sketch." [...] Ward was complimentary towards Jane Krakowski, observing that her [...] "comic timing" [...] in [...] "The Break-Up" [...] was [...] "impeccable as usual, but {{it would be nice to}} see her character get a tad more three-dimensional." [...] Amy Amatangelo of the Boston Herald enjoyed Dean Winters' appearances on the show, citing that he does a [...] "hilarious turn" [...] as Dennis, while the Houston Chronicles Mike McDaniel opined that Winters had a [...] "cene-stealing and hilarious role" [...] on the show.|$|E

2500|$|Clerks {{hired by}} each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given {{considerable}} leeway in the opinions they draft. [...] "Supreme Court clerkship {{appeared to be a}} nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s", according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School. [...] "As law has moved closer to mere politics, political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts", former federal court of appeals judge J. Michael Luttig said. David J. Garrow, {{professor of history at the}} University of Cambridge, stated that the Court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government. [...] "We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like the House of Representatives", Professor Garrow said.

He believed {{that the study of}} public administration could enable officials to increase governmental efficiency. He faulted political leaders who focused on philosophical issues and the nature of government and dismissed the critical issues of government administration as mere [...] "practical detail". He thought such attitudes represented the requirements of smaller countries and populations. By his day, he thought, [...] "it is <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> harder to run a constitution than to frame one." [...] He thought it time [...] "to straighten the paths of government, to make its business less unbusinesslike, to strengthen and purify its organization, and it to crown its dutifulness". He summarized the growth of such foreign states as Prussia, France, and England, highlighting the events that led to advances in administration.|$|E

2500|$|... 1985 {{was to see}} Keke Rosberg set {{the all-time}} Formula 1 {{qualifying}} lap record for 17 years after posting fastest qualifying time for the race with an average speed of 258.983km/h (160.92mph). Silverstone, which was already a very fast circuit, was becoming faster and faster and the cars were lapping the circuit in the low 1-minute range. The race was an exciting one with Brazilian rising star Ayrton Senna making a great start from 4th and taking the lead by the first corner. He led {{until late in the}} race, when his car was running out of fuel while Prost was pushing him hard; Senna eventually ran out of fuel and Prost went on to take victory. 1986 saw a huge crowd thanks to Mansell being a favourite to win; his newly found fame and place in a competitive team would help the British Grand Prix to see huge crowds for several years. This race saw 42-year-old Jacques Laffite get involved in a first corner accident and slam head-on into the barriers, breaking both his legs and ending his Formula One career. Nigel Mansell, whose car broke {{at the start of the}} first race, got into his teammate Piquet's spare car and won the race; although this was the last F1 race at Brands Hatch. A number of people had concerns about the speeds of the cars on the small track; particularly the European Grand Prix held at Brands Hatch the previous year. The southern English circuit was <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very fast- now with these 1,000+ hp, 1,180 pound cars, pole sitter Piquet's average qualifying speed was 140.483mph (227.583km/h) and his lap time was in the 1 minute 6-second range, compared to the 1 minute 20-second range in 1976. But Brands Hatch's demise was for political reasons- the international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts for one circuit per Grand Prix. Brands Hatch was perceived as a poorer facility, and considering most of the track was located in a very old forest it did have very little run-off and room to expand, something Silverstone had in acres. Silverstone and the BRDC had signed a seven-year contract with Formula 1 and FISA at some point in 1986, to run from 1987 to 1993.|$|E
