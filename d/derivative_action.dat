25|$|Although a PID {{controller}} {{has three}} control terms, some applications use {{only one or}} two terms to provide the appropriate control. This is achieved by setting the unused parameters to zero, and is called a PI, PD, P or I controller {{in the absence of the}} other control actions. PI controllers are fairly common, since <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> is sensitive to measurement noise, whereas the absence of an integral term may prevent the system from reaching its target value.|$|E
2500|$|In most {{commercial}} control systems, <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> {{is based}} on process variable rather than error. That is, {{a change in the}} setpoint does not affect the <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> [...] This is because the digitized version of the algorithm produces a large unwanted spike when the setpoint is changed. If the setpoint is constant then changes in the PV will be the same as changes in error. Therefore, this modification makes no difference to the way the controller responds to process disturbances.|$|E

40|$|Transactional {{class and}} <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> {{have long been}} {{controversial}} in both the popular and the academic literatures. Yet, the debate over such litigation has thus far neglected to consider a change in legal technology, adopted in Delaware a dozen years ago, favoring selection of institutional investors as lead plaintiffs in these cases.

Based on a hand-collected dataset of all Delaware class and <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> filed from November 1, 2003 to December 31, 2009, I find that institutional investors play as large of a role in these cases as they do in federal securities fraud class actions, leading 41...|$|R

40|$|In {{approving}} settlements of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> {{that include}} fees for plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s attorney, courts typically announce that attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees are approved if a substantial benefit is obtained. In fact, courts, particularly Delaware courts, approve settlements in shareholder <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> that included substantial fees for plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s attorney, despite {{the absence of}} a corresponding benefit to the corporation. Frequently, the 2 ̆ 2 benefit 2 ̆ 2 obtained is a reform in corporate governance, which is of dubious value to the corporation. To deter frivolous litigation, courts should resist the temptation to approve these settlements just to dispose of the litigation. The paper concludes that fees should not be approved unless the settlement (a) generates a common fund out of which such fees may be paid, (b) produces an intangible benefit reasonably susceptible of valuation, or (c) reflects a strong nexus between the relief sought in the complaint and the relief obtained...|$|R
