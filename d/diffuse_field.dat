40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{quiet zone}} design using ultrasonic transducers for local active control in pure tone <b>diffuse</b> <b>fields.</b> Most of researches in local {{active noise control}} used conventional loudspeakers for the secondary sources to produce quiet zones. Recently ultrasonic transducers {{have been used for}} the secondary sources to control the plane wave in active noise control. However there is no research related to active noise control in <b>diffuse</b> <b>fields</b> using ultrasonic transducers. Therefore this study uses ultrasonic transducers for the secondary sources to control the <b>diffuse</b> <b>fields.</b> The quiet zone produced using ultrasonic transducers in single tone <b>diffuse</b> <b>fields</b> has been analyzed through simulations in this work. The results showed that quiet zones created using ultrasonic transducers were larger than those created using conventional loudspeakers. This {{is due to the fact}} that the audible sound pressure produced by the ultrasonic transducers decays slowly with the distance. Therefore the secondary field created by an ultrasonic transducer could fit the pri-mary field better and the larger zone of quiet could be obtained using the ultrasonic transducer. Also the audible sound produced by the ultrasonic transducers is directional; therefore the sound pressure amplification outside the quiet zones was lower...|$|R

This approach is important for dosimetry specifically in realistic environments wherein <b>diffuse</b> <b>fields</b> can be prominent. For this application, {{the knowledge of the}} whole-body specific absorption rate is critical and can be determined from the human whole-body absorption cross section. The whole-body absorption cross section is obtained from measurements performed in a stirred-mode reverberating chamber processed with the high-resolution parameter estimator RiMAX. To validate the proposed approach and highlight its robustness, the whole-body absorption cross section of a cylindrical phantom is experimentally and numerically determined at 1800 MHz. For both methods, the whole-body absorption cross section is shown to be independent on the orientation of the transceivers, indicating that it is indeed caused by <b>diffuse</b> <b>fields.</b> A good agreement is obtained between experimental and numerical finite-difference time-domain results with a relative deviation of about 17 %.

Radiation-hydrodynamical calculations are performed by using operator splitting to combine Monte Carlo pho-toionization with grid-based Eulerian hydrodynamics that includes self-gravity. It is found that the <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> has {{a significant effect on}} the nature of radiatively driven collapse which is strongly coupled to the strength of the driving shock that is estab-lished before impacting the BES. This can result in either slower or more rapid star formation than expected using the on-the-spot approximation depending on the dis-tance of the BES from the source object. As well as directly compressing the BES, stronger shocks increase the thickness and density in the shell of accumulated material, which leads to short, strong, photo-evaporative ejections that reinforce the compres-sion whenever it slows. This happens particularly effectively when the <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> is included as rocket motion is induced over a larger area of the shell surface.

30|$|Since {{microtremor}} {{consists of}} both body and surface waves, a full-wave description is desirable {{to interpret the}} H/V. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>field</b> approximation {{is one of the}} promising theories to accomplish it. The <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> concept originated in acoustics and was firmly established for elasticity by Weaver (1982). But the roots of the idea {{can be traced back to}} the pioneering work of Aki (1957) who used ambient seismic noise (ASN) in the SPAC method (for spatial autocorrelation). The short-range cross-correlations of noise in a small array and its azimuthal average allow, through the argument of the Bessel function of zero order, to retrieve the phase velocity of Rayleigh waves. Aki’s pioneering work addressed first ideas and issues that were later formalized by Weaver (1982) as diffuse fields. The connection with 2 D elasticity was pointed out by Sánchez-Sesma and Campillo (2006). It has been proposed that the coda of earthquakes can be seen as a realization of a <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> (Shapiro et al. 2000; Hennino et al. 2001; Margerin 2009). In several instances, the ASN allows Green’s function retrieval from the average of cross-correlation between two receivers within a diffuse seismic field. Shapiro and Campillo (2004), Sabra et al. (2005), and Shapiro et al. (2005) confirmed that ASN is generally diffuse. We assert that the key of this fact lies in multiple scattering. The properties and the conditions of emergence of a <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> have been explored by many researchers worldwide (e.g., Weaver and Lobkis 2001; Sánchez-Sesma and Campillo 2006; Sánchez-Sesma et al. 2008). For the applications, the <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> assumption allows to get useful approximations of the Green’s Function from cross-correlation of recorded motions. Even Mulargia (2012) who claims that ASN is not diffuse accepts that it holds significant imaging properties. Based on the <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> approximation, the directional energy density is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green’s function when source and receiver coincide with each other both in position and direction (Sánchez-Sesma et al. 2008). The FW H/V is then expressed as the square root of the sum of imaginary parts of the horizontal components of Green’s function to that of the vertical counterpart (Sánchez-Sesma et al. 2011). In the <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> description, the imaginary part of the Green’s function incorporates naturally the contributions of both body (BW) and surface waves (SW). Therefore, an explanation on the origin of H/V is achieved by full-wave.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and experimental studies {{in a wide}} range of applications (ultrasonics, underwater acoustics, seismicoe) have demonstrated that Green's functions (impulse responses) can be extracted from cross-correlation of <b>diffuse</b> <b>fields</b> using only passive sensors. The technique, whose validity is supported by a physical argument based on time-reversal invariance, effectively uses a correlation process between the point source and points located in the focal zone. Indeed, the coherent noise source distributions can be considered as a timereversal mirror and the cross-correlation operations gives the field measured at one receiver after refocusing on the other receiver. Passive-only reconstruction of coherent Lamb waves (80 - 200 kHz) in an aluminum plate and thickness comparable to aircraft fuselage and wing panels will be presented.

30|$|We review briefly the {{relationship}} between ensemble average correlations within a <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> and the imaginary part of Green’s functions.

This is the sum of an emission episode at the source and the contribution of waves returning to the source. Various properties of the fields are the same for apparently different phenomena. Namely, the radiated energy due to the excitation of system at a point is closely related to the “projection” of the diffuse energy at such point, by means of correlations that extract the appropriate information from a ubiquitous <b>diffuse</b> <b>field.</b> One open problem is identifying and enhancing the diffuse properties of seismic ambient noise.
