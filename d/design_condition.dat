50|$|Good {{practice}} in industrial {{health and safety}} management requires that worker vibration exposure is assessed in terms of acceleration amplitude and duration. Using a tool that vibrates slightly {{for a long time}} can be as damaging as using a heavily vibrating tool for a short time. The duration of use of the tool is measured as trigger time, the period when the worker actually has their finger on the trigger to make the tool run, and is typically quoted in hours per day. Vibration amplitude is quoted in metres per second squared, and is measured by an accelerometer on the tool or given by the manufacturer. Amplitudes can vary significantly with tool <b>design,</b> <b>condition</b> and style of use, even for the same type of tool.|$|E
50|$|Also on July 19, the TSB issued another urgent safety {{advisory}} {{requesting that}} Transport Canada review Rule 112 of the Canadian Rail Operating Rules (CROR) and all related railway special instructions {{to ensure that}} equipment and trains left unattended are properly secured {{in order to prevent}} unintended movements. The TSB noted that most railway special instructions specify the minimum number of hand brakes needed in general operating conditions but not always for specific conditions. It is often left up to the operating employee to determine the number of hand brakes to apply. The employee must take into consideration the slope or grade of the track and the approximate tonnage of the equipment to be secured at a specific location. The TSB also noted that the effectiveness of the hand brake system varied from car to car depending on the <b>design,</b> <b>condition</b> and maintenance, and also from one operator to another due to differences in physical capability and personal technique. The TSB also stated that it is inadequate for railway operators to depend on the push-pull test to verify whether the hand brakes can hold the cars.|$|E

40|$|Voluntary Environmental Programs (VEPs) {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular in addressing environmental risks that are too complex to solve through traditional direct regulatory interventions. Whilst VEPs have attracted much scholarly attention, still little is known how they cause their outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the flow structures emanating from convergent-divergent nozzles with conical sections like {{those used in}} practical high-speed propulsion applications. LES simulations and experimental measurements {{in the form of}} PIV and shadowgraph imaging and far-field acoustic measurement are employed. The development of the supersonic jets from these nozzles are examined in underexpanded, perfectly expanded and overexpanded conditions. It is found that in addition to the shock diamond features expected of smoothly contoured nozzles at off-design conditions, these nozzles produce a second set of shock diamonds anchored at the nozzle throat and overlaid on the shock diamonds shed from the nozzle lip. These together form a double-diamond appearance. These nozzles do not exhibit any shock-free condition at or near the expected <b>design</b> <b>condition.</b> As a consequence, there is no absence of shock noise at or near the <b>design</b> <b>condition.</b> Near the <b>design</b> <b>condition</b> there is a diminution in the intensity of the screech tone, but no diminution in the broad-band shock-associated noise.
