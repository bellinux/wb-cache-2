50|$|<b>External</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> occur {{below the}} dentate or {{pectinate}} line. They are covered proximally by anoderm and distally by skin, {{both of which}} are sensitive to pain and temperature.|$|E
50|$|In about 40% {{of people}} with {{pathological}} hemorrhoids there are no significant symptoms. Internal and <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> may present differently; however, many people may have {{a combination of the}} two. Bleeding enough to cause anemia is rare, and life-threatening bleeding is even more uncommon. Many people feel embarrassed when facing the problem and often seek medical care only when the case is advanced.|$|E
50|$|Perianal hematoma, perianal thrombosis, anal vein thrombosis, or {{external}} hemorroidal thrombosis is a hematoma located in, {{or on the}} border of the anus. It is sometimes inappropriately referred to as an <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoid.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is a {{surgical}} excision of the hemorrhoid used primarily only in severe cases. It {{is associated with}} significant postoperative pain and usually requires 2-4 weeks for recovery. However, the long-term benefit is greater in those with grade 3 hemorrhoids as compared to rubber band ligation. It is the recommended treatment in those with a thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoid</b> if carried out within 24-72 hours. Glyceryl trinitrate ointment after the procedure helps both with pain and healing.|$|R
50|$|Hemorrhoids are {{typically}} diagnosed by physical examination. A visual {{examination of the}} anus and surrounding area may diagnose <b>external</b> or prolapsed <b>hemorrhoids.</b> A rectal exam may be performed to detect possible rectal tumors, polyps, an enlarged prostate, or abscesses. This examination {{may not be possible}} without appropriate sedation because of pain, although most internal hemorrhoids are not associated with pain. Visual confirmation of internal hemorrhoids may require anoscopy, insertion of a hollow tube device with a light attached at one end. The two types of <b>hemorrhoids</b> are <b>external</b> and internal. These are differentiated by their position with respect to the dentate line. Some persons may concurrently have symptomatic versions of both. If pain is present, the condition {{is more likely to be}} an anal fissure or an <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoid</b> rather than an internal hemorrhoid.|$|R
50|$|If not thrombosed, <b>external</b> <b>{{hemorrhoids}}</b> {{may cause}} few problems. However, when thrombosed, hemorrhoids {{may be very}} painful. Nevertheless, this pain typically resolves {{in two to three}} days. The swelling may, however, take a few weeks to disappear. A skin tag may remain after healing. If hemorrhoids are large and cause issues with hygiene, they may produce irritation of the surrounding skin, and thus itchiness around the anus.|$|E
5000|$|Hemorrhoids, {{also called}} piles, are {{vascular}} {{structures in the}} anal canal. In their normal state, they are cushions that help with stool control. They become a disease when swollen or inflamed; the unqualified term [...] "hemorrhoid" [...] {{is often used to}} refer to the disease. The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present. Internal hemorrhoids are usually present with painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating. <b>External</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> often result in pain and swelling {{in the area of the}} anus. If bleeding occurs it is usually darker. Symptoms frequently get better after a few days. A skin tag may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid.|$|E
40|$|Introduction:External {{hemorrhoids}} {{are located}} {{outside of the}} dentate line and covered by anoderm. Thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> {{are one of the}} frequent acute anorectal diseases which are treated successfully in the proctology outpatient room. The etiology of this disease is still unknown. Knowledge of the etiology of thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> could prevent recurrence of this disease and help prepare good prophylaxis. Material/Methods:A group of 50 patients with a diagnosis of thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> and treated in the Mikolaj Pirogow Regional Specialist Hospital in Lodz was interviewed by means of the author’s own questionnaire concerning demography and published hypothesis. The necessary statistics were conducted by means of STATISTICA 7. 1 and EXCEL 2008 programs. Results:The analysis of the survey results shows a significant relationship of thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> and presence of internal hemorrhoids, practice of anoreceptive sex and consumption of more alcohol products than usual. There was no statistical relationship between lifting heavy objects, eating spicy food, having hard stools or straining at toilet during motions and thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids.</b> Conclusions:This study confirmed three hypotheses on the causes of thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> which were presented in medical journals available in the MEDLINE database. The author of this article believes {{that it is necessary to}} conduct a multi-center study, which would explain the exact etiology of this disease. Knowledge about the etiology of thrombosed external disease would help develop effective prevention and treatment...|$|E
40|$|The most {{frequent}} clinical {{presentation of a}} juvenile polyp is painless rectal bleeding. We report {{a case of a}} 12 -year-old boy who presented with unexplained abdominal pain and difficulty defecating but no rectal bleeding. A digital rectal examination showed no <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoid,</b> anal fissure or other anal disease. However, a mass with stalk was detected about 5 cm above the anal verge. The mass suddenly exited the anus during the rectal examination and was diagnosed as a hamartomatous juvenile polyp on pathologic examination. Both a detailed patient history and a digital rectal examination might be necessary to evaluate the cause of unexplained abdominal pain and difficulty defecating in children and young people...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is {{associated}} with less postoperative pain and faster recovery. However, it {{may be associated with}} a greater risk of symptomatic recurrence. We hypothesized that undertaking a limited surgical excision of hemorrhoid disease after stapling may be a valid approach for selected patients. Aim: To compare long-term results after stapled hemorrhoidopexy with and without complementation with closed excisional technique. Method: In a retrospective uni-institutional cohort study, sixty-five (29 men) patients underwent stapled hemorrhoidopexy and 21 (13 men) underwent stapled hemorrhoidopexy with excision. The same surgeons operated on all cases. Patients underwent stapled hemorrhoidectomy associated with excisional surgery if symptoms attributable to <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoid</b> piles were observed preoperatively, or if residual prolapse or bulky external disease was observed after the firing of the stapler. A closed excisional diathermy hemorrhoidectomy without vascular ligation was utilized in all complemented cases. All clinical variables were obtained from a questionnaire evaluation obtained through e-mail, telephone interview, or office follow-up. Results: The median duration of postoperative follow-up was 48. 5 (6 - 40) months. Patients with grades 3 and 4 hemorrhoid disease were operated on more frequently using stapled hemorrhoidopexy complemented with excisional technique (95. 2 % vs. 55. 4 %, p= 0. 001). Regarding respectively stapled hemorrhoidopexy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy complemented with excision, {{there was no difference between}} the techniques in relation to symptom recurrence (43 % and 33 %, p= 0. 45) and median interval between surgery and symptom recurrence (30 (8 - 84) and 38. 8 (8 - 65) months, p= 0. 80). Eight (12. 3 %) patients were re-operated after stapled hemorrhoidopexy and 2 (9. 6 %), after hemorrhoidopexy with excision (p= 0. 78). Patient distribution in both groups according to the degree of postoperative satisfaction was similar (p= 0. 97). Conclusion: Stapled hemorrhoidopexy combined with an excisional technique was effective for more advanced hemorrhoid disease. The combination may have prevented symptomatic recurrence associated to stapled hemorrhoidopexy alone...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the results and the complications of the treatment of hemorrhoids with circular stapler with a follow-up of 18 months, and to review the complications in the literature. METHODS: From April 1998 to August 1999, 140 patients (83 males and 57 females) with an average age of 43. 8 years (range: 19 - 83 years) underwent haemorrhoidectomy using a circular stapler in three university hospital centers. The degree of hemorrhoids has been classified: three cases of degree II, 97 cases of degree III, and 40 cases of degree IV. All the patients were prospectively evaluated at two weeks, two and 18 months after surgery. RESULTS: The average length of the operation was 18 minutes (range: 8 - 60 minutes). Mean hospital stay was 36 hours (range: 8 - 72 hours). There was no intraoperative complication. There was no mortality. The postoperative complication rate was 7. 8 % (N = 11) : there were five cases of bleeding that two complicated by a submucosal hematoma (one was infected and needed a rectotomy on day 21), two cases of urinary retention, and two cases of <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoid</b> thrombosis. The bleeding occurred in the 12 hours after surgery except for one patient with antivitamin K whith presented a secondary bleeding on day 16. At 18 months, five patients presented a moderate asymptomatic stricture dilated on digital examination. Two patients complained of persistent skin tags. Neither functional trouble nor incontinence to gas, liquids, or solids was presented. With a mean follow-up of 40 months, 90 % (N = 112) of the patients were fully satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of hemorrhoids with circular stapler appears to be effective with 96 % of patients fully satisfied at 18 months. The morbidity rate was low, and no higher than the diathermy excision hemorrhoidectomy. The results are directly dependent on the practice that required a learning, and not on the technique itself...|$|R

40|$|Intersphincteric {{resection}} (ISR) is {{the ultimate}} sphincter saving procedure for low rectal cancer. Hemorrhoids are a common benign condition. We present and discuss a case of ISR which developed painful edematous hemorrhoids after ISR. A 62 -year-old female with low rectal cancer received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with successful down staging of tumor before undergoing robot assisted ISR with coloanal hand-sewn anastomosis. She had pre-existing <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> which were not excised. She developed painful and edematous <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> 4 days after surgery. These were treated conservatively before discharge. Many colorectal surgeons performing ISR have experienced similar situations in their patients, but none have reported on this phenomenon. We discuss the possible factors that may contribute to this situation. A possible solution is prophylactic excision of the hemorrhoids during coloanal anastomosis. Painful hemorrhoids may occur after ISR and if managed conservatively, the outcome is skin tags...|$|E

40|$|Hemorrhoids {{are normal}} {{vascular}} structures underlying the distal rectal mucosa and anoderm. Symptomatic hemorrhoidal tissues located above the dentate line {{are referred to}} as internal hemorrhoids and produce bleeding and prolapse. Thrombosis in <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> results in painful swelling. Symptomatic internal hemorrhoids that fail bowel management programs may be amenable to in-office treatment with rubber band ligation or infrared coagulation. Internal hemorrhoids that fail to respond to these measures or complex internal and external hemorrhoidal disease may require a surgical hemorrhoidectomy, either open or closed. A stapled hemorrhoidopexy treats symptomatic internal hemorrhoids and should be employed with care and only after thorough training of the surgeon because of the risk of rare, severe complications. The choice of procedure should be based on the patient's symptoms, the extent of the hemorrhoidal disease, and the experience of the surgeon...|$|E

We also identified the clinical parameters influencing pain during the TRUS examination. Materials and methods: Records were obtained from a prospective database for male patients who received TRUS of prostate in the outpatient department of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan, from January 2014 to June 2014. The patients underwent a detailed physical examination and medical history review. Immediately after the TRUS examination, the patients completed questionnaires based on a ten-point visual analog pain scale. The variables of interest were age, body mass index, prostate volume, prostate sagittal length, prostate-specific antigen, previous TRUS experience, <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids,</b> anal surgical history, prostate calcification, and image artifact caused by stool in the rectum. All variables were correlated to the visual analog scale by applying multivariate regression analysis. Results: By using linear regression analysis, we identified the independent factors that affected the pain score during the TRUS examination. The patients who received the examination for the first time or had longer prostate sagittal lengths, <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids,</b> anal surgical history, or stool stored in the rectum experienced more pain during the TRUS examination. Furthermore, the pain was reduced when we provided the patients with a detailed explanation before the procedure and allowed them to observe the real-time images during the examination. Conclusion: Although a TRUS examination is uncomfortable for patients, after having identified the factors affecting pain, physicians can assist patients in reducing pain during the procedure, thus providing higher quality examinations.

40|$|Objective: Evaluate the {{difference}} in the subjective pain of using different probes for transrectal ultrasound of prostate. Materials and Methods: From July 2014 to December 2014, patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) of prostate were randomly divided into two groups and using two different probes. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate subjective perception of pain in these patients. Results: A significant difference was found in VAS between the two groups. The patient felt less pain during TRUS examination when using a microconvex transducer. Additionally, patients with external hemorrhoid, longer prostate sagittal length, image artifacts caused by stool, and deeper probe insertion depth were all found to be associated with more pain. The usage of a microconvex transducer can help reduce pain for patients with <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids,</b> whereas {{there was no difference in}} pain perception when the patient had previous rectal surgery or image artifacts caused by stool.

40|$|Injection {{therapy has}} a long history of being used for the treat-ment of hemorrhoids. However, the {{previous}} results on injec-tion therapy for its complication rates and severity were not promising [1]. In this respect, aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) therapy could be a new promising option for the treatment of internal hemorrhoids [2]. However, some complications have been reported for ALTA therapy [3]. Thus, the learning of a precise surgical procedure and careful selec-tion of the patients are vital. In addition, over-dosage and injec-tion at an inappropriate location or depth frequently lead to se-rious complications. Application of ALTA therapy for the treat-ment of internal hemorrhoids may be a good choice, but still its efficacy for the treatment of <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> and skin tags is limited. Thus, the surgeon should consider combined therapy (a hemorrhoidectomy and ALTA therapy) for the treat-ment of mixed hemorrhoids. Even though ALTA therapy has better treatment results than PAO therapy, well-controlled sur-gery and patient selection are still needed.

40|$|Background: Hemorrhoids are {{a common}} {{pathology}} of the ano-rectal region and their treatment remains relevant. New minimally invasive methodsof surgical treatment of hemorrhoids have been developed recently. Transanal Doppler-Guided Hemorrhoidal Artery Ligation (DG-HAL) of internalhemorrhoids is an up-to-date minimally invasive surgical method of hemorrhoid treatment. In the Republic of Moldova, many patients seek medicalhelp only in advanced stages with large prolapse. It is not always possible to resolve the problem with minimally invasive methods. In medical literaturethere is little elucidation of the simultaneous combination of the DG-HAL method with the excision of external hemorrhoidal nodes. In the Republic ofMoldova this study is being carried {{out for the first}} time. The authors present the results of combined surgical treatment of patients with hemorrhoids. The combined method of surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease has been implemented in our country and the efficacy of the method for individualapproach has been demonstrated.

40|$|Background:  Manual hemorrhoidopexy {{is a new}} {{technique}} of treating second degree hemorrhoids. In contrast to the conventional resectional techniques (Milligan-Morgan), manual hemorrhoidopexy is a novel technique as described by T Carlo. It does not involve excision but plication with fixation of the prolapsing hemorrhoid. Objective:  To study the outcome of manual hemorrhoidopexy and to compare manual hemorrhoidopexy with the traditional hemorrhoidectomy. Methods:  This is a prospective study conducted over 16 months (January 2012 to April 2013) in the College of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital (COMS-TH), Bharatpur, Chitwan, Department of Surgery. The patients who presented with third degree internal-hemorrhoids on a random basis, and underwent either conventional hemorrhoidectomy (Group A) or Manual hemorrhoidopexy (Group B) by senior consultant surgeons were included. The patients who had <b>external</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> in addition to internal were excluded. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics were evaluated. Results:  Twenty five patients with median age group 42. 5 years underwent conventional (Milligan-Morgan) hemorrhoidectomy (Group A) and 25 patients with mean age of 40. 1 years underwent manual hemorrhoidopexy (Group B). Male patients were predominant in both groups. The patients in group A had more postoperative pain as compared to group B (as assessed by the visual analogue scale and requirement of post-operative analgesic) and this was statistically significant (p< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference}} among the other post-operative urinary retention. Twelve percent (n= 3) patients in group A had post-operative bleeding and only 4 % (n= 1) in group B which was statistically significant (p< 0. 001). Mean duration of hospital stay in group A was 2. 5 days as compared to 1. 5 day in group B. Median follow up in both the study group was 3 (2 - 4) months. Conclusion:  Manual hemorrhoidopexy has comparable outcomes in term of postoperative analgesic requirement, and post operative complications.
