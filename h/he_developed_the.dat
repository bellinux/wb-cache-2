5|$|Although critics panned the novel, Balzac {{remained}} steadfast in {{his belief}} that it provided an important look at philosophy, especially metaphysics. As <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> scheme for La Comédie humaine, he placed Louis Lambert in the Études philosophiques section, and later returned to the same themes in his novel Séraphîta, about an androgynous angelic creature.|$|E
5|$|Dan Dugan (born March 20, 1943) is an American audio engineer, inventor, {{and nature}} sounds recordist. He {{was the first}} person in {{regional}} theatre to be called a sound designer, and <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> first effective automatic microphone mixer: the automixer. Dugan's sound design work was acknowledged in 2003 with a Distinguished Career Award by the United States Institute for Theatre Technology.|$|E
5|$|John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute, KT, FRS (10 August 1793 – 18 March 1848), styled Lord Mount Stuart between 1794 and 1814, was {{a wealthy}} aristocrat and {{industrialist}} in Georgian and early Victorian Britain. <b>He</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> coal and iron industries across South Wales {{and built the}} Cardiff Docks.|$|E

5|$|Outside philosophy, Putnam {{contributed to}} {{mathematics}} and computer science. Together with Martin Davis <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem {{and he helped}} demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem. He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{followed}} the usual course {{of reading the}} law {{in order to obtain}} his license to practice. In 1756, he became an apprentice in the office of John Putnam, a leading lawyer in Worcester. In 1758, he earned an A.M. from Harvard, and the following year was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, having completed his studies under Putnam. From an early age, <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men which are scattered through his diary, which included his report of the 1761 argument of James Otis Jr. in the Massachusetts Superior Court as to the legality of Writs of Assistance. Otis's argument inspired Adams to the cause of the American colonies.|$|E
5|$|After the war Alvarez was {{involved}} in the design of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He {{was involved}} in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> Alvarez hypothesis which proposes that the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.|$|E
50|$|His {{principal}} works are: A társadolom alapoloci (The {{fundamental principles}} of human society), Budapest, 1864 in which <b>he</b> <b>develops</b> <b>the</b> ideas of Lacordaire and others against modern errors.|$|R
60|$|Everything {{would be}} fine if he didn't think it {{necessary}} to tack on the artistic temperament to his painting. <b>He's</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> idea that <b>he</b> has nerves and everything upsets them.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> also <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> minimal {{model and}} the {{fixpoint}} semantics of Horn clauses with Maarten van Emden. With Marek Sergot, <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> both <b>the</b> event calculus {{and the application of}} logic programming to legal reasoning. With Fariba Sadri, <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> an agent model in which beliefs are represented by logic programs and goals are represented by integrity constraints.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Libby {{accepted}} professorship at the University of Chicago's Institute for Nuclear Studies, where <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> {{technique for}} dating organic compounds using carbon-14. He {{also discovered that}} tritium similarly {{could be used for}} dating water, and therefore wine. In 1950, he {{became a member of the}} General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He was appointed a commissioner in 1954, becoming its sole scientist. He sided with Edward Teller on pursuing a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, participated in the Atoms for Peace program, and defended the administration's atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5|$|As <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> series, Kishimoto {{created the}} three primary {{characters}} {{as a basis}} for the designs of the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other shōnen manga as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. The characters that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen characters, although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the characters was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto's work in the manga and anime adaptations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} that <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> Baby Bombard and sent it off the War Office, Blacker was working for a {{government}} department known as MD1, which was given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe. Shortly after {{the trial of the}} Baby Bombard, Blacker was posted to other duties, and left the anti-tank weapon {{in the hands of a}} colleague in the department, Major Millis Jefferis.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>develops</b> <b>the</b> proposition, {{laid out}} in The Responsibility of Intellectuals, that the American {{intellectual}} and technical class, in universities and in government (the New Mandarins), bear major responsibility for the atrocities perpetrated by the United States in Vietnam.|$|R

5|$|Between 1859 and 1866, <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> {{theory of}} the {{distributions}} of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments {{in a better way}} than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on thermodynamics led him to devise the thought experiment that {{came to be known as}} Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{originally}} {{studied to}} be a dramatic actor, but {{became interested in}} improvisational theatre while attending Northwestern University, where he met Second City director Del Close. Colbert first performed professionally as an understudy for Steve Carell at Second City Chicago, where his troupe mates included Paul Dinello and Amy Sedaris, comedians with whom <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> sketch comedy series, Exit 57. He wrote and performed on the short-lived Dana Carvey Show before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series Strangers with Candy. He gained attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher Chuck Noblet.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Odine is a {{scientist}} and magic researcher from Esthar. He discovered the GFs and junctioning and engineered {{a machine that}} mimics Ellone's power. Seventeen years before the game, <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> necessary technology to allow Laguna to entomb Adel. As a researcher of the Lunatic Pandora, he also helps {{to prevent it from}} reaching Tears' Point and initiating a Lunar Cry. Odine also plays a role in the plot to destroy Ultimecia, explaining how to survive time compression.|$|E

50|$|Working for Fremantle Media <b>he</b> helped <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> show Na Wspólnej.|$|R
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> {{symbolic}} {{view of the}} Eucharist. He {{denied the}} Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and following Cornelius Henrici Hoen, he agreed that the bread and wine of the institution signify and do not literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Zwingli's differences of opinion on this with Martin Luther resulted in {{the failure of the}} Marburg Colloquy to bring unity between the two Protestant leaders.|$|E
5|$|His early {{stand-up}} career led {{to supporting}} roles on television shows, during which <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> {{character of a}} hapless middle-class bachelor. In 1993, Carey had a small role in the film Coneheads as a taxi passenger. In 1994, Carey co-starred with John Caponera in The Good Life, a short-lived sitcom on NBC. After the show was cancelled, Bruce Helford, a writer on the show, hired Carey as a consultant for the television show Someone Like Me.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Rabi {{returned}} to the United States, where Columbia offered him a faculty position. In collaboration with Gregory Breit, <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> Breit–Rabi equation and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm {{the properties of the}} atomic nucleus. His techniques for using nuclear magnetic resonance to discern the magnetic moment and nuclear spin of atoms earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. Nuclear magnetic resonance became an important tool for nuclear physics and chemistry, and the subsequent development of magnetic resonance imaging from it has also made it important to the field of medicine.|$|E
25|$|Information-ideological geopolitical {{development}} concept: {{proposed in}} 2008 {{in his book}} Information warfare {{for the future of}} Russia, where <b>he</b> <b>develops</b> <b>the</b> basic ideas of Eurasian integration.

5|$|In {{philosophy}} of mind, Putnam {{is known for}} his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem. In {{philosophy of}} language, along with Saul Kripke and others, <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a famous thought experiment called Twin Earth.|$|E
5|$|Jones had {{previously}} developed a gruesome game called Go to Hell. In an interview Jones stated that <b>he</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> game {{for his own}} amusement; he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game. The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics. Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and akin to a horror movie by others.|$|E
5|$|Kerst {{returned}} to the University of Illinois after the war. From 1953 to 1957 he was technical director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association, where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts, most notably the FFAG accelerator. <b>He</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> spiral-sector focusing principle, which {{lies at the heart}} of many spiral ridge cyclotrons that are now in operation around the world. His team devised and analysed beam stacking, a process of radio frequency acceleration in fixed field machines that led to the development of the colliding beam accelerators.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> also <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> fixed {{cassette}} distance which standardized magnification and serial superimposition.|$|R
50|$|His poetic ambitions {{resulted}} in the poem called Le Bonheur (published posthumously, with an account of Helvétius's life and works, by Jean François de Saint-Lambert, 1773), in which <b>he</b> <b>develops</b> <b>the</b> idea that true happiness is only {{to be found in}} making the interest of one person that of all.|$|R
50|$|In 1928 he {{published}} Zur Frage der Struktur und Konstitution der Feldspäte, {{a paper in}} which <b>he</b> <b>develops</b> <b>the</b> concept of the atomic structure of silicates and formulates the construction principle of feldspars.
