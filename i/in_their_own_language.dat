5|$|A {{tradition}} of indigenous literacy in Ottawa {{arose in the}} 19th century, as speakers of Ottawa on Manitoulin Island became literate <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language.</b> Manitoulin Island Ottawas who were Catholic learned to write from French Catholic missionaries using a French-influenced orthography, while Methodist and Anglican converts used English-based orthographies. Documents written in Ottawa by Ottawa speakers on Manitoulin Island between 1823 and 1910 include official letters and petitions, personal documents, official Indian band regulations, an official proclamation, and census statements prepared by individuals. Ottawa speakers from Manitoulin Island contributed articles to Anishinabe Enamiad ("the Praying Indian"), an Ojibwe newspaper started by Franciscan missionaries and published in Harbor Springs, Michigan between 1896 and 1902.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language.</b> A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E
