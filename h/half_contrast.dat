A central thesis is that other primates, although having memory and expectation, do not possess the same ability {{to live in the}} past or in the future. The first half of this paper argues that reconstructive access to the past (i. e. episodic memory) is dependent on other advanced cognitive capabilities (e. g. self-awareness and meta-representation) and focuses on the results of recent `theory of mind 2 ̆ 7 research in order to evaluate the thesis. Mental simulation is the proposed underlying mechanism for the development of both mindreading and mental time travel.

Thus, the peak of the activity of deltoid shows those two motions of grasping a handgrip and opening upper arm in the latter half. In addition, according to the ratio of force on armrest, the armrest supports about 40 [%] of weight around the time T 2 when the subject left seat and on the other hand, the ratio declines at the latter half of motion. We found that the subject has kept the posture of upper body which she leans against an armrest, because the armrest has received a load continuously until T 3 when an armrest height equals the lliocristale height of a subject. It means that the armrest pushed the upper body upward and the lower limbs has stretched. Therefore, we regard the posture at the time T 3 as closing to upright.|$|R
