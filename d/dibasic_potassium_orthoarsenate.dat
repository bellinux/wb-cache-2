40|$|Anticapsin {{is a new}} {{fermentation}} product which inhibits {{formation of}} the hyaluronic acid capsule of Streptococcus pyogenes. Production of this metabolite in a complex medium by S. griseoplanus is enhanced by high levels of carbohydrate. A number of carbon sources support biosynthesis but sucrose is most effective, the optimum level being 150 g/liter. Neither glucose nor fructose, alone or in combination, serves as an equivalent substitute for sucrose. The addition of <b>dibasic</b> <b>potassium</b> phosphate to the medium further increases anticapsin production. Dissolved oxygen levels are important for synthesis and stability of the metabolite. Anticapsular activity diminishes rapidly in previously aerated broths which are held under static conditions. This decrease does not occur in pasteurized broths or unpasteurized filtrates...|$|R
40|$|The electrooxidation of 1, 2 -benzopyrone (BP) was {{assessed}} via linear voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on a glassy carbon electrode in <b>dibasic</b> <b>potassium</b> phosphate buffer. The oxidation process for BP requires one electron and forms a ketone. This oxidation product was adsorbed by the electrode surface {{to form a}} film that blocks active sites and increases in thickness over consecutive measurements. The oxidation conditions were optimized using factorial design and Doehlert matrices. This electrochemical method was compared to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which has a detection limit of 26. 4 µmol L- 1 for BP. The voltammetric results were statistically similar to those from HPLC; however, the method was faster, simpler, more easily acquired, more sensitive, and required less organic solvent...|$|R

Three seeds were placed in plastic pots {{containing}} 9.0  kg of the soil sample from the surface layer. Thinning was performed 10 days after emergence (DAE), and 1 plant per pot was maintained. Harvesting took place 60 and 62 DAE for ‘Grafite’ and ‘Bonus,’ respectively. For both the experiments, the equivalent of 35  kg ha− 1 of P (<b>dibasic</b> <b>potassium</b> phosphate), 25  kg ha− 1 of K (as potassium chloride), and 20  kg ha− 1 of N (as urea) were applied in furrows immediately before sowing. Liming with 2000  kg ha− 1 of calcium carbonate was performed in each pot immediately before sowing. An additional 13.5  kg ha− 1 of N (as urea) fertilizer was applied at 25 DAE.|$|R
40|$|Porous anodic films, with {{pore size}} of ~ 10 nm, have been {{developed}} by anodizing of magnetron sputtered Ti- 25 at % Si alloy at constant formation voltages in glycerol electrolyte containing <b>dibasic</b> <b>potassium</b> phosphate at 433 K. The films, of amorphous structure, contain titanium and silicon species, as units of TiO 2 and SiO 2, throughout the film thicknesses, with negligible amounts of phosphorus species. The silicon is enriched in the film relative to {{the composition of the}} alloy, the level of enrichment suggesting that anion migration is increased in comparison with amorphous film growth at ambient temperature. In contrast to the behaviour of the alloy, essentially barrier films were formed on commercially pure titanium in the glycerol electrolyte, when a main anodic reaction was generation of oxygen, which was probably promoted by the development of anatase...|$|R
40|$|A 30 - day feeding {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy of selected sources of inorganic phosphorus in a diet compounded for juvenile Penaeus indicus. The phosphorus sources tested were calcium phosphate dibasic, sodium phosphate monobasic, potassium phosphate monobasic and a mixture of calcium phosphate <b>dibasic</b> and <b>potassium</b> phosphate monobasic in the ratio 1 : 1. Ihe efficacy ol the diets was evaluated in terms of weight gain, food conversion ratio (FCR), apparent feed digestibility coefficient and apparent phosphorus digestibility. No significant differences were observed among the treatments (P> 0. 05) in the response parameters recorded. However the best specific growth rate (4. 05 + 0. 32), apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of the diet (93. 58 ± 2. 05) and apparent digestibility of phosphorus (ADP) (55. 08 ± 2. 05) were recorded for shrimps fed the diet supplemented with sodium phosphate monobasic. but the best FCR (2. 00 ± 0. 33) was observed with the diet supplemented {{with a mixture of}} calcium phosphate <b>dibasic</b> and <b>potassium</b> phosphate monobasic in the ratio 1 : 1.

40|$|In 1816, Adolf Weil {{described}} the first recognized leptospiral infections in humans. 1 These cases {{were caused by}} Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae and the disease was subsequently named Weil's Disease. 1 Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, having its reservoir in wild, domestic, and peridomestic animals. Infection usually results from direct or indirect exposure to the urine of leptospiruric animals. 2 Indirect exposure through contaminated water and soil accounts for most sporadic cases. Direct exposure occurs in pet owners, veterinarians and persons working with livestock. 3 The basal medium and enrichment are prepared according to the formulations described by Ellinghausen and McCullough 4 as modified by Johnson and Harris. 5 They modified the formula by replacing rabbit serum medium with polysorbate 80 -albumin. Leptospira Medium EMJH was used in cultivation studies of Leptospira. 6 Leptospira Medium EMJH is recommended for the clinical isolation of Leptospira. 7, 8 PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE Leptospira Medium Base EMJH contains ammonium chloride, a nitrogen source, and thiamine, a growth factor. Sodium phosphate <b>dibasic</b> and <b>potassium</b> phosphate monobasic are buffering agents. Sodium chloride maintains the osmotic balance of this formula.

40|$|Medium organ bioassays {{to shorten}} the {{experimental}} duration with unilateral nephrectomy for early detection of renal tumors were investigated in male Wistar rats after N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethylnitrosamine (EHEN) administration. Animals were fed 1000 ppm EHEN diet for 2 weeks and the left kidney was removed at week 3. They received several promoting agents and non-promoting agents as negative control for 18 weeks. Within {{a relatively short period}} of 20 weeks, the promoting effect on rat renal tumorigenesis can be detected as a significant increase of preneoplastic lesions, such as simple or adenomatous hyperplasias with increased levels of 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) -labeled renal cortical tubular epithelia. Various kinds of salts and metals contained in the diet were tested at concentrations more than 20 times the normal doses in a preliminary experiment for nephrotoxicity over 8 weeks. <b>Potassium</b> <b>dibasic</b> phosphate (PDP), <b>potassium</b> aluminum sulfate (PAS) and copper sulfate (CS) induced nephropathy. Therefore, these three salts were investigated in this medium-term bioassay for renal tumorigenesis. Treatment with 5 % PDP induced renal calcification with severe nephropathy and promoted the development of preneoplastic lesions, but that with 5 % PAS or 0. 5 % CS did not. To study the effect of alkalization on renal mineralization，animals concomitantly received 5 % potassium citrate (PC). The addition of PC to PDP diet reduced the promoting effect on renal tumorigenesis; also indicated was retardation of renal calcium by histology, serum biochemistry and urinalysis. The promoting effects of PDP and inhibitory effects of PC were correlated to BrdU-labeling indices. Immunohistochemical study was used to examine α₂ᵤ-globulin accumulation; however, PDP-induced nephropathy did not appear to be related to α₂ᵤ globlin, as evidenced by the negative results. A pathogenesis for renal carcinogenesis is suggested in which nephropathy associated with mineralization enhanced the development of renal cell tumors...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} {{morphological}} {{investigation of the}} parathyroid gland of mice at abnormal salt and steroid hormone environments produced by administration of various salts and steroid hormones. The results are summarized as follows. 1) Under the hypercalcemic circumstances induced by administration of calcium chloride, parathyroid hormone or calcium lactate, the parathyroid gland showed generalized hypoplasia, atrophy and decrease of the clear cells, increase of dark cells, atrophy of the Golgi apparatus and complete absence of mitosis. 2) Under the hyperphosphatemic circumstance induced by administration of dibasic sodium phosphate or <b>dibasic</b> <b>potassium</b> phosphate or by renal incineration, the parathyroid gland showed marked generalized hyperplasia, hypertrophy and increase of the clear cells and their nuclei, decrease of the dark cells, hypertrophy of the Golgi apparatus and presence of many mitotic figures. 3) With administration of potassium chloride or sodium chloride, hyperplasia of the tissue and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the clear cells were observed with the former, while these changes were not so distinct with the latter. 4) The influence to the parathyroid gland was more evident with diffusible inorganic calcium than with organic calcium. 5) In the parathyroid gland of mice, very little lipid could be demonstrated, PAS positive granula and alkaline phosphatase activity were weakly shown and only small amount of RNA was recognized. 6) On {{the basis of the}} results described in 1) and 2), generalized tissue hyperplasia, especially hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the clear cells and decrease of the dark cells represent hyper parathyroid state, while atrophy and decrease of the clear cells and increase of the dark cells report hyper parathyroid state. The acidophilic cells are supposed to bave 1 ess relation to calcium and phosphorus metabolism of the parathyroid gland. 7) The proliferation of the parathyroid gland was found to be accomplished by hyperplasia of the subcapsular fibroblastoid cells developing into dark cells followed by turning into clear cells after their mitosis or by decrease of nuclear chromatin of dark cells shifting into clear cells. In hyper functioning state, the clear cells proliferated with mitosis, while' in hypo functioning state a reverse shifting from clear cells to dark cells was also demonstrated. 8) Hypo physectomy: Following hypophysectomy, the parathyroid gland showed increase in number of the dark cells and marked atrophy of the tissue and cell nuclei despite less decrease in number of the clear cells. These alterations suggested development of hypoparathyroidism. 9) Administration of ovarian follicle hormones: Following administration of a-estradiol,. hexestrol or acrylonitril-derivatives atrophy of tissue, decrease of the clear cells and atophyof nuclei, representing probable hypoparathyroid state, were observed with the former two' hormones. With acrylonitril derivatives, hyperplasia of the tissue and nuclei and marked increase of clear cells were observed, despite marked weightloss, suggesting probable develop-ment of hyperparathyroid state. 10) Administration of male sexual hormones: Following administration of methylandro-, stendiol, methyltestosterone or testosteron propionate generally the parathyroid tissue showed, hyperfunctioning histological pictures. This effect was especially intense with methylandro-, stendiol followed by in the order of methyltestosterone and testosterone propionate. 11) Administration of corpus lutein hormone: Following administration of corpus lutein hormone the parathyroid gland showed marked hyperfunctioning pictures which was next to that following methylandrostenediol. 12) Administration of adrenocortical hormones: Following administration of cortisone, despite marked weightloss, the parathyroid gland demonstrated hyper unctioning histological pictures with tissue hyperplasia and proliferation and hypertrophy of the clear cells. Following administration of DOCA the histological pictures were that in hypofunctioning state although, its was only slight in degree. 13) Gonadectomy: Following gonadectomy the parathyroid gland showed hyper unctioning state with hyperplasia of the tissue. 14) Hypophysectomy combined with administration of steroid hormone or gonadectomy : Hypoparathyroid state following hypophysectomy, which was described in 8), was further intensified by combination of administration of estradiol, hexestrol or DOCA. However, development of the post-hypophysectomy hypoparathyroidiom was slightly prevented by combination of gonadectomy, or administration of acrylonitril derivatives, methylandrostandiol, cortisone or progesterone. The results suggest that these steroid hormones have direct effect to the parathyroid gland without through the pituitary gland. The experimental results clearly demonstrated that parathyroid function is not only intensively influenced by blood calcium and phosphorus levels and kidney functions, but also is closedly related to other endocrine organs such as pituitary, ad rena Is and gonadal glands. It is supposed that the pituitary gland, adrenal cortex (cortisone) and testicle have accelerating actions upon the parathyroid gland, while the adrenal cortex (DOCA) and ovary have inhibiting works...|$|R
