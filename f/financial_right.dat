The success of this process is related to the integrated performance of the external control from the public administration.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} and how the {{allocation}} of <b>financial</b> transmission <b>rights</b> affects the behavior of electricity generators and electricity consumers with market power in the electricity market. The analysis recognizes that the ultimate allocation of rights is endogenous, depending both on whether transmission rights can enhance market power and the microstructure of the rights market. Three alternative rights market microstructures are examined. The analysis initially focuses on a two-node network where there are cheap supplies available in an exporting region, expensive supplies in an importing region, and a congested transmission link between the two regions. Several other market power configurations are examined in less detail. We find that the allocation of <b>financial</b> <b>rights</b> can enhance the market power of generators at the expensive node and of electricity buyers at the cheap node. <b>Financial</b> <b>rights</b> can also mitigate market power of buyers at the expensive node and of sellers at the cheap node. However, {{when there is a}} monopoly at the expensive node, allocating <b>financial</b> <b>rights</b> to it need not affect its behavior since it may extract all of the congestion rents without possessing <b>financial</b> <b>rights.</b> Whether and how many rights will be allocated through the rights market to agents that can use them to enhance market power turns on the microstructure of the rights market and, in particular, on the extent of free riding on the potential monopoly rents accruing to rights holders. Extending the analysis to a three-node network to allow for loop flows does not change the basic results. Alternative regulatory rules that would restrict who can acquire rights are examined. A companion paper extends this analysis to the situation where physical rather than <b>financial</b> <b>rights</b> are utilized and compares the welfare properties of <b>financial</b> and physical <b>rights</b> from a market power enhancement perspective.

40|$|This report, based {{primarily}} on open-ended interviews with 40 people living in Essex affected by the 2013 UK Welfare Reform Act, analyses the financial, subjective and social effects of Welfare Reform on those participants. Almost all participants were affected by having to pay the Spare Room Subsidy (?bedroom tax?) and council tax contributions which had reduced weekly incomes, after paying utility bills, to as little as 10 or 20 pounds, meaning that spending on food and heating was squeezed to less than a minimum, and that many participants had fallen into severe debt with utility companies and housing providers. Many participants had also {{been affected by the}} Reforms through being re-categorised as available for work from their previous status as disabled and unable to work. These penalties and re-categorisations had made the UK welfare system increasingly precarious and conditional and this was interpreted by many as form of punishment for life events over which they felt they had little control. The result was high levels of stress which participants felt had affected their physical health and their ability to ?take control? of their lives. However, despite the financial problems occasioned by, in particular, the Spare Room Subsidy, most participants preferred to pay the penalty rather than move to a smaller dwelling. Not moving was largely due to perceptions of needing a ?spare? room due to disability or family responsibilities, strong attachments to local communities and dwellings in which they had lived, often, for decades, and the lack of suitable alternatives. Reforms were also seen by participants as strengthening the discourse on welfare claimants as scroungers and liars, which had a further insidious effect on participants? self-identity and mental health. This stigma was also experienced directly through what participants? saw as the belittling attitude of welfare agency workers, their bureaucracy, and an associated lack of consistent information about the Reforms. Despite this, because of the political narrative about welfare claimants as liars and scroungers, almost all participants thought that Welfare Reform was necessary. Yet, participants felt that the reforms had been aimed at the wrong people i. e. people like themselves who had a moral and <b>financial</b> <b>right</b> to adequate welfare...|$|E

When <b>financial</b> transmission <b>rights</b> are assigned to the grid operator, my model, {{in contrast with the}} models available in the literature, works out the equilibrium for any transmission capacity. Moreover, I have found that an increase in transmission capacity not only increases competition between markets but also within a single market. When <b>financial</b> transmission <b>rights</b> are assigned to the firm that submits the lowest bid in the spot electricity auction, firms compete not only for electricity demand, but also for transmission rights and the arbitrage profits derived from its hold. I have found that introduce competition for transmission rights reduces competition in spot electricity auctions. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{whether and}} how the {{allocation}} of transmission rights {{associated with the use}} of electric power networks affects the behavior of electricity generators and electricity consumers with market power. We consider two alternative types of transmission rights: (1) <b>financial</b> <b>rights</b> which give the owner a share of the congestion charges which accrue to the network operator when the network is congested and (2) physical rights which give the owner the right to utilize scarce transmission capacity without paying additional congestion charges. The analysis first focuses on a two-node network where there are cheap generation supplies available in an exporting region, expensive generation supplies controlled by a single firm in an importing region, and a congested transmission link between the two regions. We find that holding <b>financial</b> <b>rights</b> enhances the market power of a monopoly generator in the importing region. The ultimate allocation of rights depends on the microstructure of the rights market through the ability of initial rights holders to free ride on generators with market power enhancing the value of the transmission rights. We next examine {{whether and how}} reliance on physical rather than <b>financial</b> <b>rights</b> affects these results. We find that holding physical rights can both enhance the market power of a generator in the importing region and lead it inefficiently to restrict imports of cheap power from the exporting region by "withholding" some physical rights from the rights market. Inefficient withholding of physical rights leads us to consider "capacity release" rules which mitigate withholding. These results are summarized with a comparison of the welfare properties of <b>financial</b> and physical <b>rights</b> with and without capacity release rules. The paper concludes with discussions of extensions to alternative buyer and seller market power configurations and to a three-node network to incorporate loop flow considerations. The extension to the three-node network does not change the basic conceptual results, but does reveal complications with the use of physical rights in the presence of loop flow.
