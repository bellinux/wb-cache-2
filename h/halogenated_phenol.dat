40|$|Altered {{inactivation}} kinetics in {{skeletal muscle}} Na(+) channels due to mutations in the encoding gene are causal for the alterations in muscle excitability in nondystrophic myotonia. Na(+) channel blockers like lidocaine and mexiletine, suggested for therapy of myotonia, do not reconstitute inactivation in channels with defective inactivation in vitro. We {{examined the effects}} of four methylated and/or <b>halogenated</b> <b>phenol</b> derivatives on one heterologously expressed inactivation-deficient Paramyotonia congenita-mutant (R 1448 H) muscle Na(+) channel in vitro. All these compounds accelerated delayed inactivation of R 1448 H-whole-cell currents during a depolarization and delayed accelerated recovery from inactivation. The potency of these effects paralleled the potency of the drugs to block the peak current amplitude. We conclude that the investigated phenol derivatives affect inactivation-deficient Na(+) channels more specifically than lidocaine and mexiletine. However, for all compounds, the effect on inactivation was accompanied by a substantial block of the peak current amplitude...|$|E

It was proposed that the mode of action involved and alteration of thyroid physiology by the metabolites of the pesticides, namely <b>halogenated</b> <b>phenols.</b> Studies were carried out {{to determine the effect}} of tri-halogenated phenols and pyridinols upon T 4 -binding to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and to liver mitochondria isolated from male rats. Using the rat as a model, feeding trials were performed to determine the effect of <b>halogenated</b> <b>phenols</b> and pyridinols on rate of gain, relative thyroid weight, thyroid histology, and serum- T 4 levels. In vitro results with BSA indicated that the mechanism could have involved competition between T 4 and the phenol for the T 4 -binding site(s) of serum proteins, thus possibly lowering the serum-T 4 level. This was not well substantiated by in vivo measurements of serum-T 4 levels from rats fed varying concentrations of <b>halogenated</b> <b>phenols.</b> The methods employed to determine the effect of halophenols upon r 4 binding to mitochondria indicated that these compounds are poor competitors for the T 4 -binding site on mitochondria.

In order to achieve the best yield in TBP degradation, an experimental design was applied for multivariate optimization of the experimental degrading system variables. At optimized concentrations, the CAT- driven Fenton reaction yielded 75 % TBP degradation in 2 h at room temperature. The multivariate optimization showed that the highest TBP degradation (1 mol base) was obtained at a ratio of CAT: FeCl 3 : H 2 O 2 = 0. 150 : 0. 211 : 5. 100 at pH = 3. 4. A time course degradation of TBP comparing the CAT-driven Fenton reaction with the classical Fenton reaction is also presented.

Thirty-five pregnant dairy cows were treated in this study with nitroxynil (340 mg/mL solution for injection) at the recommended dose of 10 mg/kg body weight {{at the start of}} the dry period, i. e. 53 to 74 days before the expected calving. Calving occurred between 43 days and 79 days after treatment. The concentrations of NIT in the milk were monitored for up to 120 days after calving. NIT residues were extracted using acetonitrile; magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride were added to induce liquid-liquid partitioning and purified by dispersive solid phase extraction for clean-up. NIT was detected by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) in negative ionization mode.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of four {{different}} phenol derivatives, with methyl and halogen substituents, on heterologously expressed human skeletal muscle sodium channels, {{in order to find}} structural determinants of blocking potency. All compounds blocked skeletal muscle sodium channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The methylated phenol 3 -methylphenol and the <b>halogenated</b> <b>phenol</b> 4 -chlorophenol blocked sodium currents on depolarization from − 100 [*]mV to 0 [*]mV with IC 50 values of 2161 and 666 [*]μM respectively. Methylation of the halogenated compound further increased potency, reducing the IC 50 to 268 [*]μM in 2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenol and to 150 [*]μM in 3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -chlorophenol. Membrane depolarization before the test depolarization increased sodium channel blockade. When depolarizations were started from − 70 [*]mV or when a 2. 5 [*]s prepulse was introduced before the test pulse inducing slow inactivation, the IC 50 was reduced more than 3 fold in all compounds. The values of KD for the fast-inactivated state derived from drug-induced shifts in steady-state availability curves were 14 [*]μM for 3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -chlorophenol, 19 [*]μM for 2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenol, 26 [*]μM for 4 -chlorophenol and 115 [*]μM for 3 -methylphenol. All compounds accelerated the current decay during depolarization and slowed recovery from fast inactivation. No relevant frequency-dependent block after depolarizing pulses applied at 10, 50 and 100 [*]Hz was detected for any of the compounds. All the phenol derivatives that we examined are effective blockers of skeletal muscle sodium channels, especially in conditions that are associated with membrane depolarization.

40|$|Burkholderia is an {{important}} bacterial genus containing species of ecological, biotechnological and pathogenic interest which are widely distributed in the natural environment. This study describes the development of molecular methods to identify Burkholderia and also examines the genetic basis for their tolerance to halogenated pollutants. The recA gene is a useful target for speciation of B. cepacia complex bacteria. Novel PCR primers were evaluated by testing their specificity against a panel of Burkholderia species. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 869 bp of the recA gene differentiated between putative and known Burkholderia species, including the B. cepacia complex. A genus-specific recA PCR yielding 385 bp was also able to identify all Burkholderia examined. Phylogenetic analysis of 188 novel recA genes clarified the taxonomic position of several important Burkholderia strains, revealing the presence of four novel B. cepacia complex recA lineages. Although the recA phylogeny could not differentiate B. cepacia complex strains recovered from clinical infection versus the natural environment, it facilitated the identification of clonal strain types of from both niches. A rec/ 4 -based cultivation-independent approach {{was used to examine}} Burkholderia diversity associated with the maize rhizosphere and cord forming fungi. Robust sequence datasets were created from the 869 bp recA fragments and screened to identify recA phylotypes matching B. cepacia complex species previously cultivated from the maize samples.

40|$|Anthelmintic {{drugs are}} widely used in {{veterinary}} medicine for protecting or treating animals mainly against gastrointestinal nematodes and trematodes. In general, they cause no human health risk if veterinary drugs are properly administered and the recommended doses are correctly adhered to. However, {{there may be a}} concern that if withdrawal periods are not adhered to or if products are administered to animals in unapproved applications (e. g. administration to lactating species) those levels may exceed MRLs in foods. In addiction, whenever chemicals are used, especially with long term low dose exposure, toxicological, teratological and carcinogenetic effects must be considered. Only a limited number of products are licensed for treatment of animals during the lactating period and have a MRL listed under European Commission Regulation 37 / 2010. The widespread availability of cheaper generic veterinary medicinal products and the development of drug resistance to the limited number of licensed products have increased the potential for off-label applications. SUMMARIES The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the persistence of oxyclozanide and levamisole residues in bovine milk after treatment with a combination product and their subsequent fate during cheese production. Animals were milked twice daily up to 16 days post treatment. Soft (3 d ripening), hard (35 d ripening) and whey cheeses were produced from the milk samples collected from first two milkings. Milk and cheese samples were subsequently analysed by UPLC-MS/MS. Highest levels of levamisole (< 600 µg/kg- 1) and oxyclozanide (< 25 µg/kg- 1) were determinate at first and third milking respectively. Levamisole residues were found to concentrate in all cheese types. There was a three fold concentration effect for levamisole in mature cheese. Oxyclozanide residues were found to occur at lower levels in soft and hard cheese than milk with a 10 -fold concentration in whey cheese compared to milk. Residues were found at higher levels in cheeses compared to the milk. The results of this study demonstrate that levamisole and oxyclozanide residues are rapidly excreted in dairy cows and milk is compliant after few days, but survive the fermentation process to persist in cheese.

A DNA intercalator, Ru (bpy) (2) (dppz) (2 +), was allowed to bind to the DNA film and produce photocurrent upon light irradiation. After the DNA film was exposed to 300 mu M tetrafluoro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (TFBQ), the photocurrent dropped by 20 %. In a mixture of 300 mu M TFBQ and 2 mM H(2) O(2), the signal dropped by 40 %. The signal reduction indicates less binding of Ru (bpy) (2) (dppz) (2 +) due to structural damage of ds-DNA in the film. Similar results were obtained with tetra- 1, 4 -chloro-benzoquinone (TCBQ), although the signal was not reduced as much as TFBQ. Fluorescence measurement showed that TFBQ/H(2) O(2) generated more hydroxyl radicals than TCBQ/H(2) O(2). Gel electrophoresis proved that the two benzoquinones produced DNA strand breaks together with H(2) O(2), but not by themselves.

Theperoxidase transformation of these pollutants is accompanied by a reduction in their toxicity, due to loss of biological activity, reduction in the bioavailability, or the removal from aqueous phase, especially when the pollutant is found in water. The review describes the sources of peroxidases, the reactions catalyzed by them, and their applications in the management of pollutants in the environment. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Halogenated</b> <b>phenols</b> (HPs) are {{naturally}} {{present in the}} marine environment (Gribble, 2010). They are also important man-made compounds owing to their chemical inertness and applications in many industrial processes. For instance, chlorinated phenols, e. g. 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol and its isomers, have been routinely used as pesticides, bactericides and fungicides, {{and a number of}} tribromophenols are commercially produced as flame retardants and wood preservatives. The carbon–halogen bond can be quite stable in the environment and HPs are recalcitrant molecules, widespread organic pollutants found in air, water, soil and sedi-ments (Shao et al., 2011). The HPs mentioned above have, in fact, been detected and quantified in blood from birds, fish and mammals, including humans. The retention of HPs by living organisms is related to their structural resemblance to the thyroid hormones 3, 30, 5, 50 -tetraiodo-l-thyroxin (thyroxine, T 4) and 3, 30, 5 -triiodo-l-thyronine (T 3). In fact, para- and meta-halophenols bind to some proteins such as transthyretin (TTR), thyroxin-binding globulin (TGB) and albumin (ALB), and the receptor affinity of o,o’-dihalophenols is remarkably high (Kitamura et al., 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Halogenated</b> <b>phenols</b> {{appear in}} {{many aspects of}} our lives as they are used for wood preservation, as pesticides, flame retardants, and even in computers. They are toxic, bio-accumulative and bio-retardant. However, {{horseradish}} peroxidase {{has been shown to}} be useful for polymerizing and dehalogenating them, thus reducing their toxicity. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, HRP rapidly polymerizes phenols in aqueous solution with high selectivity. A novel glass-based support incorporating titanium dioxide for immobilizing the enzyme was developed and characterized (Tglass). Under UV irradiation it was shown to reduce the blockage of the enzyme active sites by the polymerized product and also to provide in situ production of H 2 O 2 with little inactivation of the enzyme. A packed bed reactor that utilized the immobilized HRP to treat 4 -bromophenol (as model substrate) under UVB irradiation was shown to give 75 % reduction of 4 -bromophenol, 21 % reduction in total organic carbon and formation of 70 µM bromide over 16 hours operation. The reactor was tested on reservoir water spiked with pentabromophenol and pentachlorophenol. The system was able to transform 98 % of these <b>halogenated</b> <b>phenols</b> and to release 70 % of their halogen content. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) and/or pentabromophenol (PBP) spiked into a sample of drinking water (8 and 10 mg L- 1, respectively) was treated by the HRP-Tglass packed bed reactor under UVB radiation. The treatment gave 98 % transformation for both species and up to 4 of the 5 available halogens (bromide and chloride) were removed. Toxicity tests were performed on a solution feed containing PCP and/or PBP in MilliQ water (1 mg L- 1) before and after treatment. The toxicity (as measured by Microtox®) of the treated effluent showed that after treatment the lethal toxicity (LD 50) was removed while the effect toxicity (EC 50) has reduced. Toxicity tests using Hydra hexactinella showed a slight decrease in toxicity, however the dehalogenated PCP and PBP mixture was shown to have a greater decrease in toxicity. Dehalogenation plays an important rule in reduction in toxicity; it was found that for a partial transformation (up to 70 % in both species) of the PBP and PCP mixture (0. 67 and 0. 89 mg L- 1) in reservoir water, an increase in toxicity occurs. The results of the present work clearly show the potential for continuous removal of soluble phenolic pollutants from water and wastewater streams by immobilized horseradish peroxidase using the novel Tglass developed in this study...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Dehaloperoxidase {{hemoglobin}} A (DHP A) is a multifunctional hemoglobin {{that appears}} to have evolved oxidative pathways for the degradation of xenobiotics as a protective function that complements the oxygen transport function. DHP A possesses at least two internal binding sites, one for substrates and one for inhibitors, which include various <b>halogenated</b> <b>phenols</b> and indoles. Herein, we report the X-ray crystallographic structure of the carbonmonoxy complex (DHPCO). Unlike other DHP structures with 6 -coordinated heme, the conformation of the distal histidine (H 55) in DHPCO is primarily external or solvent exposed, {{despite the fact that the}} heme Fe is 6 -coordinated. As observed generally in globins, DHP exhibits two distal histidine conformations (one internal and one external). In previous structural studies, we have shown that the distribution of H 55 conformations is weighted strongly toward the external position when the DHP heme Fe is 5 -coordinated. The large population of the external conformation of the distal histidine observed in DHPCO crystals at pH 6. 0 indicates that some structural factor in DHP must account for the difference from other globins, which exhibit a significant external conformation only when pH < 4. 5. While the original hypothesis suggested that interaction with a heme-Fe-boun...|$|R
40|$|A sample {{preparation}} method combining solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) {{was developed to}} be used in Effect-Directed Analysis (EDA) of blood plasma. Until now such a method was not available. It can be used for extraction of a broad range of thyroid hormone (TH) -disruptors from plasma with high recoveries. Validation of the method using spiked cow plasma showed good recoveries for hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs; 93. 8 ± 19. 5 %), hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs; 93. 8 ± 15. 5 %), other <b>halogenated</b> <b>phenols</b> (OHPs; 107 ± 8. 1 %), and for short-chain (< 8 C-atoms) perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs; 85. 2 ± 24. 6 %). In the same extracts, the potency of the compound classes spiked to the cow plasma to competitively bind to transthyretin (TTR) was recovered by 84. 9 ± 8. 8 %. Furthermore, the SPE-LLE method efficiently removed endogenous THs from the extracts, thereby eliminating their possible contribution to the binding assay response. The SPE-LLE method was applied to polar bear plasma samples to investigate its applicability in future EDA studies focusing on TH-disrupting compounds in this top predator species that is exposed to relatively high levels of bioaccumulating pollutants. A first screening revealed TTR-binding potency in the polar bear plasma extracts, which could be explained for 60 - 85 % by the presence of OH-PCBs. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R
30|$|A first {{important}} {{requirement for}} textile use of azo dyes {{is that no}} possible products of their reductive cleavage are listed by the EU Directive 2002 / 61 /EC. This requirement was met by the dyes used in this study. Furthermore, the strongly coloured washcloth IW 1 was certified according to OekoTex 100 product class 1 (contact with babies). The washcloth conformed to the requirements {{in terms of the}} absence of formaldehyde, the specifications concerning disperse azo dyes, heavy metal ions, <b>halogenated</b> <b>phenols,</b> tin organic compounds, surfactants, as well as rub fastness, fastness to perspiration and resistance to spittle. However, the pH of the washcloth (pH 9 of the aqueous extract) was higher than regulated by ISO 3071 (i.e. between 4.0 and 7.5). It was realised that the washing machine used for cleaning the washcloth was not rinsing textiles properly so that some small amount of alkaline washing agent was still present in the tested washcloth, causing an elevated pH. This fact was also visible from the colour of the washcloth which was partially orange-red, especially at its thick corners. Therefore, the weakly coloured washcloth IW 4, prior to its certification, was rinsed twice by hand with tap water after washing with the laundry machine. Following this, the pH was found to be 6.6 and the washcloth fully conformed to the specifications for OekoTex 100 product class 1.|$|R
40|$|<b>Halogenated</b> <b>phenols</b> and cresols {{belong to}} a group of {{volatiles}} consistently reported as off-flavour compounds. For example, 2 -iodophenol and 2 -iodo- 4 -methylphenol with their typical medicinal smell were found to negatively affect bottled mineral water. Even though these compounds are widespread in nature no comprehensive information about their chemo-analytical as well as odour properties is available. Therefore, the objective of this study were (1) to provide systematic chemo-analytical data on these substances, such as mass spectral data and retention parameters in gas chromatographic analysis, and (2) to determine, on a direct comparative basis, the sensory properties of eight mono-halogenated phenols, four di-halogenated <b>phenols</b> and four <b>halogenated</b> cresols. Evaluations focused on the determination of odour quality and odour threshold concentration in air and water. With regard to the relationship between substitution pattern and odour character, the location of an iodine atom in the ortho-position was demonstrated to obviously be an important prerequisite for medicinal, plaster-like or ink-like smell. Faecal or horse stable-like odour notes were predominantly related to compounds being substituted either by halogen moieties or by a methyl group in the para-position. The 2 -halogenated 4 -methylphenols were found to be the odorants with the lowest odour threshold concentrations of all the compounds investigated in this study, and that, generally, compounds with ortho-halogenation exhibited exceptionally low odour threshold concentrations...|$|R
