500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} The Guardian, Kitty Empire {{was critical of}} West's lyrics regarding [...] "women as ruthless money-grabbers" [...] on an otherwise [...] "herculean" [...] and [...] "flawed near-masterpiece".

25|$|The {{success of}} a play, {{especially}} one's first success, is somewhat like pushing against a door which suddenly opens from the other side.

For myself, the experience <b>was</b> <b>invigorating.</b> It {{made it possible to}} dream of daring more and risking more. The audience sat in silence before the unwinding of All My Sons and gasped when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, I imagine, for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invented a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Discursive Challenges for African Feminisms. In what follows, I draw {{attention}} to the necessity for connecting national and continental feminist challenges to those that confront feminisms globally. Two main discursive manifestations of the neo-liberal co-optation of feminism are explored: the growth of moderate rights-based discourses; and secondly, the co-optation and adulteration of gender research and teaching. While there are important differ-ences in the way that these trends have evolved and currently function in dif-ferent parts of the world, I stress that they are politically connected. In the third and final section, I focus on ways in which some feminist commentators <b>are</b> <b>invigorating</b> the language and practice of feminism to contest our present context of hegemonised knowledge and information. key words: Africa, feminism, gender, philosophy, post-colonial, globalizatio...|$|R
50|$|The close {{association}} with environmental determinism and the freezing of political boundaries during the Cold War {{led to a}} significant decline in the perceived importance of political geography, which was described by Brian Berry in 1968 as a 'moribund backwater'. Although {{at this time in}} most other areas of human geography new approaches, including quantitative spatial science, behavioural studies, and structural Marxism, <b>were</b> <b>invigorating</b> academic research these were largely ignored by political geographers whose main point of reference remained the regional approach. As a result, most of the political geography texts produced during this period were descriptive, and it was not until 1976 that Richard Muir could argue that political geography was no longer a dead duck, but could in fact be a phoenix.|$|R

5000|$|Stephen Wigler of The Baltimore Sun {{praised the}} symphony as [...] "tightly {{constructed}} and fun to listen to" [...] and added, [...] "It was the finale, with its pile-up of ear-splitting sonorities so typical of this composer, that occasioned the catcalls from the audience. But its relentless energy <b>was</b> <b>invigorating</b> and its coda — an outburst of savage drumming — splendidly inventive." [...] Steve Metcalf of the Hartford Courant also lauded the work, saying, [...] "The ideas are crisp and unforced, the orchestration brilliant.
