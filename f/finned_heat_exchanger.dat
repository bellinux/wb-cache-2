Simulation software has proven to drastically reduce development time and cost by limiting the need for expensive and time consuming laboratory testing. Three different system types were used in this study to show the capability of the model and identify design options for improving performance. The three system types were: 3 Ton Air Source Heat Pump: It was selected as it is the most common system using conventional round tube finned heat exchangers in indoor and outdoor units. 5 Ton Heat Pump Pool Heater: This unit was selected to show SDS’s ability to model other system types. It uses coaxial heat exchanger in the outdoor unit and round tube <b>finned</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in the Indoor Unit.. 2. 5 Ton Residential Split System with a Micro Channel Condenser: Unit is equipped with Micro Channel condenser in the outdoor unit whereas the indoor unit has round tube <b>finned</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Methodology Several design options that may improve performance were identified for all three systems but only design options for the 13. 7 SEER, 3 ton Heat Pump will be presented, including validation runs for the other two systems. Targeted performance testing was used to validate the modeling tool during the re-design exercise. For simplicity, the following parameters are investigated in this exercise: 1. Optimize refrigerant charge by managing compressor Superheat and Condenser Subcooling) and superheat). 2. Optimize refrigerant circuits in indoor and outdoor coils. 3. Change to higher efficiency fan motors in indoor and outdoor units. 4. Optimizing the air flow rate in indoor and outdoor units. 5. Effect of smaller displacement compressor. 6. Evaluate effect of two-capacity compressor. The overall SEER for the final system configuration was 15. 8 Btu/Wh resulting in gain of about 16 %.

The study included three heat exchanger designs, where {{two of them had}} symmetrical louvered fins and a thickness of 19 mm and 52 mm. The third had a thickness of 19 mm and had the louvers angled in one direction. All heat exchangers have been simulated when the airflow entered both from above and below relative to the horizontal plane. Simulations have also been carried out when the airflow entered from the side, illustrating the heat exchanger to be angled relative to the vertical axis. Two air speeds have been investigated for each configuration, where the results were compared to experimental data. The results showed that the airflow characteristics were strongly dependent on the inclination angle. A more inclined heat exchanger generated larger separated areas at the entrance of the heat exchanger core. After approximately six louvers the airflow was fairly similar for all inclinations. The pressure drop over the core was not affected by the direction of the entered airflow. It was also seen that the heat exchanger with the louvers in only one direction resulted in approximately the same pressure drop as the one with symmetrical louvered fins. For a constant velocity in the longitudinal direction within the core, the pressure drop did not varied between the inclinations. Depending on the definition of the heat exchanger arrangement the heat transfer rate was affected.

40|$|The {{interest}} in storing latent energy in phase change materials has risen {{over the last}} years as the need grows for more energy efficient systems. By storing energy, free chilling and heat can be saved for later use during high load hours. Thus the gap between supply and load can be overcome. It is an efficient way to provide both cooling and heating to buildings using phase change material (PCM) as they take up much less volume compared to a corresponding water-cistern with the same amount of stored energy. Low thermal conductivity of most of the PCMs can be compensated with advanced heat transfer design, however impact of different heat transfer mechanisms is not explicitly studied. In this work, a heat transfer study has been made on a finned cylindrical PCM heat exchanger with focus on determining the heat transfer effect of convection in non-gelled PCMs and the different ways to model such a system in a two dimensional axis-symmetric plane. The first and simpler numerical model of the two was built using Matlab, where the convection effect was simulated using an enhanced-conduction factor based on empirical equations. The other model was built in a CFD environment and simulates the convection with more complexity and more realistic behavior. The results show that the convection may contribute to 65 % of the total heat transfer in non-gelled PCMs at a certain time and that using empirical equations for simulating convection is a fast and easy way to estimate the heat transfer, though not a recommended method for high accuracy results. The study also showed that because of the gravity-induced convection, the angle of the cylindrical <b>finned</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> affects the heat transfer and that more fins, while increasing the overall heat transfer rate, inhibits the effect of convection in a vertically positioned heat exchanger...|$|E
40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory's {{graphite}} foam has {{the potential}} to be used as a heat exchanger for the Army's Future Combat System Manned Ground Vehicle and thus {{has the potential}} to improve its thermal performance. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program FLOW 3 D was used to develop a new CFD model for the graphite foam to be used in the development of a proper heat exchanger. The program was calibrated by first measuring the properties of the solid foams and determining the parameters to be used in the CFD model. Then the model was used to predict within 5 % error the performance of finned foam heat sinks. In addition, the f factors and j factors commonly used to predict pressure drop and heat transfer were calculated for both the solid and finned structures. There was some evidence that corrugating the foams would yield higher j/f ratios than state of the art heat exchangers, confirming previously measured data. Because the results show that the CFD model was validated, it is recommended that the funding for Phases 2 through 5 be approved for the design of both the <b>finned</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> using tubes and round fin structures and the solid foam design using corrugated foams. It was found that the new CFD model using FLOW 3 D can predict both solid foam heat transfer and finned foam heat transfer with the validated model parameters. In addition, it was found that the finned foam structures exhibited j/f ratios that indicate that significant heat transfer is occurring within the fin structures due to aerodynamically induced flow, which is not present in solid aluminum fin structures. It is possible that the foam surfaces can act as turbulators that increase heat transfer without affecting pressure drop, like the vortex generators seen in state of the art heat exchangers. These numbers indicate that the foam can be engineered into an excellent heat exchanger. It was also found that corrugating the solid foams would increase the j/f ratio dramatically, allowing the solid foams to compete directly with standard heat exchangers. Although corrugated L 1 foam samples have not been produced (attempts are under way), it is possible that their j/f ratio can be even higher than those of the finned structures...|$|E
40|$|The path {{to future}} aero-engines with more {{efficient}} engine architectures requires advanced thermal management technologies {{to handle the}} demand of refrigeration and lubrication. Oil systems, holding a double function as lubricant and coolant circuits, require supplemental cooling sources to the conventional fuel based cooling systems as the current oil thermal capacity becomes saturated with future engine developments. The present research focuses on air/oil coolers, which geometrical characteristics and location are designed to minimize aerodynamic effects while maximizing the thermal exchange. The heat exchangers composed of parallel fins are integrated at the inner wall of the secondary duct of a turbofan. The analysis {{of the interaction between}} the three-dimensional high velocity bypass flow and the heat exchangers is essential to evaluate and optimize the aero-thermodynamic performances, and to provide data for engine modeling. The objectives of this research are the development of engine testing methods alternative to flight testing, and the characterization of the aerothermal behavior of different <b>finned</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> configurations. A new blow-down wind tunnel test facility was specifically designed to replicate the engine bypass flow in the region of the splitter. The annular sector type test section consists on a complex 3 D geometry, as a result of three dimensional numerical flow simulations. The flow evolves over the splitter duplicated at real scale, guided by helicoidally shaped lateral walls. The development of measurement techniques for the present application involved the design of instrumentation, testing procedures and data reduction methods. Detailed studies were focused on multi-hole and fine wire thermocouple probes. Two types of test campaigns were performed dedicated to: flow measurements along the test section for different test configurations, i. e. in the absence of heat exchangers and in the presence of different heat exchanger geometries, and heat transfer measurements on the heat exchanger. As a result contours of flow velocity, angular distributions, total and static pressures, temperatures and turbulence intensities, at different bypass duct axial positions, as well as wall pressures along the test section, were obtained. The analysis of the flow development along the test section allowed the understanding of the different flow behaviors for each test configuration. Comparison of flow variables at each measurement plane permitted quantifying and contrasting the different flow disturbances. Detailed analyses of the flow downstream of the heat exchangers were assessed to characterize the flow in the fins¿ wake region. The aerodynamic performance of each heat exchanger configuration was evaluated in terms of non dimensional pressure losses. Fins convective heat transfer characteristics were derived from the infrared fin surface temperature measurements through a new methodology based on inverse heat transfer methods coupled with conductive heat flux models. The experimental characterization permitted to evaluate the cooling capacity of the investigated type of heat exchangers for the design operational conditions. Finally, the thermal efficiency of the heat exchanger at different points of the flight envelope during a typical commercial mission was estimated by extrapolating the convective properties of the flow to flight conditions.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> used in {{cryogenic}} applications need to {{have very}} high effectiveness to preserve the refrigerating effect produced. Normally the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> used in cryogenic refrigerators and liquefiers have effectiveness {{of the order of}} 0. 95 or higher. If the effectiveness of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> falls below the design value, there may not be any liquid yield. Plate <b>fin</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> because of their compactness, low weight and high effectiveness, are widely used in aerospace and cryogenic applications. Such <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> have closely spaced fins and offer narrow and intricate passages for the fluid flow which often leads to significant pressure drop. The stringent requirement of high effectiveness in cryogenic refrigerators and liquefiers and high pressure drop occurring in plate <b>fin</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> make it necessary to test the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> before putting into operation in a liquefier. Plate <b>fin</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (PFHE) is a type of compact exchanger that consists of a stack of alternate flat plates called parting sheets and corrugated fins, both being brazed together as a block. Streams exchange heat by flowing along the passages made by the fins between the parting sheets. Separating plates act as the primary heat transfer surfaces and the appendages known as fins act as the secondary heat transfer surfaces intimately bonded to the primary surface. Aluminum is the most commonly used material and stainless steel is employed in high pressure and high temperature applications...|$|R

40|$|Plate <b>fin</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> {{because of}} their compactness, low weight and high {{effectiveness}} are widely used in aerospace and cryogenic applications. This device is made of a stack of corrugated fins alternating with nearly equal number of flat separators known as parting sheets, bonded {{together to form a}} monolithic block. Appropriate headers are welded to provide the necessary interface with the inlet and the exit streams. While aluminum is the most commonly used material, stainless steel construction is employed in high pressure and high temperature applications. The performance of a plate <b>fin</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is determined, among other things, by the geometry of the fins. The most common fin configurations are - (1) plain (straight and uninterrupted) rectangular or trapezoidal fins (2) uninterrupted wavy fins and (3) interrupted fins such as offset strip, louver and perforated fins. The interrupted surfaces provide greater heat transfer at the cost of higher flow impedance. Here I have designed rectangular offset plate <b>fin</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> I have assumed some data and based on them I have designed <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The flowing fluid in <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is liquid nitrogen and material of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is Al. After designing the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> rating is also necessary. The heat transfer and flow friction characteristics of plate fin surfaces are presented in terms of the Colburn factor j and the Fanning friction factor f vs. Reynolds number Re, the relationships being different for different surfaces. The laminar flow model under predicts j and f values at high Reynolds number, while the 2 -Layer k-e turbulence model over predicts the data throughout the range of interest. Because most industrial <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> operate with Re less than 3000, and because the j and f data predicted by the laminar and the 2 -layer k-e turbulence model differ little from each other at low Reynolds numbers, we have used the laminar flow model up to Reynolds number of 10, 000, which is considered to be the limit for plate <b>fin</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> operating with gases. Velocity, pressure and temperature fields have been computed and j and f factors determined over appropriate range of Reynolds number and geometric dimensions. ...|$|R
