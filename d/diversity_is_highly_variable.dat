40|$|As {{secondary}} producers, zooplankton {{species are}} crucial {{as a vehicle}} for energy transfer in marine ecosystems worldwide yet few studies have observed the zooplankton community in tropical island estuaries. This study aims to understand the distribution of the zooplankton community in two of the largest estuaries (Opunohu and Cook’s Bays) in the volcanic tropical island of Moorea, French Polynesia. The results show that a few taxonomic groups, especially copepod, dominate the zooplankton composition. Moreover, the zooplankton community and <b>diversity</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> at each bay and between bays. In the laboratory, copepod salinity response was examined. Copepods were placed at different salinity treatments for 16 hrs and dead copepods were counted. The salinity experiments show greater mortality of copepods at the extreme ends of salinity concentration, 40 ppt and 0 ppt, suggesting that salinity is a major component influencing the abundance in these systems. Monitoring fluctuations in the zooplankton abundances will help understand changes in the marine food web as the result of climate change. ...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} Popular {{population}} genetic markers. Its relevance as an indicator Of Population size and history has recently been questioned by several large-scale studies in animals reporting evidence for recurrent adaptive evolution, at least in invertebrates. Here we focus on mammals, a more restricted taxonomic group for which the issue of mtDNA near neutrality is crucial. By analyzing the distribution of mtDNA diversity across species and relating 4 to allozyme diversity, life-history traits, and taxonomy, we show that (i) mtDNA in mammals (toes not reject the nearly neutral model; (ii) mtDNA diversity, however, is unrelated to any of the 14 life-history and ecological variables that we analyzed, including body mass, geographic range, and The World Conservation Union (IUCN) categorization; (iii) mtDNA <b>diversity</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> between mammalian orders and families; (iv) this taxonomic effect is most likely explained by variations of mutation rate between lineages. These results are indicative of a strong stochasticity of effective population size in mammalian species. They Suggest that, even in the absence of selection, mtDNA genetic diversity is essentially unpredictable, knowing species biology, and probably uncorrelated to species abundance...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Biological invasions pose {{one of the}} {{greatest}} threats to global biodiversity, but many naturalized invaders coexist with the native community. Community ecology theory provides a framework for understanding the mechanisms by which invaders might coexist with native species or exclude them from the community, thus informing management practices to maximize their effectiveness at conserving native biodiversity. Differences in functional or phylogenetic similarity of invaders to native residents can affect invasion success and the probability they will coexist with natives. For example, functionally dissimilar species may not compete strongly and distantly related species may share fewer natural enemies. Furthermore, environmental heterogeneity can promote species coexistence by providing the opportunity for a greater number of coexistence mechanisms to operate, thereby mitigating the potential for species invasions to lead to native extinction. My thesis examines how provenance (i. e., native origin) and phylogenetic relatedness of plant species affect community dynamics and species interactions in the invaded California grasslands. To do this I have assembled two unique community data sets, one spanning 48 years across a 1000 -ha site and one spanning 7 years along a 500 -km latitudinal transect. I show that native and exotic species abundance and <b>diversity</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> in both time and space, but these provenance group responses are rarely negatively correlated (Chapter 2). Thus, exotic species do not generally appear to exclude natives from communities. Long-term abundance patterns further suggest that the system remains in a state of transience, and populations of several native species are declining at local scales (Chapter 3). Recruitment limitation due to the build-up of plant litter associated with exotic grasses may be generally responsible for these declines, but habitat suitability, land-use history, and community composition also affect native recruitment. Across the grasslands, disturbance and resource supply can interact to affect both species and phylogenetic diversity (Chapter 4). Disturbance in particular can increase diversity, likely by increasing opportunities for colonization by removing plant litter that previously limited recruitment. Both phylogeny and provenance can also affect biotic interactions, such as with communities of soil organisms (Chapter 5). Thus, I have shown that spatio-temporal heterogeneity, alterations to the biotic environment mediated by exotic invasion, and phylogenetic relationships among species are all important considerations when evaluating impacts of invasion and designing management strategies to conserve native biodiversity, especially in light of anthropogenic influence on disturbance regimes and resource supply...|$|E
40|$|Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a {{model system}} for {{studying}} cilia, photosynthesis, and other core features of eukaryotes, and is also an emerging source of biofuels. Despite its importance to basic and applied biological research, the level and pattern of genetic variation in this haploid green alga {{has yet to be}} characterized on a genome-wide scale. To improve understanding of C. reinhardtii's genetic variability, we generated low coverage whole genome resequencing data for nearly all of the available isolates of this species, which were sampled from a number of sites in North America over the past ∼ 70 years. Based on the analysis of more than 62, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, we identified two groups of isolates that represent geographical subpopulations of the species. We also found that measurements of genetic <b>diversity</b> <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> throughout the genome, in part due to technical factors. We studied the level and pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD), and observed one chromosome that exhibits elevated LD. Furthermore, we detected widespread evidence of recombination across the genome, which implies that outcrossing occurs in natural populations of this species. In summary, our study provides multiple insights into the sequence diversity of C. reinhardtii that will be useful to future studies of natural genetic variation in this organism...|$|R
40|$|Macrobenthos {{data for}} the Belgian Continental Shelf were used (1) to give an {{overview}} of the spatial pattern of the different macrobenthic species and communities of the Belgian Continental Shelf and (2) to examine the influence of different environmental variables on the spatial distribution of the macrobenthos species and communities on different spatial scales. The Belgian part of the North Sea <b>is</b> a <b>highly</b> dynamic area with a continuous succession of gullies and sandbanks. A variety of human activities like sand extraction, dredge dumping and fishing also affect the ecosystem. Samples were collected in the framework of different monitoring programs during 2004 and 2005 using the same sampling techniques. Total abundance, number of species and <b>diversity</b> indices <b>were</b> calculated and used for spatial comparison. The differences in community structure were investigated through multivariate analyses. Several a-biotic variables were measured and used in statistical tests to investigate the relation with the macrobenthos on different spatial scales. Multivariate analysis distinguished five major community groups, with a clear separation between the coastal and the offshore samples. The groups were characterised by the presence and/or absence of certain species and the relative abundance of the different taxonomic and feeding type groups. The average density, species richness and <b>diversity</b> <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> within each group. The distribution patterns of certain species were clearly related to the environmental variability. Univariate measures correlated best with depth and salinity, whereas multivariate analysis identified median grain size, mud content and salinity as the major environmental variables influencing the faunal patterns...|$|R
40|$|Enterococci are fecal {{indicator}} bacteria (FIB) {{that are}} used worldwide for water quality assessment. However, evidence of high densities and extended survival of enterococci in sediments and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has caused uncertainty about their reliability in predicting human health risks from recreational activities in environmental waters. To address the concern that sediments and SAV may harbor large reservoirs of enterococci that can affect water column concentrations, aquatic mesocosms and environmental sampling were employed to investigate patterns of enterococci densities and population structure across the Tampa Bay watershed. In mesocosm experiments and environmental samples, SAV harbored higher densities of enterococci, per mass of substrate, than sediments, and sediments harbored higher densities than water. Population structure assessed by BOX-PCR genotyping was relatively unique in each sample, although slight similarities among samples suggested grouping primarily by location rather than substrate or season. Strain <b>diversity</b> <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable,</b> and many samples had low diversity, including nearly monoclonal structure throughout the mesocosm experiments and {{in several of the}} environmental samples. Several strains <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> abundant and cosmopolitan (found across sites, seasons, and substrates), and may represent highly naturalized and reproducing indicator bacteria populations that are not directly related to pollution events. When the enterococci densities were viewed {{from the perspective of the}} entire aquatic system, SAV-associated enterococci did not comprise a major proportion of the total population, due to the typically large differences in volume of each substrate (SAV vs. sediments vs. water). Instead, the largest proportions of enterococci were typically found in the water or the sediments, depending on the relative volume of substrate or the enterococci density associated with each substrate. Modeling results illustrate that the relative importance of each substrate in terms of FIB populations can shift dramatically over time and space due to changes such as vegetation cover, tidal cycles, and bacteria densities. Furthermore, at several sites within the watershed, estimates of sediment and bacteria resuspension from sediments were very low, suggesting that this process rarely, if ever, significantly affects water column concentrations of enterococci in the watershed...|$|R
40|$|In low {{intensity}} agri-ecosystems such as wet grassland habitats, {{the inclusion}} of invertebrates in conservation assessments and monitoring is usually limited to charismatic groups such as bees or butterflies. However, wet grasslands support {{a wide range of}} inveterate groups, some of which may exhibit limited movement not generally represented by more mobile groups such as those typically examined. The use of surrogate species which exemplify broader invertebrate <b>diversity</b> has <b>been</b> suggested as a possible means of including these overlooked invertebrates (such as Diptera) in conservation planning within these habitats. Based on collections made by Malaise trap, we utilized two families of Diptera (Sciomyzidae and Syrphidae) as indicators of a wider range of dipteran diversity (nine Diptera families identified to parataxonomic unit level [PUs]) in wet grassland habitats. We examined the role of environmental variability, spatial scale, and habitat type on patterns of cross-taxon congruence for all three assemblages. Both environmental correlation and community congruence were significantly stronger among assemblages when examined at low spatial scales, highlighting the need to examine dipteran groups at scales untypical of current agri-environmental assessments; namely field and farm level. Furthermore, when wet grasslands were differentiated into two habitat categories (sedge and rush dominated grasslands), the significance of the community congruence increased markedly. This correlation was particularly strong between Sciomyzidae and PUs which demonstrated similar differentiation based on habitat type, implying that assemblages which exhibit comparable ecological partitioning {{are more likely to be}} useful surrogates of one another. Correlations between richness, abundance and Shannon's <b>diversity</b> <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> among groups, suggesting compositional analysis as the most appropriate examination of dipteran diversity for surrogacy studies. The results indicate that cross-assemblage congruence of Diptera is influenced by similarity of response to environmental variability, scale of observation, and examination of assemblages differentiated into appropriate habitat categories. The results illustrate the need to investigate invertebrate biodiversity surrogates at scales appropriate to the indicator groups and examine congruence among assemblages within specific habitat categories. Such an approach has the potential to maximise gamma diversity in areas where wet grasslands are under threat of intensification or abandonment. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{ecological}} and agricultural significance of bumble bees in Alaska, {{very little is}} known and published about this important group at the regional level. The objectives {{of this study were}} to provide baseline data on species composition, distribution, seasonal biology, and parasites of the genus Bombus at three major agricultural locations within Alaska: Fairbanks, Delta Junction, and Palmer, {{to lay the groundwork for}} future research on bumble bee pollination in Alaska. A total of 8, 250 bumble bees representing 18 species was collected from agricultural settings near Delta Junction, Fairbanks, and Palmer, Alaska in 2009 and 2010. Of the 8, 250 specimens, 51 % were queens, 32. 7 % were workers, and 16. 2 % were males. The species composition and relative abundances varied among sites and years. Delta Junction had the highest relative abundance of bumble bees, representing 51. 6 % of the specimens collected; the other two locations, Fairbanks and Palmer represented 26. 5 % and 21. 8 % of the overall catch respectively. The species collected were: Bombus bohemicus Seidl 1837 (= B. ashtoni (Cresson 1864)), B. balteatus Dahlbom 1832, B. bifarius Cresson 1878, B. centralis Cresson 1864, B. cryptarum (Fabricius 1775) (=B. moderatus Cresson 1863), B. distinguendus Morawitz 1869, B. flavidus Eversmann 1852 (=B. fernaldae Franklin 1911), B. flavifrons Cresson 1863, B. frigidus Smith 1854, B. insularis (Smith 1861), B. jonellus (Kirby 1802), B. melanopygus Nylander 1848, B. mixtus Cresson 1878, B. neoboreus Sladen 1919, B. occidentalis Greene 1858, B. perplexus Cresson 1863, B. rufocinctus Cresson 1863, and B. sylvicola Kirby 1837. Overall, the most common bumble bees near agricultural lands were B. centralis, B. frigidus, B. jonellus, B. melanopygus, B. mixtus, and B. occidentalis. Species' relative population densities and local <b>diversity</b> <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> from year to year. Bombus occidentalis, believed to be in decline in the Pacific Northwest states, represented 10. 4 % of the overall specimens collected from the three sites studied. Bumble bees were found to be infected by Nosema and nematodes with infection rates up to 2. 1 % and 16. 7 % respectively. Of the eight species infected by parasites, B. occidentalis displayed the highest Nosema infection, while B. centralis was the species with the highest infection of nematodes. To our knowledge this represents the first multi-year study on bumble bees from the main agricultural areas of Alaska to provide baseline data on species composition, distribution, seasonal biology, and parasites of the genus Bombus...|$|R
40|$|Sugar cane {{cultivation}} {{has become}} the main land use in northeast and southeast Brazil {{and it is still}} increasing because of a growing national and international demand of sugar and biofuel. Shallow coastal lagoons and estuaries are the linkage between terrestrial and marine environments and are susceptible to anthropogenic modifications. Little is know about the impact of sugar cane cultivation in these systems. Aim {{of this study was to}} gain knowledge on the impact of effluents from sugar cane cultivation on the biogeochemistry and phytoplankton dynamics in two shallow coastal systems affected by sugar cane monoculture in their watersheds, a coastal lagoon and an estuary in Brazil. In the Mundau Manguaba Lagoon (MML), water samples were collected at the beginning and end of the dry season during five expeditions between September 2007 and February 2009. Additionally, sediment cores were taken in March 2007. In the Paraiba do Sul River (PSR), samples were taken during the rainy (January) and dry (September) season 2008. The main elements of this study were the determination and characterization of nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, silicate, phosphate) and total suspended matter (TSM) as well as phytoplankton communities in the MML and the PSR. Particulate organic matter (Corg, PN) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (&# 61540; 13 C, &# 61540; 15 N) were determined in TSM of surface water in the MML and PSR and sediments of the MML. Inorganic nutrients were measured in the water samples. Phytoplankton abundance, biomass and community composition were identified in the MML. Effects of nutrient enrichment caused by fertilizer runoff from sugar cane fields on phytoplankton communities in the MML were experimentally simulated. Chlorophyll a (chl a) was used to estimate phytoplankton biomass in the PSR. Nutrients and organic matter derived from fertilizer runoff in the catchment area of the PSR were transported from the river and its tributaries to the estuary and subsequently to adjacent coastal waters during the rainy season because of high river discharge. Reduced river discharge and long residence time during the dry season led to an increase in chl a amount and retention of allochthonous and autochthonous material inside the system. Nutrient concentrations in the MML were mainly governed by the rivers which drain the sugar cane dominated catchment area. A seaward nutrient decrease coincided with high phytoplankton biomass inside the lagoons and was the result of fast nutrient uptake by algae. Parts of the organic matter were removed from the water column due to sedimentation and were recycled or stored in the sediments of the lagoons. Other parts of the organic matter were exported from the Manguaba and Mundau lagoons into adjacent coastal waters due to tidal currents. Phytoplankton community and <b>diversity</b> <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> in both lagoons because of rapidly changing salinity and nutrient concentrations as well as residence time. Thus, temporal and spatial phytoplankton distributions and shifts between cyanobacteria and diatom dominated communities were observed in the MML. Nutrient enrichment experiment conducted in order to simulate high nutrient input from fertilizer runoff showed a direct response of phytoplankton communities. Diatoms were the main profiteers due to permanently high silicate concentrations in tropical aquatic ecosystems. Alterations in the nutrient ratios affected by high nitrogen and phosphate inputs from sugar cane cultivation lead to a shift in phytoplankton communities and consequently influence the entire food web dynamics in the lagoons. It can be concluded that lagoons and estuaries play an important role for nutrient and organic matter cycles in the coastal ecosystems affected by sugar cane cultivation in the northeast and southeast regions of Brazil. Seasonal variations in fertilizer runoff, geomorphology of the system and biological processes are the main factors that control the material distribution, composition and finally the retention of nutrients and organic matter inside the system or the outwelling from the system into adjacent coastal waters...|$|R
40|$|The Amazonian {{avifauna}} remains severely understudied {{relative to}} that of the temperate zone, and its species richness is thought to be underestimated by current taxonomy. Recent molecular systematic studies using mtDNA sequence reveal that traditionally accepted species-level taxa often conceal genetically divergent subspecific lineages found to represent new species upon close taxonomic scrutiny, suggesting that intraspecific mtDNA variation could be useful in species discovery. Surveys of mtDNA variation in Holarctic species have revealed patterns of variation that are largely congruent with species boundaries. However, little information exists on intraspecific divergence in most Amazonian species. Here we screen intraspecific mtDNA genetic variation in 41 Amazonian forest understory species belonging to 36 genera and 17 families in 6 orders, using 758 individual samples from Ecuador and French Guiana. For 13 of these species, we also analyzed trans-Andean populations from the Ecuadorian Chocó. A consistent pattern of deep intraspecific divergence among trans-Amazonian haplogroups was found for 33 of the 41 taxa, and genetic differentiation and genetic <b>diversity</b> among them <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable,</b> suggesting a complex range of evolutionary histories.

40|$|Forest {{management}} {{can significantly}} affect both {{the diversity and}} spatial patterning of understory vegetation. However, few studies have considered both diversity and spatial patterning at a stand scale. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of forest management on understory plant communities in northern hardwood forests and assess the processes governing differences in species composition, diversity, and spatial patterns. We sampled understory vegetation (all speciestall) and percentage of light transmission levels in three forest types in 12 mesic northern hardwood stands in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA: old-growth, undisturbed forests; even-aged forests resulting from clearcut logging (65 – 85 yr old); and uneven-aged forests with recent selective logging. Estimated understory species richness per stand, mean species richness per quadrat, and mean percent cover per quadrat were lower in old-growth forest than in even-aged, second-growth forests and lower in even-aged than in uneven-aged, second-growth forests. Differences in species composition among the three forest types were related to available light and to coarse woody debris; however, differences between the cover of most plant groups were not significant. The mean patch size of species <b>diversity</b> and cover <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> {{and could not be}} related to forest stand type. However, understory communities in old-growth forests have significantly smaller community patch sizes and larger compositional heterogeneity. Community patch size is correlated with both coarse woody debris and light heterogeneity. Each forest stand type produces a characteristic combination of understory composition, diversity, and spatial patterning of communities. Although harvesting has negligible effects on understory alpha diversity in these mesic hardwood forests, spatial structure is slower to recover and has not recovered in the even- and uneven-aged northern hardwood forests studied. If management objectives include preserving or restoring the ecological character of the forest, harvesting may need to be altered or delayed predicated on the character of the understory...|$|R
40|$|Faecal {{genotyping}} {{has been}} proposed as a method to examine the diets of individuals, but this application has been virtually unexplored by wildlife biologists. We used faecal genotyping and conventional scat analysis to determine the diets of 42 coyotes Canis latrans belonging to nine social groups in Alaska. We use rarefaction to {{examine the effect of}} scat sample size on the accuracy and precision of individual diets, and we simulate diets from scats to determine how diet richness and evenness affect sample size requirements. We then demonstrate the util-ity of this technique by examining variation in diet among individual coyotes and social groups in relation to prey availability. Estimates of di-et <b>diversity</b> and composition <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> when < 10 scats were used to construct the diet. Diets simulated with a uniform (i. e. even) distribution of prey items required generally smaller sample sizes to esti-mate diet diversity and richness than diets with exponentially distribut-ed items; however, items in actual scats were exponentially distributed. We found moderate dietary variability among individuals in our study area, and diet overlap was higher among coyotes within social groups than between groups. As predicted by optimal foraging theory, the niche widths of all coyote groups expanded as their primary prey (the snow-shoe hare Lepus americanus) became scarce during our three-year study. Despite increased niche width, diet overlap among groups remained con-stant, suggesting that coyotes selected differing alternative prey. Spatio-temporal variation in snowshoe hare availability explained 70 % of the variation in hare consumption among groups, indicating that variation in local prey availability may be the primary cause of diet variation among coyotes. Although faecal genotyping can be used to address ecological questions at the individual level, studies should be designed specifically for this purpose so that sufficient numbers of faeces can be obtained...|$|R
