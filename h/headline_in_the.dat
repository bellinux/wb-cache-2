25|$|Specials about Jackson {{aired on}} {{multiple}} television {{stations around the}} world. The British soap opera EastEnders added a last-minute scene, in which the character Denise Johnson discussed the news with Patrick Trueman, to the June 26 episode. While most British newspapers printed pictures of Jackson in his youth or in his prime, The Sun (for {{the day after his}} death) was the only paper to show Jackson from 2009 at his frailest, and keeping to their regular promotion of 'Wacko Jacko.' The next day, The Sun fell into course {{with the rest of the}} newspapers and Jackson was the topic of every front-page <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Sun for about two weeks following his death. Magazines including Time published commemorative editions. A scene that had featured Jackson's sister La Toya was cut from the film Brüno out of respect toward Jackson's family.|$|E
25|$|Arachne {{is upset}} that Spider-Man {{has not taken}} her bait, and she visits him in another dream {{in which the two}} of them get married. When that does not work, she uses a <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Daily Bugle about 50 stolen pairs of shoes to weasel her way into the office of J. Jonah Jameson. Her furies steal the shoes for {{themselves}} and descend upon Jameson ("Deeply Furious"). Arachne convinces him to run a headline pronouncing Spider-Man a needed hero, and he does. After enjoying the blackout and its intimacy, MJ and Peter come to a standstill: because of the dreams and the added pressure of needing Spider-Man, Peter doesn't think he can be good enough for MJ anymore. She assures him that he is all she needs in the world ("If the World Should End"). On a path of soul-searching, Peter realizes that if MJ loves him then he can go on being Spider-Man; he finds his inner hero and vanquishes the Sinister Six ("The Boy Falls From the Sky").|$|E

500|$|In November 2011 the McCanns {{testified before}} the Leveson Inquiry into British press standards.

[...] "Maddie 'Sold' By Hard-Up McCanns" [...] ran a <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Daily Star, part of the Express group. Lord Justice Leveson called the articles [...] "complete piffle".

500|$|When the Record {{shut down}} in 1947, The Inquirer {{announced}} that it was now an [...] independent newspaper and, frustrated with corruption in Philadelphia, supported Democratic candidates in the 1951 election. While Walter Annenberg had made The Inquirer independent he did use the paper to attack people he disliked. Sometimes when a person or group angered Annenberg, they were blacklisted and not mentioned anywhere within The Inquirer. People on the blacklist were even airbrushed out of images. People who were on the list at one point included Nicholas Katzenbach, Ralph Nader, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and the basketball team the Philadelphia Warriors, who were not mentioned for an entire season. In 1966, Walter Annenberg used The Inquirer to attack Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Milton Shapp. During a press conference, an Inquirer reporter asked Shapp if he had ever been a patient in a mental hospital; having never been a patient, Shapp said no. The next day's <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Inquirer read [...] "Shapp Denies Ever having been in a Mental Home."

500|$|Goldfaden seems, in Bercovici's words, to {{have lost}} [...] "his {{theatrical}} elan" [...] in this period. He briefly put together a theater company in 1886 in Warsaw, with no notable success. In 1887 he went to New York (as did Mogulescu, independently). After extensive negotiations and great anticipation in the Yiddish-language press in New York ("Goldfaden in America," [...] read the <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11 January 1888 edition of the New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung), he briefly took on the job of director of Mogulescu's new [...] "Rumanian Opera House"; they parted ways again after the failure of their first play, whose production values were apparently not up to New York standards. Goldfaden attempted (unsuccessfully) to found a theater school, then headed in 1889 for Paris, rather low on funds. There he wrote some poetry, worked on a play that he didn't finish at that time, and put together a theater company that never {{got to the point}} of putting on a play (because the cashier made off with all of their funds). In October 1889 he scraped together the money to get to Lvov, where his reputation as a poet again came to his rescue.|$|E
500|$|Boston pitted former Yankee pitcher Mike Torrez {{against the}} Yankees' Cy Young Award winner, Ron Guidry, {{who took a}} 24–3 record into the game. The Sox were beating Guidry 2–0 {{in the top of}} the seventh inning when light-hitting Yankee shortstop Bucky Dent hit a two-out, three-run home run over Fenway Park's Green Monster to take a 3–2 lead. It was only his fifth home run of the season. The Yankees later led 5–2 and held on to win 5–4 when Yastrzemski popped out with runners on first and third, ending the Red Sox' season. Yankees closer Goose Gossage notched his 27th save of the season. Gossage would later comment years later about how he was spat on at Fenway Park and had beer thrown in his face. [...] "There is no rivalry in sports that rivals the Yankees—Red Sox...that playoff game in '78–it felt like the playoffs and World Series were {{exhibition}} games after that." [...] The <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Boston Globe the next day summed it all up: [...] "Destiny 5, Red Sox 4." [...] New York went on to defeat the Kansas City Royals in the ALCS and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series for their second straight championship.|$|E

500|$|Writing in London's Evening Standard on 5 January 2011, media {{commentator}} Roy Greenslade {{expressed concern}} {{over a number}} of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates' landlord, Jefferies, following his arrest, describing the coverage as [...] "character assassination on a large scale". He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published, including a <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Sun describing Jefferies– a former schoolmaster at Clifton College– as weird, posh, lewd and creepy; a story from the Daily Express quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as [...] "... a sort of Nutty Professor" [...] who made them feel [...] "creeped out" [...] by his [...] "strange" [...] behaviour; and an article from the Daily Telegraph, which reported Jefferies [...] "has been described by pupils at Clifton College ... as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films". Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April– The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Daily Star, the Daily Express, the Daily Mail and the Daily Record– seeking damages for libel. It was held that the media were quick to jump to conclusions regarding Jefferies' arrest. Being a retired English teacher who lived alone, whose physical appearance and [...] "eccentrically unkempt white hair," [...] made him stand out, led people to believe that he looked the type. As Stephen Moss would write in The Guardian: [...] "The unspoken assumption was that no one could look that odd and be innocent." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was then}} {{confirmed}} {{to play against}} England at Swansea on 12 January in a team much changed from that which was beaten by South Africa the previous month. The London Express commented that neither he nor Maddock on the other wing, had much merit, but were selected {{for a lack of}} choice, the whole team being unexceptional. Welsh spectators, expecting defeat {{at the hands of the}} English, stayed away from the game, and only 5,000 turned out, a record low for international rugby in Wales. But the <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 'Pink Edition' of the Evening Express read [...] "St George Routed", as Wales beat England 22–0. Right from the start, the Welshmen seemed up to the task. An early try-scoring opportunity was lost when Gabe was tackled and unable to make the pass to Williams, who was in the clear. Wales came close to scoring a few more times, until Gabe receiving the ball from Trew, timed his pass perfectly to Williams, and he scored in the corner. Most of the play till this point had been in England's 25, but when the English broke out, Williams' defensive play was called into action. At half time, with further tries from Gibbs and Maddock, the Welsh were leading 13–0. England started the second half well but, after a long period in the Welsh half, Wales got an attacking opportunity, and Gabe, receiving the ball from Trew, beat his opposite number, and passed to Williams, who scored a second try in the corner. Maddock and Brown then scored two more tries, for a total of six to Wales.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times writer Stephen Holden {{considered}} Bedtime Stories as [...] "easily Madonna's best album", {{and concluded}} {{that it was a}} [...] "seductive mixture of soft-focus hip-hop and bittersweet ballads". Peter Galvin from The Advocate magazine gave a positive review, describing the album as [...] "a gorgeously produced R album with lots of funky beats lush keyboards, and soaring Love Unlimited-style string arrangements". Barry Walters from The San Francisco Examiner praised the album as Madonna's most low-key album and her best work at the date. J.D. Considine, while writing his review for the album for The Baltimore Sun, declared that Bedtime Stories was more listener-friendly than Madonna's previous albums. He added that it [...] "seems remarkably close in spirit to the singer's first album, emphasizing dance grooves and pop melodies over genre exercises and conceptual statements", while praising Madonna's vocal performance. Linda L. Labin from the Bangor Daily News, noted that [...] " [...] isn't taking any chances. This time around, her daring {{has more to do with}} music than lyrics", while also praising her vocals; [...] "If anything, her singing is the album's greatest strength. Madonna uses every trick from her repertoire. [...] Bedtime Stories turns in some of the strongest performances of her career. 'Madonna sings well' — bet you don't see that <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tabloids anytime soon". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave it two-stars-and-a-half out of four, writing that the album [...] "seems the least remarkable of all Madonna's albums. But it's not necessarily the least of them. [...] It has a nice, consistently relaxed feel, its slow jams hip-hop-inflected but not as self-consciously as last time".|$|E
