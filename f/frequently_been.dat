5|$|BLEU has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> {{reported}} as correlating well with human judgement, and remains a benchmark {{for the assessment}} of any new evaluation metric. There are however a number of criticisms that have been voiced. It has been noted that although in principle capable of evaluating translations of any language, BLEU cannot in its present form deal with languages lacking word boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has been}} remade several times for {{different}} platforms and has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> packaged with Final Fantasy II in various collections.

5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> {{used as a}} model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered {{to occur in the}} hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Arsenal and Manchester United is a notable one in English {{football}} as both clubs are recognised for having great history and traditions. Although the two clubs have <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> {{in the same}} division as each other since 1919, the rivalry was instigated in 1990, when a brawl resulted in both clubs having points deductions in the Football League First Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{show has}} <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> criticized for perpetuating {{negative}} stereotypes about Italian Americans. Several major organizations have voiced their concern that The Sopranos presents a very distorted and harmful stereotype of Italian Americans and their cultural values, including the National Italian American Foundation, Order Sons of Italy in America, Unico National, and the Italic Institute of America.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} (Turdus philomelos) is a thrush that breeds {{across much of}} Eurasia. It has brown upperparts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts and has three {{recognised}} subspecies. Its distinctive song, which has repeated musical phrases, has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> referred to in poetry.|$|E
5|$|Although the Battle of Pelagonia has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> {{described}} as a decisive turning point, Michael VIII Palaiologos' gains were rapidly reversed and his rivals quickly regained their strength, with both the Epirotes and Manfred of Sicily reclaiming most of the territories they had lost. Nevertheless, {{the effects of the}} battle were not wholly undone: Palaiologos' victory, gained with the assistance of John Doukas, not only prevented the Epirote–Latin league of 1259 from taking Thessalonica and much of Nicaea's European domains, but also provided a valuable breathing space in the lead-up to the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, which led to the re-establishment of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologan dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> the subject of scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims {{about the consequences of}} such an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943 Britten {{made his}} {{debut in the}} Decca studios, {{accompanying}} Sophie Wyss in five of his arrangements of French folk songs. The following January he and Pears recorded together, in Britten's arrangements of British folk songs, and the following day, in duet with Curzon he recorded his Introduction and Rondo alla burlesca and Mazurka elegiaca. In May 1944 he conducted the Boyd Neel string orchestra, Dennis Brain and Pears in the first recording of the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, which has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> reissued, most recently on CD.|$|E

5|$|Pendants in a {{distinctive}} shape representing the hammer of Thor (known in Norse sources as Mjöllnir) have <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> unearthed in Viking Age Scandinavian burials. The hammers {{may have been}} worn {{as a symbol of}} Norse pagan faith and of opposition to Christianization, a response to crosses worn by Christians. Casting moulds have been found for the production of both Thor's hammers and Christian crucifixes, and at least one example of a combined crucifix and hammer has been discovered. The Eyrarland Statue, a copper alloy figure found near Akureyri, Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer.|$|E
5|$|Sitakunda {{was to be}} {{the landing}} station for a {{submarine}} communications cable, but the cable now comes ashore at Cox's Bazaar. The cable has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> severed by miscreants, often in the Sitakunda area, since its installation on 21 May 2006. Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication (BNNRC) has brought internet services to the upazila by establishing Rural Knowledge Centres (RKC). BTTB and RanksTel run telephone services in the upazila. The telephone area code for Sitakunda is 3028, which has to be added to Bangladesh area code +880 when making overseas calls, and the subscriber numbers consist of four digits locally.|$|E
5|$|The Chinooks have mainly {{been used}} to support the Australian Army, though they have {{performed}} {{a wide range of}} other tasks. Three Chinooks took part in the Iraq War during 2003, when they transported supplies and Australian special forces. A detachment of two Chinooks was also deployed to Afghanistan during the northern spring and summer months for each year between 2006 and 2013, seeing extensive combat. Two of the CH-47s deployed to Afghanistan were destroyed as a result of crashes. The helicopters have also <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> assigned to assist recovery efforts following natural disasters and undertook a range of civilian construction tasks while being operated by the RAAF.|$|E

5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the animals or drown. In one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The real-life {{surprise}} of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made {{it one of the}} film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater {{so as not to be}} too close to the screen during the sequence. The scene has <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> called one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. In 2007, Empire magazine named it as the greatest 18-rated moment in film, ranking it above the decapitation scene in The Omen (1976) and the transformation sequence in An American Werewolf in London (1981).|$|E
5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have <b>frequently</b> <b>been</b> the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E
