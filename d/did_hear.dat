5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the hurricane, many {{residents}} in shanty towns failed to hear tropical cyclone warnings and watches. Some <b>did</b> <b>hear</b> the warnings, but they did not believe them as the same warning had been issued several weeks before and nothing had happened. In addition, city officials warned the residents living near the dam to take shelter in public buildings though most refused to leave. The government ignored all requests to shore up an earthen dam, as they did not believe Liza would pose a significant threat of damage to the Baja California Peninsula. Along the Gulf Coast, troops evacuated residents, and radio stations warned all nearby ships to remain at harbor. During the afternoon hours of September29, the education department suspended classes as it began to rain.|$|E

25|$|The first post-Revolution Cuban {{dance music}} genre was the short-lived, but highly {{influential}} mozambique (1963). Neither the dance, nor the music caught on outside of Cuba. In spite of this, members of Eddie Palmieri's Conjunto la Perfecta <b>did</b> <b>hear</b> this new music over shortwave radio, inspiring {{them to create}} a similar rhythm which they also called mozambique. Although the two rhythms share no parts in common, the band received death threats because some right wing Cuban exiles thought Palmieri's band was playing contemporary Cuban music.|$|E

500|$|After More, no writs {{of error}} issued from federal {{criminal}} trials {{in the circuit}} courts for 84 years. [...] In 1889, Congress created a right of appeal by writ of error in capital cases. In 1891, the Judiciary Act of 1891 (the [...] "Evarts Act") extended this right to other serious crimes. The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts and placed original jurisdiction for the trial of all federal crimes in the district courts. Appeal to the courts of appeals by writs of error was provided for all [...] "final decisions," [...] in civil and criminal cases alike. Appeals to the Supreme Court were permitted directly from the district courts by writ of error, from the courts of appeals on certified questions, and by petition for certiorari. Without reported discussion of the jurisdictional issue, the Court <b>did</b> <b>hear</b> writs of error from criminal cases removed to the circuit courts. (Recall that the Judiciary Act of 1789 explicitly authorized appeals in removal cases.) ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{he lived with}} fellow actor Jerome Flynn and earned money by signing fan mail for the {{successful}} star of Soldier Soldier. In his debut feature film, Hear My Song (Peter Chelsom, 1991), Nesbitt played Fintan O'Donnell, a struggling theatrical agent and friend of Mickey O'Neill (Adrian Dunbar). A New York Times critic wrote, [...] "the jaunty, bemused Mr. Nesbitt, manages to combine soulfulness with sly humor". The praise he received made him self-assured and complacent; in 2001, he recalled, [...] "When I <b>did</b> <b>Hear</b> My Song, I disappeared so far up my own arse afterwards. I thought, 'Oh, that's it, I've cracked it.' And I'm glad that happened, because you then find out how expendable actors are." [...] His attitude left him {{out of work for}} six months after the film was released. Until 1994, he mixed his stage roles with supporting roles on television in episodes of Boon, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Covington Cross, Lovejoy, and Between the Lines. In 1993, he appeared in Love Lies Bleeding, an instalment of the BBC anthology series Screenplay and his first appearance in a production directed by Michael Winterbottom; he later appeared in Go Now (1995), Jude (1996) and Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). A Guardian journalist wrote that [...] "he showed himself to be a generous supporting actor" [...] in Jude and Sarajevo.|$|E

As such, it was recalled to help secure the coronation of Charles II, and helped provide a model for the other regiments founded {{after the collapse of the}} New Model Army. The regiment returned to France from 1662–66 and 1667–78, seeing English service again during the Second Anglo-Dutch War; soldiers of {{the regiment}} responded to the Raid on the Medway, when Pepys recorded that [...] "Here in the streets, I <b>did</b> <b>hear</b> the Scotch march beat by the drums before the soldiers, which is very odde." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{process of}} {{recruiting}} was much different during Brady's time, and athletes' rankings {{were not as}} prominent. In terms of recruiting in the 2000s, Brady {{would have been considered}} a four-star recruit. In essence, he was a highly rated prospect. Brady was also on Blue Chip Illustrated as well as a Prep Football Report All-American selection. Following his recruiting process he narrowed down his list to five main schools. [...] "Probably the ones that we <b>did</b> <b>hear</b> from and ultimately pared the list to were Cal-Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Michigan, and Illinois," [...] his father said. As a Cal fan, his father hoped that Brady would attend the nearby Cal, where Brady was a silent commit, and be able to watch his son play.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{commentators}} {{agree that}} the timekeepers erred with respect to Rule 10.4.1; that is, the siren did not continue to sound until it was formally acknowledged by an umpire. [...] Acknowledgement of the siren requires {{any one of the}} three field umpires to raise both arms into the air and blow the whistle. [...] There remains some doubt as to whether any of the three umpires <b>did</b> <b>hear</b> the siren, but in any event, none chose to bring play to an end as required by Rule 10.4.2. [...] This rule is not well known by football fans and clearly states that the umpires are the sole judge of when a quarter ends. [...] However, generally this is in terms of a split second decision as to whether a mark or kick occurred before or after the siren sounded, rather than the 25 seconds difference in this case.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Intersope Records {{signed the}} Pussycat Dolls, a sextet spun {{off from the}} burlesque group which was created by Robin Antin. After Universal Records dropped Almaze, the label was still very much {{interested}} in [...] "Don’t Cha". Doug Morris—then chairman of Universal Music Group—suggested that [...] "Don't Cha" [...] {{should be given to}} the Pussycat Dolls as the label was trying to reinvent the girl group. Initially Green was skeptical saying, [...] "I didn't know too much about them , but when I found out that [...] Interscope Records was involved, that was an alliance I didn't hesitate to make." [...] The Pussycat Dolls version was recorded around March adding two verses from rapper Busta Rhymes. Lead singer Nicole Scherzinger admitted that two records sounded identical. [...] "I had [...] version as a guide. But ours is just a bit fresher." [...] This song was initially offered to both Sugababes and Paris Hilton, but both declined. In 2006, Hilton claimed that she was presented with the track, but was not impressed with it, commenting. [...] "I think I <b>did</b> <b>hear</b> the song, but not in the format that we all came to know and love. If I'd heard that, of course I'd have jumped at the chance".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly before halftime of the Saturday evening {{game between}} the Oklahoma Sooners and the Kansas State Wildcats, spectators inside the stadium heard an {{explosion}}. The explosion was reported as being heard up to five miles away, but people {{on the east side}} of the stadium heard only a rumble like a low-volume thunder, of the type that signals impending rain. A few heard nothing. [...] Spectators were not allowed to leave the stadium at half-time, which caused concern among fans who <b>did</b> <b>hear</b> the explosion. No stadium announcements were made until the third and fourth quarters of play, when bus drivers were asked to leave the stadium and meet at the northwest corner of the Asp Avenue Parking Facility. [...] During the last six minutes of the game, an announcement was made over the public address system in the stadium and over local radio to exit through the south and east gates and to avoid the area, known to students and fans as the South Oval, west of the stadium. [...] No further explanations were given to game attendees because university officials [...] "didn't want to start any kind of panic." [...] "Everyone in my [...] section heard it. We looked to the opposite side of the field though thinking it was thunder. Me and my family were gonna go to the university bookstore after the game but the direction we had to go was blocked by caution tape. We knew something was up and got out of there ASAP."
