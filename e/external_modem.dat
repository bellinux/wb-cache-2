5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} serial port, {{designed for}} use with a printer or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an <b>external</b> <b>modem</b> port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud modem for communications. As a result, {{for the first time}} a user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster <b>external</b> <b>modem</b> simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces could not be used because they required the dedicated use of both ports. A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the internal modem slot for consumers who needed traditional functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Mac Mini {{includes two}} USB 2.0 and one FireWire 400 port.

The modem was later {{omitted from the}} Mac Mini, but an <b>external</b> <b>modem</b> remained an option. External displays are supported via a DVI port.

25|$|A key {{innovation}} {{required for}} the popularization of the BBS was the Hayes Smartmodem. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, {{and could not be}} used with other useful platforms like video terminals. <b>External</b> <b>modems</b> were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but <b>external</b> <b>modems</b> had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.|$|R
50|$|Unwired {{customers}} used <b>external</b> <b>modems</b> {{to connect}} to the wireless network. Unwired technology was portable, but not mobile - the technology does not operate well while the receiver was in motion. The network operated at 3.5 GHz within a spectrum exclusively reserved for use by Unwired. Unwired offered free technical support 7 days a week plus public holidays.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>external</b> <b>modems</b> have LED {{indicators}} on the front, one {{of which}} is TR ("terminal ready"). This light follows the state of the DTR pin. The light is on when DTR is high, and off when it is low. Modems will typically keep the TR light illuminated when the AT&D0 command is used to force the modem to ignore the DTR signal, regardless of the pin's actual state.|$|R
50|$|Brazilian {{proposal}} for the interactivity channel is focused on flexibility {{and is based on}} TCP/IP protocol. Receiver shall have an USB interface for an <b>external</b> <b>Modem</b> connection. This is adequate to comply with an existing telecomm infrastructure of multiple technologies and is also open for future innovations.|$|E
50|$|The {{capability}} to browse the World Wide Web on {{the device was}} also available through STNC HitchHiker, although it was only available for use with an <b>external</b> <b>modem.</b> Due to {{the black and white}} screen, this was often not the most practical way of browsing the web.|$|E
5000|$|On an <b>external</b> <b>modem</b> {{the status}} of the Ring Indicator pin is often coupled to the [...] "AA" [...] (auto answer) light, which flashes if the RI signal has {{detected}} a ring. The asserted RI signal follows the ringing pattern closely, which can permit software to detect distinctive ring patterns.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} NetBlazer was {{a standard}} PC with a serial card connected to user supplied <b>external</b> <b>modems</b> by serial cables. Later smaller versions, the PN and STi, were offered {{which consisted of}} a small-form-factor PC combined with custom software and one {{of a variety of}} modems or other connection systems (ISDN, etc.) combined into a large modem-like box. Administrators connected to it via Ethernet, which was also used for maintenance commands and setup.|$|R

50|$|The Palm OS system {{benefits}} from the integrated cell phone by utilizing it as an attached modem.

The phone can also be used as an <b>external</b> <b>modem</b> for a computer via the HotSync cradle.|$|E
50|$|In addition, a {{modified}} Communication Slot II was {{present on the}} Power Macintosh G3 personality cards. This slot only provided power and serial lines, leaving the PCI pins disconnected. For this reason {{it could only be}} used with modem cards. As in other machines, the <b>external</b> <b>modem</b> port is disabled when a modem is installed in the Communication Slot.|$|E
50|$|Apple Computer began {{retailing}} MacTerminal in July 1984 {{following the}} launch of the Macintosh 128K (the first Apple Macintosh) in January. Although MacTerminal was compatible with the original 128K model using Apple's optional 300 or 1200 bit/s <b>external</b> <b>modem</b> designed for the Apple II, MacTerminal was not available for general release at the 128K's launch date. Apple began bundling MacTerminal with later Macintosh models.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of USB, the {{parallel}} interface was adapted to access a number of peripheral devices other than printers. Probably {{one of the earliest}} devices to use parallel were dongles used as a hardware key form of software copy protection. Zip drives and scanners were early implementations followed by <b>external</b> <b>modems,</b> sound cards, webcams, gamepads, joysticks, external hard disk drives and CD-ROM drives. Some of the earliest portable MP3 players required a parallel port connection for transferring songs to the device. Adapters were available to run SCSI devices via parallel. Other devices such as EPROM programmers and hardware controllers could be connected via the parallel port.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the respective expansion bus pins, these slots also carried audio and serial lines. The serial bus was shared with the <b>external</b> <b>modem</b> port. Because the power and serial pins remained unchanged between the two slots, {{it was possible to}} design a universal modem card which could work in either. Network adapters, however, needed to be designed for one or the other.|$|E

5000|$|While early PDAs {{connected}} to a user's personal computer via serial ports or another proprietary connection, many today connect via a USB cable.

50|$|Apple {{introduced}} its first true modems in 1984, the Apple Modem 300 & 1200 modems (V21/V22). Prior to that they offered {{a third party}} Apple-badged comparatively low-tech acoustic coupler. Those were followed by the industry standard 2400/data and combined 9600/fax (V29) AppleFax Modem in 1987. Apple introduced the internal 2400 data/fax modem card for its Macintosh Portable in 1989 as well as released its last external desktop Apple Data Modem 2400. Only standard internal modems were offered during the 1990s through 2005, with the notable exception of Apple's foray into GeoPort passive telephony modems which relied heavily upon the computer's software and processing power rather than dedicated hardware (like Apple's proprietary internal Express Modem). The Apple USB Modem is Apple's first true <b>external</b> <b>modem</b> since the Apple Data Modem 2400 was discontinued in 1992.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{content with}} simply {{being the first}} {{consumer}} v.32bis modem on the market, Supra {{made a number of}} improvements over existing designs. One was the use of a much smaller case, about half the size of most models. The size and shape of modems had initially been set by the original Hayes Smartmodem in 1981, and its case design was widely used a decade later in spite of the internals having shrunk in size considerably over the years. The Supra's smaller design made it much easier to fit on a desk. Additionally, Supra replaced many indicator lights with a two-digit green electroluminescent display that showed the speed of connection and other information such as [...] "RI" [...] for ring indication and [...] "CD" [...] for carrier detect. Later models such as the LC ("Low Cost") used individual lamps that were a common feature of <b>external</b> <b>modems.</b>|$|R

The aim is the coordinated cost optimal planning of the power station park and of the energy import from <b>external</b> companies. <b>Modem</b> forecasting and optimization procedures are applied for solving this task. The result is an individually configurable management tool...|$|R
50|$|The Apple USB Modem is a {{combined}} 56 kbit/s data modem and 14.4 kbit/s fax <b>external</b> USB <b>modem</b> introduced by Apple Inc. after the internal 56k modem was {{dropped on the}} October 12, 2005 iMac G5 revision. While it looks similar, {{it should not be}} confused with Apple's optional USB Ethernet Adapter accessory, available for its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro Retina range of laptops since 2008.|$|R
