40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to qualitatively investigate the effect of the burn-out (mold) temperature, investment material, and casting alloy on the surface integrity of the Magfit EX keeper. Materials and Methods: Forty-two Magfit EX keepers were waxed-up, invested in five investment materials (Beauty-Cast, Cristobalite, CM- 10, Cera-Fina, Castorit-super), and subjected to burn-out temperatures ranging from 450 to 700 °C at intervals of 50 °C. The keeper samples were then cast into copings with three alloys (Castwell, Protor 3, Optimum) under standard conditions. The keeper surfaces were then examined under a microscope, and the compositions were assessed by an X-ray micro-analyzer in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A new keeper served as control. Results: At a burn-out temperature of 550 °C, the keeper surface started to disintegrate. X-ray micro-analysis showed an increase in oxygen content with increasing temperature. At 700 °C, the keeper surface disintegrated, and the composition differed markedly from that of the new keeper. The keeper surfaces were intact with all investments except those with Beauty-Cast. The keeper surfaces were found to be damaged when the casting alloy was Optimum. Conclusions: Beauty-Cast investment with a burn-out temperature of 700 °C is unsuitable for casting the Magfit EX keeper-coping unit. Also, <b>high</b> <b>fusing</b> alloys are not recommended for casting Magfit EX keepers. © 2007 by The American College of Prosthodontists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the setting expansion characteristics of three commercially available phosphate bonded investment materials for casting <b>high</b> <b>fusing</b> alloys and heat pressed lithium disilicate. The experimental groups in this study were P 90 (Powercast 90 % Special Liquid for Cobalt-Chrome alloys), P 60 (Powercast 60 % Special Liquid for High Noble Gold alloys), FF 75 (FastFire 15 75 % Special Liquid for Cobalt-Chrome alloys), FF 50 (FastFire 15 50 % Special Liquid for High Noble Gold alloys), and PVS (PressVest Speed 60 % Special Liquid for Lithium Disilicate Veneers, Partial Crowns and Single Crowns). Twenty specimens per group were poured in a trough that conformed to ADA Specification No. 2 for the measurement of the linear setting expansion of gypsum bonded investments. Measurements of the setting expansion were taken at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after mixing. A one sample T-Test revealed that the setting expansion measured for all of the groups was statistically significant and that all of the groups exhibited statistically significant differences in setting expansion at the manufacturer?s recommended burn-out time from the setting expansion reported by the manufacturer (P? 0. 01). P 90, P 60, FF 50 and PVS showed less expansion than is required in order to fully compensate for solidification shrinkage during the casting procedures. FF 75 was the only group that managed to fully compensate for the solidification shrinkage of the alloy it is intended for (P? 0. 01). The delayed burn-out times evaluated in this study resulted in significantly different setting expansion for PVS. A statistically significant difference was detected after 4 hours. The dimension of the PVS specimens did not change significantly after 4 hours. No such difference in setting expansion at delayed burn-out times could be detected for P 90, P 60, FF 75 & FF 50 (P? 0. 01). Within the limitations of this study, the setting expansion of the phosphate bonded investment materials tested could not fully compensate for the solidification shrinkage of the alloys except for FF 75. Delayed burn-out times resulted in significantly different setting expansion for PVS. Significant differences at delayed burn-out times could not be detected for the rest of the groups...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{liberalisation}} of the Swedish electricity {{market in}} 1996, {{the competition between}} utilities has increased, and the generation capacity has gradually been adjusted to suit the demand. Consequently, the earlier excessive electricity production capacity has been reduced. However, if {{the gap between the}} generation capacity and demand will be too narrow, this may result in notable power shortages in the electricity market. In order to achieve lower load demand, to avoid load peaks and to reduce electricity cost, a Swedish electrical utility - Skånska Energi Nät AB (SENAB), is planning to include a load demand component in its electricity tariff to make customers more aware of their energy consumption pattern and (possible) load demand problems. This study investigates the impact of the new tariff from the viewpoint of the utility as well as its customers, compared to the existing tariff. The project was carried out by the Efficient Energy Use in Buildings Research Group at the Department of Energy Sciences, Lund University. The results of the investigation show that if a load demand component were to be introduced into SENAB’s network tariff, primarily customers with a 16 -ampere <b>fuse</b> would incur <b>higher</b> network charges whereas customers with a <b>higher</b> <b>fuse</b> level would incur lower charges. With the existing network tariff, customers with <b>high</b> <b>fuse</b> levels pay relatively high standing charges in relation to their exploitation of the grid and as such they are subsidising customers with lower fuse levels. The study also shows that {{it is important that the}} new load demand pricing strategy (tariff) is communicated to customers in a comprehensive manner, so that they understand it and furthermore realise that they can save money by changing their energy consumption patterns without lowering their standard of living or comfort...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Zener diodes {{are widely}} used in {{electrical}} barriers to protect equipment operating in a potentially explosive atmosphere. Although normally not conducting, the zeners must have a high power rating so that their junction temperature meets safety factors when shunting the maximum fuse current. This often requires two or three lower voltage commercial zeners connected in series. Silicon carbide diodes have much higher thermal conductivity and maximum allowed junction temperature, so {{it should be possible}} to use one SiC zener in the place of two or three commercial diodes and/or allow use of <b>higher</b> <b>fuse</b> ratings. Low voltage SiC Zener diodes were fabricated and tested to evaluate potential benefits of their application as a component of intrinsically safe barriers. The diodes demonstrated mixed avalanche-tunnel breakdown at reverse bias voltages of 23 V with positive temperature coefficients of breakdown voltages of about 0. 4 mV/°C.

30|$|Another {{protocol}} was proposed by Khan et al.[69] to assess spectral and spatial quality at full scale. For assessing spectral quality, the MTF of each spectral channel {{is used to}} low-pass filter the fused image. This filtered image, once it has been decimated, will give a degraded LR MS image. For comparing the degraded and original low-resolution MS images, the Q 4 index [113] is used. Note that the MTF filters for each sensor are different and the exact filter response is not usually provided by the instrument manufacturers. However, the filter gain at Nyquist cutoff frequency may be derived from on-orbit measurements. Using this information and assuming that the frequency response of each filter is approximately Gaussian shaped, MTF filters for each sensor of each satellite can be estimated. To assess the spatial quality of the fused image, the high-pass complement of the MTF filters is used to extract the high-frequency information from the MS images at both <b>high</b> (<b>fused)</b> and low (original) resolutions. In addition, the PAN image is downscaled to {{the resolution of the}} original MS image, and high-frequency information is extracted from high- and low-resolution PAN images. The UIQI value is calculated between the details of the each MS band and the details of the PAN image at the two resolutions. The average of the absolute differences in the UIQI values across scale of each band produces the spatial index.|$|R

The Gaussian deconvolution of spectra allows dividing the five luminescence bands in two categories.
