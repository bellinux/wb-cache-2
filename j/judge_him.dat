5|$|The {{head of this}} {{association}} of delinquents, Mussolini, while yellow with rancour and fear and trying to cross the Swiss frontier, has been arrested. He must be handed over to a tribunal of the people so it can <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> quickly. We want this, even though we think an execution platoon is {{too much of an}} honour for this man. He would deserve to be killed like a mangy dog.|$|E
5|$|The county {{magistrate}} and commandery administrator {{were the}} official court judges {{of the county}} and commandery, respectively. Their jurisdictions overlapped, yet the commandery administrator only interfered in county court cases when necessary; it was generally agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first {{would be the first}} to <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> or her. If a commandery-level court case could not be resolved, the central government's Commandant of Justice was the final authority of appeal before the emperor. Yet he most often dealt with cases of political rebels and regicide in regards to kings, marquesses, and high officials. Above the Commandant was the emperor, the supreme judge and lawgiver.|$|E
5|$|The High Court quickly {{assembled}} at Nikli. Guy de la Roche {{presented himself}} before it {{accompanied by his}} own knights, but the assembled barons decided {{that they did not}} have the authority to <b>judge</b> <b>him,</b> and referred the matter to King Louis IX of France (r. 1226–1270). Guy travelled to France in 1259, but Louis not only pardoned him, but awarded him the title of Duke, which he and his successors were to bear thereafter. The renegade Geoffroy de Bruyères too was brought for judgement before William, and it was only the determined and passionate intercession of the other barons that saved his life and secured a pardon from the vengeful prince. He was however deprived of the possession of his domains by the inalienable right of conquest, and retained them henceforth as a gift from the Prince, meaning that they would be forfeit upon his death unless he had any immediate descendants.|$|E

6000|$|... "I know it, simple one; {{you must}} not suppose that I <b>judged</b> <b>him</b> by his exterior; I <b>judged</b> <b>him</b> by his rude manner and conduct, and I do not extend my opinion of him to the whole class to which he belongs." ...|$|R

5|$|Edward {{was joined}} at Barnet by his brothers, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and George, Duke of Clarence. Unlike his eldest brother, Gloucester was slender and {{seemingly}} delicate. He was 18 {{years old at}} the Battle of Barnet, his first major engagement. His military prowess, however, was well respected; many historians <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> a capable warrior and military leader. Clarence was not as well regarded as his brothers, especially in matters of loyalty. When Edward became king, Clarence was chosen as his heir; however, the births of Elizabeth of York (1466) and Edward V (1470) displaced the Duke in the line of succession to the throne. Hence, Clarence participated in Warwick's schemes, marrying the Earl's daughter Isabella, believing he could gain his brother's throne. Clarence lost faith in the Earl when Warwick defected to the Lancastrians and married off his other daughter, Anne, to their prince in order to cement his new allegiance. When Edward launched his campaign to retake England, Clarence accepted his brother's offer of pardon and rejoined the Yorkists at Coventry on 2 April 1471. The last of the Yorkist commanders was William, Lord Hastings, a loyal subject {{since the start of the}} wars. Hastings had accompanied the young king in exile and supported his return. The courtier was rewarded for his faithfulness, gaining the lieutenancy of Calais in 1471 and becoming Edward's lord chamberlain and primary confidant.|$|E
25|$|On 9 July 1819, {{exactly two}} years after Bouchard left Buenos Aires, the Santa Rosa and the María Sofía arrived to Valparaíso. the 12th of the same month arrived the Neptuno and one day later arrived La Argentina. Bouchard was {{informed}} that Thomas Cochrane had ordered his arrest. The corsair replied that the Chilean government had no authority to <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> {{and that he would}} only speak about his travels to the Argentine authority.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard {{decided to}} step up to the Tree of the {{knowledge}} of good and evil for himself, replacing Adam, and make his choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of the trial, Socrates imitates, parodies, and corrects the Orators, his accusers, and asks the jury to <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> by the truth of his statements, not by his oratorical skill (cf. Lysias XIX 1,2,3; Isaeus X 1; Isocrates XV 79; Aeschines II 24). Socrates says he will not use sophistic {{language}} — carefully arranged ornate words and phrases — but will speak using the common idiom of the Greek language. He affirms that he will speak in the manner he is heard using in the agora and at the money tables. Despite his claim of ignorance, Socrates speaks masterfully, correcting the Orators and showing them what they should have done — speak the truth persuasively and with wisdom. Although offered the opportunity to appease the prejudices of the jury, with a minimal concession to the charges of corruption and impiety, Socrates does not yield his integrity to avoid the penalty of death. Accordingly, the jury condemns Socrates to death.|$|E
500|$|His tormenters {{are usually}} untrustworthy temptresses, though {{occasionally}} they're authority figures who <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> {{as a criminal}} trespasser or a cultural arriviste. And songs such as the porno fantasy [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] and the siren-slaying [...] "Devil in a New Dress" [...] (featuring the consummately macho Ross) revive familiar mythologies about women — that they're monsters, killers, fallen angels — in language vibrant enough to fully revive these old stereotypes.|$|E
500|$|After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton {{applied to}} cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: [...] "though I {{know he had}} many imperfections... now the brethren say he is unworthy, (though I know not who {{appointed}} them to <b>judge</b> <b>him,)</b> they urge that I stand in a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, {{as well as my}} own, I ought to marry again." [...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] she murmured. [...] "Sometimes I {{wonder whether}} {{we do not}} misjudge him--you and I, Kingston. For you know we have been his judges. You must not shake your head. It is true. You have <b>judged</b> <b>him</b> to be unworthy of a son, and I--I have <b>judged</b> <b>him</b> to be unworthy of a wife. You don't think--that we could {{possibly}} have made a mistake--that underneath {{there is a little}} heart left--eaten up with pride and loneliness?" ...|$|R

500|$|Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru stated upon Jinnah's death, [...] "How {{shall we}} <b>judge</b> <b>him?</b> I {{have been very}} angry with him often during the past years. But {{now there is no}} {{bitterness}} in my thought of him, only a great sadness for all that has been... he succeeded in his quest and gained his objective, but at what a cost and with what a difference from what he had imagined." [...] Jinnah was buried on 12 September 1948 amid official mourning in both India and Pakistan; a million people gathered for his funeral. Indian Governor-General Rajagopalachari cancelled an official reception that day in honour of the late leader. Today, Jinnah rests in a large marble mausoleum, Mazar-e-Quaid, in Karachi.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{completing}} his piano studies in December 1861, the 19-year-old Bache travelled to Italy, staying in Milan and Florence {{with the intent}} of soaking in Italian culture before returning to England. In Florence he met Jessie Laussot, [...] "who had founded of a flourishing musical society in the city ... and was intimately acquainted with Liszt, Wagner, Hans von Bülow and other leading musicians." [...] While Laussot remained kindly disposed towards Bache, she also quickly summed up his overly easy-going character and decided to help him. She encouraged him to teach harmony as well as piano, then arranged a harmony class that met early in the morning some ways out of town so that he would not oversleep. She eased his way into polite society and also suggested, after hearing him play at several local concerts, that he travel to Rome and seek out Liszt. However, she insisted that he do so without any introduction from her, as she wanted Liszt to <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> solely on his own merits.|$|E
500|$|A week later, Tom lies in bed, {{smoking and}} writing. Gerri enters the room, {{and it is}} {{revealed}} that Tom has left his job. She has been rehearsing in Portsmouth and says she left him dozens of messages, but Tom thinks he lost his phone. The pair fight over Migg, who is still living with Tom. Later still, the flat is a mess, and Tom is unkempt and drinking heavily. He has no messages on his phone and no post. He sits down to play Scrabble with Migg, and it is revealed that it is Tom's birthday. The two argue about washing up, and Migg says that Tom has [...] "no right" [...] to <b>judge</b> <b>him.</b> Tom storms out of the room, and Migg flicks through birthday cards he has hidden from Tom, saying [...] "Thank you, Grandma!" [...] and taking the £10 that Tom's grandmother sent. The house and Tom have deteriorated further when Stevie comes to visit. He has brought Tom vouchers for The Body Shop. Stevie invites Tom out for dinner, but he declines. Stevie leaves, and Tom settles down with Migg on the sofa.|$|E

2500|$|It is not {{advisable}} {{to judge a}} person’s political orientation simply by {{whether he or she}} owns property or how much property he or she owns [...] Rather, we should <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> or her mainly by his or her political awareness, moral integrity and performance, by how he or she has acquired the property, how it has been disposed of and used, and by his or her actual contribution to the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|Akutagawa {{explores the}} themes of vanity and egoism in [...] "The Nose". Naigu’s vanity leads him to obsess only with his nose. This vanity {{eventually}} breeds disfigurement and a coldness from his peers, recognizing Naigu’s egotism taking precedence over his religious studies and teaching. Instead of {{his status as a}} renowned priest, Naigu views his nose as the source of how society will <b>judge</b> <b>him.</b> As is typical with Akutagawa, these inherently modern psychological themes are directly injected into ancient stories and myth.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2008, a 38-year-old Iowa comic {{collector}} named Christopher Handley was {{prosecuted for}} possession of explicit lolicon manga. The judge ruled that {{two parts of the}} PROTECT Act criminalizing [...] "a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting" [...] were unconstitutional, but Handley still faced an obscenity charge. Handley was convicted in May 2009 as the result of entering a guilty plea bargain at the recommendation of his lawyer, under the belief that the jury chosen to <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> would not acquit him of the obscenity charges if they were shown the images of question.|$|E
2500|$|Tim Jeal had unique {{access to}} the massive Stanley {{collection}} in the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Brussels and saw many letters, diaries and other documents (including correspondence between Stanley and King Leopold II of Belgium) unseen by previous biographers. The book had its detractors. Kenyan law professor Makau Mutua said [...] "If Jeal's attempt was the resurrection of a humane Stanley, then I must <b>judge</b> <b>him</b> a complete failure," [...] going on to suggest that [...] "the author should have set aside any biased personal agendas and let history speak for itself. Instead, Jeal writes a political book in defence of a historical monster." ...|$|E
