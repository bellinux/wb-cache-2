5000|$|The Jin {{troops and}} the Later Liang troops, {{commanded}} by He Gui, met at Huliu Slope (胡柳陂, in modern Heze, Shandong), {{not far from the}} Later Liang capital Daliang. Zhou pointed out that the Later Liang army outnumbered Jin troops and was highly motivated <b>due</b> <b>t</b> the closeness to their capital. He advocated similar tactics that resulted in the Boxiang victory—refusing to engage Later Liang troops quickly, using cavalry raiders to wear them out and cut off their food supplies, and then engage them once they were tired. Li Cunxu refused, believing that this was the time to finally destroy the main Later Liang army once and for all, and he took his own troops and proceeded without agreement from either Zhou or Li Cunshen. Zhou was forced to follow Li Cunxu, but commented to his son, [...] "I will not have a good place to die." [...] Subsequently, in the initial engagement, Jin forces prevailed over that of He's subordinate Wang Yanzhang, but as Wang Yanzhang was withdrawing toward the west, Jin's support troops, which was to the west as well, thought that Wang was winning the battle and heading toward them to attack them, panicked and fled, colliding with Li Cunxu's and Zhou's troops. Zhou died in the ensuing confusion, along with his son, as did Li Cunxu's secretary, Wang Jian (王緘) the deputy military governor of Tianxiong. Jin forces later counterattacked and fought the battle to a draw, with both armies said to have casualties of two thirds of their troops.|$|E

Major factors affecting the output and which are considered in this thesis are; (1) time lost due to equipment failure (T bd), 2) time lost due to shortage of material (T inv), (3) time lost <b>due</b> to absenteeism (<b>T</b> ab), (4) time lost <b>due</b> to set-up (<b>T</b> setup), (5) Time lost <b>due</b> to rejection (<b>T</b> rej), (6) time lost due to material handling (T mh) and (7) time lost <b>due</b> to fatigue (<b>T</b> f).

40|$|The two {{classical}} {{forms of}} human trypanoso- moses are sleeping sickness due to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or T. brucei rhodesiense, and Chagas disease <b>due</b> to <b>T.</b> cruzi. However, {{a number of}} atypical human infections caused by other T. species (or sub-species) have been reported, namely <b>due</b> to <b>T.</b> brucei brucei, T. vivax, T. congolense, T. evansi, T. lewisi, and T. lewisi -like. These cases are reviewed here. Some infections were transient in nature, while others required treatments that were successful in most cases, although two cases were fatal. A recent case of infection <b>due</b> to <b>T.</b> evansi was related {{to a lack of}} apolipoprotein L-I, but T. lewisi infections were not related to immunosuppression or specific human genetic profiles. Out of 19 patients, eight were confirmed between 1974 and 2010, thanks to improved molecular techniques. However, the number of cases of atypical human trypanosomoses might be underestimated. Thus, improvement, evaluation of new diagnostic tests, and field investigations are required for detection and confirmation of these atypical cases. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
