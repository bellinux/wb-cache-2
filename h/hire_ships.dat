2500|$|Several Royal Navy {{warships}} {{were sent}} towards Ireland {{in pursuit of}} Jones, but on this occasion, he continued right around the north of Scotland into the North Sea, creating near-panic all along Britain's east coast {{as far south as}} the Humber estuary.

On September 23, 1779, the squadron met a large merchant convoy off the coast of Flamborough Head, East Yorkshire.

500|$|As Dart and Désirée fought at the {{southern}} end of the line, the British fireships attacked the van. [...] The fireships had been stripped of all useful materials and been converted into their original role. Small crews of volunteers set alight to the vessels and all four bore down on the three northern French ships with supporting fire coming from Dart and the brigs. The smaller vessels, accompanied by a number of ship's boats from the British frigates outside the harbour, attended the fireships and removed their crews once they were alight. Although all four fireships were well-handled, the French were prepared for the tactic and the squadron severed its anchor cables and sailed into the channels around the Braak Sands. This manoeuvre took them past Biter and Boxer and also exposed them to continued fire from Dart, but, despite the damage, all three made the safety of the channel, into which the British could not follow without fear of grounding. One of the French ships did become stuck at low tide, but out of the range of the British ships and it suffered no serious damage. The fireships drifted aimlessly before exploding uselessly, succeeding only in wounding two British sailors whose boat was too close to Comet. [...] While the frigates and fireships fought, a host of small French gunboats emerged from Dunkirk and were met by the <b>hired</b> <b>ships,</b> armed as brigs. In a sharp engagement the <b>hired</b> <b>ships</b> lost four wounded but successfully held back the gunboats during the battle.|$|R
