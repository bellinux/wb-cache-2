5|$|Primary lung cancers {{themselves}} {{most commonly}} metastasize to the brain, bones, liver and adrenal glands. <b>Immunostaining</b> of a biopsy is often helpful {{to determine the}} original source. The presence of Napsin-A, TTF-1, CK7 and CK20 are helpful in confirming the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC derived from neuroendocrine cells may express CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin or chromogranin.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{method of}} {{studying}} {{the brain is}} anatomical, and {{until the middle of}} the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of <b>immunostaining</b> techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.|$|E

40|$|Idiopathic retroperitoneal {{fibrosis}} (IRF) {{is a rare}} {{human disease}} characterized by non-neoplastic fibroblastic proliferation associated with chronic inflammatory cells; its pathogenesis is obscure. We undertook an immunohistochemical study {{for the expression of}} HLA-DR antigens and other immune-related markers by retroperitoneal proliferating fibroblasts and inflammatory cells from 2 IRF patients. Patterns of immunoreactivity were compared with those expressed by human nodular fasciitis (NF) and granulation tissue. In IRF, most fibroblasts <b>immunostained</b> strongly for HLA-DR antigens, whereas fibroblasts in NF and granulation tissue did, not <b>immunostain</b> at all. The fibroblasts did not <b>immunostain</b> for interleukin 2 receptor, C 3 b receptor, CD- 4, CD- 8, or Leu-M 1 in any of the tissue studied. Most macrophages and lymphocytes in IRF and NF <b>immunostained</b> Strangly for HLA-DR antigens. In IRF, the CD- 4 and CD- 8 <b>immunostained</b> T-lymphocytes appeared equally distributed. The expression of HLA-DR antigens by fibroblasts in IRF indicates that this rare disease may indeed be an immune-associated hypersensitivity disorder...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of p 53 <b>immunostain</b> positive cells from histological sections for molecular genetic studies {{is a difficult}} task, especially if there are few positive cells. To eliminate contaminating DNA from p 53 negative cells, which can obscure the results of molecular assays, {{a variation on the}} technique of immunohistoselective sequencing was developed. This is a highly selective approach, whereby <b>immunostained</b> sections of formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue are exposed to ultraviolet irradiation to damage the DNA in p 53 negative cells. The DNA in positive cells remains unaffected because the dark <b>immunostain</b> protects their nuclei from ultraviolet light. Polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism of samples enriched with p 53 <b>immunostain</b> positive cells has shown that this method can produce pure samples of mutated DNA. The {{isolation of}} DNA from minority <b>immunostain</b> positive cells allows a wide range of molecular analyses to be carried out on these samples, which would otherwise be hampered by the problem of contaminating background cells...|$|R

25|$|This {{method is}} of {{critical}} importance in the modern life sciences, {{as it can be}} extremely sensitive, allowing the detection of single molecules. Many different fluorescent dyes can be used to stain different structures or chemical compounds. One particularly powerful method is the combination of antibodies coupled to a fluorophore as in <b>immunostaining.</b> Examples of commonly used fluorophores are fluorescein or rhodamine.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} with IHC staining is overcoming specific or non-specific background. Optimisation of fixation methods and times, pre-treatment with blocking agents, incubating antibodies with high salt, and optimising post-antibody wash buffers and wash times are all important for obtaining high quality <b>immunostaining.</b> In addition, the presence {{of positive and negative}} controls for staining are essential for determining specificity.|$|E
25|$|In {{vertebrate}} cells, replication sites concentrate into positions called replication foci.

25|$|The {{molecular}} composition between conventional neuronal synapse and ribbon synapse {{is surprisingly}} dissimilar. At {{the core of}} synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery in vertebrate neuronal synapses is the SNARE complex. The minimally functional SNARE complex includes syntaxin 1, VAMP 1 and 2, and SNAP-25. In contrast, genetic ablation or application of botulinum, targeting SNAP-25, syntaxin 1-3, and VAMP 1-3, did not affect inner hair cell ribbon synapse exocytosis in mice. Additionally, no neuronal SNAREs were observed in hair cells using <b>immunostaining,</b> pointing {{to the possibility of}} a different exocytosis mechanism. However, several studies found SNARE mRNA and protein expressed in hair cell, perhaps indicating presence of a neuronal SNARE complex in ribbon synapse that is present in low levels and with very redundant components.|$|E
25|$|Several {{proteins}} of the synaptic ribbon {{have also}} {{been found to be}} associated with conventional synapses. RIM (Rab3-interacting proteins) is a GTPase expressed on synaptic vesicles that is important in priming synaptic vesicles. <b>Immunostaining</b> has revealed the presence of KIF3A, a component of the kinesin II motor complex whose function is still unknown. The presynaptic cytomatrix proteins Bassoon and Piccolo are both expressed at photoreceptor ribbons, but Piccolo is only expressed at retinal bipolar synaptic ribbons. Bassoon is responsible for attaching itself {{to the base of the}} synaptic ribbons and subsequently anchoring the synaptic ribbons. The function of Piccolo is unknown. Also important is the filaments that tether the vesicles to the ribbon synapse. These are shed during high rates of exocytosis. The only unique protein associated with the synaptic ribbon is RIBEYE, first identified in purified synaptic ribbon from bovine retina. It is found to be a part of all vertebrate synaptic ribbons in ribbon synapses and is the central portion of ribbon synapses. RIBEYE interactions are required to form a scaffold formation protein of the synaptic ribbon.|$|E
500|$|The first {{indications}} of compartmental structure came {{from studies of}} the receptive fields of cells {{in various parts of}} the cerebellar cortex. Each body part maps to specific points in the cerebellum, but there are numerous repetitions of the basic map, forming an arrangement that has been called [...] "fractured somatotopy". A clearer indication of compartmentalization is obtained by <b>immunostaining</b> the cerebellum for certain types of protein. The best-known of these markers are called [...] "zebrins", because staining for them gives rise to a complex pattern reminiscent of the stripes on a zebra. The stripes generated by zebrins and other compartmentalization markers are oriented perpendicular to the cerebellar folds—that is, they are narrow in the mediolateral direction, but much more extended in the longitudinal direction. Different markers generate different sets of stripes, the widths and lengths vary as a function of location, but they all have the same general shape.|$|E

Several lines of evidence {{have suggested that}} the ventral midbrain dopamine neurons that give rise to the major CNS dopaminergic projections may also be glutamatergic. To examine this possibility, we double <b>immunostained</b> ventral midbrain sections from rat and monkey for the dopamine-synthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and for glutamate; we found that most dopamine neurons <b>immunostained</b> for glutamate, both in rat and monkey. We then used postnatal cell culture to examine individual dopamine neurons. Again, most dopamine neurons <b>immunostained</b> for glutamate; they were also immunoreactive for phosphateactivated glutaminase, the major source of neurotransmitter glutamate. Inhibition of glutaminase reduced glutamate staining. In single-cell microculture, dopamine neurons gave rise t...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} five endodermal sinus tumors was studied for their cytoskeletal and other {{phenotypic}} markers. They included 2 ovarian, 2 testicular, and 1 inguinal tumors. The cytoskeletal expression was also studied by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Every tumor was diffusely and strongly <b>immunostained</b> for cytokeratin. By SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, cytokeratins 8 & 18 were detected. Vimentin was focally coexpressed in 4 cases. The stroma was diffusely <b>immunostained</b> for vimentin. None of them expressed desmin, neurofilament, or glial filament protein. Desmoplakin was expressed only in one ovarian tumor. Alpha-fetoprotein and S- 100 protein were also diffusely positive among the neoplastic cells; intracytoplasmic globules were especially strongly <b>immunostained.</b> These {{findings suggest that}} endodermal sinus tumors represent a group of pure malignant epithelial neoplasms, and may be regarded as primitive carcinomas...|$|R
