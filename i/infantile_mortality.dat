While diarrhea is also a major problem among primates kept in captivity, the role of E. coli is unclear. This study was designed to characterize diarrheagenic E. coli recovered from the feces of 56 New World nonhuman primates, primarily marmosets (Callithrix spp.). Seventeen of the 56 primates had signs of diarrhea and/or enteritis. E. coli recovered from feces from these animals was tested by PCR for genes encoding virulence factors of diarrheagenic E. coli and for patterns of adherence to HeLa cells. In addition, isolates were characterized by the fluorescence actin staining test and by their ability to induce attaching and effacing lesions. PCR for the eae gene was positive in 10 of the 39 (27 %) apparently healthy animals and in 8 of the 17 (47 %) animals with diarrhea and/or enteritis. Colonies of eae+ E. coli were serotyped and examined by PCR for genes encoding EPEC virulence markers. The eae+ E. coli isolates recovered from both healthy and sick nonhuman primates demonstrated virulence-associated attributes similar to those of EPEC strains implicated in human disease and are designated monkey EPEC. The results presented here indicate that EPEC may be a significant pathogen for nonhuman primates, deserving further investigation. The similarities between the affected animals investigated in this study and human EPEC infections suggest that marmosets may represent an important model for EPEC in humans...|$|R

40|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} or middle age was tightly connected to mortality structure. Major mortality crises in certain years greatly reduced life expectancy in the area. High mortality rate influencing {{all age groups}} led to a considerable decrease of average age. From {{the point of view}} of life expectancy in the whole region, there was a genuine positive revolution. Mortality rate in the region as well as in Transylvania and Hungary greatly decreased, thus leading to the demographic pattern specific in Central and Western Europe at the time. The number of children dying before reaching the age of 1 and <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> together with the high mortality rate at children aged 1 to 5 show that “young age group was dominant” in mortality analysis. Children were the most exposed to pressure of internal and external factors leading to death. Children were the most vulnerable in front of “death claws” in all seasons and all communities. It was a reality in all Transylvania. In spite of obvious developments as compared to 1860 - 1880, in 1910, there still was a high mortality rate amongst children. In Bihor, the percentage of deceased children under 5 out of the total number of children was 34. 2 %, and of those under 7 was 36. 3 %. In the Sătmar County, mortality amongst children was even higher, which has been proved by the great number of deceased children in Ghenci: out of the total number of children, 36. 3 % were children deceased before reaching 5, while 38. 4 % were under 7 in 1910. In 1900 - 1910, the average number of newborns was 17, 547 in Bihor and 9, 655 in Sătmar. In the same period, the annual average of deceased children in Bihor was 4, 094 and in Sătmar was 2, 198. From the average of deceased children under 1 and the average number of newborns in 1900 - 1910, the average <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate was 232. 95 ‰ in Bihor and 227. 65 ‰ in Sătmar. Thus, there was a very high <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate in the two counties. It was above the rate in Transylvania, where average <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate was 206. 24 ‰. Despite the high <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate, there were counties where <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate index was even higher; for instance, in Arad <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate was 245. 56 ‰. In the two county seats, average <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate for 1900 - 1910 was lower as compared to the whole of the counties. In Oradea, <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate was 213. 25 ‰ and in Satu Mare it was 219. 98 ‰. This was a world where many were born and many died. Children were the most exposed to social, economic and meteorological hardships. Throughout the second half of the 19 th century and at the beginning of the 20 th century, there was a high <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate. Moreover, as seen in the Principality of Transylvania, <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> rate was even increasing in some regions. There were several complex causes of high <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality.</b> They originated in the precarious living conditions, lack of, or inappropriate, food, lack of hygiene and qualified medical staff, inappropriate housing for newborns, lack of special care for small children; last but not least, the attempt of applying traditional adult medical “treatment” to children, etc. As parish registers show, many children died at birth or immediately after. The lack of qualified and specialised midwives to assist the mother in childbirth to provide some medical assistance to the child was another important cause of <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality.</b> Last but not least, the high <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> originated in a harmful collective mentality of the people concerning physicians and sanitary system. ...|$|E

40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is an {{autosomal}} recessive neurodegenerative disorder {{and a leading}} genetic cause of <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality.</b> SMA is caused by mutation or deletion of Survival Motor Neuron- 1 (SMN 1). The clinical features of the disease are caused by specific degeneration of α-motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness, atrophy and, {{in the majority of}} cases, premature death. A highly homologous copy gene (SMN 2) is retained in almost all SMA patients but fails to generate adequate levels of SMN protein due to its defective splicing pattern. The severity of the SMA phenotype is inversely correlated with SMN 2 copy number and the level of full-length SMN protein produced by SMN 2 (∼ 10 – 15 % compared with SMN 1). The natural history of SMA has been altered over the past several decades, primarily through supportive care measures, but an effective treatment does not presently exist. However, the common genetic etiology and recent progress in pre-clinical models suggest that SMA is well-suited for the development of therapeutic regimens.

In addition, the continued limited existence of leprosy is a persistent challenge to our profession. The Medical and Health department wisely spends a great deal of time, energy and money in persuading the public to accept vaccination against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, tuberculosis and poliomyelitis.

The science that studies the causes of these disorders is called teratology (Greek teratos = monster). As genetic and malformative disorders are very diverse, appear at different ages and affect any system or organ, the patients who suffer of these diseases can be examined by a specialist doctor, all the medical practitioners facing genetic pathology should know some principles of genetic medicine. They also should know and apply the general methodology of genetic examination, {{should be able to}} indicate the necessary genetic explorations, as well as to correctly understand and interpret their results and should be able to advice genetically in a correct manner - within his/her area of competence – the patient and/or the family facing a genetic risk. Major structural anomalies appear in 2 - 3 % in live newborns and other 2 - 3 % are discovered in children up to 5 years old, summarizing 4 - 6 %. Birth defects are the first causes of <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality,</b> accounting for approximately 25 % of all neonatal deaths. Minor anomalies appear in approximately 15 % out of the total of newborns. These anomalies do not alter the individual’s health status, but they are associated with major defects in some cases, therefore they can serve as key elements for the diagnosis of more serious, hidden defects...|$|E
40|$|Background: Neonatal {{mortality}} rate {{is one of}} the main health problems which is affected by prenatal status, maternal, fetal and perinatal conditions. Low birth weight (LBW) {{is one of the}} main causes of neonatal and <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality.</b> The aim of this study is an evaluation of the LBW causes in neonates. Methods: This descriptive cross sectional study was done on 1500 neonates, born in Fatemieh Hospital, Hamedan, 2004. Data such as birth weight, sex, maternal age, gestational age, birth interval, history of abortion, prenatal care, maternal occupation, level of education, systemic and underlying diseases, history of infections and smoking were extracted from medical records. Data were statistically analyzed by SPSS ver. 13 using chi-square, t-test and fishers exact test. Findings: 19. 1 % of neonates were LBW newborns. Mean values for maternal age, gestational age, maternal weight and height, and the interval between births of LBW neonates were significantly lower compared with normal birth weight neonates. The number of siblings of LBW neonates was more than normal birth weight neonates. Maternal infections and systemic diseases, occupation, the presence and absence of prenatal care in LBW neonates, showed no significant differences with normal birth weight newborns. Smoking and history of abortion in the mothers of LBW neonates were more than those of normal birth weight neonates. Maternal educational level of LBW neonates was lower than mothers of normal birth weight neonates. The most common maternal infection was vaginitis and the most common maternal systemic disease was hypertension. Conclusions: The results revealed a correlation between LBW in neonates with maternal age, gestational age, maternal weight and height. There was also a correlation with the interval between pregnancies, number of siblings, maternal smoking, previous abortion and level of mothers education...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{problem of}} <b>infantile</b> <b>mortality</b> caused by {{imbalance}} feeding of infant shortly after cessation of breastfeeding {{is still a}} serious concern in most developing countries. This study aimed at producing precooked weaning food of high nutrient quality that can alleviate the problem of malnutrition associated with weaning children from quality protein maize, soy bean and cashew nut. METHOD: Three formulations were produced from various mixture of flours produced from QPM, soybean and cashew nut. The blends were reconstituted and precooked at 1100 C. The products were subjected the proximate composition, mineral, functional and pasting properties, sensory, biological assessment tests using standard methods. RESULTS: The {{results showed that the}} addition of both cashew and soybean to QPM improved the level of protein (9. 84 %), fat (4. 50 - 14. 03 %), ash (1. 90 - 2. 30 %) and selected mineral {calcium (280. 50 – 350. 55 mg/ 100 g), potassium (228. 50 - 399. 90 mg/ 100 g), iron (3. 50 - 4. 20 mg/ 100 g), zinc (3. 20 - 4. 15 mg/ 100 g) } of precooked weaning food. The final viscosity and pasting temperature ranged between 142. 25 – 229. 33 RVU and 75. 25 – 80. 630 C respectively. The sensorial quality of the diet showed that the precooked diets were acceptable to the panellists but the control was the best. The in vivo studies showed higher growth rate (30. 82 – 67. 10 g) in the soy and cashew substituted QPM group was the best among the formulated diets while the basal did not support growth (- 15. 22 g). The protein efficiency ratio ranged between 1. 90 and 2. 94. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that QPM substituted with both soy and cashew nut produced weaning food of comparable quality to the commercial weaning food and supported good growth responses in experimental animals...|$|E
