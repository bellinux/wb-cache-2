2500|$|In a 2004 election, David Hergert {{defeated}} incumbent Don Blank {{for a seat}} on the University of Nebraska Board of Regents. [...] After the election, it {{was discovered}} that Hergert had missed a deadline for filing a campaign-finance report; the belated filing had deprived Blank of $15,000 in public money for his campaign. [...] In April 2006, Hergert was impeached by a vote of the Nebraska legislature. [...] Domina was retained by the legislature to prosecute the ensuing case before the Nebraska Supreme Court. Hergert's defense argued that his violations of the law were not impeachable, since they occurred before he had taken office and not during his term as regent. [...] Domina responded that Hergert would not have won the election had he not transgressed the law, and that the transgressions were therefore connected to his holding office. [...] The Supreme Court, stating in its decision [...] "During the campaign and, significantly, after he took office, Hergert intentionally filed false reports of campaign spending in an attempt to cover up his conduct", found Hergert <b>guilty</b> <b>on</b> <b>charges</b> of false reporting and obstruction of government operations, and removed him from office in July 2006.|$|E
2500|$|On August 25, 2015, {{more than}} five years after the Toronto G20 {{incidents}} leading to the charges, Fenton was found guilty of two counts of unlawful arrest and one count of discreditable conduct, disciplinary charges under the Police Act, in relation to the “kettling” of protestors and passers-by at the intersection of Queen Street and Spadina Avenue and at the Novotel hotel on the Esplanade. In rendering judgment, retired Ontario judge John Hamilton explained that “Legitimate protesters … had the right not to be subject to arrest for making noise, chanting and sitting in the public street.”. [...] Hamilton indicated that he believed Fenton was committed to serving the public, but that he did not properly understand the constitutional right of the public to protest. [...] In addition to the unlawful arrest convictions, Hamilton deemed Fenton guilty of discreditable conduct resultant from keeping people corralled in the streets during a severe thunderstorm while his duty was to protect them from such harsh weather; however he found him not guilty of the same charge in relation to the Novotel because those unlawfully arrested did not suffer similar hardships. [...] Fenton was found not <b>guilty</b> <b>on</b> <b>charges</b> of unnecessary exercise of authority relating to the treatment of protestors after they were arrested and taken away because another officer of equal rank {{was in charge of the}} Prisoner Processing Centre; that officer was never charged.|$|E
