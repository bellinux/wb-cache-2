5|$|The {{main reason}} for calling is to allow male frogs to attract a mate. Males may call {{individually}} or {{there may be a}} chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. Females of many frog species, such as the common tree frog (Polypedates leucomystax), reply to the male calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony. Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crowd.</b> The rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} ODI series {{between the}} two teams was drawn 3–3. The series was notable for two incidents. In the fifth match at Georgetown, Guyana, Waugh was facing the bowling of Keith Arthurton with his team needing four runs from the final over to win. He struck the last ball of the match into the outfield, and attempted three runs to tie the match. A crowd invasion resulted in all the stumps being removed, with Waugh out of his ground when the ball was returned by the fielder. The match was declared a tie. During the West Indies run-chase in the final match in Barbados, local batsman Sherwin Campbell was run out after he fell over because of a collision with the bowler (Brendon Julian) who was attempting to field the ball. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> riot and Waugh was nearly struck {{in the head with}} a glass bottle. The match continued after Campbell was reinstated, but Waugh criticised the security and questioned the integrity of the match.|$|E
