25|$|Animal {{and human}} studies and {{clinical}} experience {{back up the}} contention that morphine {{is one of the}} most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Hydal), and oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like nicomorphine and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like desomorphine, <b>hydromorphinol,</b> etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.|$|E
50|$|The process {{gave rise}} to various {{concentrations}} of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, <b>hydromorphinol,</b> and oxymorphone during the experiments. Three paths were found: from morphine to hydromorphone with dihydromorphine as the penultimate step, from morphine to hydromorphone with morphinone as the penultimate step, and from morphine to <b>hydromorphinol</b> to hydromorphone.|$|E
50|$|RAM-378 (7,8-Dihydro-14-hydroxy-N-phenethylnormorphine) is an opioid analgesic. It is the N-phenethyl {{derivative}} of <b>hydromorphinol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine (RAM-318) is an opiate {{analgesic}} drug, {{which is}} also an active metabolite of oxycodone and <b>hydromorphinol.</b> 14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine is not currently marketed in any developed country, but has been of interest to pharmaceutical companies looking for new analgesics and antitussives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydromorphinol</b> is metabolised {{mainly in}} the liver {{in the same fashion}} as many other opioids and is itself a minor active {{metabolite}} of 14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine, an uncommonly used opiate (but is therefore also an active metabolite of a first-order active metabolite of oxycodone).|$|E
50|$|Oxymorphol is {{oxymorphone}} {{which has}} been hydrogenated at the 6-position and consists of a mixture of 4,5α-Epoxy-17-methylmorphinan-3,6β,14-triol and 4,5α-Epoxy-17-methylmorphinan-3,6α,14-triol (<b>hydromorphinol)..</b> It is produced by the human body as an active metabolite of oxymorphone and some bacteria as an intermediate in turning morphine into hydromorphone. It can also be manufactured and {{is the subject of}} patents by drug companies looking for new semi-synthetic analgesics and cough suppressants.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hydromorphinol</b> was {{developed}} in Austria in 1932. It is available, and commonly used, as a medicine in Sweden. In the United States, it was never available and is classified as a Schedule I drug with a DEA ACSCN of 9301. The salts in use are the bitartrate (free base conversion ratio 0.643) and hydrochloride (0.770). The 2014 national aggregate manufacturing quota was 2 grams, unchanged from prior years.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hydromorphinol</b> (RAM-320, 14-Hydroxydihydromorphine) is an opiate {{analogue}} that is {{a derivative}} of morphine, where the 14-position has been hydroxylated and the 7,8- double bond saturated. It has similar effects to morphine such as sedation, analgesia and respiratory depression, but is twice as potent as morphine and has a steeper dose-response curve and longer half-life. [...] It is used in medicine as the bitartrate salt (free base conversion ratio 0.643, molecular weight 471.5) and hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.770, molecular weight 393.9) ...|$|E
50|$|Like {{all or most}} of {{the direct}} {{morphine}} derivatives, halogenated derivatives of these drugs and their hydromorphone and <b>hydromorphinol</b> analogues were synthesized in the 1930s when both the esters and the halogenated morphine derivatives were being developed, including one given as 1,2-iodo-3,6,14-triacetyl-6ɑ-14β-hydroxydihydromorphinone in a footnote to a 1948 German medical journal article about the esters of morphine. It appears that this drug was used, labelled with Iodine 129, as a tracer in animal studies, was significantly stronger than morphine, and possibly has 1- and/or 2- fluoro, chloro, and bromo analogues.|$|E
50|$|Thebacon is {{generated}} by the esterification product of the enol tautomer of hydrocodone (dihydrocodeineone) with acetic acid. Although modification of thebaine {{is the most common}} way of making thebacon, it is not uncommonly prepared by refluxing hydrocodone with acetic anhydride, generally similar to how diacetylmorphine is produced. It is also a product of the metabolism of hydrocodone by Pseudomonas putida M10, the bacterium used for oil spill remediation. This also produces a morphinone reductase which can turn morphine into hydromorphone in a process which produces other active opioids, such as oxymorphone, oxymorphol, or <b>hydromorphinol</b> as intermediates.|$|E

50|$|Thebacon's {{analgesic}} and antitussive potency {{is slightly}} {{higher than that of}} its parent compound hydrocodone, which gives it approximately eight times the milligramme strength of codeine. The acetylation at position 3 and the conversion into a dihydromorphinone class semisynthetic (at position 14 on the morphine carbon skeleton) allows for the drug to more rapidly enter the central nervous system in greater quantity where it is de-acetylated into hydromorphone, and also converted by other processes into <b>hydromorphinol,</b> morphine and various other active and inactive substances; it therefore simultaneously takes advantage of two methods of increasing the effectiveness of morphine and its derivatives, those being catalytic hydrogenation (codeine into hydrocodone) and esterification (morphine into diamorphine, nicomorphine &c) in a manner not unlike to that of dihydrodiacetylmorphine.|$|E
5000|$|Morphine is {{the gold}} {{standard}} to which all narcotics are compared. Semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), nicomorphine (Vilan), <b>hydromorphinol</b> and others vary in such ways as duration of action, side effect profile and milligramme potency. Fentanyl has the benefit of less histamine release and thus fewer side effects. It can also be administered via transdermal patch which is convenient for chronic pain management. In addition to the intrathecal patch and injectable Sublimaze, the FDA has approved various immediate release fentanyl products for breakthrough cancer pain (Actiq/OTFC/Fentora/Onsolis/Subsys/Lazanda/Abstral). Oxycodone is used across the Americas and Europe for relief of serious chronic pain; its main slow-release formula is known as OxyContin, and short-acting tablets, capsules, syrups and ampules are available making it suitable for acute intractable pain or breakthrough pain. Diamorphine, methadone and buprenorphine are used less frequently. Pethidine, known in North America as meperidine, is not recommended [...] for pain management due to its low potency, short duration of action, and toxicity associated with repeated use. Pentazocine, dextromoramide and dipipanone are also not recommended in new patients except for acute pain where other analgesics are not tolerated or are inappropriate, for pharmacological and misuse-related reasons. In some countries potent synthetics such as piritramide and ketobemidone are used for severe pain, and tapentadol is a newer agent introduced in the last decade.|$|E
