Due {{to the introduction of}} a new small- er plugger (30 / 04) shaping and obturation procedures are expected to be easier. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate in vitro how deep apically the new plugger penetrates and com- pare penetration with the “fine” plugger.

In the second test, initially two 30 / 04 pluggers and then two 50 / 06 pluggers were inserted in the mesial canals as deep as clinically required. Radi- ograms were taken of all samples by means of a millimetric grid. Pictures were scanned, and digitally analized.
