40|$|Engineering {{drawing is}} a {{combination}} of geometrical and building, mechanical and electrical drawing. It relates between theory and picture of reality. Engineering drawing will provide an accurate and complete picture for every object in terms of shape and size. Individuals involved in the world of engineering must be able to read and interpret an engineering drawing. This is an important pre-requisite. Many researches showed that those who learn Engineering drawing encounter difficulties to see an image in 3 dimension, in other words, visualisation. In Engineering drawing, information and specifications from the real object must be transferred to a drawing; likewise, interpretation of information from a drawing to produce a real image. The transfer from reality to a drawing and vice versa is not an easy task. Thus, a web-based system for teaching and learning Engineering drawing was developed based on the Visualisation and Constructivist Model. EEO™ is tailored for several topics of engineering drawing such as Orthographic Projection; Sectional View; Isometric and Oblique drawing at the secondary level. The learning strategy consists of multiple phases beginning with orientation, elicitation of ideas, reconstruction, application of concept and reflection. For example, in the orientation phase, students will be exposed to an overview of the topic followed by learning of specific concepts. Other phase involved eliciting of ideas reconstruction of concept and application of knowledge. This system also provides a learning environment that allows learners to view objects from different angles; such as third angle projection and <b>first</b> <b>angle</b> <b>projection</b> as well as views of plans, side and front elevations. The learners will be gUided through the various steps in drawing methods for each topic via animations and simulations. Learners are able to view any section repeatedly. Examples of real application of engineering drawings WIJl be also given using graphic, animations and video. To evaluate students understanding, exercises will be given {{at the end of each}} session. The effectiveness of the system will also be evaluated using students' interactive patterns while working at the interface...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} different <b>angle</b> <b>projection</b> {{technique for}} the clinical detection {{and treatment of}} multiple canals in mandibular anterior teeth and premolars. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-seven in vivo mandibular anterior teeth and premolars were selected from two hundred and fourteen patients. Four kinds of radiographs were taken for each tooth. The radiograph was taken at a horizontal angles of 0, 20 - 30 degrees from the mesial or distal of the tooth with and without files in canal. If a radiolucent line or files was present mesial or distal to the main canal, an additional canal was suspected. If the tooth appeared to have one large canal in the cervical or middle third of the root which disappeared or constricted as it traveled in an apical direction, an additional canal was suspected. The root canals were instrumented with ProTaper in crown-down mode and filled with laterally condensed gutta-percha and paste, the root canal configurations were classified into Types I - V. RESULTS: 60. 92 % multiple canals and 26. 44 % long oval canals were detected and treated from suspected multiple canals. The sensitivity of <b>angle</b> <b>projection</b> technique with file in X-ray diagnosing of multiple canals was 93. 0 %, and second canal was missed in four cases. The multiple canals in the 247 mandibular anterior teeth and premolars were present in central incisors: 9. 43 % (5 of 53); lateral incisors: 38. 33 % (23 of 60); canines: 15. 90 % (7 of 44), first premolar: 40. 38 % (21 of 52); second premolar: 2. 63 % (1 of 38). CONCLUSIONS: The different <b>angle</b> <b>projection</b> technique will assist the clinician in the detection and treatment of multiple canals in mandibular anterior teeth and premolar, and <b>angle</b> <b>projection</b> technique with file detected more multiple canals. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{approach}} to the X-ray tomography problem with sparse projection data is proposed. Non-negativity of the X-ray attenuation coefficient is enforced by modelling it as max{Φ(x), 0 } where Φ is a smooth function. The function Φ is computed as the equilibrium so-lution of a nonlinear evolution equation analogous to the equations used in level set methods. The reconstruction algorithm is applied to (a) simulated full and limited <b>angle</b> <b>projection</b> data of the Shepp-Logan phantom with sparse angular sampling and (b) measured limited <b>angle</b> <b>projection</b> data of in vitro dental specimens. The results are significantly better than those given by traditional backprojection-based approaches, and similar in quality (but faster to compute) compared to Alge-braic Reconstruction Technique (ART).

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new method based on wavelet-medianmoments and a novel idea of <b>angle</b> <b>projection</b> for {{detecting}} multioriented text in video. The proposed method uses wavelet decomposition first to obtain three high frequency sub-bands (LH, HL and HH) and then median central moments are computed on the average sub-bands of the three high frequency sub-bands to brighten the text pixels. K-means clustering (K= 2) is used for obtaining text pixels from the wavelet-median-moments features (WMMF). Text candidates are obtained by mapping the output of K-means on Sobel edge map of the original input frame. To deal with multi-oriented text, we introduce new idea of <b>Angle</b> <b>Projection</b> (AP) based on boundary growing and nearest neighbor concepts from the text candidates instead of conventional projection profiles.

The subjects (N= 12) were members of 1979 - 80 University of Alberta Volleyball Team. The research design employed a repeated measures technique with two variables, the on-hand and off-hand spikes. Subjects were required to perform 20 straight spikes for each technique. The velocity and the <b>angle</b> of <b>projection</b> data for each trial were obtained by cinematographical analysis. Accuracy scores were collected by direct recording after each trial. A correlated t test was used to determine the differences in velocity and accuracy between the on-hand and the off-hand spikes.

A further correlated t test was used to determine differences in that relationship between the on-hand and off-hand spikes.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} projection e†ects {{involved in the}} study of classical double sources is pre-sented here. Theoretical calculations of the way projection e†ects enter empirically determined param-eters are studied. It is shown that some parameters, such as the lobe width, are rather insensitive to the <b>projection</b> <b>angle,</b> while other parameters, such as the ambient gas density, are more sensitive. The deviation of the observed value from the true value of any given parameter is usually not signiÐ-cant when the <b>projection</b> <b>angle</b> is greater than about 60 ¡ and is signiÐcant only at very small <b>projection</b> <b>angle,</b> at which the symmetry axis of the source is pointing close to the line of sight to the observer.

40|$|In the {{performance}} {{analysis of a}} trough compound parabolic concentrator (CPC), the concept of south <b>projection</b> <b>angle</b> is often used for the nonmeridional sunlight to compare with the acceptance angle of CPC to determine if solar radiation could be collected. The solar altitude and azimuth {{are the only two}} factors used to calculate the south <b>projection</b> <b>angle.</b> However, for the solid CPC made of dielectric material, due to the refraction on the air–dielectric interface, the optical path of refracted light within a dielectric CPC would also depend on the refractive index of dielectric material and the tilt angle of CPC. The conventional south <b>projection</b> <b>angle</b> would not be suitable for performance analysis of a solid dielectric CPC. This paper therefore introduces a concept of inner south <b>projection</b> <b>angle</b> which is based on the refracted light and derives a formula using vector analysis. The formula relates the inner south project angle with the solar altitude and azimuth, the refractive index, and the CPC tilt angle as well. Photopia software is meanwhile employed to predict the optical performance of dielectric CPC. The simulation results confirm that use of the inner south <b>projection</b> <b>angle</b> can determine if solar radiation could be collected or transmitted through a dielectric CPC rather than conventional south <b>projection</b> <b>angle.</b> Discussions are given about the correlation between the inner south <b>projection</b> <b>angle</b> and the optical efficiency and transmittance of a trough dielectric CPC.
