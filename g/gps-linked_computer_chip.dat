50|$|These {{techniques}} included {{wafer scale}} integration (WSI), {{with the goal of}} producing a <b>computer</b> <b>chip</b> that was 2.5 inch on one side. At the time, <b>computer</b> <b>chips</b> of only 0.25 inch on a side could be reliably manufactured. This giant chip was to be connected {{to the rest of the}} system using a package with 1200 pins, an enormous number at the time. Previously, mainframe computers were built from hundreds of <b>computer</b> <b>chips</b> due to the size of standard <b>computer</b> <b>chips.</b> These <b>computer</b> systems were hampered through chip-to-chip communication which both slowed down performance as well consumed much power.|$|R

By agreement with State, the U. S. Government Printing Office (GPO) produces blank e-passport books. Two foreign companies are used by GPO to produce e-passport covers, including the <b>computer</b> <b>chips</b> embedded in them. At U. S. ports of entry, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) inspects passports. GAO was asked to examine potential risks to national security posed by using foreign suppliers for U. S. e-passport <b>computer</b> <b>chips.</b> This report specifically examines the following two risks: (1) Can the <b>computer</b> <b>chips</b> used in U. S. e-passports be altered or forged to fraudulently enter the United States? (2) What risk could malicious code on the U. S. e-passport <b>computer</b> <b>chip</b> pose to national security? To conduct this work, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials at State, GPO, and DHS relating to the U. S. e-passport design and manufacturing and e-passport inspection systems and procedures. ...|$|R
