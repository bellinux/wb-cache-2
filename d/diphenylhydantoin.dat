Chronic exposure of rats to the closely relatedepoxide, dieldrin, {{has been suggested}} to reduce their muscular efficiency in performing a work exercise. Dieldrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide widely used in crop protection andpreservation. Among the diverse symptoms resulting from intoxication are muscular twitching increasing in severity to epileptiform convulsions with loss of consciousness.

5000|$|Procainamide was {{approved}} by the US FDA on June 2, 1950, under the brand name [...] "Pronestyl". It was launched by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1951.Due to the loss of Indonesia in World War II, the source for cinchona alkaloids, a precursor of quinidine, was reduced. This led to research for a new antiarrhythmic drug. As a result, procaine was discovered, which has similar cardiac effects as quinidine. In 1936 it was found by Mautz that by applying it directly on the myocardium, the ventricular threshold for electrical stimulation was elevated. This mechanism is responsible for the antiarrhythmic effect. However, due to the short duration of action, caused by rapid enzymatic hydrolysis, its therapeutic applications were limited. In addition, procaine also caused tremors and respiratory depression. All these adverse features stimulated the search for an alternative to procaine. Studies were done on various congeners and metabolites and this ultimately led to the discovery of procainamide by Mark et al. It was found that procainamide was effective for treating ventricular arrhythmias, but it had the same toxicity profile as quinidine, and it could cause systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. These negative characteristics slowed down the search for new antiarrhythmics based on the chemical structure of procainamide. In 1970 only five drugs were reported. These were the cardiac glycosides, quinidine, propranolol, lidocaine and <b>diphenylhydantoin.</b> In January 1996, extended release procainamide hydrochloride (Procanbid extended-release tablets) {{was approved}} by the FDA.|$|E

The mode {{of action}} of <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> was investigated by characterizing its effect on 86 Rb and 45 Ca fluxes in isolated pancreatic islets. The inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin release by <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> was apparently not attributable to activation of a Na+ + K+ATPase as <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> failed to affect 86 Rb net uptake, at least in glucose-stimulated islets. <b>Diphenylhydantoin</b> decreased 45 Ca net uptake by the islets, an effect possibly due to inhibition of Ca 2 + entry into the islet cells. <b>Diphenylhydantoin</b> indeed markedly inhibited the glucose-induced increase in 45 Ca outflow and decreased the process of 40 Ca- 45 exchange evoked by a rise in extracellular Ca 2 + concentration. <b>Diphenylhydantoin</b> failed to affect the inhibitory action of glucose upon 45 Ca outflow whether in {{the presence or absence}} of extracellular Ca 2 +, and did not impair the antimycin A-induced release of 45 Ca from intracellular organelles.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the relaxant effect of MgSO 4 and <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> on isolated canine middle cerebral artery (MCA) rings contracted with the thromboxane-A 2 analogue U 46619. Methods: Canine MCA rings, {{with and without}} endothelium, were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording, they were contracted with U 46619 {{in the presence of}} indomethacin, with and without nitro-L-arginine (NLA). Cumulative dose-response curves were performed using MgSO 4 (10 - 8 M to 10 - 2 M) and <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> (10 - 9 M to 10 - 3 M). Main Outcome Measures: Tension at each concentration of the study drug expressed {{as a percentage of the}} maximum tension developed with U 46619; area under the concentration response curve. Results: Both MgSO 4 and <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> relaxed the MCA rings irrespective of the presence of endothelium. <b>Diphenylhydantoin</b> caused an endothelium-dependent relaxation at concentrations above 3 x 10 - 5 M, unaffected by NLA. Conclusions: MgSO 4 relaxes canine MCA by a direct smooth muscle effect independent of the endothelium. <b>Diphenylhydantoin</b> causes an endothelium-dependent relaxation of canine MCA at concentrations above 3 x 10 - 5 M, unrelated to nitric oxide.

40|$|Cardiac {{toxicity}} is {{a frequent}} manifestation in amitriptyline overdose and is felt to be due, in part, to sodium channel blockade by the drug. Another agent with sodium channel blocking properties, <b>diphenylhydantoin,</b> has been used clinically to reverse cardiac conduction abnormalities induced by amitriptyline. This reversal of toxicity is believed to occur secondary to competition for the sodium channel binding site. We evaluated individually and in combination the effects of amitriptyline (0. 4,uM) and <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> (10 - 80,uM) on the sodium current in isolated rabbit atrial and ventricular myocytes at 17 °C. Using the whole-cell variant of the patch-clamp technique, we found that both amitriptyline and <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> reduced the sodium current in a use-dependent fashion. The time constant of recovery (Tr) from block by amitriptyline at- 130 mV was very slow (13. 6 ± 3. 2 seconds), whereas rr during <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> exposure was fast (0. 71 ± 0. 21 seconds, p< 0. 0001 compared with amitriptyline).

We investigated whether <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> treatment caused any differences in glycosaminoglycans, collagen synthesis and gene expression in human normal palate fibroblasts. METHODS: Human palate fibroblasts were maintained for 24 hours in serum-free 199 medium containing 5 microg/mL (3) H-glucosamine or (3) H proline hydrochloride. Collagen and glycosaminoglycan classes were then measured using biochemical methods, gene expression with microarray analysis and cytoskeleton components with immunofluorescent antibodies and computer analysis. RESULTS: In normal fibroblasts <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> reduced collagen and glycosaminoglycan synthesis with a marked effect on sulphated glycosaminoglycans. There were also substantial decreases in tubulin, vimentin and alpha-actin staining and an increase of vinculin compared to controls. <b>Diphenylhydantoin</b> acted on several genes related to the synthesis of cytoskeleton and adhesion membrane proteins.

40|$|Barbiturates and <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> {{inhibit the}} carbamoylcholine-stimulated {{increase}} in 32 P incorporation into phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid, {{but have a}} relatively slight effect on the incorporation of 32 P into these lipids {{in the absence of}} carbamoylcholine and no effect on 32 P incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Inhibition of the carbamoylcholine-stimulated increase was observed for pentobarbital, thiopental, phenobarbital, 5 -(1, 3 -dimethylbutyl) - 5 -ethylbarbiturate, (+) - and (-) - 5 -ethyl-N-methyl- 5 -propylbarbituate and <b>diphenylhydantoin.</b> Similar concentrations of barbiturates and <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> were previously reported to inhibit the K+-stimulated Ca 2 + influx, and therefore other agents that affect Ca 2 + influx were tested to find whether they had any effect on 32 P incorporation into these lipids. K+ (35 mM) increases 32 P incorporation into phosphatidic acid, but to a smaller degree than 100 micrometer-carbamoylcholine, and its effect was inhibited by pentobarbital. Veratridine (75 micrometer) does not increase 32 P incorporation into either phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylinositol, but did inhibit the carbamoylcholine-stimulated increase in 32 P incorporation into phosphatidylinositol. The possible relationship between the phospholipid effect and stimulated Ca 2 + influx is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiepileptic}} drugs <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> and phenobar-bital {{were measured}} in serum {{by a new}} commercially available enzyme immunoassay procedure (“EMIT,” Syva Corp.). The procedure requires < 5 mm {{and no more than}} 50 l of serum per determination. It is simple; only four steps (pipetting and diluting with an automatic pipettor-dilutor) are required before spectrophotometry. Twenty replicate analyses of a serum containing pheno-barbital and <b>diphenylhydantoin</b> gave results with a CV of 6. 8 % and 9. 1 %, respectively. Results attained in a large series of patients were compared with results by a gas/liquid chromatographic procedure. For phenobarbi-tal r = 0. 97, and for diphenyihydantoin r = 0. 98. No false negatives or false positives were encountered. The clinical value of determining the concentra...|$|E
