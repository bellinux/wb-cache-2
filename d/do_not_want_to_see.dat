5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
25|$|The {{capture of}} {{undesirable}} species is a recognized problem with all fishing methods and unites environmentalists, who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> fish killed needlessly, and fishermen, {{who do not}} want to waste their time sorting marketable fish from their catch. A number of methods to minimize this have been developed for use in trawling. Bycatch reduction grids or square mesh panels of net can be fitted to parts of the trawl, allowing certain species to escape while retaining others.|$|E

500|$|Starting on September 29, 1983, a {{layer of}} {{concrete}} was poured {{on top of the}} crushed materials, a rare occurrence in waste disposal. An anonymous workman's stated reason for the concrete was: [...] "There are dead animals down there. We wouldn't want any children to get hurt digging in the dump." [...] Eventually, the city began to protest the large amount of dumping Atari was doing, with one commissioner stating that the area did not want to become [...] "an industrial waste dump for El Paso." [...] The local manager ordered the dumping to be ended shortly afterwards. Due to Atari's unpopular dumping, Alamogordo later passed an Emergency Management Act and created the Emergency Management Task Force to limit the future flexibility of the garbage contractor to secure outside business for the landfill for monetary purposes. Alamogordo's then mayor, Henry Pacelli, commented that, [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> something like this happen again." ...|$|E
500|$|Robey {{returned}} to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took {{a leading role in}} another hit revue, Joy Bells. Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: [...] "No, No, No" [...] centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and [...] "The Rest Cure" [...] told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: [...] "Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion {{from one side of the}} auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic." [...] Joy Bells ran for 723 performances.|$|E

500|$|However, the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval was {{disastrous}} for Fingleton, who scored a pair as Australia were hammered by 338 runs. He was blamed for leaking {{the details of}} the dressing room exchange between captain Bill Woodfull and English manager Plum Warner, which almost caused the abandonment of the Test series. Warner had visited Woodfull to express sympathies after the Australian captain was struck in the heart by Larwood's short pitched bowling, to which Woodfull retorted [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you Mr. Warner. There are two sides out there. One is playing cricket and the other is not." [...] The leak caused a sensastion, as Woodfull had publicly remained composed {{in the face of the}} body barrage, neither complaining nor retaliating. Fingleton was dropped for the remaining two Tests of the series. New South Wales played England after the Third Test and Fingleton had a chance to show his credentials against Bodyline but made only 19 and 7 in a four-wicket defeat, and was unable to force his way back into the Test team. Fingleton always denied responsibility for the leak, blaming Bradman. This incident was the first in a string of open disagreements between Fingleton and Bradman.|$|E
500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{said that}} while the storyline of Liz being forced to {{integrate}} GE products into the show was a [...] "good idea", it [...] "missed the bull's-eye". He also felt that the storyline of putting Jack on TGS with Tracy Jordan was [...] "fun", but thought [...] "that for some reason fell a bit flat". Tom Shales of The Washington Post felt that [...] "30 Rock had [...] "consistently and considerably improved since its premiere". He praised Alec Baldwin, whose performance he described as [...] "rare and rich [...] perilously close to perfect, beyond improving". Shales said that it was [...] "painful to report" [...] that Jack McBrayer was absent in the episode, saying he was [...] "the show's brightest discovery", and his [...] "performance has been a bittersweet beauty". Rob Canning of IGN said that 30 Rocks was [...] "one new comedy we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> taken off the air". He said that [...] "Jack-Tor" [...] had him [...] "laughing from every angle", and may have [...] "begun a debate as to which character is more fun to watch– Jack Donaghy or Tracy Jordan?". He said that the outtakes of Jack's sketch were [...] "one of the best parts of the episode", and that Tracy was evolving into his own [...] "uniquely hilarious character". Overall, he felt that Jack was winning the [...] "comedy showdown".|$|E
500|$|In 1932–33, great {{controversy}} erupted during England's tour of Australia. The visitors, captained by Douglas Jardine, used bodyline tactics—persistently {{aiming at}} the upper bodies and heads of the Australian batsmen {{in the hope of}} stifling the hosts' strong batting line-up. The Australian public and cricket community abhorred the tactic, but Woodfull refused to retaliate or complain publicly, despite some of his players wanting to do so. After the first Test, which Australia lost heavily, Woodfull was not confirmed as captain until just {{before the start of the}} next match, prompting speculation that the Australian Board of Control might remove him for refusing to retaliate. The controversy peaked during the third Test at the Adelaide Oval. Woodfull was felled by a blow to the heart, almost provoking a riot. After Woodfull was dismissed, English manager Plum Warner came to privately express his sympathy, to which Woodfull famously replied [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is playing cricket and the other is not." [...] The comment was leaked to the media and caused an uproar, after a teammate suffered a fractured skull, the Australian Board formally complained to English administrators about whether bodyline was sporting. This prompted threats of a trade boycott and a tour cancellation, so the Australian Board retracted. England completed a convincing 4–1 victory, but Woodfull was much praised for his stoic public behaviour. The Australian captain batted for 20 hours during the series, defying the bruising bowling for a longer time than any of his compatriots.|$|E

500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. It shows you care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E

Rather than continue with this line up or add additional members, it was decided by Colby and BBC production staff to replace this group with a male and female group created for the programme, Ruby Flipper, choreographed by Colby and managed by Colby with Pearson. Lee Ward left shortly after this decision was made, reportedly saying regarding the change [...] "It's a big mistake. Men rush home to watch sexy ladies.

The median wait time for surgery is a little over four weeks with 82.2% waiting less than 3 months. In the U.S., patients on Medicaid, the low-income government programs, can wait three months or more to see specialists. Because Medicaid payments are low, some have claimed that some doctors <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Medicaid patients. For example, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, specialists agreed to spend one afternoon every week or two at a Medicaid clinic, which meant that Medicaid patients had to make appointments not at the doctor's office, but at the clinic, where appointments had to be booked months in advance. A 2009 study found that on average the wait in the United States to see a medical specialist is 20.5 days.|$|E
