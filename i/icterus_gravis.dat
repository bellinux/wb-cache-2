40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that after familial jaundice in the new-born there not rarely remain certain cerebral symptoms which are related to a particular localization of the icteric staining in the brain substance, especially in the basal ganglia. The first description of <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neonatorum was given by Orthl', and the familial character was stressed by Schmorl 2. In recent years a number of articles on this subject have appeared. In America it was discussed extensively by Zimmermann and Yannet', and recently by Astrachansa, in England by Hawksley and Lightwood 4, in France by Pehu, Brochier and Wang ' and in Holland by C. de Lange 6. The relationship of <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neonatorum to hydrops foetalis and congenital anaemia has been studied recently by Diamond, Blackfan and Baty ' and by Parsons, Hawksley and Gittins 8. On {{the cause of the}} peculiarly localized icteric staining in the brain {{as well as on the}} etiology of <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neonatorum there exist differen...|$|E
40|$|Cirrhosis of {{the liver}} is a {{comparatively}} rare disease in childhood. Poynton and Wyllie ' describe seven ' types, ' one of these being a type associated with <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neonatorum. They say: Pathologically, there {{may seem to be}} very little evidence in favour of grouping such cases among cirrhoses {{of the liver}}. In affected infants dying in the first few days after birth [...] . (there was) found no indication of increased connective tissue [...] In the more chronic cases, however, as in the fourth child in Pfannenstiel's family which died on the 21 st day, the liver was enlarged, coarse and dark green [...] . Microscopically, the interstitial tissue of the liver was irregularly broadened and had an oedematous appearance, with here and there small collections of cells. The liver cells contained bile and the cell columns were very narrow; the bile ducts were widened at several points. These details are strongly suggestive of an early biliary cirrhosis, the fibrosis not commencing till after birth. This thesis is supported by Hawkesley and Lightwood 2 in their clinical and pathological study of <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neonatorum. They found, in seven cases out of nine of more than five weeks of age, signs of hepatic fibrosis. The fibrosis was most conspicuous in relation to the portal tracts but an intercellular fibrosis was also observed. They suggest that survival from <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> may be accompanied by cirrhotic changes in the liver and that infants so surviving may become the subjects of multilobular cirrhosis of the liver in early childhood. Several cases of liver cirrhosis with a history of jaundice in the neo-natal period have been reported.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years the close {{association}} of hydrops fetalis, congenital anemia of the newborn, <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neonatorum, and erythroblastosis fetalis has been stressed because of the occurrence of these pathological processes in various combinations in individual children and on some occasions in several of the offspring of one family. The opportunity for observing individually the children of a family thus afflicted has not often presented itself. The object of the present paper is to report the case histories of four siblings delivered in the New Haven Hospital, the first-born of whom had gross congenital anomalies; the second, <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neonatorum and kernicterus; and the third and fourth, <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis,</b> congenital anemia, and erythroblastosis fetalis. The case studies that have been previously reported in the literature have been adequately summarized in 1932 by Diamond, Blackfan and Baty, 1 who added one of their own, and more recently by Hawksley and Lightwood in 1934. 2 Pasachoff and Wilson, 4 and Netter 8 in this country have subsequently published additional familial case studies. The parents of the siblings in the present report were in normal health and were not blood relatives. Both had negative Kahn tests on blood serum. The mother had scarlet fever and diphtheria in childhood; her menstrual history revealed nothing unusual. She was twenty-eight years old when she married and was pregnant thirteen months later. Abstracts of the case histories of the children are as follows, and are given in the order of their births. No other pregnancies are known to have occurred. Case 1. (N. H. H. No. 60, 500). The first pregnancy was uneventful except for severe nausea. and vomiting during the early months. After thirteen hours of normal labor the infant was delivered by cesarean section becaus...|$|E
40|$|RHESUS {{incompatibility}} as a {{cause of}} mental deficiency is now well recognized (Penrose, 1954). Fortunately, only about one child in 20, potentially incompatible with its mother, has haemolytic disease (Race, 1954) and of these, especially since the introduction of effective treat-ment, only a small number suffer severe brain damage. Already in 1875 Orth was interested in brain damage resulting from <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neonatorum, long before Landsteiner and Wiener dis-covered the rhesus factor in 1940. Schmorl reported nuclear damage in the brain of jaundiced babies in 1904. Until recently little attention was paid to the neurological effects in survivors of <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neona-torum and the causal relationship was not appreciated. Following the publications by Zimmerman and Yannet (1933 and 1935) the relation-ship between jaundice of the newborn and mental defect, epilepsy and extra-pyramidal symptoms began to be mentioned in textbooks of neurology (Brain, 1947). Once discovered, this relationship became overestimated, as so often happens in such cases. Yannet and Lieberman (1944), as well as Snyder, Schonfeld and Offerman (1945), suggested that undifferentiated mental defect, with no history of jaundice, might be due to blood incom-patibility: but it now seems clear that gross brain damage and mental defect can only arise from such incompatibility following severe jaundice (Pickles, 1949). The work of Gerver and Day (1950) suggests, however, that some loss of intelligence without gross neurological signs may follow <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis.</b> A small proportion of children certified as mentally defective owe their handicap to blood group, usually rhesus, incompatibility. Most clinical articles on blood group incompatibility deal with the acute illness- and there have been few accounts of the neurological after-effects. Richards (1950) described 5 cases of double athetosis, deaf mutism by guest on Septe...|$|E
40|$|INTRINSIC STAINING OF TEETH, {{apart from}} being caused by {{localised}} injury or infection, {{may be due to}} {{one of a number of}} factors. For example, the white patchy hypoplasia sometimes seen on the tips of the permanent incisors may have been due to a debilitating illness, such as broncho-pneumonia, in infancy. Pink staining of the teeth may occur in porphyria and in <b>icterus</b> <b>gravis</b> neonatorum the teeth, when they erupt, may be stained bluish green. Osteogenesis imperfecta may cause, in addition to blue sclerotics, a distinctive brownish colour of the teeth, which soon wear down due to poorly formed or absent enamel. Several of the tetracycline group of antibiotics are known to cause yellowish staining of the teeth in children (Stewart 1964, 1973) and the time of administration of the drug may be calculated approximately from the area of tooth so discoloured. It has been known for many years that people living in certain districts have peculiar staining or mottling of the teeth. One such area in Mexico was mentioned by Kuhns in 1888. The inhabitants of a district of Italy, near Naples, were described by Eager (1901) as suffering from a dental peculiarity known as "denti di chiaie". Black and McKay (1916) gave the classic description of mottled teeth which they found in inhabitants of parts of Colorado. This was followed by reports of simila...|$|E
