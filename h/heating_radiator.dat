50|$|In {{electronics}} {{testing and}} servicing an isolation transformer is a 1:1 (under load) power transformer used for safety.

5000|$|Denison Olmsted of New Haven, Connecticut, {{appears to}} have been the {{earliest}} person to use the term 'radiator' to mean a heating appliance in an 1834 patent for a stove with a heat exchanger which then radiated heat. In the patent he wrote that his invention was a peculiar kind of apparatus, which I call a radiator. The <b>heating</b> <b>radiator</b> was invented by Franz San Galli in 1855, a Prussian-born Russian businessman living in St. Petersburg. [...] In the late 1800s, companies, such as the American Radiator Company, promoted cast iron radiators over previous fabricated steel designs in order to lower costs and expand the market.|$|E

The next day they find some candy or a small present in their shoes. Typical Sinterklaas treats traditionally include hot chocolate, mandarin oranges, pepernoten, speculaas (sometimes filled with almond paste), letter-shaped pastry filled with almond paste or a chocolate letter (the first letter of the child's name made out of chocolate), chocolate coins and marzipan figures. Newer treats include gingerbread biscuits or and a figurine of Sinterklaas made of chocolate and wrapped in colored aluminum foil.|$|E

5000|$|The {{broadcasting}} station that became UKC Radio had {{its origins in}} the autumn term of 1967 as an audio feed through the radiator system. This was inspired by {{an article in the}} magazine Practical Wireless entitled ‘Communications through the Ground’. The article explained how an audio signal injected into two separate earthing points could be detected by connecting an amplifier to two more earthing points nearby. Budding electronics students decided to test this out in Eliot College by connecting the loudspeaker output of a HiFi amplifier between the mains earth and the central <b>heating</b> <b>radiator</b> system. The signal could be heard loud and clear in study bedrooms throughout the college by connecting a modified transistor radio, used as an audio amplifier, between the radiator and the metal table lamp, which provided a connection to the mains earth.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the inventors of the radiator, which significantly contributed to modern central heating systems. He gave it the name [...] "hot-box".

It appears that he is one of several people who contributed to the development of the heating innovation. San Galli received a radiator patent in 1857, while American Joseph Nason developed a primitive radiator in 1841 and received a number of U.S. patents for hot water and steam heating. Nason's patent for tapered pipe threads in particular is cited by 1930s writer Ara Marcus Daniels as the key development in the birth of the radiator.|$|E
