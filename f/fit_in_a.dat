Starting in the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for additional roles ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short range battlefield systems that <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> backpack.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Denning {{was born}} on 23 January 1899 in Whitchurch, Hampshire, to Charles Denning, a draper, and his wife Clara Denning (née Thompson). He was one of six children; his older brother Reginald Denning later became a noted staff officer with the British Army, {{and his younger brother}} Norman Denning became Director of Naval Intelligence and Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Intelligence). Denning was born two months earlier than {{expected}} and almost died at birth; he was so small and weak that he was nicknamed 'Tom Thumb' and could <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pint pot. He was named after Alfred the Great by his sister Marjorie, and was baptised on 23 April 1899 at All Hallows Church, Whitchurch.|$|E
5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the Eiffel Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital Eiffel Tower, the technicians {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E

25|$|Copper used in {{building}} wire has a conductivity rating of 100% IACS or better. Copper building wire requires less insulation {{and can be}} installed in smaller conduits than when lower-conductivity conductors are used. Also, comparatively, more copper wire can <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given conduit than conductors with lower conductivities. This greater “wire fill” is a special advantage when a system is rewired or expanded.|$|E

25|$|Chamber {{music is}} a form of {{classical}} music that is composed for a small group of instruments—traditionally a group that could <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> palace chamber or a large room. Most broadly, it includes any art music that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part (in contrast to orchestral music, in which each string part is played by a number of performers). However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances.|$|E

25|$|A 30A, 4-wire {{single-phase}} grounding socket {{is often}} used for electric clothes dryers. 240 volts from the split phase system {{is used for the}} heating elements, and the motor and controls run on 120 volts. These plugs have blades that are rather larger than NEMA 5-20, are more widely spaced, and are angled so as to prevent using the wrong plug in the wrong circuit. These plugs have L-shaped neutral blades that will not <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> NEMA 14-50 receptacle.|$|E
25|$|Lenses {{are used}} as {{prosthetics}} for the correction of visual impairments such as myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatism. (See corrective lens, contact lens, eyeglasses.) Most lenses used for other purposes have strict axial symmetry; eyeglass lenses are only approximately symmetric. They are usually shaped to <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> roughly oval, not circular, frame; the optical centres are placed over the eyeballs; their curvature may not be axially symmetric to correct for astigmatism. Sunglasses' lenses are designed to attenuate light; sunglass lenses that also correct visual impairments can be custom made.|$|E
25|$|This is a 50A, 4-wire {{grounding}} socket usually {{installed in}} kitchens {{and used for}} electric cooking ranges and ovens supplied with 240V by the split phase system. Similar to dryers on 14-30 sockets, these usually have lights, fans, timers, etc., that are run from 120V (obtained {{from one of the}} 120 legs to neutral). Many plug-in electric cars also use this type of socket for recharging in the owner's garage (but in this case neutral is not needed). It is also commonly found in RV parks to provide electricity to recreational vehicles. These plugs have a straight neutral blade that will not <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> NEMA 14-30 receptacle.|$|E

25|$|TOPS-20 (and {{possibly}} TENEX) used a 0 to 2 level {{tree that}} has similarities to a B-tree. A disk block was 512 36-bit words. If the file <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 512 (29) word block, then the file directory would point to that physical disk block. If the file fit in 218 words, then the directory would {{point to an}} aux index; the 512 words of that index would either be NULL (the block isn't allocated) or point to the physical address of the block. If the file fit in 227 words, then the directory would point to a block holding an aux-aux index; each entry would either be NULL or point to an aux index. Consequently, the physical disk block for a 227 word file could be located in two disk reads and read on the third.|$|E
25|$|Very small lamps {{may have}} the {{filament}} support wires extended through {{the base of the}} lamp, and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.|$|E
25|$|The MRAP program's lack of {{a common}} design {{presents}} a potential wartime logistic challenge, but others saw the diversity of MRAP vehicles as an advantage. The vehicle's weight and size severely limits its mobility off main roads, in urban areas, and over bridges, as 72 percent of the world's bridges cannot hold the MRAP. Its heft restricts transport by C-130 cargo aircraft or amphibious ships. Three MRAP vehicles (or five Oshkosh M-ATVs) <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> C-17 aircraft, and airlifting is expensive, at $150,000 per vehicle, according to estimates by the U.S. Transportation Command. The US Air Force contracted several Ukrainian Antonov An-124 heavy-cargo aircraft, which became a familiar sight above cities such as Charleston, South Carolina where some MRAPs are produced. For comparison, sealifting costs around $13,000 per vehicle, but takes 3–4 weeks for the vehicle to arrive in theater. In December2007, the Marine Corps reduced its request from 3,700 vehicles to 2,300. and the Army also reassessed its MRAP requirements in Iraq. In January2010, 400 were flown into Afghanistan, increasing to 500 a month in February, but the goal of 1,000 a month was scaled back, because of difficulties in distribution and training drivers.|$|E
