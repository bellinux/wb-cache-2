50|$|About 70 billion cheques {{were written}} {{annually}} in the US by 2001, though around 17 million adult Americans do not have bank accounts at all. When sending a payment by online banking in the US at some banks, the sending bank mails a cheque to the payee's bank or to the payee rather than sending the funds electronically. Certain companies whom a person pays with a cheque will turn it into an Automated Clearing House (ACH) or electronic transaction. Banks try to save time processing cheques by sending them electronically between banks. Cheque clearing is usually done through an <b>electronic</b> <b>cheque</b> broker, such as The Clearing House, Viewpointe LLC or the Federal Reserve Banks. Copies of the cheques are stored at a bank or the broker, for periods up to 99 years, {{and this is why}} some cheque archives have grown to 20 petabytes. The access to these archives is now worldwide, as most bank programming is now done offshore. Many utilities and most credit cards will also allow customers to pay by providing bank information and having the payee draw payment from the customer's account (direct debit). Many people in the US still use paper money orders to pay bills or transfer money which is a unique type of cheque. They have security advantages over mailing cash, and do not require access to a bank account.|$|E

40|$|As today, the {{traditional}} payment systems of cash, cheques {{and credit cards}} are being supplemented by <b>electronic</b> <b>cheques,</b> <b>electronic</b> credit card-based systems, and token-based systems, online security is of utmost importance {{and one of the}} biggest criteria used for evaluating electronic payment systems. Electronic payment systems must guarantee the essential security requirements: confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability. authentication, non-repudiation as well as anonymity and trust. This paper compares the various payment systems (both traditional and electronic) available today mainly according to their security aspects. Secure processing can be accomplished including access controls and detection techniques, such as, encrypted communication channels, user and/or message authentication, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital certificates and firewalls.

40|$|On the {{assumption}} that the current WWW is a precursor to full commercial networked hypermedia systems this paper examines how payments can be made on the Internet. We have identified two classes of payments. Micropayments would typically be charged per link access and are between 1 / 100 or a cent and $ 1. Macropayments are larger payments above $ 1. Several payment schemes have been proposed for networked services and electronic commerce. The schemes are roughly divided into electronic cash, <b>electronic</b> <b>cheque</b> and electronic credit card. This paper evaluates each of these proposals for their suitability for micropayments and concluded that with current Internet charging all the schemes fail. This paper proposes a simple method of providing micropayments. 1.

50|$|Instrument-specific {{legislation}} {{includes the}} Cheques Act 1960, {{part of the}} Bills of Exchange Act 1908, which codifies aspects related to the cheque payment instrument, notably the procedures for the endorsement, presentment and payment of cheques. A 1995 amendment provided for the <b>electronic</b> presentment of <b>cheques</b> and removed the previous requirement to deliver cheques physically to the paying bank, opening the way for cheque truncation and imaging. Truncation allows for the transmission of an electronic image of {{all or part of}} the cheque to the paying bank’s branch, instead of the cumbersome physical presentment. This reduced the total cheque clearance time, as well as eliminating the costs of physically moving the cheque.|$|R
50|$|Although {{technology}} {{needed to}} exist {{to be able}} to truncate a cheque, it was the laws related to cheques that were the main impediment to their introduction.

30|$|This study {{examines}} the dynamic causal relationship of adopting cashless payment on five EU economies, namely, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, and Portugal. Telegraphic transfer, card payment, <b>electronic</b> money, and <b>cheque</b> payment are the proxies for cashless payment. The real {{gross domestic product}} is computed by dividing gross domestic product (GDP) by its consumer price index (CPI). The annual GDP and CPI of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, and Portugal 2004 to 2012 are obtained from International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics. The real GDP {{has been used as}} a proxy for economic growth (Apergis and Payne 2010; Slesman et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016), economic activities (McCoskey and Selden 1998; Cevik et al. 2016) and productivity (Conti 2014).

30|$|A cashless {{transaction}} {{refers to an}} economic setting whereby goods and services are transacted without cash (Paul and Friday 2012), either through <b>electronic</b> transfer or <b>cheque</b> payment. The effect of cashless payment on an economy can be analysed by the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI). The concept was first introduced by Roger in 1962 where he explained how innovation is diffused to members of a social system over time (Rogers, 1995). According to DOI, {{the adoption of a}} new idea or innovations is caused by interaction between individuals through interpersonal networks. In this context, diffusion is the spread of cashless payment where consumers seek improved and convenient transaction, while businesses seek new profit opportunities. The diffusion of cashless payment will result in the adoption of {{cashless transaction}}s within the society or community, subject to the types of innovation adopters 2 and innovation-decision process. 3 Since the consequences of diffusion in cashless payment depend on how quickly the society is willing to adopt cashless payment through different stages of innovation processes, the consequences of the adoption of cashless payment differs in different society.|$|R
5000|$|In the US, {{the bottom}} 5/8" [...] of the cheque is a keep out zone {{reserved}} for MICR characters only which {{should not be}} intruded upon by handwriting. One must be especially careful of lower case descenders when filling out the signature and memo lines which are often {{at the bottom of}} the cheque in close proximity. It is advisable to treat the signature and memo lines as boundaries rather than baselines and sign above them. Intrusion into the MICR area can cause problems when the cheque runs through the clearinghouse, requiring someone to print an MICR cheque correction strip and glue it to the cheque. Many new ATMs do not use deposit envelopes and actually scan the cheque at the time it is deposited and will reject cheques due to handwriting incursion which interferes with reading the MICR. This can cause considerable inconvenience as the depositor may have to wait days for the bank to be open and may have difficulty getting to the bank even when they are open; this can delay the availability of the portion of a deposit which their bank makes available immediately as well as the balance of the deposit. Terms of service for many mobile (cell phone camera) deposits also require the MICR section to be readable. Not all of the MICR characters have been printed at the time you manually fill in the cheque as additional characters will be printed later to encode the amount; thus your sloppy signature could obscure characters that you didn't realize would later be printed there. Since MICR characters are no longer necessarily printed in magnetic ink and will be scanned by optical rather than magnetic means, the readers will be unable to distinguish pen ink from pre-printed magnetic ink; these changes allow cheques to be printed on ordinary home and office printers without requiring pre-printed cheque forms, allow ATM deposit capture, allow mobile deposits, and facilitate <b>electronic</b> copies of <b>cheques.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, cheques {{are still}} popular, partly because cheques remain {{free of charge}} to {{personal}} customers; however, bank-to-bank transfers are increasing in popularity. Since 2001, businesses in the United Kingdom have made more <b>electronic</b> payments than <b>cheque</b> payments. Automated payments rose from 753 million in 1995 to 1.1 billion in 2001 and cheques declined in that same period of time from 1.14 to 1.1 billion payments. Most utilities in the United Kingdom charge lower prices to customers who pay by direct debit than for other payment methods, including electronic methods. The vast majority of retailers in the United Kingdom and many in France have not accepted cheques {{as a means of}} payment for several years, and cheque guarantee cards are no longer issued. For example, Shell announced in September 2005 that it would no longer accept cheques at its UK petrol stations. This was soon followed by other major fuel retailers, such as Texaco, BP, and Total. Asda announced in April 2006 that it would stop accepting cheques, initially as a trial in the London area, and Boots announced in September 2006 that it would stop accepting cheques, initially as a trial in Sussex and Surrey. Currys (and other stores in the DSGi group) and WH Smith also no longer accept cheques. Cheques are now widely predicted to become a thing of the past, or at most, a niche product used to pay private individuals or for the very large number of small service providers who are not willing to provide their bank details to customers to allow electronic payments to be made to them or do not wish to be burdened with checking their bank accounts frequently and reconciling them with amounts due (for example, music teachers, driving instructors, children's sports lessons, small shops, schools). The UK Payments Council announced in December 2009 that cheques would be phased out by October 2018, but only if adequate alternatives were developed. They intended to perform annual checks on the progress of other payments systems and a final review of the decision would have been held in 2016. Concerns were expressed, however, by charities and older people, who are still heavy users of cheques, and replacement plans were criticized as open to fraud. [...] It was therefore announced by the UK Payments Council in July 2011 that the cheque would not be eliminated. 432 million inter-bank cheques and credit-items worth £472 billion were processed in the United Kingdom in 2016 according to Payments UK.|$|R
