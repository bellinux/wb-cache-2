Sheppard {{would go on}} to serve PA duties at Yankee Stadium for another 56 years. On September 28 of that year, Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds pitched a no-hitter against the Red Sox. A year later, Red Sox outfielder Jimmy Piersall and Yankees second baseman Billy Martin exchanged insults before a game in Boston, and ended up fighting in the tunnel under the stands. The fight was eventually broken up by Yankees coaches Bill Dickey and Oscar Melillo, and Boston starting pitcher Ellis Kinder. Piersall changed out of <b>his</b> <b>bloody</b> shirt and promptly fought with teammate Maury McDermott. The Red Sox won 5–2 with Piersall sitting the game out.|$|E

25|$|The Mauryan Emperor Aśoka (273232 BC) {{converted}} to Buddhism after <b>his</b> <b>bloody</b> {{conquest of the}} territory of Kalinga (modern Odisha) in eastern India during the Kalinga War. Regretting the horrors and misery {{brought about by the}} conflict, the king magnanimously decided to renounce violence, to replace the misery caused by war with respect and dignity for all humanity. He propagated the faith by building stupas and pillars urging, amongst other things, respect of all animal life and enjoining people to follow the Dharma. Perhaps the finest example of these is the Great Stupa of Sanchi, (near Bhopal, India). It was constructed in the 3rd century BC and later enlarged. Its carved gates, called toranas, are considered among the finest examples of Buddhist art in India. He also built roads, hospitals, resthouses, universities and irrigation systems around the country. He treated his subjects as equals regardless of their religion, politics or caste.|$|E

They will meet back up in Odense, Denmark. Some of Floki’s men follow them on land where they attack fishermen and burn boats to stop their means of escape. Thorfinn tries to rationalize with those men to take him to Floki but all they want is his head. With no other choice, Thorfinn fights them barehanded and backup from Hild. With only three pursuers remaining, one of them kills their leader. It turns out that the other two are part of the Vagn Battalion who infiltrated Floki’s army to track their movements. The two men, Eskil and Vrage, ask Thorfinn for assistance to vanquish Floki once and for all. They were testing him during his fight against the pursuers to observe his strength and noble birth as the candidate for leader of the Jomsvikings.

While criticizing the characters' sad decisions, Serdar Yegulalp from About.com wondered whether the OVAs had to make viewers accept Kenshin's death wish after so much time of wandering and feeling a mortal disease. However, some reviewers noted Kenshin's personality in the OVAs {{was one of the most}} complex ever to be animated remarking on the fact that he can not forget <b>his</b> <b>bloody</b> past, despite having a peaceful life. Don Houston from DVD Talk noted the controversy between the fandom as they refrained from treating Reflection as canon due to how tragic the life of Kenshin's family became. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe shared similar feelings, but noted Kenshin had no new enemies to fight after Enishi, leaving him with his disease story arc.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{returned}} home early in 1919 {{to a time}} of readjustment.

He could not say how scared he was in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not." [...] In September, he took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back-country of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The trip became the inspiration for his short story [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", in which the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war. A family friend offered him a job in Toronto, and with nothing else to do, he accepted. Late that year he began as a freelancer, staff writer, and foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly.

Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future.
