Ice cubes, which are very cold, are most commonly placed in it to make the things inside stay cool.

40|$|Polythene lined thermocole <b>insulated</b> plywood <b>boxes</b> (second-hand tea chests) {{could be}} {{successfully}} used for transport of fresh iced fish. It {{was found that}} a minimum of 25 mm thermocole insulation was necessary during summer (April to June) and 15 mm during winter (Nov. to March). By using these <b>insulated</b> <b>boxes</b> the initial fish to ice ratio could be brought down to 1 : 0. 75 and still further to 1 : 0. 5 {{at the height of}} winter in Jan. and Feb. These second-hand tea chests are robust and are able to stand a minimum of 5 trips to and fro. The moulded polystyrene boxes are not suited for long distance transport. Another redeeming feature in the entire operation was that there was practically no loss of fish due to spoilage in transit. 100 % of the fish transported was in acceptable condition and could be marketed. In the non-insulated boxes used by the trade, the loss due to spoilage ranged from 10 % to 25 %, and this could be completely eliminated by the use of these <b>insulated</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{generalized}} {{model for}} predicting quantities of ice to cool and maintain freshly harvested fish at sea in <b>insulated</b> <b>boxes</b> is presented. The model addresses the universal need for fisherman {{to know in}} advance of going to sea just how much ice {{will be needed to}} cool down the expected day's catch to a desired temperature, maintain the catch, and to allow for losses. Illustrative predictions are presented for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) (Thunnus maccoyii) for a range of day's catch from 2000 to 8000 kg in ambient temperature ranging from 15 to 35 °C. The amount of ice needed to cool down SBT from an initial uniform harvest temperature of 28 °C to a maintenance temperature of 5 °C is shown to be the controlling contribution to total ice needed. Predictions highlight that a useful, safe rule-of-thumb is 1 kg of ice will be needed for each 3. 5 kg of SBT. Importantly, the model is based on fundamental principles and predictive accuracy is demonstrated to be largely insensitive to a range of assumptions including volume of the void in the <b>insulated</b> <b>boxes</b> and overall coefficient of heat influx from ambient. The model can be used to predict the number of <b>insulated</b> <b>boxes</b> of defined dimension that will be needed to cool and hold the fish, ice and water {{for a wide range of}} fish species. It will be of interest to fisherman and boat owners and agents who invest in ice to preserve fish at sea. This research addresses the universal need for fisherman to know in advance of going to sea how much ice will be needed on-board boats to cool down an expected day's catch to a desired temperature, maintain the catch and to allow for losses. The model is generalized and can be applied to a wide range of fish species. K. R. Dave...|$|R

In industrial cases a parabolic mirror can concentrate sunlight on the tube. Heat is stored in a hot water storage tank. The volume of this tank needs to be larger with solar heating systems to compensate for bad weather and because the optimum final temperature for the solar collector is lower than a typical immersion or combustion heater. The heat transfer fluid (HTF) for the absorber may be water, but more commonly (at least in active systems) is a separate loop of fluid containing anti-freeze and a corrosion inhibitor delivers heat to the tank through a heat exchanger (commonly a coil of copper heat exchanger tubing within the tank). Copper {{is an important component}} in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of its high heat conductivity, atmospheric and water corrosion resistance, sealing and joining by soldering and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks).|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{environmental concerns}} and energy needs require {{the investigation of}} alternatives {{to the use of}} non-renewable and polluting fossil fuels. One such option is solar energy. A way that the domestic sector can lessen its impact on the environment is by the installation of solar collectors to heat up water. A typical flat-plate collector consists of an absorber, transparent cover sheets, and an <b>insulated</b> <b>box.</b> The absorber is usually a sheet of high-thermal-conductivity metal such as copper or aluminium, with tubes either integral or attached. Its surface coated to maximise radiant energy absorption and to minimise radiant emission. The <b>insulated</b> <b>box</b> reduces heat loss from the back or sides of the collector [1]. The cover sheets, called glazing, allow sunlight to pass through the absorber but also insulate the space above the absorber to prevent cool air to flow into this space. Flat-plate solar collectors are commonly used for residential water and space heating. They have been in service for the last 30 years without significant changes in their design and operation principles. Collectors are usually oversized in order to satisfy a heat demand and this increases its manufacture cost. 2. Why?

40|$|Documentation of the empiric data, {{measured}} in the heating and cooling chamber to determine the thermal constant for the investigated transport boxes. Background: The transport of veterinary drugs must comply with the general standards for drug storage. Although many vehicles are equipped with active heating and/or cooling devices assuring recommended storage conditions, simple <b>insulated</b> transport <b>boxes</b> are also often used. In this study, measurements for typical transport boxes were performed under laboratory conditions {{by the use of}} a climate chamber for a temperature of - 20 °C and 45 °C to investigate the impact of box size, insulation material, liquid vs. dry filling products, filling degree and other parameters on the thermal performance of <b>insulated</b> <b>boxes.</b> Model calculations and instructions are presented to predict the retention time of recommended drug storage temperatures. Results: The measurements and the model calculations showed that the loading of the transport boxes with additional water bottles to increase the heat capacity is appropriate to prolong the retention time of the recommended temperature range of the drugs. <b>Insulated</b> transport <b>boxes</b> are not suitable to store drugs over a period of more than approximately 12 hours. For practical use, a recipe is presented to measure the thermal properties of a transport box and the related retention time for which the recommended storage temperatures can be assured. Conclusions: The following principles for drug transportation in vehicles are recommended: (1) Before transfer into boxes, drugs should always be thermally preconditioned (2) Increase the filling degree of the boxes with thermally preconditioned water bottles or re-usable thermal packs will increase the heat capacity. Do not deep-freeze the bottles or packs below 0 °C to avoid drug freezing due to contact. (3) Open the lid of the boxes only to uncase drugs that are immediately needed. (4) The bigger the box and the higher the filling degree, the longer the retention time of the transport box. (5) Wherever possible, place the drug box at a cool site inside the vehicle. (6) The monitoring of the inside temperature of the transport boxes is recommended.
