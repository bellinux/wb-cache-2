25|$|A {{key feature}} of ObjC is its support <b>for</b> <b>categories,</b> methods {{that can be}} added to extend classes at runtime. Categories allow {{extending}} classes in-place to add new functions with no need to subclass or even have access to the original source code. An example might be to add spell checker support to the base NSString class, which means all instances of NSString in the application gain spell checking. The system is also widely used as an organizational technique, allowing related code to be gathered into library-like extensions. Swift continues to support this concept, although they are now termed extensions, and declared with the keyword extension. Unlike ObjC, Swift can also add new properties accessors, types and enums to extant instances.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} the Cobas TaqMan MTB assay (Cobas assay) with respect to its clinical application. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 1154 results from 1034 patients for whom mycobacterial cultures and the Cobas assay were performed simultaneously. Based on the patient medical records, two categories of clinical application were defined: (1) the diagnosis of patients with a high probability of pulmonary tuberculosis according to clinical and radiological features (nÂ =Â  128), and (2) the exclusion of tuberculosis in clinically indeterminate patients (nÂ =Â  1026). Standard culture was used as the reference method. Results: The sensitivity of the Cobas assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 70. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 49. 7 â 85. 5 %) <b>for</b> <b>category</b> 1, but only 25. 0 % (95 % CI 4. 5 â 64. 4 %) <b>for</b> <b>category</b> 2.
