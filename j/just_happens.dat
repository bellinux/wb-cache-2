5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she <b>just</b> <b>happens</b> to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation <b>just</b> <b>happens.</b> Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E

Darden held a ten-hour clemency hearing and, after hearing arguments from both sides, decided {{to proceed with the}} execution. Pauli Murray, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters' A.

The president's apparent refusal to act damaged his relationship with civil rights leaders; Murray, in an open letter on behalf of the movement, called it a [...] "stab in the back".

[...] Jennifer Morrison was hired for the part of Emma Swan. The actress explained her character as someone who [...] "help this kid who seems like he's a little bit emotionally dysfunctional," [...] but noted that Emma does not yet {{believe there is a}} fairytale universe.

500|$|GameSpot's Mc Shea found Second Sons open world {{beholden to}} a dated formula. He {{described}} Seattle as [...] "a playground {{for you to}} go nuts in" [...] instead of [...] "a living, breathing world", with the Seattleites existing only as fodder for players. CVGs Hussain called Seattle [...] "hauntingly empty", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately. He felt that the open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with Grand Theft Auto V, Sleeping Dogs and , which he felt featured better open worlds. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that Second Son did not innovate the open world genre as well as it could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes. Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as [...] "virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs". Edge found the amount of content in the game thin, finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side-missions. [...] "Approach [...] as an action game that <b>just</b> <b>happens</b> to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense", they wrote. Destructoid's Carter found the amount of content ample, and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{iterations}} included new numberless visual {{themes and}} new game mechanics {{such as a}} monster who ate tiles and a wall that blocked certain movements. Early Threes designs had no inclination towards minimalism: the pair felt that the game needed to appear more complex so as to interest players. Wohlwend sent Vollmer designs including sushi-themed tiles that paired fish and rice, a chess theme that paired chess pieces, themes about animals, broccoli and cheese soup, military insignia, hydrogen atoms, and textile patterns. Their test audiences were confused by the close to two dozen themes tested in total. Vollmer commented that these ideas made the game feel [...] "unwieldy and unnatural" [...] and that he always preferred the game when the changes were reverted. They received a [...] "wake-up call" [...] from fellow game designer Zach Gage, who encouraged them to return from their foray into complexity. The final game returned to its original theme of numbers. Speaking in retrospect, Wohlwend said the game [...] "always wanted to be simple". He noted that players [...] "think math" [...] upon seeing the game's numbers, though the game is more about [...] "spatial relationships" [...] and <b>just</b> <b>happens</b> to have a [...] "number theme".|$|E

500|$|Wohlwend, Vollmer, and Hinson of Puzzlejuice collaborated {{again on}} Threes!, a game where the player slides {{numbered}} tiles on a four-by-four grid to combine addends and multiples of three. Its development began before Ridiculous Fishing March 2013 release. Vollmer presented an idea {{similar to the}} final product in its simplicity: pair tiles as multiples of three. The first prototype was written in a single night. Vollmer and Wohlwend spent {{at least half a}} year of the game's 14-month development iterating on this main idea. Early Threes designs had no inclination towards minimalism: the pair felt that the game needed to appear more complex so as to interest players.

500|$|The {{formulation}} of Russell as an Asian American character, {{along with the}} casting of an Asian American in the role was met positively as well. Both Nagai and the film were awarded by the East West Players for the depiction of Russell. EWP lauded Pixar {{for the creation of}} the character, stating, [...] "We are proud to honor a very progressive film company like Pixar who cast an Asian American character alongside an elderly one to play the leads in a feature film." [...] The character is noted as Pixar's first lead Asian character, and was further positively received within the added context of historical non-Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment. Asian American organizations and entertainment websites, such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), Racebending.com, and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions, noting the general lack of Asian American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment. In an interview with NPR in 2013, Angry Asian Mans Phil Yu reflected on the character's lack of typical Asian stereotyping, stating, [...] "You know, he <b>just</b> <b>happens</b> to be Asian and he's, you know, really adorable character. But that kid could've been of any ethnicity but they made the effort to make him Asian - just a little color, you know, and it's really wonderful when that kind of thing happens where they don't have to play that up and make it like a thing or a joke, which happens a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season, however, {{was another}} championship year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan averaged 20.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 blocks per {{game in the}} regular season, and was selected as a Western Conference starter for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, his ninth appearance in the event. In the playoffs, he led the Spurs to a 4–1 series win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4–2 win over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4–1 win against the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals, setting up {{a meeting with the}} Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals. There, the Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4–0, earning Duncan his and San Antonio's fourth ever championship. Duncan proclaimed that that championship was [...] "the best" [...] of his four championships; however, he also acknowledged he played [...] "sub-par" [...] and thus received only one vote for NBA Finals MVP from a panel of ten. His colleagues were more appreciative of Duncan; among others, ex-teammate David Robinson referred to the Spurs titles as the [...] "Tim Duncan era", and lauded his leadership. Coach Popovich also praised Duncan: [...] "Tim is the common denominator. He's [...] a different cast around him [...] '99, '03 and '05. He's welcomed them all. [...] But he is that easy to play with, and his skills are so fundamentally sound that other people can fit in." [...] Then-NBA commissioner David Stern added: [...] " [...] is a player for the ages. I'm a tennis fan, and Pete Sampras is one of the greats. OK, he wasn't Andre Agassi or John McEnroe. He <b>just</b> <b>happens</b> {{to be one of the}} greatest players of all time.
