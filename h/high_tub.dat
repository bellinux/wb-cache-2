40|$|Coffee seeds {{begin to}} develop shortly after {{fertilization}} and can take 6 to 8 months to complete their formation, a period during which all {{the characteristics of the}} mature seed are determined, directly influencing physiological quality. However, {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanisms that act during coffee seed maturation. The objective of the current study was to analyze expression of the &# 946;-tubulin (TUB) and endo-&# 946;-mannanase (MAN) genes during different phases at the end of development and in different tissues of Coffea arabica seeds. The transcription levels of the TUB and MAN genes were quantified in a relative manner using qRT-PCR in whole seeds, and dissected into embryos and endosperms at different developmental stages. Greater expression of MAN was observed in whole seeds and in endosperms during the green stage, and in the embryo during the over-ripe stage. <b>High</b> <b>TUB</b> gene expression was observed in whole seeds during the green stage and, in the embryos, there were peaks in expression during the over-ripe stage. In endosperms, the peak of expression occurred in both the green stage and in the cherry stage. These results suggest participation of endo-&# 946;-mannanase during the initial seed developmental stages, and in the stages of physiological maturity in the embryo tissues. TUB gene expression varied depending on the developmental stage and section of seed analyzed, indicating the participation of &# 946;-tubulin during organogenesis and coffee seed maturation. 201...|$|E
40|$|Dustacators (combination mineral feeders and {{livestock}} dusting devices) {{were used for}} four beef herds at Kansas State University in 1985. Loose mineral was supplied in all four Dustacator tubs, which were adjusted to low settings. Permethrin dust had no apparent effect on horn flies. Co-Ral® from two sources and Rabon® provided approximately 65 % horn fly reduction during the 53 -day test period. The 1986 experiment compared the effects of Dustacator mineral tub height adjustments and loose vs. block mineral. Co-Hal 1 % dust from a single source was used in all treatments on two Simmental herds and two Polled Hereford herds. Excellent horn fly control was achieved and maintained except for a temporary increase in horn fly numbers in early September in all treatments. Face fly control was inadequate in all treatments in both years. Use of block mineral was related to reduced mineral consumption and self-application of more insecticide dust. <b>High</b> <b>tub</b> adjustment was related to greater mineral consumption but reduced self-application of insecticide. The degree of fly control was not correlated with amount of insecticide used either on a per-cow or per-herd basis. Simmentals consumed nearly twice as much mineral per head as Polled Herefords, but they used only 20 % more insecticide. Including the cost of 1 % Co- Ral dust and equipment costs amortized over 5 years, Dustacators provided acceptable horn fly control and some reduction of face fly numbers for $ 1. 62 per cowlcalf pair, plus labor...|$|E

30|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the HTC 1 directions, carried possibly by magnetite (or Ti-poor titanomagnetite), are primary. If so, the HTC 1 s should be the original DRMs. Then the LTC 1 s should be post-depositional CRMs after deposition, compatible with the observation that the highest TH step that define the LTC 1 s {{is associated with the}} Tub (Tc) of the low-temperature mineral phase. This scenario is possible when the low-temperature oxidation of the original detrital (titano)magnetite to (titano)maghemite occurs (e.g. Bina and Prévot 1989; Zhou et al. 2001; Fischer et al. 2008; Channell and Xuan 2009) in oxidizing condition. It is also consistent with the LTC 1 directions that are apparently within the secular variation range of the normal-polarity Brunhes Chron. Furthermore, this possibility may explain the occasional presence of the HTC 2 having Tubs above 580  °C: some maghemite with high-temperature stability formed during the low-temperature oxidation might also acquire post-depositional CRM with Tubs with above 580  °C, having a normal-polarity direction, but this acquisition might not significantly affect the temperature spectra below 580  °C of its NRM previously carried by the detrital magnetite (or Ti-poor titanomagnetite), presumably because of a relatively little amount compared to the pre-existing magnetite (or Ti-poor titanomagnetite). This possible scenario may also explain the HTC 1 decaying not toward the origin during TH demagnetization, for example, as shown in the case of specimen GSDS 2 – 7.1  cm-TH of Fig.  4. On the other hand, some studies (e.g. Channell and Xuan 2009; Xuan and Channell 2010; Xuan et al. 2012) reported apparently negative inclinations unblocked below[*]~[*] 300 – 350  °C in late Brunhes-aged Arctic deep-sea sediments, which were often anti-parallel in direction to the remanence with <b>higher</b> <b>Tubs.</b> The low-temperature negative inclinations were interpreted by the authors as partially self-reversed CRMs carried by titanomaghemite. Even considering this, the current possibility that the HTC 1  s were originated from the geomagnetic field during or just after deposition is still valid.|$|R
60|$|At {{the next}} farm-house, which stood low and broad near the <b>high</b> road, <b>tubs</b> of water {{had been put}} out. The {{soldiers}} clustered round to drink. They took off their helmets, and the steam mounted from their wet hair. Captain sat on horseback, watching. He needed to see his orderly. His hel-met threw a dark shadow over his light, fierce eyes, but his moustache and mouth and chin were distinct in the sunshine. The orderly must move under {{the presence of the}} figure of the horseman. It was not that he was afraid, or cowed. It was as if he was disembowllled, made empty, like an empty shell. He felt himself as nothing, a shadow creeping under the sunshine. And, thirsty as he was, he could scarcely drink, feeling the Captain near him. He would not take off his helmet to wipe his wet hair. He wanted to stay in shadow, not to be forced into consciousness. Starting, he saw the light heel of the officer prick the belly of the horse; the Captain cantered away, and he himself could relapse into vacancy.|$|R
50|$|The work {{consists}} of a circular pool slightly raised above the street level. The protruding edge, the center of which is placed on a large circular base, a convex edge, on which the water slides rather than falls. The base supports a stocky and short baluster, adorned at the top with the leaves or petals relief from which flows the water and in the lower half, {{with a series of}} small tanks placed around the circumference of the banister. The latter supports a wide, central, flared basin, whose center is located in a circular base just <b>higher</b> than the <b>tub</b> edge. On the base are four large sitting nude female figures, caryatids, supporting the arms. At the center of the water gushes from a big pine cone.|$|R
5000|$|Above {{the theatre}} {{there is a}} terrace, {{excavated}} in rock, accessible by a central stairway and by a recessed path, known as [...] "Via dei Sepolcri" [...] (Street of the Tombs). Originally, the terrace had a large portico at the left. In {{the centre of the}} foundation wall was a grotto, the grotta del Ninfeo, excavated in the rock, bordered by niches probably designed to host statues and originally probably surrounded by architectural elements of the Doric order (of which only parts of a frieze survives). Inside the room (9.35 x 6.35 m, 4.75 m <b>high)</b> was a <b>tub</b> made of Opus signinum, into which water from the ancient Greek aqueduct flowed. From here the water flowed into the hydraulic system of the theatre. The whole thing might be identified with the Mouseion or sanctuary of Muses, seat of the company of actors. According to the anonymous Life of Euripides, Dionysios dedicated objects belonging to the tragic poet Euripides acquired at great expense in Greece in this sanctuary.|$|R
40|$|The {{trade off}} {{between age and}} size at emergence, which plays {{a central role in}} life history theory, is {{hypothesized}} to be more pronounced under stressful conditions, especially when these conditions are combined. Empirical evidence for this is equivocal. We tested the hypothesis by imposing combinations of two types of time stress (pond drying and late hatching date) in larvae of the damselfly Lestes viridis. Larvae from a temporary pond and a permanent pond population were reared in outdoor tubs from egg hatching until emergence. Unexpectedly, larvae did not accelerate their life history in response to simulation of pond drying. Instead, larvae reared in temporary tubs generally had a slower development and growth than larvae reared in permanent tubs. Probably deteriorating growth conditions in temporary <b>tubs</b> associated with <b>higher</b> densities and lower food levels caused this pattern. In agreement with a higher time stress in late hatched larvae, they generally had faster development and growth than larvae that hatched early in the season. Drying regime and hatching date shaped the covariation pattern between age and size at emergence, but the tradeoff was only apparent when time stress was relaxed. The tradeoff between age and size at emergence was only present in early hatched larvae, especially in permanent tubs (lowest time stress). Conversely, in late hatched larvae there was a strongly negative relationship between age and size at emergence, especially in temporary <b>tubs</b> (<b>highest</b> time stress). Our results support an alternative hypothesis that deteriorating growth conditions (i. e. pond drying) may decouple the tradeoff under time stress. The absence of a tradeoff in more time-stressed late hatched larvae can be explained by their higher intrinsic growth rates, independent of deteriorating growth conditions. We hypothesize that the pattern of less clear tradeoffs under the imposed types of time stress may be general. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mutations in the Tubby gene (TUB) cause late-onset {{obesity and}} insulin {{resistance}} in mice and syndromic obesity in humans. Although TUB gene function {{has not yet}} been fully elucidated, studies in rodents indicate that TUB is involved in the hypothalamic pathways regulating food intake and adiposity. Aside from the function in central nervous system, TUB has also been implicated in energy metabolism in adipose tissue in rodents. We aimed to determine the expression and distribution patterns of TUB in man as well as its potential association with obesity. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In situ hybridization was used to localize the hypothalamic regions and cells expressing TUB mRNA. Using RT-PCR, we determined the mRNA expression level of the two TUB gene alternative splicing isoforms, the short and the long transcript variants, in the hypothalami of 12 obese and 12 normal-weight subjects, and in biopsies from visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissues from 53 severely obese and 24 non-obese control subjects, and correlated TUB expression with parameters of obesity and metabolic health. RESULTS: Expression of both TUB transcripts was detected in the hypothalamus, while only the short TUB isoform was found in both VAT and SAT. TUB mRNA was detected in several hypothalamic regions involved in body weight regulation, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert and the paraventricular, supraoptic and tuberomammillary nuclei. We found no difference in the hypothalamic TUB expression between obese and control groups, while the level of TUB mRNA was significantly lower in adipose tissue of obese subjects as compared to controls. Also, TUB expression was negatively correlated with indices of body weight and obesity in a fat-depot-specific manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate <b>high</b> expression of <b>TUB</b> in the hypothalamus, especially in areas involved in body weight regulation, and the correlation between TUB expression in adipose tissue and obesity. These findings suggest a role for TUB in human obesity. International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 30 August 2017. doi: 10. 1038 /ijo. 2017. 214...|$|R
