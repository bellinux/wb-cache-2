However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of No Doubt's {{breakthrough}} album Tragic Kingdom (1995), the band wrote more than 20 songs for a new album, influenced by artists such as The Cure. Having toured extensively <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years since the release of Tragic Kingdom, they initially had trouble producing material and decided to experiment with new sounds. Many of the songs were written in a rented house in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, where bassist Tony Kanal was living. During early production in mid-1998 the band worked on seven tracks in Los Angeles with Matthew Wilder, who had produced Tragic Kingdom, but had creative differences with him. They planned on going to New York City to work with producer Michael Beinhorn, who had produced for alternative rock acts such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Hole, and Soundgarden.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} the action began, with Pitot's stern chasers opening fire upon Constellation. In an effort to cut the American frigate's {{advantage}} in speed, La Vengeance changed course to the south-east where the wind would give her an advantage. As he maneuvered his vessel, Pitot was able to unleash a broadside aimed at Constellations rigging. The American frigate waited to return fire until she'd gained the weather gage. Now having {{the advantage of the}} wind, Truxton's opening double-shotted broadside slammed into the port side of La Vengeances hull. Sailing side by side, the two frigates continued to engage each other <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half hours while Truxton attempted unsuccessfully to move his ship into a raking fire position. As the French tended to aim for the rigging, at one point Constellations foresails were shot away and the frigate lost her maneuverability until they could be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Having {{attended}} the National Defence College, Jackson joined the directing {{staff at the}} Army Staff College and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1981. He served {{as a member of}} the directing staff at the Staff College, Camberley, <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years. During his tenure at Camberley, he was seconded to a staff position at the Ministry of Defence in 1982 during the Falklands War, and thus missed the opportunity to serve in the conflict directly. He took command of 1 PARA in March 1984, who, at the time, were deployed in Norway, training for the possibility of a Soviet attack. Concerned that he was insufficiently prepared for the weather conditions, he left Camberley early to train with the Royal Marines. He was appointed Senior Directing Staff (Army) at the Joint Service Defence College from 1986 to 1988 and was promoted to colonel in 1987.|$|E

The album was completed after the band returned to the studio and recorded what became two of the album's singles.|$|E
