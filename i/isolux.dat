40|$|The {{degree of}} realism of the shaded {{image of a}} {{three-dimensional}} scene depends on the successful simulation of shading effects. The shading model has two main ingredients, properties of the surface and properties of the illumination falling on it. Most previous work has concentrated on the former rather than the latter.

The procedure can include intensity distributions for point light sources and output both umbrae and penumbrae for linear light sources, assuming the environment is composed of convex polyhedra. This paper generalizes Crow’s procedure for computing shadows by using shadow volumes to compute the shading of umbrae and penumbrae. Using shadow volumes caused by the end points of the linear source results in an easy determination of the regions of penumbrae and umbrae on the face prior to shading calculation.

The textural and morphological characterizations of the materials reveal {{that the presence of}} the additives does not impede the cross-linking of the monomers to form branched clusters and colloidal aggregates leading to a highly porous structure. Furthermore, the aerogel materials display an open macroporous network inherited by the diatomite, even after its lixiviation.

40|$|Introduction Industrial safety {{professionals}} {{recognize that}} adequate illumination {{is essential to}} a safe and productive work environment. The need for effective, lighting in underground coal mines is even greater. 1 Designing appropriate lighting systems for these mines is no easy [] task because of the unique environment and work procedures encountered in underground coal-mining operations. Miners must depend totally on artificial lighting systems to see. Moreover, the working face is a low-reflectivity and low-contrast environment and is continually advancing or retreating. 2 Laboratory mock-ups {{have been a major}} part of the process lighting equipment manufacturers must under- go to design an underground machine-mounted lighting system. The mock-ups often have taken considerable time. Furthermore, modifications to a lighting system (using different luminaires with an existing configuration or changing a luminaire's location, orientation, etc.) could require more time with additional mock-ups and laboratory measurements. Understanding the need to improve this situation, the US Bureau of Mines has developed an alternate method for facilitating lighting system mock-ups. A PC-Program (CAP),* with the latest software technology enables users to design, alter, and evaluate under- ground machine-mounted illumination systems. Lux levels and distance are measured as the luminaire is moved incrementally through angular traverses about horizontal and vertical axes. The measurements and angles subsequently are entered into the model. From this input data, three-dimensional <b>isolux</b> or isofootcandle profiles are constructed for luminaires that can be placed at various locations and orientations on a mining machine. As an example, Figure 1 shows a computer display of 21. 5 Ix or 2. 00 fc profiles for luminaires mounted on a simulated mine-shuttle car. Using this information, the model allows the user to determine the lux level at different locations in space about the shuttle car. How the model calculates illumination During initial development of the CAP model, the <b>isolux</b> profile of the luminaire was determined using the inverse square law (ISL). 3 The method of gathering data comprised recording a single measurement of distance at 21. 5 21 1. 21 x (2. 00 2111 fc) for angular traverses following 0. 09 rad (5 degree) increments. This data was then used to find the illumination in space for any other distance at a given azimuth and elevation using the ISL. Limitations, however, exist with this method. 4 The main one is that the ISL assumes a luminaire is a single point source of light, so long as the distance is greater than five times the 1 al;gest dimension of the luminous area of the luminaire. 5 Also, by using a single measurement to calculate the illumination for a given luminaire in the CAP model a large error could result from an inaccurate measurement...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{modification}} of the sol–gel polymerization of resorcinol–formaldehyde mixtures allowed the preparation route of homogeneously dispersed carbon black-activated carbon aerogel composites with high pore volumes and improved electrical conductivity. These materials showed good performance as electrodes for the electro-assisted removal of sodium chloride from saline water using high voltages. Besides {{the effect of the}} carbon black additive, we have investigated the influence of resorcinol–water ratio on the textural and electrochemical properties of the resulting materials. Data has shown a slight dependence on the structural order of the aerogels with the R/W ratio, regardless the incorporation of the conductive additive. The effect of the carbon black on the textural features was also negligible, due to the low amount incorporated. Nonetheless, the samples showed higher capacitance values for the removal of ions from solution, due to the enhanced conductivity provided by the carbon black, being the effect more evident for the materials prepared using a low R/W ratio.

The electrosorption capacitance evaluated by cyclic voltammetry revealed large values for the activated samples containing a large contribution of mesopores, regardless the electrolyte salt.

40|$|Highly micro-mesoporous carbon {{electrodes}} {{have been}} synthesized by the polycondensation of resorcinol-formaldehyde-melamine mixtures {{in the presence}} of a carbon conductive additive. The materials showed high surface functionalization (N- and O- groups) provided by the precursors. Despite the low amount used, the conductive additive had a marked effect on the porosity of the aerogels; for a given series, the carbon black loaded materials showed similar micropore volumes and a more developed mesoporosity than the pristine aerogels. Furthermore, the activation treatment under CO 2 atmosphere led to an increase in the surface area along with a widening of the mesoporosity. The synthesized aerogels were explored as electrodes for the electro-assisted removal of sodium chloride from saline water. A desalting capacity of 7. 3 mg/g was obtained for monolith electrodes of sample MRF-Act/CB, along with an excellent chemical stability upon charge and discharge at high polarization voltages. Such good electrochemical performance is due to the combination of an adequate pore network and surface functionalization with an enhanced electrical conductivity achieved upon the incorporation of the carbon black additive during the polycondensation of the aerogel precursors.

The solution containing the metal precursors was mixed with the hydrogel before the supercritical drying step ensuring a highly homogeneous dispersion of the nanometric metal oxides as determined by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. XPS spectra revealed the increased contribution of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups after the activation process. Also, an enhanced metal oxidation at the outer particle surface was observed. Nitrogen isotherms have revealed a decrease of the pore volume in doped samples ascribed to the partial blocking of the pore structure by the embedded nanometric metal oxide particles. Capacitance values as large as 99 F/g and 91 F/g were respectively recorded for CAGDFeAct and CAGDMnAct by cyclic voltammetry. The large capacitance detected for the iron containing activated aerogel was confirmed by deionization experiments. An electrosorption capacity of 0. 133 mmol/g was recorded for CAGDFeAct in a 0. 025 M NaCl solution when 1. 5 V were applied during the charge period.

40|$|Background: Carpet weaving is an {{occupation}} that requires sufficient and appropriate lighting. The lighting in carpet weaving workshops affects the productivity {{and the physical}} and mental health of workers. Therefore, the evaluation of the illumination and the identification of work stations requiring lighting modifications will be helpful in promotion of {{the health and safety of}} workers in carpet weaving workshops. Methods: This study was carried out for the evaluation of illumination on the basis of Geospatial Information System (GIS) technology in two carpet weaving workshops of Bokan city. As per the norms of Illumination Engineering Society, the sensors of the photometer Testo 545 were placed at lowest and highest of 35 and 163 cm in workshop I, and at 40 and 245 cm in workshop II, which correspond to the lowest and highest work surfaces in the respective workshops. Total, natural, and artificial illuminance was measured in the center of each measurement station using the photometer, and data was analyzed using the Arc GIS software. The maximum and minimum illuminances as well as <b>isolux</b> curves were obtained for each workshop. Results: The illuminance in workshops I and II were found to be lower and higher, respectively, than 200 lux, which is considered the standard for carpet weaving workshops. Thus, improving the artificial lighting system or redesigning it is essential for ensuring that the standard conditions of illuminance (200 – 300 lux) are provided. Discussion: This study showed that the application of GIS technology renders the assessment of illumination in carpet weaving workshops possible. This assessment method could also prove useful for determining the exact stations in the carpet weaving workshops that need modifications, thereby leading to cost reduction. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} resorcinol/catalyst (100 ≤R/C≤ 800) and resorcinol/water (0. 04 ≤R/W≤ 0. 13) molar ratio on the textural and capacitive properties of carbon aerogels with potential application for capacitive deionization has been evaluated. Activated and pyrolyzed aerogels were synthesized by the sol-gel polymerization of resorcinol-formaldehyde mixtures and dried in supercritical conditions. Data show that high R/C and R/W molar ratios lead to materials with large pores in the mesopore range, whereas {{the surface area}} and micropore volumes remain somewhat the same. The activation of the aerogels increased {{the differences in the}} specific surface and micropore volumes due to the development of microporosity. This effect was more remarkable for the samples with low R/C whatever the R/W ratio, indicating that the carbon aerogel obtained using high amounts of catalyst are more prone to be activated. Regarding the electrochemical features of the aerogels, low capacitance values were measured in aerogels combining low R/W and high R/C and reciprocally low R/C and high R/W molar ratios, due to their higher resistance. Polarization resistances were found to be slightly higher for the pyrolyzed than for activated aerogels, and followed a decreasing trend with the mesoporosity, indicating the outstanding contribution of the mesoporous network to provide a good kinetic response. The desalting capacity of monolithic aerogels showed a simultaneous dependence with the surface area and the resistivity of the electrodes, pointing out the importance of performing electrochemical measurements in adequate cell configurations (i. e., desalting units) upon the intended application.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} new mathematical and computational {{tools for}} applying perturbation methods to image synthesis. The key {{idea is to}} characterize families of closely related optical paths by expanding a given path into a high-dimensional Taylor series. Our methods {{are based on the}} closed-form expressions for linear and higher-order approximations of specularly reflected rays of light, which are derived from the Implicit Function Theorem and Fermat's Variation Principle. The expressions hold for general multiple-bounce specular paths and provide a mathematical foundation for exploiting path coherence in incremental rendering. To illustrate their use, new algorithms based on the perturbation formulas are developed for several applications, including fast approximation of specular reflections on curved surface and direct caustic contour generation. First, path Jacobians are introduced to formulate the linear perturbation of a ray path connecting a fixed point and a perturbed point through any number of intermediate reflection points. These Jacobian matrices are the derivatives of the reflection points with respect to the perturbed endpoint. A recurrence relation is derived to compute the closed-form expressions of path Jacobians for a general multiple-bounce reflection path, even when the new reflection path cannot be expressed in a closed form. Next, the concept of path Jacobian is generalized to tensors of third order, which we call path Hessians. A simiar recurrence formula for path Hessians is derived from tensor calculus. The expressions for path Jacobians and path Hessians hold for any reflection path involving implicitly-defined reflective surfaces. Based on the close-form expressions for the path Jacobian and the path Hessian, a reflection path can be expanded as a Taylor series up to the second order. This perturbation formula gives rise to a fast and accurate interpolation scheme for the unknown reflection paths nearby. Finally, new algorithms are presented for some applications that will benefit from our perturbation method. In one application, a new approach is presented for interactively approximating specular reflections in arbitrary curved surfaces. The technique is quite general as it employs local perturbations to interpolate point samples and is applicable to any smooth implicitly-defined reflecting surface that is equipped with a ray-intersection procedure. After ray tracing a sparse set of reflection paths with respect to a given vantage point and static reflecting surfaces, the algorithm rapidly approximates reflections of arbitrary points in 3 -space by expressing them as perturbations of nearby points with known reflections. The reflection of each new point is approximated to second-order accuracy using the Taylor expansions of one or more nearby reflection paths. After preprocessing, the approach is fast and accurate enough to compute specular reflections of tessellated objects in arbitrary curved surfaces at interactive rates using standard graphics hardware. In another application, the path Jacobian formula is used to directly compute caustic contours on a plane formed by a given point light source and an implicitly-defined specular surface. Caustic irradiance for a given point on the plane is computed using wavefront tracing and some classical results from differential geometry. Using the closed-form expression for path Jacobian, an analytic formula for the gradient of caustic irradiance is also derived. The level curves with constant caustic irradiance on the plane, caustic contours, are traced by numerically solving an <b>isolux</b> ordinary differential equation...|$|E
40|$|Chinese vernacular {{dwellings}} are low-energy buildings constructed {{before the}} advent of modern external services. No work has been published that incorporates an exacting assessment of the environmental performance of these buildings. The principal aim of this research was to investigate the environmental performance of Chinese vernacular skywell dwellings quantitatively and to establish a model of rigorous and comprehensive qualitative and quantitative research in this area. This was done by analysis of on-site measurements and computer simulation of the environmental performance of eight vernacular skywell dwellings in three villages in south-eastern China - Xidi, Zhifeng and Yuyuan. Environmental performance and building form are examined in relation to current knowledge of the social and economic life of the villages in the past centuries, and to the environmental comfort and the activities of present-day residents of the eight dwellings and other vernacular houses in the villages. It has previously been noted that, in general, the courtyard/skywell of vernacular dwellings decreases in size with progression from northern China to southern China as the climate becomes warmer. However, the mean size of the skywells was found to differ considerably between the three climatically similar villages - large skywells were found in Yuyuan village, medium sized skywells in Xidi village and very small skywells in Zhifeng village. While physical factors were found to be important in determining house form; socioeconomic, cultural and security considerations were found to be strong influences as well. The investigation of the natural illumination of Chinese vernacular dwellings conducted in this study was the first quantitative study of the distribution of natural light in these houses. Houses in the three villages were found to differ in their distribution of illumination according to local skywell form. In all three villages residents were found to take various actions to pursue satisfactory daylighting. Two patterns of daylighting <b>isolux</b> contour in skywell dwellings were identified and analysed. The first comprehensive quantitative study of the thermal performance of Chinese vernacular skywell dwellings was conducted by on-site measurement and administration of questionnaires to residents. Residents of Xidi and Zhifeng were found to appreciate the coolness of their houses in summer, but residents of all three villages found their houses unacceptably cold in winter. The efforts made by residents to mitigate extremes of heat and cold appear to be important in ensuring their thermal comfort. Evidence was obtained that evaporative cooling had a substantial influence on the temperature in the skywells of dwellings in Xidi and Zhifeng villages. In addition to the buffering of temperature by thermal mass, evaporative cooling was found to further reduce the fluctuation in temperature inside the skywell and is likely to have been the main reason that the mean dry bulb temperatures inside the skywells in these villages were lower than the mean external dry bulb temperatures. It is proposed that evaporative cooling in skywells can be exploited even in humid conditions, because natural ventilation can ensure exchange of air between the exterior and the interior of the skywell. Summer temperature/humidity data obtained in the most used spaces of skywell dwellings in the three villages were plotted on psychrometric charts and were examined in relation to the boundaries of predicted thermal comfort zones. The acceptability of thermal conditions in the dwellings that was predicted using this approach was very much lower than that reported by residents. Residents appear to be more tolerant of high humidity with the presence of natural ventilation. Such air movement is desirable to improve the thermal comfort for house occupants in hot and humid conditions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The {{continuous demand}} for more energy efficient systems is generating two lines of action in the market, on the one hand, new lighting systems more efficient and secondly, a systematic increase of the market demands concerning procedures for measuring the amount and distribution of light arriving on the surfaces. This thesis aims to deepen the knowledge of measurement algorithms and instrumentation associated {{with the process of}} design and manufacture of a new device capable of measuring dynamically photometric lighting in public lighting installations, getting the amount of flow light per unit area and the origin of that making use of the spread of information obtained at each point as to provide, ultimately <b>isolux</b> map provided by public lighting installations. This thesis responds to the development of an algorithm for propagation of light output that can be used by a photometric device in order to analyze the lighting systems found in urban areas, especially in public lighting systems thereby obtaining relevant data on the energy efficiency of facilities and future actions to be taken to minimize energy expenditure. Such photometric device can process through propagation algorithm luminous flux greater amount of information about the illumination provided by public lighting installations. Measures will optimize performing a larger number of records in less time which will result in {{a better understanding of the}} lighting conditions. We analyze the regulations governing photometric measurements of public lighting installations, both at European and Spanish statewide.
