5|$|Lights and Sounds is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Yellowcard, {{released}} on January 24, 2006, in the United States through Capitol Records. Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's first concept album, which was inspired to reflect what the band was <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> the time of production and how they have matured in the process. Lights and Sounds also departs from the sounds on Yellowcard's previous album, Ocean Avenue (2003), which broke away from its pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, Persis Khambatta {{was hired}} to portray Ilia. She had been {{required}} to wear a bald cap for her screen test, although {{at this point the}} character also wore elaborate headgear in some footage. Roddenberry was insistent on this as a character attribute, but others such as Eisner hated the idea of a bald female character. His notes said that while a bald female character would be an interesting addition, it may prevent the audience from <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> ease with Ilia and so the style may need to be given to a different character entirely. The auditions by this time were not held under the pretence that they were to play a part in a television series, but were openly talking about Star Trek becoming a feature film. The casting for Willard Decker had been delayed, both because of a slight delay in the production but also because the writers were no longer sure that the character was needed at all. This was despite auditions being conducted {{at the same time that}} Gautreaux was cast as Xon, during which, in his second audition with Barrett, he also read lines against ten actors competing for the role of Decker.|$|E
5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, Peadar O'Donnell and then George Gilmore went to Spain on behalf of the Congress to report on proceedings, and returned enthusiastic supporters of the Spanish Republicans. Ryan was incensed at quasi-Fascist Blueshirt leader Eoin O'Duffy organising an Irish Brigade to fight with the Fascists, and in open letters to the papers criticised Cardinal McRory for raising funds at church collections to support Franco. The Congress started publicising the Spanish Republican cause in public meetings. This was no easy task, given the strength of pro-Franco <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> the time, which was whipped up by sections of the Catholic Church and the Irish Independent. Pro-Republican meetings were frequently challenged, and on one occasion Ryan had to climb up a lamp-post to escape from a crowd which attacked a meeting he was addressing in York Street.|$|E
25|$|The Ensenberger Building was {{designed}} by local architect Arthur Pillsbury in an eclectic interpretation of the Art Deco Style. It {{was to be the}} last building designed by Pillsbury and one he would never see open as he was killed in an automobile accident in October 1925. The building included a six-room, fully furnished Spanish-style bungalow on the seventh floor when it opened in 1926. The bungalow had white stucco walls and arched windows and doorways. The original design of the building include gothic spires on the roof which gave the building a much less Art Deco appearance than it has today. The spires were removed in 1941 to give the building a more modern <b>feeling.</b> <b>At</b> one time there were plans to replace the terra cotta panels on the east facade with stainless steel panels. The WWII steel shortage stopped those plans and the terra cotta panels remain one of the building's most prominent features.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} photography, Brodovitch had a {{distinct}} {{feel for what}} the magazine needed. He favored on-location fashion photography {{as opposed to the}} studio shots normally used in other fashion publications. He urged his photographers to look for jarring juxtapositions in their images. One such spread features a woman in a full-length Dior gown posed between two circus elephants. The cinematic effect, a trademark characteristic of his layouts, involved using photographs as if they were stills from a film. He would repeat a pose or a dress several times across a spread to give a narrative, temporal <b>feeling.</b> <b>At</b> times, Brodovitch would arbitrarily take a series of photographs and adopt a story line to go with them, as though recapping a movie. He was known to push this idea even further by adding film sprocket borders to photographs at times. Brodovitch also often emphasized spatial illusions, using type and photographs to create multiple perspectives within a space. The notion of mirroring and doubling also interested him, {{as can be seen in}} how he paired similar pictures on a spread or dividing halves of one image across the gutter of the page.|$|E

500|$|Coghill {{was cast}} as Tony on 20 June 2008. He deemed {{the role the}} most {{challenging}} he had ever played, but hoped that it would help to raise public awareness of child abuse. Of his off-screen relationship with McGarty, Coghill explained that it helped {{that she does not}} look or act like a young child, deeming her [...] "fantastic to work with", as well as [...] "very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress", commenting: [...] "There isn't any uncomfortable <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008.|$|E

In {{order to get a}} shot of Pam and Jim looking into the camera, Greg Daniels restaged the scene four years after [...] "Niagara" [...] had been filmed. Daniels noted, [...] "To get Jim and Pam's eye line right for the camera, I stepped in as the minister [...] so they were both looking at me with the full actor-power of all the emotions {{they were supposed to be}} <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> their own wedding, just blasting in my face. I got chills and a fever." ...|$|E
500|$|In January, Davis wrote home, expressing {{frustration}} at the slow logistics of replacement aircraft parts, claiming this was slowing down missions. He {{also began to}} express contempt for the F-86, <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> times it was being outperformed by the MiG and that [...] "something {{will have to be}} done" [...] to give the UN pilots more of an advantage in combat. He also said that he had begun to grow tired of the constant publicity about him. [...] "They're trying to make a hero of me and I find it rather embarrassing", he wrote in a letter. At other times, Davis indicated he preferred to stay in combat.|$|E
500|$|In October 1899, Ricordi {{realized}} {{that some of}} the music for Cavaradossi's act 3 aria, [...] "O dolci mani" [...] was borrowed from music Puccini had cut from his early opera, Edgar and demanded changes. Puccini defended his music as expressive of what Cavaradossi must be <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> that point, and offered to come to Milan to play and sing act 3 for the publisher. Ricordi was overwhelmed by the completed act 3 prelude, which he received in early November, and softened his views, though he was still not completely happy with the music for [...] "O dolci mani". In any event time was too short before the scheduled January 1900 premiere to make any further changes.|$|E

500|$|After Argento had {{experimented with}} pure supernatural horror with 1977's Suspiria and 1980's Inferno, Tenebrae {{represented}} the filmmaker's {{return to the}} giallo horror subgenre, which he had helped popularize in the 1970s. Argento {{was inspired by a}} series of incidents which saw an obsessed fan telephone the director to criticize him for the damaging psychological effects of his previous work. The telephone calls culminated in death threats towards Argento, who channelled the experience into the writing of Tenebrae. The director also wanted to explore the senselessness of killings he had witnessed and heard about while staying in Los Angeles in 1980, and his <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> the time that true horror came from those who wanted [...] "to kill for nothing".|$|E
500|$|The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a [...] "fantaisie lyrique" [...] to a {{libretto}} by Colette. She and Ravel {{had planned}} {{the story as}} a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto. It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole, and the jazz elements and bitonality {{of much of the}} work upset many Parisian opera-goers. Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds [...] "profoundly serious <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> the heart of this vivid and entertaining work". The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, [...] "extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout".|$|E
500|$|Running {{throughout}} McNeile's {{books is}} {{the metaphor of}} warfare as sport. His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif: in Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E., he writes, [...] "To bag {{a man with a}} gun is one thing; there is sport—there is an element of one against one, like when the quality goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> all, even if they are Germans". The motif was continued into the Drummond novels. McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports, or of boxing, poker or hunting. The titles of his books also use sporting imagery: The Third Round, The Final Count, Knock-Out and Challenge.|$|E

500|$|With Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard {{broke away}} from their {{original}} pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album. The album is somewhat of a concept album, made to reflect what Yellowcard was <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> the time of production. Ryan Key, in discussion of this, said that Ocean Avenue was about [...] "finding your place in the world" [...] and explained that Lights and Sounds was about [...] "realizing that you've gotten lost". The band has cited Radiohead's Kid A (2000) and Guns N' Roses' 1991 albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II as major influences for the album. Yellowcard also credit Aphex Twin, Mouse on Mars and Explosions in the Sky for inspiration, regarding the music sound in the album.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Jackson {{started working}} on her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., with her then partner, record {{producer}} Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned as the executive producer. The discussion between the producers turned to how Jackson was <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> the time her third studio album Control (1986) was recorded. [...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of life when you were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on}} in her life then that I just thought her album should be called that", Dupri commented. Jackson wanted to maintain a R sound from her most recent albums, but with an emphasis on dance music. In June 2006, rapper Khia was confirmed on a song titled [...] "So Excited". However producer Dupri said she would be not rapping on the track, ...|$|E
500|$|... "Jacksonville" [...] premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. James Poniewozik of Time Magazine {{called it}} [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "well-acted", especially liking John Noble's performance. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining [...] "I liked 'Jacksonville' {{for the way}} it plunged directly {{into the heart of}} the show's mythology for the first time in a while, and even if it didn't tell us much we didn't already know, having the story become more personal for our heroes served to create that unsettled <b>feeling</b> <b>at</b> which Fringe excels". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly loved [...] "Jacksonville", believing it to be a [...] "tremendously moving, startling episode" [...] and [...] "one of [...] finest hours". AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw particularly praised the scene of Olivia trying to comfort her younger self, and then confronting Walter over it. She also felt Olivia's loss of memory to be [...] "interesting," [...] and became [...] "practically gleeful" [...] at her and Peter's near kiss.|$|E
