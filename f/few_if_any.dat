5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} immune to disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been <b>few,</b> <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.|$|E

Across the Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam had experienced deadly flooding in the week before Nepartak's approach, and the typhoon initially raised concerns about worsening the situation. Officials made preparations to minimize potentially exacerbating factors, and the cyclone remained far enough east to avoid seriously impacting the country.|$|E
50|$|Each $50 {{banknote}} in the 1988 {{series was}} sprinkled with special green ink dots that glow {{when exposed to}} ultraviolet light.

5|$|The 13th century saw popular {{outbursts of}} ecstatic piety {{in support of}} the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212. Large groups of young adults and children spontaneously gathered, believing their innocence would enable success where their elders had failed. <b>Few,</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> at all, journeyed to the Eastern Mediterranean. Though little reliable evidence survives for these events, they provide an indication of how hearts and minds could be engaged for the cause.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of {{lungfish}} {{are similar}} to those of amphibians, with <b>few,</b> <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> internal septa. In the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the esophagus. The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|These geyser observations, {{along with}} the finding of {{escaping}} internal heat and very <b>few</b> (<b>if</b> <b>any)</b> impact craters in the south polar region, show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus is trapped in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its interior, possibly driving the geological activity.|$|E

Additionally, elaborate ceramics are {{found only in}} garbage and burial contexts, not around hearths (Roosevelt 1991: 339-340). This could suggest that women primarily made and used domestic plainware, while men primarily controlled ceremonial fineware (Roosevelt 1991: 407). Nonetheless, the true relationship between ceramic distribution and social rank is still unclear {{and needs to be}} further investigated (Roosevelt 1991: 396).|$|R

5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales.

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{announcement}} proclaiming the ACC's expansion to 12teams, several cities and sports organizations were preparing bids {{to host the}} ACC Football Championship Game. The prospect {{of tens of thousands}} of visitors could provide a multimillion-dollar economic boost for a host city and region while requiring <b>few,</b> <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> additional facilities. One early contender was the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Even before Virginia Tech, Miami, and Boston College were chosen as the ACC's picks to expand, Carolinas Stadium Corporation, the owner and operator of Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium (as it was called then) lobbied heavily for Charlotte's selection. Other early options included Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{their native}} habitat, elk and other deer species, {{especially}} white tails, {{were introduced in}} areas that previously had <b>few</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> large native ungulates. Brought to these countries for hunting and ranching for meat, hides and antler velvet, they have proven highly adaptable and have often had an adverse impact on local ecosystems. Elk and red deer were introduced to Argentina in the early 20th century. There they are now considered an invasive species, encroaching on Argentinian ecosystems where they compete for food with the indigenous Chilean huemul and other herbivores. This negative impact on native animal species has led the IUCN to identify the elk {{as one of the}} world's 100 worst invaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the National Football League in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often saddled with financial difficulties, poor player talent and attendance rates. As the league expanded through the years, players were provided with no formal representation and received <b>few,</b> <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> benefits. In 1943, Roy Zimmerman's refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the Washington Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles. With {{the formation of the}} competing All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946, NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for five years from NFL-associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC.|$|E

5|$|All in all, Auerbach coached nine {{championship}} teams {{directly and}} mentored 4 players—Russell, Sharman, Heinsohn and K.C. Jones—who {{would go on}} to win an additional 7 NBA championships as coaches (two each for Russell, Heinsohn and Jones, all with the Celtics, and one for Sharman with the Lakers). Ten players who played for Auerbach have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame—Macauley, Ramsey, Cousy, Sharman, Heinsohn, Russell, K. C. Jones, Havlicek, Sam Jones and Bailey Howell. Although Don Nelson played for Auerbach only during his last year as coach, his influence was profound: Nelson would later join Auerbach as one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. Sharman and Heinsohn would become two of only four people to be inducted into the Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. <b>Few,</b> <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> coaches can match Auerbach's record of wins and successful mentorship of his players.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Soviets {{unveiled}} the T-26 mod. 1933. The Model 1933, {{with a new}} single cylindrical turret carrying one 45mm cannon L46 (length in calibers, which meant quite high initial velocity, over 700–800m/s depending on ammunition) and one 7.62 mm machine gun, became the most common T-26 variant. The 45mm 20K tank gun {{was based on the}} Soviet 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 (19-K) {{and it was one of}} the most powerful anti-tank guns of its time. Actually, <b>few,</b> <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> western tanks existed with similar guns. The T-26 could carry up to three secondary DT 7.62mm machine guns in coaxial, rear, and anti-aircraft mounts. This increased firepower was intended to aid crews in defeating dedicated anti-tank teams, as the original machine gun armament had been found insufficient. The turret rear ball mounting for the additional DT tank machine gun was installed on the T-26 tanks from the end of 1935 until 1939.|$|E

His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs.
