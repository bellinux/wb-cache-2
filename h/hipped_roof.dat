5|$|In the Tokyo Woman's Christian College, {{commenced}} in 1924, Raymond's architecture {{can be seen}} {{to still}} be heavily influenced by Wright. Its low, <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> and overhanging eaves are reminiscent of Wright's Prairie Houses. This early work also demonstrates his interest in Czech Cubism and the work of Auguste Perret.|$|E
5|$|The Methodist Chapel {{was built}} in 1815/16 after {{religious}} services had been established at Fairseat Farm, and the chapel was rebuilt in the late 19th century with limestone walls with stone dressings and a slate <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> with brick eaves stacks and crestings.|$|E
5|$|The pool {{house was}} built in 1968 and is brick with wood-framed {{casement}} windows. It is a divided brick building with locker rooms on the larger west section and a refreshment area on the smaller east section. The west section has a flat roof, and the east section has a shallow <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> with a broad overhang. The building does {{not contribute to the}} former historic estate.|$|E
50|$|A square <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> {{is shaped}} like a pyramid. <b>Hip</b> <b>roofs</b> on houses could have two {{triangular}} sides and two trapezoidal ones. A <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> on a rectangular plan has four faces. They are almost always at the same pitch or slope, which makes them symmetrical about the centerlines. <b>Hip</b> <b>roofs</b> often have a consistent level fascia, meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around. <b>Hip</b> <b>roofs</b> often have dormer slanted sides.|$|R
40|$|Three <b>hip</b> <b>roofed</b> {{building}} {{models of}} 15 °, 20 °, and 30 ° roof pitch, respectively, are {{tested in a}} wind tunnel to investigate wind pressure distributions over <b>hip</b> <b>roofs</b> {{and the effect of}} roof pitch on roof pressures. The pressures measured on the <b>hip</b> <b>roofs</b> are then compared with those on gable roofs of otherwise similar geometry to evaluate the effect of roof shape on roof pressures. Finally, the measured roof pressures of commonly-used probability of occurrence are compared with Meecham's work in terms of local mean and peak pressures. The results show that roof pitch does affect both the magnitude and distribution of <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> pressures. The 30 ° <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> experiences the highest peak suction at roof corner among the three tested <b>hip</b> <b>roofs.</b> The worst peak suctions are much smaller on the <b>hip</b> <b>roofs</b> than on the gable roofs for 15 ° and 20 ° roof pitches. However, the worst peak suctions on the <b>hip</b> and gable <b>roofs</b> are almost the same for 30 ° roof pitch. It is also seen that the magnitudes and distributions of local mean and peak pressures on the low pitched <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> tested here are compatible with the results from Meecham's work on a <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> of similar geometry.

5|$|Robert Mann's {{original}} 1730s {{house was}} a two-storey brick building seven bays wide with a break front. This was extended for the fifth Earl Cornwallis in 1825 by Thomas and William Cubitt. The Cubitts' alterations included adding a third storey to the original house and building two-storey wings four bays wide on each side. The {{house was a}}lso refinished with stucco render. Its <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> is covered with slates.|$|E
5|$|The former St John the Evangelist's Church {{was listed}} at Grade II on 20 August 1971. It is a Greek Revival-style stucco-clad {{building}} {{of stone and}} brick with a partly <b>hipped</b> <b>roof.</b> The three-bay façade has four Tuscan pilasters beneath a substantial entablature and pediment. The frieze between them has metopes and triglyphs. Work by L.A. Mackintosh in 1957 altered the exterior; the architect added his personal monogram and an eagle emblem (representing John the Evangelist) above {{the left and right}} entrances respectively.|$|E
5|$|The house {{known as}} the Jesse Ashbridge house {{was built on the}} family's land {{beginning}} in 1854. The house was designed for Sarah's grandson and Jonathan's son, Jesse Ashbridge, by prominent local architect, Joseph Sheard, who many years later would later serve as Mayor of Toronto. The cottage was designed in the Regency style, built with red brick laid in a Flemish bond, with a <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> and treillage veranda. Jesse married in 1864 and died in 1874.|$|E
50|$|The carpenter/lampist shop is {{a single}} story brick <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> {{building}} measuring 50 feet by 20 feet. It has arched door and window openings, and an enclosed <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> porch across the front.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hip</b> <b>roof</b> dormer: Also {{called a}} hipped dormer, {{it has a}} roof {{composed}} of three sloping planes that rise from {{each side of the}} dormer frame and converge at the ridge—analogous to the <b>hip</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|R
25|$|The narrow axis of {{the plan}} faces {{the street to the}} east, and the main {{entrance}} lies midway along the long side of the plan. The use of <b>hip</b> <b>roofs</b> includes a very large cantilevered <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> over the living room terrace. The pitch of the main <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> is shallow enough to give the passer-by {{on the sidewalk in front}} of the house the impression that it is a flat roof.|$|R
5|$|The {{limestone}} {{building has}} a slate <b>hipped</b> <b>roof.</b> It is rectangular with a projecting doric portico entrance and an extension to the rear. The interior {{is laid out}} in a U shape, with the larger Ball Room and Tea Room along either side with the octagonal Card Room at the end. The rooms have Whitefriars crystal chandeliers and are decorated with pictures by Thomas Gainsborough, Allan Ramsay (artist), Edwin Long and William Hoare.|$|E
5|$|The smokehouse is {{a square}} two-story {{building}} with a <b>hipped</b> <b>roof,</b> and is believed to date to the early 19th century. East of the smokehouse, a 1-story {{building with a}} three bay facade and a gabled roof {{was used as a}} post office in the late 19th century, and may have served as a schoolhouse originally. The manager's farmhouse stands 2 stories high and is L-shaped with a porch. The springhouse is also 2 stories.|$|E
5|$|Mulberry House is a late Georgian {{building}}, {{dated to}} 1818. It served as Bentworth's rectory {{and became a}} Grade II listed building on 31 July 1963. The house has stucco walls, with painted brickwork and a slate roof. It is a square two-storey building, with a symmetrical front consisting of three windows, a doric columned porch, half-glazed doors and a low-pitched <b>hipped</b> <b>roof,</b> with a raised lead flat in the centre. The current rectory is a smaller, modern house {{on the other side}} of the main road through the village, opposite Mulberry House.|$|E

5|$|The 1857 {{house is}} in Regency {{architectural}} style. It was {{oriented so that}} its long side, facing north-east, was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue. Rectangular in floor plan, the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays, with the central bay pedimented, which gave the house a symmetrical look. An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker, held by the Canterbury Museum, shows a verandah on the north-west {{side of the building}} only. This verandah was later extended to cover the front as well, and it mirrors the pedimented central bay. A <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> was hidden behind a balustrade.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom is a {{historic}} meeting hall at 47 Mulberry Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It is a single-story red brick building, with a low-pitch <b>hipped</b> <b>roof.</b> Basically rectangular, an enclosed entry pavilion projects from the main block. The building was designed by William R. Walker & Son and built in 1886. Originally used as a polling place and meeting hall, it was later used as a school and by veterans organizations before being converted into a single family residence during its National Register of Historic Places nomination. It was listed on the historic register in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The stables {{were built}} in 1820, during {{the early part of}} the Admiral's {{ownership}} of the estate, based on a design by John Smith; the buildings are sited to the rear of the mansion house. Built in a horseshoe-shape, neo-classical design, the two-storey building was constructed in pinned rubble with granite dressings; grey granite was used for the parapet and quoins. The main buildings were originally harled. A corrugated asbestos <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> was at some point substituted for the original slate roof. It features a columned rotunda above a timber clock tower, which has a finial and domed copper roof. The pedimented centrepiece of the symmetrical front elevation is a segmental arch and has three panels set back between columns. Each side is bordered by wings of three bays with single-bay pavilions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> is self-bracing, {{requiring}} less {{diagonal bracing}} than a gable <b>roof.</b> <b>Hip</b> <b>roofs</b> are thus much {{better suited for}} hurricane regions than gable <b>roofs.</b> <b>Hip</b> <b>roofs</b> have no large, flat, or slab-sided ends to catch wind and are inherently much more stable than gable roofs. However, for a hurricane region, the roof also has to be steep-sloped; at least 35 degrees from horizontal or steeper in slope is preferred. When wind flows over a shallow sloped <b>hip</b> <b>roof,</b> the roof can behave like an airplane wing. Lift is then created on the leeward side. The flatter the roof, the more likely this will happen. A steeper pitched <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> tends to cause the wind to stall as it goes over the roof, breaking up the effect. If the roof slopes are less than 35 degrees from horizontal, the roof {{will be subject to}} uplift. Greater than 35 degrees, and not only does wind blowing over it encounter a stalling effect, but the roof is actually held down on the wall plate by the wind pressure.|$|R
50|$|Henry Peters House is a {{historic}} home located at Garrett, DeKalb County, Indiana. It was built about 1910, and is a two-story, Colonial Revival-style frame dwelling.

5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. The veranda has large 6-over-9 sash windows that extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set it apart from the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched <b>hipped</b> <b>roof.</b> The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out {{and has two}} porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette windows {{on the sides of}} the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, {{as is often the case}} in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible <b>hipped</b> <b>roof.</b> From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E
5000|$|In modern {{domestic}} architecture, <b>hip</b> <b>roofs</b> {{are commonly}} seen in bungalows and cottages, {{and have been}} integral to styles such as the American Foursquare. However, the <b>hip</b> <b>roof</b> {{has been used in}} many different styles of architecture and in a wide array of structures.|$|R

5|$|The West Wycombe {{estate was}} {{acquired}} by Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet, and his brother Samuel in 1698. Dashwood demolished the existing manor house and built a modern mansion on higher ground nearby. This mansion forms {{the core of the}} present house. Images of the house on early estate plans show a red-brick house with stone dressings and a <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> in the contemporary Queen Anne style. In 1724, Dashwood bequeathed this square conventional house to his 16-year-old son, the 2nd Baronet, also Francis, who later inherited the title Baron le Despencer through his mother and is perhaps best known for establishing the Hellfire Club close to the mansion, in the West Wycombe Caves. Between 1726 and 1741, Dashwood embarked on a series of Grand Tours: the ideas and manners he learned during this period influenced him throughout his life and were pivotal in the rebuilding of his father's simple house, transforming it into the classical edifice that exists today.|$|E
5|$|Woodlea is {{constructed}} of buff-colored pressed Italian brick with pale limestone trim. It is three stories tall, seven bays wide, {{and more than}} fourteen bays deep. The south and west facades are both symmetrical, although the house has an asymmetrical overall plan. The house has pedimented pavilions and entrance porticos on the west, south, and east; window trim consisting of stone surrounds, pediments, lintels, and sills; classical balusters and quoins. The house's third story is separated visually by a stone string course and is topped with a modillioned cornice. From a shallow <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> rise brick chimneys that are trimmed and capped with stone. The pavilion pediments have decorative urn-shaped elements. The house's windows are primarily rectangular, double hung, one-over-one panel style, except for a large triple Palladian window, which has stained glass and is situated midway up the house's main staircase, illuminating its lower steps. The house has distinctive quoins, pediments, and classical balustrades of pale gray limestone.|$|E
5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered <b>hipped</b> <b>roof</b> has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E
5000|$|A {{possible}} {{disadvantage of}} a <b>hip</b> <b>roof,</b> {{compared with a}} gable roof on the same plan, {{is that there is}} less room inside the roof space; access is more difficult for maintenance; <b>hip</b> <b>roofs</b> are harder to ventilate; and there is not a gable with a window for natural light.|$|R
