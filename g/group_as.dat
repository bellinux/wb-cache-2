5|$|Triceratops is {{the best}} known genus of the Ceratopsidae, a family of large North American horned dinosaurs. The exact {{location}} of Triceratops among the ceratopsians has been debated over the years. Confusion stemmed mainly from the combination of short, solid frills (similar to that of Centrosaurinae), and the long brow horns (more akin to Ceratopsinae, also known as Chasmosaurinae). In the first overview of horned dinosaurs, R. S. Lull hypothesized two lineages, one of Monoclonius and Centrosaurus leading to Triceratops, the other with Ceratops and Torosaurus, making Triceratops a centrosaurine as the group is understood today. Later revisions supported this view, formally describing the first, short-frilled <b>group</b> <b>as</b> Centrosaurinae (including Triceratops), and the second, long-frilled <b>group</b> <b>as</b> Chasmosaurinae.|$|E

50|$|According to Susan Fiske, {{there are}} two {{underlying}} characteristics of stigmatized groups around the world: the ideas that status predicts perceived competence and that cooperation predicts perceived warmth. Two combinations of competence and warmth produce ambivalent prejudices. The combined perception of <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> warm but incompetent leads to pitied <b>groups,</b> such <b>as</b> traditional women or older people. The combined perception of <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> competent but cold leads to envied <b>groups,</b> such <b>as</b> nontraditional women or minority entrepreneurs. Fiske uses this conception of prejudice to explain ambivalent sexism, heterosexism, racism, anti-immigrant biases, ageism, and classism.|$|R
