I want to describe you my scares during the study, how I have been fighting with my own and I hope this fight ended as a victory. In the diploma thesis, you can find how stressed could be to study that school and how is not casily to came out from this kind of stress. Maybe at the beginning it can sound as a critic of DAMU, but it´s just a feeling. DAMU is school which will take you something but after all, it will {{make it up to}} you and finally I´m happy, I was going throught this school, thanks to this school, I´m prepared to be an actor. It´s the work about one young girl, which DAMU helps to survive at the movie and theatre...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} and thermal behavior of cadmium di-iso-butyldithiocarbamate (<b>I)</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studied</b> by solid-state 13 C and 15 N CP/MAS NMR and simultaneous thermal analysis (STA). The cadmium complex forms two crystalline polymorphs, α and β. The structure {{of each of}} the polymorphs contains two structurally nonequivalent binuclear [Cd 2 {S 2 CN(iso-C 4 H 9) 2 } 4] molecules. The STA data have shown the possibility of the α-I → β-I phase transition. Studying the thermal behavior of the complex has demonstrated that the end product of thermodestruction is a fine yellow-orange powder of CdS. The sorption properties of <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studied</b> with respect to gold(III) chloride solutions in 2 M HCl.
