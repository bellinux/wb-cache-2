5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and <b>indium</b> <b>phosphide,</b> are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film solar cell. Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E
5|$|Indium has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection. Indium tin oxide and <b>indium</b> <b>phosphide</b> harm the pulmonary and immune systems, predominantly through ionic indium, though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of indium introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. Indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; {{they tend to be}} stored temporarily in the muscles, skin, and bones before being excreted, and the biological half-life of indium is about two weeks in humans.|$|E
25|$|A method {{studied by}} Thomas Nann {{and his team}} at the University of East Anglia {{consists}} of a gold electrode covered in layers of <b>indium</b> <b>phosphide</b> (InP) nanoparticles. They introduced an iron-sulfur complex into the layered arrangement, which when submerged in water and irradiated with light under a small electric current, produced hydrogen with an efficiency of 60%.|$|E

25|$|Tandem {{solar cells}} based on monolithic, series connected, gallium <b>indium</b> <b>phosphide</b> (GaInP), gallium {{arsenide}} (GaAs), and germanium (Ge) p–n junctions, are increasing sales, despite cost pressures. Between December 2006 and December 2007, {{the cost of}} 4N gallium metal rose from about $350 per kg to $680 per kg. Additionally, germanium metal prices have risen substantially to $1000–1200 per kg this year. Those materials include gallium (4N, 6N and 7N Ga), arsenic (4N, 6N and 7N) and germanium, pyrolitic boron nitride (pBN) crucibles for growing crystals, and boron oxide, these products are critical to the entire substrate manufacturing industry.|$|E
25|$|Many astronomers {{request that}} nearby {{communities}} use low pressure sodium lights or amber Aluminium gallium <b>indium</b> <b>phosphide</b> LED {{as much as}} possible, because the principal wavelength emitted is comparably easy to work around or in rare cases filter out. The low cost of operating sodium lights is another feature. In 1980, for example, San Jose, California, replaced all street lamps with low pressure sodium lamps, whose light is easier for nearby Lick Observatory to filter out. Similar programs are now in place in Arizona and Hawaii. Such yellow light sources also have significantly less visual skyglow impact, so reduce visual sky brightness and improve star visibility for everyone.|$|E

50|$|Reported in the January 5 {{issue of}} the journal Applied Physics Letters in 2004, Milton Feng and Nick Holonyak, the {{inventor}} of the first practical light-emitting diode (LED) and the first semiconductor laser to operate in the visible spectrum, made the world's first light-emitting transistor. This hybrid device, fabricated by Feng's graduate student Walid Hafez, had one electrical input and two outputs (electrical output and optical output) and operated at a frequency of 1 MHz.

50|$|Triple {{junction}} cells {{consisting of}} <b>indium</b> gallium <b>phosphide</b> (InGaP), gallium arsenide (GaAs) or indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and germanium (Ge) can be fabricated on germanium wafers.

500|$|In 1924, indium {{was found}} to have a valued {{property}} of stabilizing non-ferrous metals, and that became the first significant use for the element. The first large-scale application for indium was coating bearings in high-performance aircraft engines during World War II, to protect against damage and corrosion; this is no longer a major use of the element. [...] New uses were found in fusible alloys, solders, and electronics. In the 1950s, tiny beads of indium were used for the emitters and collectors of PNP alloy-junction transistors. In the middle and late 1980s, the development of <b>indium</b> <b>phosphide</b> semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid-crystal displays (LCD) aroused much interest. By 1992, the thin-film application had become the largest end use.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} between the photon-emitting semiconductor laser and a conventional phonon-emitting (non-light-emitting) semiconductor junction diode lies {{in the type of}} semiconductor used, one whose physical and atomic structure confers the possibility for photon emission. These photon-emitting semiconductors are the so-called [...] "direct bandgap" [...] semiconductors. The properties of silicon and germanium, which are single-element semiconductors, have bandgaps that do not align in the way needed to allow photon emission and are not considered [...] "direct." [...] Other materials, the so-called compound semiconductors, have virtually identical crystalline structures as silicon or germanium but use alternating arrangements of two different atomic species in a checkerboard-like pattern to break the symmetry. The transition between the materials in the alternating pattern creates the critical [...] "direct bandgap" [...] property. Gallium arsenide, <b>indium</b> <b>phosphide,</b> gallium antimonide, and gallium nitride are all examples of compound semiconductor materials {{that can be used to}} create junction diodes that emit light.|$|E

Indium gallium arsenide (In0.53Ga0.47As) is lattice matched to <b>Indium</b> <b>Phosphide</b> with a band gap of 0.74eV. A quaternary alloy of Indium gallium arsenide phosphide can be lattice matched for any band gap in between the two.|$|E
50|$|Described in the November 15 {{issue of}} the journal Applied Physics Letters in 2004, Milton Feng, Nick Holonyak, {{postdoctoral}} research associate Gabriel Walter, and graduate research assistant Richard Chan demonstrated operation of the first heterojunction bipolar transistor laser by incorporating a quantum well in the active region of a light-emitting transistor. As with a light-emitting transistor, the transistor laser was made of <b>indium</b> gallium <b>phosphide,</b> <b>indium</b> gallium arsenide, and gallium arsenide, but emitted a coherent beam by stimulated emission, which differed from their previous device that only emitted incoherent photons. Despite their success, the device was not useful for practical purposes since it only operated at low temperatures - about minus 75 Celsius degrees.|$|R

40|$|Indium gallium {{arsenide}} (InGaAs) planar Gunn diodes with on chip matching circuits were fabricated on a semi-insulating <b>Indium</b> <b>phosphides</b> (InP) substrate. Radial and diamond stub resonators {{were used as}} circuit elements to suppress the fundamental frequency and allow the second harmonic frequency to be extracted from the planar Gunn diode. The extraction of the second harmonic will enable the planar Gunn diode to operate at millimetre wave and terahertz frequencies. InGaAs planar Gunn diodes were fabricated with an active channel length (anode to cathode separation) of 4 µm and a width of 120 µm. The experimental results gave a second harmonics signal at 118 GHz with an RF output power of - 20 dBm for the radial stub resonator, and 121 GHz with an RF output power of - 14. 1 dBm for the diamond stub resonator. This is the highest second harmonic power recorded for a planar Gunn diode.
