50|$|Before 2013, innerexile {{self-healing}} protective {{cases were}} made using the <b>in-mold</b> <b>decoration,</b> IMD process. The {{application of this}} technology was costly since it necessitated {{the use of a}} membrane that was attached to a film. The film was placed on the phoneâ€™s screen to protect the screen. Therefore, buying protective cases was expensive at that time.|$|E

Dynamic mechanical analysis experiments, uniaxial tension tests at several high temperatures and different stretching velocity {{were carried out}} to analysis and explain the phenomenon of yielding, strain softening and strain hardening. Results showed that the glass transition temperature range of PMMA-IRK- 304 films was suitable for thermoforming of <b>in-mold</b> <b>decoration.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|This article {{details the}} {{behavior}} of polycarbonate films utilized in the resin infusion between double flexible tooling (RIDFT) process as means to achieve <b>in-mold</b> <b>decoration</b> (IMD) of composites. This work evaluated forming capability with respect to surface quality of the composite assembly. Improved drawability was achieved with increasing temperature. However, this yielded in print-through of the fibers through the film. Five process parameters (temperature, mold type, time, fiber reinforcements, and vacuum pull), were optimized through sequential experimentation using analysis of variance (ANOVA) in terms of print-through, as the response variable. Statistical validation indicated minimal print-through at a forming temperature of 147 degrees C. However, at this temperature formability of the film was limited to subtle contours. At 160 degrees C, the forming capability of the composite assembly was maximized, yet surface finishes exhibited high print-through. This article describes achievements, difficulties, and future work in the utilization of polycarbonate films for the RIDFT process. close 6...|$|E
