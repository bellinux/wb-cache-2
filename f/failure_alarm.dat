40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the design of an Integrated Health Monitoring and Fast on-Line Actuator Reconfiguration Enhancement (IHM-FLARE) system whose role is to combine the failure parameter estimates from the two systems while assuring robustness to false <b>failure</b> <b>alarms,</b> missed detections, and failure detection delays.

The integration of the failure parameter estimates generated by both systems is carried out, and the worst-case performance bound is calculated for the case when the Health Monitoring system generates false failure information (i. e. either missed detections or false alarms) for all time. Properties of the proposed system are evaluated through simulations of a high-performance aircraft under multiple simultaneous flight-critical failures. I...|$|R

40|$|Predicting {{the time}} of failure is a topic of major concern {{in the field of}} {{geological}} risk management. Several approaches, based on the analysis of displacement monitoring data, have been proposed in recent years to deal with the issue. Among these, the inverse velocity method surely demonstrated its effectiveness in anticipating {{the time of}} collapse of rock slopes displaying accelerating trends of deformation rate. However, inferring suitable linear trend lines and deducing reliable failure predictions from inverse velocity plots are processes that may be hampered by the noise present in the measurements; data smoothing is therefore a very important phase of inverse velocity analyses. In this study, different filters are tested on velocity time series from four case studies of geomechanical failure in order to improve, in retrospect, the reliability of failure predictions: Specifically, three major landslides and the collapse of an historical city wall in Italy have been examined. The effects of noise on the interpretation of inverse velocity graphs are also assessed. General guidelines to conveniently perform data smoothing, in relation to the specific characteristics of the acceleration phase, are deduced. Finally, with the aim of improving the practical use of the method and supporting the definition of emergency response plans, some standard procedures to automatically setup <b>failure</b> <b>alarm</b> levels are proposed. The thresholds which separate the alarm levels would be established without needing a long period of neither reference historical data nor calibration on past failure events...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{interest}} has been {{show in the}} development and application of real time On-The-Fly (OTF) kinematic GPS. A major error source and limitation of such a positioning technique is that caused by cycle slips. When these occur, the integer ambiguities must be resolved for, which can take hundreds of epochs to complete depending on satellite availability and geometry. This research has focused on investigating the applications of real time OTF GPS, as well as its limitations and precision, which has been shown in the thesis to be precise to a few millimetres. The limitations of such a system at present include the use of UHF telemetry links, which at best have a line of sight range of - 10 km. The research has shown that alternatives are required, and the use of a relay station can prove invaluable. Cycle slips are another major limiting factor when using OTF GPS, as once a cycle slip occurs, it can either be corrected for or the integer ambiguities resolved for. The second option can take hundreds of seconds, depending on the algorithms used and the satellite number and geometry. This research has partly focused on the development of software which will instantaneously detect and correct for cycle slips in high rate GPS data. The applications of real time OTF GPS are numerous. Research has been carried out to investigate its use to monitor and control construction plant as well as monitoring the movement of large structures. As OTF positioning is precise to a few millimetres, it is ideal for the control of construction plant, and has been compared to laser levelling and precise digital levelling. Such a GPS system gives the user a 3 -dimensional position for the bulldozer blade, for example. Such information can prove invaluable for quality control as well as developing an automated system, which would be controlled by real time OTF GPS. In addition, real time OTF GPS has been shown in the research to provide instantaneous positioning of large structures in the form of bridges. Such information could provide future systems which would monitor the structure for dangerous movements, resulting in a <b>failure</b> <b>alarm.</b> Carrier phase kinematic GPS has previously been shown to work over baseline lengths of < 20 km. The use of Multiple Reference Stations (MRS) has been shown in this research to enable OTF GPS to be applied over longer baseline lengths, with a precision in the order of 12 cm over 132 km...|$|E

5000|$|In many {{municipalities}} {{across the}} United States, {{policies have been}} adopted to fine home and business owners for multiple false alarm activations from their security system. If multiple false alarms from the same property persist, that property could even be added to a [...] "no response" [...] list, which bars police dispatch to the property except {{in the event of}} verified emergency. Approximately 1% of police alarm calls actually involve a crime. Nuisance alarms occur when an unintended event evokes an alarm status by an otherwise properly working alarm system. A false alarm also occurs when there is an alarm system malfunction that results in an alarm state. In all three circumstances, the source of the problem should be immediately found and fixed, so that responders will not lose confidence in the alarm reports. It is easier to know when there are false alarms, because the system is designed to react to that condition. <b>Failure</b> <b>alarms</b> are more troublesome because they usually require periodic testing to make sure the sensors are working and that the correct signals are getting through to the monitor. Some systems are designed to detect problems internally, such as low or dead batteries, loose connections, phone circuit trouble, etc. While earlier nuisance alarms could be set off by small disturbances, like insects or pets, newer model alarms have technology to measure the size/weight of the object causing the disturbance, and thus are able to decide how serious the threat is, which is especially useful in burglar alarms.|$|R

40|$|Sensor {{integrity}} plays {{a crucial}} role in automatic control and system monitoring, both in achieving performance and guaranteeing safety. Conventional approaches in sensor failure detection demand precise process models and abundant central computing power. This thesis describes the development and the evaluation of a novel local sensor validation scheme which is independent of the underlying process and is applicable {{to a wide variety of}} sensors. A signal-based in-situ sensor validation scheme is proposed. Typical sensor failures are classified according to their signal patterns. To avoid the ambiguity between genuine failures and legitimate measurand variations, a pair of decomposition filters are designed to partition the sensor output; and attention is focused on characteristics beyond the measurement signal bandwidth, which is the only essential process-related variable required. In addition, the application of decimating filters is explored, both as a relief to the analog anti-aliasing filter and as an enhancement in signal discretization. An expression is derived relating the oversampling rate and the attainable improvement in signal resolution. Based on a period of failure-free observation, a whitening filter is identified by modelling the decomposed sensor signal as a stochastic time-series. Significant progress is achieved by a deliberate injection of bandlimited random noise to ensure signal stationarity and to avoid inadmissible leakage of measurement signal into the innovation sequence. The adopted failure detection strategy is primarily innovation-based. Pertinent sensor signal information is extracted recursively by a collection of efficient and robust signal processing algorithms. Its validity is continuously monitored by statistical tests on which a series of precursory <b>failure</b> <b>alarms</b> are formulated. Any aberration detected is then diagnosed under the supervision of a simple rule-based system. The practicality, efficacy and flexibility of the proposed scheme are successfully demonstrated by a bench-top thermocouple experiment and extensive synthetic simulations. </p...|$|R
30|$|Computer {{failure is}} a {{challenge}} {{that has to be}} addressed when designing medical systems. Computer-related failure can be defined as any event that causes a computer-based medical device to function improperly or present harm to patients or users due to failures in any of the medical systems components including software, hardware, I/O, or battery. Most computer failures are software failures (Alemzadeh et al. 2013). To address software failure in our system, we used watchdog timer mechanism to monitor if the system hangs or does not respond for a specific period of time because of any software failure. For example, if the system hangs for more than one minute, the watchdog timer will restart the system. Moreover, if there is a hardware <b>failure,</b> an <b>alarm</b> message will be displayed to notify the user.|$|R

We firstly modify the Von Hagen-Ho index and apply it to a large set of countries, excluding countries with a repressed financial system. The crises identified by our MMPI are more in line with the crises identified by Laeven and Valencia (2010), while the index also gives fewer ‘false alarms’. Then, we investigate the dynamic relationship between currency and banking crises in 94 developing and emerging countries using quarterly data from 1980 Q 1 to 2010 Q 4. The results show that in most cases currency crises tend to lead banking crises and vice versa which is robust for using different periods and different samples of countries. We investigate interdependence and spillover effects of financial turbulence across countries during the last decade. Our results suggest that financial turbulence has a significant interdependence effect across countries through the trade and distance channels, while a significant spillover effect through the capital flows channel is also identified.
