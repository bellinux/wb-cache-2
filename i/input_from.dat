5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory <b>input</b> <b>from</b> mossy fibers and inhibitory <b>input</b> <b>from</b> Golgi cells.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its <b>input</b> <b>from</b> the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives <b>input</b> <b>from</b> afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory <b>input</b> <b>from</b> the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E

50|$|Auditory <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> {{temporal}} cortical {{regions are}} the primary inputs to rat 36d, with visual inputs becoming more prominent closer to the postrhinal cortical border. Area 36d projects to 36v and then to 35, which forms the primary output region of perirhinal cortex. Inputs to area 35 more strongly reflect olfactory and gustatory <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> piriform and insular cortices, in addition to <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> entorhinal cortex and frontal regions.|$|R
5|$|Culturally {{inappropriate}} decision making: The Organisation is {{not designed}} to deal with cultural issues or complex social problems; the normal Indigenous decision-making processes and protocols such as consultation and <b>input</b> <b>from</b> family groupings are not structurally accommodated.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} fish and {{amphibians}} possess a lateral line system that senses pressure waves in water. One of the brain areas that receives primary <b>input</b> <b>from</b> the lateral line organ, the medial octavolateral nucleus, has a cerebellum-like structure, with granule cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the <b>input</b> <b>from</b> the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), the optic tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.|$|E

5|$|Recommendation #5: The current {{division}} of regulatory responsibilities for long-term repository performance between the NRC and the EPA is appropriate and should continue.

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of a revival in Gothic architecture is from Scotland. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design <b>input</b> <b>from</b> William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets.

50|$|LSO neurons {{are excited}} by <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> one ear and {{inhibited}} by <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> the other, {{and are therefore}} referred to as IE neurons. Excitatory inputs are received at the LSO from spherical bushy cells of the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus, which combine <b>inputs</b> coming <b>from</b> several auditory nerve fibers. Inhibitory inputs are received at the LSO from globular bushy cells of the contralateral cochlear nucleus.|$|R
50|$|Input to {{the medial}} {{habenula}} {{comes from a}} variety of regions and carries a number of different chemicals. Input regions include septal nuclei (the nucleus fimbrialis septi and the nucleus triangularis septi), dopaminergic <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> the interfascicular nucleus of the ventral tegmental area, noradrenergic <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> the locus ceruleus, and GABAergic <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> the diagonal band of Broca. The medial habenula sends outputs of glutamate, substance P and acetylcholine to the periaqueductal gray via the interpeduncular nucleus {{as well as to the}} pineal gland.|$|R
30|$|With {{reference}} to the markets for buying inputs, {{it is important to}} state that entrepreneurs offering services are not included. Hence, the results refer to 22 entrepreneurs dealing with manufacturing, processing and selling of products. However, it emerges {{that more than half of}} the sample acquires <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> the country of origin (54.6 %) and that few of the interviewees buy <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> other members of the ethnic group in Italy (13.6 %). Just less than one-third of the sample (31.8 %) acquires <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> different ethnic groups, especially from Italian suppliers.|$|R
5|$|The smash {{success of}} Docter's 2009 film Up {{encouraged}} those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film {{with a more}} sophisticated story. Inside Out is the first Pixar film without <b>input</b> <b>from</b> co-founder and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much <b>input</b> <b>from</b> chief creative officer John Lasseter, who was focused on restructuring Walt Disney Animation Studios in Los Angeles {{at the time of}} its production. Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making Inside Out, but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} amendment {{designed to}} postpone a vote attracted much acrimony. This postponement was {{to allow for}} <b>input</b> <b>from</b> then ongoing investigations: the Law Reform Commission, the High Court Zappone v.

5|$|After Wallis had {{finished}} the initial manuscript for The Road to Total Freedom, he provided representatives of Scientology leadership with a copy. Wallis negotiated with the Scientology leaders, and it was agreed upon that certain sections of the book would be edited.

Elementary School No. 33 is estimated to finish construction in August 2019.|$|E
5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time <b>input</b> <b>from</b> an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E

5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper log book, and requires less <b>input</b> <b>from</b> the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E
