500|$|Despite {{being the}} longest {{statement}} of the facts {{in any of the}} four appellate opinions generated by the case, Cardozo's was described by Posner as [...] "elliptical and slanted". It has also been deemed [...] "highly abstract". According to Professor Walter O. Weyrauch in his 1978 journal article, [...] "Cardozo's famous opinion reduced the complicated facts of the case to a bare minimum. Mrs. Palsgraf was transformed into a 'plaintiff' without age, family status, or occupation. The opinion omitted the nature of her injury, the amount of damages that she sought, {{and the size of the}} jury award." [...] For example, Cardozo describes Palsgraf (whom he does not name, nor mention her daughters) as standing on the LIRR's platform, rather than waiting for a train, thus downplaying her status as a customer entitled to a high degree of care by the railroad. The explosive package is described as small, though the witnesses had described it as large. The scales are described as being [...] "at the other end of the platform, many feet away" [...] from the explosion, but the record does not support this statement. This characterization may have been based on testimony by Lillian Palsgraf, who had gone to buy a paper from a newsstand [...] "at the other end of the platform", but who was yet close enough to see the package fall. Cardozo's characterization of distance would be challenged by the plaintiff in her motion for reargument, which would be denied with the rejoinder that however close she was to the explosion, she was not so close as to bring her within the zone of <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Five {{days after}} her husband Vernon Hunter's death, Valerie Hunter filed a {{wrongful}} death lawsuit against Sheryl Mann Stack, Andrew Joseph Stack's widow in federal District Court. The lawsuit alleges that Sheryl had a duty to [...] "avoid a <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk</b> of injury to others," [...] including her late husband and {{failed to do so}} by not warning others about her late husband. [...] The lawsuit also mentions that Stack was required by law to fly his plane at an altitude [...] above the highest obstacle. At a March 8, 2010, benefit event, Stack's widow, Sheryl, publicly offered condolences for the victims of the attack.|$|E
2500|$|The Court of Appeal {{delivered}} its {{judgment on}} 6 April 1977. Geoffrey Lane and Cumming-Bruce LJJ held {{that there was}} a <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk</b> of injury to the plaintiffs and their property from the cricket balls and the club could not prevent accidents from happening. [...] The club was guilty of negligence [...] "on each occasion when a ball comes over the fence and causes damage to the plaintiffs". [...] The repeated interference with their property was also held to be an actionable nuisance. [...] Following Sturges v. Bridgman, the fact that the Millers had [...] "come to the nuisance" [...] was no defence. [...] On that basis, the Millers were awarded damages. [...] Lord Denning MR dissented from the finding of negligence and nuisance, holding that [...] "the public interest should prevail over the private interest". [...] However, on the basis that the club had agreed to pay for any damage, Lord Denning was [...] "content that there should be an award of £400 to cover any past or future damage".|$|E

50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{must demonstrate}} that the defendant's action increased {{the risk that the}} particular harm suffered by the plaintiff would occur. If the action were repeated, the likelihood of the harm would correspondingly increase. This is also called <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E

50|$|Section 261 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts {{does not}} {{explicitly}} define {{the scope of}} what is considered impracticable, {{as it is a}} fairly subjective and fact-intensive test for the courts. Generally, courts do not consider events such as an increase in price or costs beyond a normal range to allow for discharge of duties on grounds of impracticability, as such events are normally <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risks</b> of fixed-price contracts.|$|R

50|$|In O'Byrne v Gloucester the plaintiff, a young girl, was {{standing}} next to an indoor heater when her cotton dress caught fire, burning her badly. The defendants were found guilty of negligence, in that they failed to avoid a grave and <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk</b> by taking the easily affordable precaution of affixing a warning to the dress.|$|E
50|$|A {{breach of}} the duty is only {{where there was a}} <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk</b> of harm. Here, there was no {{reasonable}} way that the theatre could foresee that Stuart would be the one to drive since he was accompanied by three individuals, two of them sober. The theatre was correct in assuming that Stuart would not be the one to drive. Nevertheless, Major confirmed that the theatre must monitor the patron's alcohol consumption based on the amount served and not solely on the patron's visible condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} of care {{is defined as the}} measures that a reasonable person (in the circumstances of the defendant) take {{to reduce the risk of}} harm. In other words, it is the response of a reasonable person to a <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk.</b> The {{standard of}} care naturally varies over time, and is effected by circumstantial factors. Thus, when a {{standard of care}} is established in one case, it will not automatically become a precedent for another - each case is judged on its own facts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{regulations}} {{apply to}} all businesses that have [...] "covered accounts". A [...] "covered account" [...] includes any account {{for which there is}} a <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk</b> of identity theft. For example, credit cards, monthly billed accounts like utility bills or cell phone bills, social security numbers, drivers license numbers, medical insurance accounts, and many others. This significantly expands the definition to include all companies, regardless of size, that maintain, or otherwise possess, consumer information for a business purpose. Because of the broad definitions in these regulations, few businesses will be able to escape these requirements.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} neo-classical {{economics}} places {{an emphasis on}} short-term gain over precaution, and in doing so, places {{the lives of a}} myriad of individual humans—and even the species itself—at <b>risk.</b> Given the <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risks,</b> if humanity wants to survive longer, we need to rethink our economic principles and priorities and the relationship between economics and law. I begin with a most brief overview of the various sources of risk to the human species and its life support system. Then I will move on to look at how neo-classical economics interacts with significant risk...|$|R
25|$|At {{the most}} basic level, the best defense against floods is to seek higher ground for high-value uses while {{balancing}} the <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risks</b> with the benefits of occupying flood hazard zones. Critical community-safety facilities, such as hospitals, emergency-operations centers, and police, fire, and rescue services, should be built in areas least at risk of flooding. Structures, such as bridges, that must unavoidably be in flood hazard areas should be designed to withstand flooding. Areas most at risk for flooding could be put to valuable uses that could be abandoned temporarily as people retreat to safer areas when a flood is imminent.|$|R

Calling the actions of O'Donnell and Reich [...] "vulgar" [...] and [...] "morally deficient," [...] the court stated:"We rely upon the CHP to protect and serve the public. It is antithetical to that expectation for the CHP to inflict harm upon us by making the ravaged remains of our loved ones the subject of Internet sensationalism...

50|$|Palmer v Tees Health Authority 1998 All ER 180; (1999) Lloyd’s Medical Reports 151 (CA) A {{psychiatric}} out-patient, who {{was known}} to be dangerous, murdered a four-year-old child. The claim was that the defendant had failed to diagnose that there was a real, substantial, and <b>foreseeable</b> <b>risk</b> of the patient committing serious sexual offences against children and that, as a result, it had failed to provide any adequate treatment for him {{to reduce the risk of}} him committing such offences and/or to prevent him from being released from the hospital while he was at risk of committing such offences. But the court struck out the claim on the grounds that there was no duty of care towards the child, as any child, at any time, was in the same danger. Furthermore, as the patient did not suffer from a treatable mental illness, there was no legal right to either treat or detain the person.|$|E
