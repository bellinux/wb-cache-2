The use of low cost micro sensors in ARTIS (Autonomous Rotorcraft Test bed for Intelligent Systems) and {{the high level of}} noise make intelligent data fusion a mandatory requirement for health monitoring. 13; In this paper model based magnetometer failure detection for ARTIS is implemented and investigated.

The health monitoring utilizes the model based redundancies present in the established flight path reconstruction model, which is based on two sequential Extended Kalman filter.

Such a view may be increasingly at odds with interpretative demands posed by recent accidents in otherwise very safe systems. Particularly the <b>drift</b> into <b>failure,</b> which represents a large category of residual risk in aerospace, is hard to model (and thereby understand and predict) with structuralist approaches. <b>Drifting</b> into <b>failure</b> is not so much about breakdowns or malfunctioning of components, but about an organization not adapting effectively to the complexity of its structure and environment. This requires aerospace to adopt a true systems approach, which sees sociotechnical complexity not as constituted of parts and their interactions, but as a web of dynamic, evolving relationships and transactions. This can lead to models that can make processes of drift come alive, and help point to more productive countermeasures...|$|R

These were systems that <b>drifted</b> into <b>failure.</b> While pursuing success in a dynamic, complex environment with limited resources and multiple goal conflicts, a succession of small, everyday decisions eventually produced breakdowns on a massive scale. We have trouble grasping the complexity and normality that gives rise to such large events. We hunt for broken parts, fixable properties, people we can hold accountable. Our analyses of complex system breakdowns remain depressingly linear, depressingly componential - imprisoned in the space of ideas once defined by Newton and Descartes.

We are able to build things - deep-sea oil rigs, jackscrews, collateralized debt obligations - whose properties we understand in isolation.

The (span/depth) ratio of these beams is determined by non-structural considerations and usually well into the ‘deep beam’ range prone to brittle behavior. This paper presents the results of tests of three coupling beam specimens in which the influence of three types of shear reinforcement were studied. All specimens were of the same dimensions and provided with different types of shear reinforcement. In order to investigate the contribution of various types of shear reinforcement, one specimen was provided with diagonal bars confined by spiral stirrups, and the second one provided with diagonal bars without stirrups, and the third one provided with the steel plate. All fixed vertically from one side and let the second side free to the top and the load was applied to the top portion of coupling beam.

40|$|The thesis covers {{data fusion}} for {{aircraft}} navigation systems in distributed sensor systems. Data fusion methodologies are {{developed for the}} design, development, analysis and simulation of multisensor aircraft navigation systems. The problems of sensor failure detection and isolation (FDI), distributed data fusion algorithms and inertial state integrity monitoring in inertial network systems are studied. Various existing integrated navigation systems and Kalman filter architectures are reviewed and a new generalised multisensor data fusion model is presented for the design and development of multisensor navigation systems. Normalised navigation algorithms are described for data fusion filter design of inertial network systems. A normalised measurement model of skewed redundant inertial measurement units (SRIMU) is presented and performance criteria are developed to evaluate optimal configurations of SRIMUs {{in terms of the}} measurement accuracy and FDI capability. Novel sensor error compensation filters are designed for the correction of SRIMU measurement errors. Generalised likelihood ratio test (GLRT) methods are improved to detect various failure modes, including short time and sequential moving-window GLRT algorithms. State-identical and state-associated fusion algorithms are developed for two forms of distributed sensor network systems. In particular, innovative inertial network sensing models and inertial network fusion algorithms are developed to provide estimates of inertial vector states and similar node states. Fusion filter-based integrity monitoring algorithms are also presented to detect network sensor failures and to examine the consistency of node state estimates in the inertial network system. The FDI and data fusion algorithms developed in this thesis are tested and their performance is evaluated using a multisensor software simulation system developed during this study programme. The moving-window GLRT algorithms for optimal SRIMU configurations are shown to perform well and are also able to detect jump and <b>drift</b> <b>failures</b> in an inertial network system. It is concluded that the inertial network fusion algorithms could be used in a low-cost inertial network system and are capable of correctly estimating the inertial vector states and the node states.

The most common method of inferential sensing uses mathematical models to infer a parameter value from correlated sensor values.

This research shows that regularization can be used in inferential sensing to produce consistent results.

An experimental study has been conducted into the effects of package related failures in plastic encapsulated semiconductors.

A number of accelerated life testing techniques including Highly Accelerated Stress Testing (HAST) were used to induced parameter <b>drift</b> and catastrophic <b>failures.</b> Examples of both insertion and surface mount package types were studied. Observations were made on the parameter <b>drift</b> and catastrophic <b>failure</b> mechanisms of plastic encapsulated Bipolar Junction Transistors in dual in line packages.

Package performance test chips were used to monitor the moisture resistance properties and thermal performance of Quad Flat Pack packages. Surface leakage path effects, corrosion onset and thermally induced stresses were monitored using this technique.

It is used for four types of sensor <b>failure</b> detection: bias, <b>drift,</b> complete <b>failure</b> and precision degradation. The application of sensor validation shows that single and multiple sensor faults can be detected and that the fault magnitude and fault type can be estimated by the reconstruction scheme.

The traditional approach is to employ equivalent static analysis methods, while current design practice is moving toward an increased emphasis on the nonlinear analysis method.

Three {{different types of}} calibration pulses are applied, whereby sets of these pulses are needed at the start and end of each data acquisition. Additionally, TerraSAR-X has been equipped with an additional calibration mode based on the so-called "PN Gating method". The PN Gating mode allows operating the T/R modules under most realistic conditions with the advantage that all modules can be characterised simultaneously. The individual characteristics are found by assigning special calibration pulse sequences with orthogonal codes to the T/R modules.

Inspired by laws of nature, a large variety of distributed node relocation algorithms have been designed to alleviate undesirable oscillations caused by local interactions and uncertainties among autonomous nodes as they reach their desired formations. Force-based distributed relocation algorithms governed by virtual push-pull forces among autonomous nodes are among such aforesaid algorithms. Adapting fuzzy logic model in exerting proper amount of forces to reduce node movement oscillation seems to be promising as its conforms well with uncertainties and interactions of autonomous nodes. However, parameters of fuzzy logic relocation model should be tuned so to enable nodes to exert proper amount of forces among their in-range neighbours. In this paper, by using particle swarm optimization, parameters of fuzzy relocation model are obtained based on the desired combinations of performance metrics within nodes' range in each movement iteration. The result shows that our model either outperforms or matches DSSA movement model. 7 page(s...|$|R
