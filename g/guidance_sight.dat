Since the angle of <b>sight</b> <b>guidance</b> law is to make the UAV flight path angle and angle of sight be proportional to the rate of change, flight path angle can be tracked by controlling the angle of sight. That taking the guidance law into use can reduce the sensitivity of UAV motion on the ship parameters change, thereby to obtain more stable trajectory.

There are many theoretical methods for solving this problem. But when applying these methods to an actual multiple AUVs system, communication constraints need to be considered because acoustic communication among multiple AUVs often is unreliable in actual ocean environment. This paper focuses on application and validation of a leader-follower approach on multi-AUVs formation maintenance with acoustic communication constraints. The communication interval between AUVs and packet loss rate are researched based on experiments. A leader-follower formation control algorithm based on a Line-Of- <b>Sight</b> <b>guidance</b> law is proposed.

40|$|The {{performance}} of guided flight missile systems is measured through the minimum miss-distance and its capability to overcome target maneuver in presence of different sources of disturbances and noises. To achieve this objective, mathematical model for different dynamical behavior phases of command {{to the line}} of sight (CLOS) system is introduced using system identification technique. However, these mathematical models cannot precisely represent a real physical system without uncertainties. To improve system performance, a multi-stages robust autopilot is designed (each stage applied with corresponding missile flight phase) and compared with single stage robust autopilot. By using the H∞ approach, both controllers are obtained to adequate the nonlinear dynamical behavior and overcome different kind of uncertainties of the intended Command Line of <b>Sight</b> <b>Guidance</b> System (CLOS).

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of robot tracking and navigation toward a moving goal. The goal’s maneu-vers are not a priori known to the robot. Thus, off-line strategies are not effective. To model the robot and the goal, we use geometric rules combined with kinematics equations expressed in a polar representation. The intent of the strategy {{is to keep the}} robot between a reference point, called the observer, and the goal. We prove under certain assumptions that the robot navigating using this strategy reaches the moving goal successfully. In the presence of obstacles, the method is combined with an obstacle avoidance algorithm. The robot then moves in two modes, the navigation mode and the obstacle avoidance mode. Simulation of various scenarios highlights the efficiency of the method and provides an instructive comparison between the paths obtained for different reference points.

An autopilot is designed using Sliding Mode Control Theory that {{can control the}} speed and heading of a full six degree of freedom, nonlinear model that allows speed and heading {{to be treated as}} separate systems. Once control of heading and speed is established, depth control is achieved by a third control law. Although they are developed separately, the three individual control laws act simultaneously to provide robust control of speed, heading, and depth of the nonlinear model of the vehicle. Line of <b>Sight</b> <b>Guidance</b> is used to convert the way points provided by the mission planner into commands for heading to which the autopilot responds. The performance of the autopilot is evaluated over a wide range of speeds to demonstrate its robustness.

The problem {{is viewed as a}} line of <b>sight</b> <b>guidance</b> problem in which unmanned aerial vehicles track the line of sight of a phantom.

Since the system is over-actuated, a control allocation optimization problem is formulated and solved by adding an additional objective term to the cost function that forces unmanned aerial vehicles to fly parallel to the phantom using a predictive control method. A closed-form solution is constructed for the unmanned aerial vehicles trajectory corresponding to the pre-specified phantom track. The proposed method is expanded through a scenario in which multiple unmanned aerial vehicles cooperatively generate a coherent phantom track toward a desired waypoint by engaging with the same number of radars.

40|$|AbstractBy restricting {{a vehicle}} to the linear region of operation, with a small {{sideslip}} angle, a vehiclecannot achieve its full potential. By entering the nonlinear region of operation tightercorners can be achieved and some accidents could be prevented. Research is currently beingconducted to introduce drifting into vehicle safety systems, which currently restrict thevehicle to the linear region of operation. Vehicle drifting {{has been shown to}} have unstableequilibria, while still maintaining controllability. In this thesis, equilibria with sideslip angles ranging from - 30 degrees to 30 are found fora nonlinear two-track model simulator. Analysis showed that simple mappings could bemade between the states and the inputs, and between the states themselves. All the linearisedsystems in these equilibria were found to be unstable, which coincides with currentresearch. In addition, this thesis presents an adaptive backstepping controller, which is used for convergeto an arbitrary sideslip angle, and when the drift is being initialised the controllermimics the behaviour of Power Over drifting technique. The adaptive part of the backsteppingcontroller is used as integral action that, by the use of adaptation, finds the stationarydeviation between the yaw rate and the desired yaw rate, which is added to the control law. A mapping between the desired sideslip angle and the desired yaw rate is used in a feedforward term such that the desired sideslip angle is achieved when the yaw rate converges. The controller has been tested with a modified Line Of <b>Sight</b> <b>guidance</b> system which providedthe controller with a desired sideslip angle.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the initial flight test {{evaluation of the}} Passive Intelligent Collision Avoidance Sensor (PICAS) developed at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). PICAS represents the latest iteration of a non-cooperative electro-optical (EO) airborne collision sensing instrument designed to explore technology appropriate for under- 25 kg Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). PICAS is a prototype, selectively-sampled, multi- camera array mated to a computing platform capable of simultaneously recording and processing images in real-time. A selective sampling approach tailored the sensor to the performance requirement by varying the angular resolution and field of view {{as a function of}} azimuth. PICAS was designed to detect a Cessna 172 -sized target at 10 km in the head- on direction. The sensor was flight-tested on a Bell 205 rotorcraft acting as a surrogate UAS and flying collision-course intercepts against a Harvard Mark IV intruder. An NRC developed Collision Intercept Display was utilized to provide beyond visual line of <b>sight</b> <b>guidance</b> for both aircraft to conduct the intercepts. Once the collision geometry was coordinated, the Bell 205 switched to automatic operation, controlling altitude, ground- speed and ground-track {{for the duration of the}} run. PICAS was operated in pure recording mode, with each camera recording synchronized and time-stamped images at 15 frames per second. The detection performance was evaluated by simulating the real-time processing algorithms against pre-collected imagery and associated aircraft data. Analysis results indicated that PICAS exceeded the minimum detection requirement throughout its field of view for an under- 25 kg UAS operating at an airspeed of 80 knots encountering typical (Cessna 172) intruders on co-altitude collision course geometries in Canadian Class G airspace.

40|$|An {{adaptive}} autopilot {{design for}} an uninhabited surface vehicle Andy SK Annamalai The work described herein concerns {{the development of}} an innovative approach to the design of autopilot for uninhabited surface vehicles. In order to fulfil the requirements of autonomous missions, uninhabited surface vehicles must be able to operate with a minimum of external intervention. Existing strategies are limited by their dependence on a fixed model of the vessel. Thus, any change in plant dynamics has a non-trivial, deleterious effect on performance. This thesis presents an approach based on an adaptive model predictive control that is capable of retaining full functionality {{even in the face of}} sudden changes in dynamics. In the first part of this work recent developments in the field of uninhabited surface vehicles and trends in marine control are discussed. Historical developments and different strategies for model predictive control as applicable to surface vehicles are also explored. This thesis also presents innovative work done to improve the hardware on existing Springer uninhabited surface vehicle to serve as an effective test and research platform. Advanced controllers such as a model predictive controller are reliant on the accuracy of the model to accomplish the missions successfully. Hence, different techniques to obtain the model of Springer are investigated. Data obtained from experiments at Roadford Reservoir, United Kingdom are utilised to derive a generalised model of Springer by employing an innovative hybrid modelling technique that incorporates the different forward speeds and variable payload on-board the vehicle. Waypoint line of <b>sight</b> <b>guidance</b> provides the reference trajectory essential to complete missions successfully. The performances of traditional autopilots such as proportional integral and derivative controllers when applied to Springer are analysed. Autopilots based on modern controllers such as linear quadratic Gaussian and its innovative variants are integrated with the navigation and guidance systems on-board Springer. The modified linear quadratic Gaussian is obtained by combining various state estimators based on the Interval Kalman filter and the weighted Interval Kalman filter. Change in system dynamics is a challenge faced by uninhabited surface vehicles that result in erroneous autopilot behaviour. To overcome this challenge different adaptive algorithms are analysed and an innovative, adaptive autopilot based on model predictive control is designed. The acronym ‘aMPC’ is coined to refer to adaptive model predictive control that is obtained by combining the advances made to weighted least squares during this research and is used in conjunction with model predictive control. Successful experimentation is undertaken to validate the performance and autonomous mission capabilities of the adaptive autopilot despite change in system dynamics.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{that has been a}} {{worldwide}} increase in the utilisation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for many diverse subsea applications. This has given rise to an increase in the research and development of these vehicles, with a particular focus on extending operational capability and longevity. Consequently, this activity has resulted in the design of many different types of AUVs that employ a variety of different propulsion and manoeuvring mechanisms. One particular area that has yielded promising results involves the vehicles designs that are biologically inspired or biomimetic. This class of AUV replicates the anatomical features of aquatic species in order to exploit some of the benefits associated with this type of swimming e. g. higher efficiency at low speeds, improved manoeuvrability. The study presented in this thesis considers the design and performance analysis of a unique biomimetic AUV design based on the physiology of an adult Atlantic salmon. This vehicle, called RoboSalmon, is equipped with a multiple jointed, fully actuated tail that is used to replicate the undulatory swimming gait of a real fish. The initial stage of this design process involves the development of a mathematical model to describe the fusion of the dynamics and electro-mechanics of this vehicle. This model provides the design specifications for a prototype vehicle, which has been used in water tank trials to collect data. Forward swimming and manoeuvring experiments, e. g. cruise in turning and turning circle swimming patterns, have been conducted for performance analysis and validation purposes. This part of the study has illustrated the relationship between the vehicle surge velocity, tail amplitude and tail beat frequency. It was found that the maximum surge velocity has been measured at 0. 143 ms- 1. Also, the vehicle has been shown to accomplish turning circle manoeuvres with turning radius just over the half of its body length. The final stage of this study involved the design of a heading control system, which changes the course of the vehicle by altering the tail centreline. This study allowed the course changing performance of the vehicle to be analysed. Furthermore, a line of <b>sight</b> <b>guidance</b> system has been used to navigate the vehicle through a multiple waypoint course in order to show autonomous operation within a simulated environment. Moreover, the vehicle has demonstrated satisfactory performance in course changing and tracking operations. It is concluded that the RoboSalmon biomimetic AUV exhibits higher propulsive efficiency and manoeuvrability than propeller based underwater vehicles at low speeds. Thus {{the results of this study}} show that mimicking biology can improve the propulsive and manoeuvring efficiencies of AUVs...|$|R
