5|$|After that, Lysacek changed <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> and his {{training}} habits. In the 2002–2003 season, he competed on the 2002–2003 ISU Junior Grand Prix circuit and won two silver medals. He was the 4th qualifier for the 2002–2003 Junior Grand Prix Final, where he placed 5th. For the 2003 U.S. Championships, his goal {{had been to}} place in the top ten. He achieved this with a 7th-place finish.|$|E
5|$|Having just {{completed}} the tracks for his fourth album in 1996, Walker was playing basketball with a friend, {{when he began}} to experience numbness, facial spasms, and double vision. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that he had multiple sclerosis (MS). Walker subsequently began changing <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> and treating the disease with a daily injection of Copaxone, sending his MS into an arrested state.|$|E
5|$|Lately, Cookie {{has also}} taught {{children}} {{the importance of}} eating a balanced diet. This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} devour. This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set a good example for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but he likes the act of eating in general. As long as his mouth is full, his heart is happy.|$|E

5|$|Lindow Man's {{last meal}} was {{preserved}} {{in his stomach}} and intestines and was analysed in some detail. It was hoped that investigations into {{the contents of the}} stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet, {{as was the case with}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> to be mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some mistletoe pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E
5|$|Miller's only solo album, a 2000 concert {{recording}} entitled Solo, {{was released}} in 2010 and was well received by critics for the imagination and harmonic development in Miller's playing. Also in 2010, Miller joined guitarist John Scofield's new band. That year, Miller had a minor stroke. After this, he took medicine, changed <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> and lost weight; he also reduced his touring and recording. In February 2012 he traveled to Denmark to play with Klüvers Big Band; selections {{from one of the}} five concerts were released under Miller's co-leadership as Grew's Tune. In autumn 2012 he performed as a piano duo with Kenny Barron, continuing an association that had begun some years earlier. In the winter of that year he toured Europe as part of a quintet led by reeds players Yusef Lateef and Archie Shepp.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} from Le Mans, Brock began to consult Melbourne-based health {{practitioner}} Eric Dowker. He gave up alcohol and cigarettes and became a vegetarian.

25|$|Walker {{is known}} for his unorthodox {{training}} and dieting methods. Walker claims he sleeps five hours a night and eats only one meal a day (skipping breakfast and lunch). Walker also claims <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> is made up mostly of soup, bread, and salads. Instead of lifting weights, he has a daily regimen of 750 to 1,500 push-ups and 2,000 sit-ups. He has been going through this same routine since high school.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, {{before the}} Davis Cup clash away at Croatia, Djokovic made another {{addition}} to his team – nutritionist Igor Četojević who additionally focuses on Chinese medicine and does acupuncture. He allegedly discovered that the tennis player suffers from gluten intolerance, using applied kinesiology, and that he cannot eat gluten, purging it from <b>his</b> <b>diet.</b> It appeared to have worked as Djokovic began feeling stronger, quicker, and much more fit.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that year}} Curly {{suffered}} a second massive stroke, which left him partially paralyzed. He used a wheelchair by 1950 and was fed boiled rice and apples {{as part of}} <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> to reduce his weight (and blood pressure). Valerie admitted him into the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital on August 29, 1950. He was released after several months of treatment and medical tests, although he would return periodically until his death.|$|E
50|$|The film follows Gameau's {{experiment}} on himself, changing from <b>his</b> normal <b>diet</b> containing no refined sugar, to a 'health-conscious' diet {{low in fat}} but high in sugar, equivalent to forty teaspoons of sugar per day. As a result, Gameau gained weight, grew lethargic, and developed fatty liver disease. The sugar diet was selected such that his calorie intake was not increased from <b>his</b> normal <b>diet.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following the experiment, he {{returned}} to <b>his</b> previous <b>diet,</b> and the ill effects are largely and quickly reversed.|$|R

25|$|Tanaka {{remained}} in convalescence through {{the election of}} 1986, where he retained <b>his</b> <b>Diet</b> seat. On New Year's Day of 1987, {{he made his first}} public appearance since the stroke, and was clearly in poor condition: half of his face was paralyzed, and he was grossly overweight. The Tokyo High Court dismissed Tanaka's appeal on July 29, 1987, and the original sentence passed down in 1983 was reinstated. Tanaka immediately posted bail and appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} dietitians was the English doctor George Cheyne. He himself was tremendously {{overweight}} and would constantly eat large quantities of rich food and drink. He began a meatless diet, taking only milk and vegetables, and soon regained his health. He began publicly recommending <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> for everyone suffering from obesity. In 1724, he wrote An Essay of Health and Long Life, in which he advises exercise and fresh air and avoiding luxury foods.|$|E
25|$|Koizumi {{remained}} in the Diet through the administrations of Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, but announced his retirement from politics on September 25, 2008, shortly following the election of Taro Aso as Prime Minister. He retained <b>his</b> <b>Diet</b> seat until the next general election, when his son Shinjiro was elected into the same seat representing the Kanagawa 11th district in 2009. Koizumi supported Yuriko Koike in the LDP leadership election held earlier in September 2008, but Koike placed a distant third.|$|E

25|$|La Follette met Belle Case while {{attending}} the University of Wisconsin, and they married on December 31, 1881, at her {{family home in}} Baraboo, Wisconsin. She became {{a leader in the}} feminist movement, an advocate of women's suffrage and an important influence on the development of La Follette's ideas. La Follette attended law school briefly and passed the bar in 1880. During this time, he became a vegetarian, declaring that <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> gave him more energy and a clear head.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of Ötzi's {{intestinal}} contents showed two meals (the {{last one}} consumed about eight hours before his death), one of chamois meat, {{the other of}} red deer and herb bread. Both were eaten with grain as well as roots and fruits. The grain from both meals was a highly processed einkorn wheat bran, quite possibly eaten {{in the form of}} bread. In the proximity of the body, and thus possibly originating from the Iceman's provisions, chaff and grains of einkorn and barley, and seeds of flax and poppy were discovered, as well as kernels of sloes (small plumlike fruits of the blackthorn tree) and various seeds of berries growing in the wild. Hair analysis was used to examine <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> from several months before.|$|E
25|$|As a defender, Cannavaro {{was known}} in {{particular}} for his concentration, anticipation, awareness and positional sense. Despite his relatively small stature for a defender, he was highly regarded for his aerial ability, courtesy of his elevation, physical strength, athleticism, timing and heading accuracy, which enabled him to outjump larger players, and made him particularly adept at defending crosses, or at scoring with his head from set-pieces. Throughout his career, he {{made a name for}} himself as a dynamic, consistent, tenacious and complete defender, known for his acceleration, speed, reactions, and agility, as well as his tackling ability, and in particular, his precise sliding challenges. Due to his wide range of skills, he excelled in a zonal marking system, but was also an excellent man-marker. Nicknamed Canna ("reed"), by his former Italy defensive teammate Paolo Maldini, as a reference to his surname and mental strength, in addition to his ability as a defender, Cannavaro was also known for his leadership, determination, strong temperament and charisma, both on and off the pitch, as well as his ability to organise his defence. Cannavaro also attributes his positive character, calm composure under pressure and self-assurance in his abilities, as well as <b>his</b> <b>diet,</b> work-rate and discipline in training, as some of the key reasons for his success as a footballer, as well as his ability to inspire confidence in his teammates.|$|E
50|$|Cathy deftly avoids being {{seduced by}} the married men, {{although}} each lets the others think he has slept with her. She supplies what each one really wants: Howie is starved for more substantial food than <b>his</b> <b>dieting</b> wife will provide; Doug likes to repair things that are conveniently broken each week (his status-conscious wife does not want their neighbors to see him tinkering about the house); George enjoys talking about himself, but his spouse keeps finishing his sentences. Fred, however, is a different story: he is very attracted to Cathy and, disgusted by his friends' fabricated stories, refuses to use his night.|$|R

25|$|Season eight {{addresses}} Roseanne's baby {{shower and}} the subsequent arrival of her son, Jerry Garcia Conner. (In a continuity error, the baby had been revealed {{to be a girl}} in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that after she fell pregnant she wished the Conners' baby to be the same gender as hers). The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone, including Mark, David, and Roseanne's mother, along to Walt Disney World. It is later revealed that one of the nights the clan was at Disney was also the night Darlene got pregnant. Darlene quickly decides she and David want to have the baby and the two get engaged. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for Darlene. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing how much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode it is revealed that he survives, as DJ saved his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to <b>his</b> <b>diet</b> and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan. Other subjects are DJ's Thanksgiving pageant, Darlene's wedding, and Dan's heart attack.|$|E
500|$|Hasil Adkins {{loved to}} eat meat, {{specifically}} poultry, {{the subject of}} many of his songs.

The episode finishes with a scene that takes place the next morning, with the entire staff waiting {{in the conference room}} for Michael to arrive for his farewell party, unaware he has already left, with the exception of Jim and Pam. When DeAngelo deduces Michael is not coming, he begins tearing pieces off Michael's farewell cake (a major subplot point of the episode) and throwing them in the trash, in a bizarre public internal struggle over <b>his</b> <b>dieting.</b> The rest of the staff, particularly Jim and Dwight, watch their new boss's outburst with concern.|$|R
