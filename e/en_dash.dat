25|$|The <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for the minus sign, when the minus sign character is not available, since the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is usually the same width as a plus sign. For example, the original 8-bit Macintosh character set had an <b>en</b> <b>dash,</b> useful for the minus sign, years before Unicode with a dedicated minus sign was available. The hyphen-minus is usually too narrow to make a typographically acceptable minus sign. However, the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> cannot be used for a minus sign in programming languages because the syntax usually requires a hyphen-minus.|$|E
25|$|A hyphen {{may be used}} {{to connect}} groups of numbers, such as in dates (see below), {{telephone}} numbers or sports scores. It {{can also be used to}} indicate a range of values, although many styles prefer an <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> (see examples at Dash > <b>En</b> <b>dash</b> > Ranges of values).|$|E
25|$|The <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is {{wider than}} the hyphen but not {{as wide as the}} em dash. An em width is defined as the point size of the {{currently}} used font, since the M character is not always the width of the point size. In running text, various dash conventions are employed: an em dash—like so—or a spaced em dash — like so — or a spaced <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> – like so – can be seen in contemporary publications.|$|E
50|$|Parties not {{represented}} in the chamber are denoted with <b>en</b> <b>dashes</b> if no indication is given of their level in polls.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} {{incorrectly}} reported {{as the product}} of four people (counting Munch-Petersen as two people). The true relationship (three people) is the reason for two <b>en</b> <b>dashes</b> and then one hyphen in [...] "Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen".|$|R
2500|$|In {{these two}} uses, <b>en</b> <b>dashes</b> {{normally}} {{do not have}} spaces around them. An exception is made when avoiding spaces may cause confusion or look odd. For example, compare [...] "12 June–3 July" [...] with [...] "12 June–3 July".|$|R
25|$|When an <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is {{unavailable}} in {{a particular}} character encoding environment—as in the ASCII character set—there are some conventional substitutions. Often two hyphens are the substitute.|$|E
25|$|The hyphen is {{sometimes}} used to hide letters in words (filleting for redaction/censoring), as in G-d, although an <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> {{can be used}} as well ("G–d").|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a spaced <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> may be {{ambiguous}} {{when it is}} also used for ranges, for example, in dates or between geographical locations with internal spaces.|$|E
25|$|In French, em or <b>en</b> <b>dashes</b> {{can be used}} as {{parentheses}} (brackets), but the use of {{a second}} dash as a closing parenthesis is optional. When a closing dash is not used the sentence is ended with a period (full-stop) as usual. Dashes are, however, much less common than parentheses.|$|R
50|$|ISO/IEC 9995-10 {{specifies}} several symbols {{to enable}} the unique identification of characters on keytops which otherwise can easily be misidentified (as em vs. <b>en</b> <b>dashes).</b> Also, it specifies a way to present diacritical marks, especially on dead keys. There is a publicly available listing of these symbols in a proposal to encode them as Unicode characters (which is still pending, as of March 2017).|$|R
25|$|Modern {{computer}} software typically has support {{for many more}} characters and is usually capable of rendering both the <b>en</b> and em <b>dashes</b> correctly—albeit sometimes with an inconvenient input method. Some software, though, may operate in a more limited mode. Some text editors, for example, are restricted to working with a single 8-bit character encoding, and when unencodable characters are entered—for example by pasting from the clipboard—they are often blindly converted to question marks. Sometimes this happens to em and <b>en</b> <b>dashes,</b> even when the 8-bit encoding supports them or when an alternative representation using hyphen-minuses is an option.|$|R
25|$|In TeX, an em dash (—) is typed {{as three}} hyphen‐minuses (---), an <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> (–) as two hyphen‐minuses (--), and a hyphen (‐) as one hyphen‐minus (-). Mathematical minus (−) is {{signified}} as $-$ or \(-\).|$|E
25|$|Either the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> or the em dash {{may be used}} as {{a bullet}} at the start of each item in a bulleted list, but a plain hyphen is more {{commonly}} used (and even mandatory in formats like Markdown).|$|E
25|$|An em dash (or an <b>en</b> <b>dash)</b> denotes a {{break in}} a {{sentence}} or to set off parenthetical statements. Glitter, felt, yarn, and buttons—his kitchen looked as if a clown had exploded.A flock of sparrows—some of them juveniles—alighted and sang.|$|E
5000|$|Mojibake in English texts {{generally}} {{occurs in}} punctuation, such as em dashes ( [...] - [...] ), <b>en</b> <b>dashes</b> ( [...] - [...] ), and curly quotes (“,”,‘,’), but rarely in character text, since most encodings agree with ASCII on the encoding of the English alphabet. For example, the pound sign [...] "£" [...] will appear as [...] "Â£" [...] {{if it was}} encoded by the sender as UTF-8 but interpreted by the recipient as CP1252 or ISO 8859-1. If iterated, {{this can lead to}} [...] "Ã‚Â£", [...] "Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£", [...] "ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£", etc.|$|R
25|$|In GNU/Linux, under recent {{versions}} of GTK+, {{there are various}} methods of producing these dashes. For em dashes, one may use the compose key followed by three presses of the hyphen character. For <b>en</b> <b>dashes,</b> one may press the compose key followed by two hyphens and a period. For all dashes, one may press and hold ctrl and shift and then press u (and release them all) after which an underlined u appears. Then, type the Unicode number (i.e., 2015) for the appropriate dash and press enter or the space bar. Also, other keys may be remapped to create dashes.|$|R
5000|$|Em dashes used as parenthetical dividers, and <b>en</b> <b>dashes</b> {{when used}} as word joiners, are usually set {{continuous}} with the text. However, such a dash can optionally be surrounded with a hair space, U+200A, or thin space, U+2009. The hair space {{can be written}} in HTML by using the numeric character references [...] or , or the named entity , but is not universally supported in browsers yet, [...] The thin space is named entity [...] and numeric references [...] or [...] These spaces are much thinner than a normal space (except in a monospaced (non-proportional) font), with the hair space being the thinner of the two.|$|R
25|$|Any kind of dash {{can be used}} {{directly}} in an HTML document, but HTML also lets them be entered using character references. The em dash and the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> are special in {{that they can be}} written using character entity references as &mdash; and &ndash;, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} {{uses of the}} <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> are to connect {{symmetric}} items, such as the two ends of a range or two competitors or alternatives, and {{as a substitute for}} a hyphen in a compound when one of the connected items is more complex than a single word.|$|E
25|$|The figure dash is used within numbers (e.g. {{phone number}} 555‒0199), {{especially}} in columns for maintaining alignment. Its meaning {{is the same}} as a hyphen, as represented by the hyphen-minus glyph; by contrast, the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is more appropriately used to indicate a range of values; the minus sign also has a separate glyph.|$|E
2500|$|On Plan 9 systems, an <b>en</b> or em <b>dash</b> may {{be entered}} by {{pressing}} the Compose key (usually left Alt), followed by typing [...] or [...] respectively.|$|R
40|$|Diski Eginda Rismianti. 14111310149. The Analysis of Punctuation Use in Unpunctuated Passages: A Discourse-Graphology Perspective. Punctuation is {{the basic}} element in writing which is {{important}} to clarify meaning. Without punctuation or ignoring the rule of punctuation in a passage, the writing will be ambiguous. The writing course in IAIN Syekh Nurjati Cirebon is studied by English Student in 5 levels. Based the phenomenon, this research aims {{to find out the}} students’ error in the use of punctuation and how does the use relate to the meaning of restrictive and nonrestrictive elements. The analyses process in this research is constructed based on the theory from Marcella Frank. This research used qualitative method in analyzing data where the data contains the two original passages which is taken from the book of academic writing and the three participants’ work which are got by examining the passages as a main data source to be analyzed in this research. Those passages are changed be unpunctuated passages then examined to the 3 EFL learner which comes from the high score, medium score, and low score of writing. The result of this analysis shows that there are fifteen punctuation marks which are used in the two passages; they are capitalization, periods, commas, semicolons, colons, quotation marks, parentheses, apostrophes, hyphen, <b>en</b> <b>dashes,</b> ellipses, percent, underscore, at sign, and citation. FP has highest number of error in Capitalization with 100 %. SP has big problem in commas exactly in the nineteenth rule with 90 % and TP are wrong in parentheses. For restrictive and nonrestrictive elements, restrictive elements has higher number than nonrestrictive elements, except is in appositive. The numbers of the elements are same with the three participants. The differences come from the number of appositive which passages has higher number of nonrestrictive appositive than restrictive appositives. The results show that punctuation in unpunctuated passages used the rule from APA (American Psychological Association). The effects of the use of punctuation are in the number of sentences and clauses, types of phrases, and restrictive and nonrestrictive elements. For the students’ error, there are some sentences in FP and TP which only contain phrase. Key words: Punctuation Marks, Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Clause, Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Phrase, Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Appositives...|$|R
50|$|Coleman {{also participated}} {{on the track}} & field team, {{where he was a}} {{standout}} sprinter and jumper. As a junior in 2011, he placed second at the District 10-4A meet in the triple jump with a leap of 13.70 meters (44'11.5"). He posted a personal-best time of 10.83 seconds in the 100-meter dash at the 48th Annual Jesuit-Sheaner Relays, placing sixth in the finals. At the Region II-4A meet, he recorded a career-best time of 21.76 seconds in the 200-meter <b>dash</b> <b>en</b> route to an 8th-place finish; he was also a finalist in the jumping events, finishing second in the long jump (6.99m or 22'11") and third in the high jump (2.0m or 6'6.75"), while also running the third leg on the 4 × 100 m relay squad, helping them earn a fourth-place finish with a time of 41.97 seconds. Before his senior year, he ran the fastest 40-yard dash (4.32 seconds) at a SPARQ Combine in Oregon, which featured some of the nation's top recruits. As senior in 2012, he finished eighth at Texas UIL 3A state meet in the high jump with a 1.93m (6'4") mark.|$|R
25|$|The dash is a {{punctuation}} {{mark that}} is similar in appearance to a hyphen or minus sign, but differs from both of these symbols primarily in length and function. The most common versions of the dash are the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> (–) and the longer em dash (—), whose names historically were loosely related with {{the length of a}} lower-case n and upper-case M, respectively, in commonly used typefaces.|$|E
25|$|In most uses of en dashes, such as {{when used}} in {{indicating}} ranges, they are closed up to the joined words. It is only when en dashes take the role of em dashes – for example, in setting off parenthetical statements {{such as this one}} – that they take spaces around them. For more on the choice of em versus en in this context, see <b>En</b> <b>dash</b> versus em dash.|$|E
25|$|An <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is used {{to express}} a {{relation}} between two places, and its adjectival form becomes completely lower-case (e.g. Moszkva–Párizs ‘Moscow-Paris ’ and moszkva–párizsi ‘of the Moscow-Paris route’). However, if a higher-ranked connected element becomes an adjective, the geographical proper names will retain the upper-case (e.g. Volga–Don-csatorna ‘Volga-Don canal’ vs. Volga–Don-csatornai), except when {{the elements of the}} name contain adjectives or common names, which will become lower-case (e.g. Cseh–Morva-dombság ‘Bohemian-Moravian Highlands’ vs. cseh–morva-dombsági).|$|E
25|$|Like em dashes, en dashes can be {{used instead}} of colons or pairs of commas that mark off a nested clause or phrase. They {{can also be used}} around parenthetical {{expressions}} such as this one in place of the em dashes preferred by some publishers, particularly where short columns are used, since em dashes can look awkward {{at the end of a}} line. (See <b>En</b> <b>dash</b> versus em dash below.) In these situations, en dashes must have a single space on each side.|$|E
25|$|The <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> – {{always with}} spaces in running text when, as {{discussed}} in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause – and the spaced em dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support full justification. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the not spaced em dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated {{by the use of}} thin spaces, hair spaces, or even zero-width spaces {{on the sides of the}} em dash. This provides the appearance of a not spaced em dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced em dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{typographical}} conventions originate from {{the widespread use}} of the typewriter, based on the characteristics and limitations of the typewriter itself. For example, the QWERTY keyboard typewriter did not include keys for the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> and the em dash. To overcome this limitation, users typically typed more than one adjacent hyphen to approximate these symbols. This typewriter convention is still sometimes used today, even though modern computer word processing applications can input the correct en and em dashes for each font type.|$|E
25|$|When an em dash is {{unavailable}} in {{a particular}} character encoding environment—as in the ASCII character set—it has usually been approximated as a double(--) or triple(---) hyphen-minus. The two-hyphen em dash proxy is perhaps more common, being a widespread convention in the typewriting era. (It is still described for hard copy manuscript preparation in the Chicago Manual of Style as of the 16th edition, although the manual conveys that typewritten manuscript and copyediting on paper are now dated practices). The three-hyphen em dash proxy was popular with various publishers because the sequence of one, two, or three hyphens could then correspond to the hyphen, <b>en</b> <b>dash,</b> and em dash, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In TeX, the {{standard}} fonts have no figure dash; however, the digits normally {{all have the}} same width as the <b>en</b> <b>dash,</b> so an <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> can be substituted when using standard TeX fonts. In XeLaTeX, one could use \char"2012 [...] (Linux Libertine font has the figure dash glyph).|$|E
2500|$|In modern fonts, {{the length}} of the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is not standardized, and the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is often more than half the width of the em dash. [...] The widths of en and em dashes have also been {{specified}} as being equal to those of the upper-case letters N and M respectively, ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{discussed}} above, the <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> {{is sometimes}} recommended {{instead of a}} hyphen in compound adjectives where neither part of the adjective modifies the other—that is, when each modifies the noun, as in love–hate relationship. The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS), however, limits {{the use of the}} <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> to two main purposes: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> is {{commonly}} used to indicate a closed range of values—a range with clearly defined and finite upper and lower boundaries—roughly signifying what might otherwise be communicated by the word [...] "through". This may include ranges such as those between dates, times, or numbers. Various style guides restrict this range indication style to only parenthetical or tabular matter, requiring [...] "to" [...] or [...] "through" [...] in running text. Preference for hyphen vs. <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> in ranges varies. [...] For example, APA style uses an <b>en</b> <b>dash</b> in ranges, but AMA style uses a hyphen: ...|$|E
