25|$|Aitken Spence {{became a}} Private Company in 1952. In its centenary year, 1968, it {{appointed}} its first Sri Lankan Chairman, E.L. Van Langenberg.

Directors' shareholdings in the Statutory Company are subject to rights of pre-emption by the PLC and are therefore treated for most purposes as being owned by that company.|$|E

The two clubs would continue separately for the last few weeks of the 1982–83 campaign, and Thames Valley Royals would begin play {{at the start of the}} 1983–84 League season. Maxwell claimed to have support in principle for this from the Football League. He said that the amalgamated team would ultimately be based at a new stadium to be built somewhere between [...] Oxford and Reading, and that in the meantime home games would alternate between the two old grounds, Elm Park in Reading and the Manor Ground in Oxford, both of which would eventually be sold.

2500|$|A {{dividend}} is allocated as a fixed {{amount per}} share, with shareholders receiving a dividend in proportion to their shareholding. [...] For the joint-stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of after-tax profits among shareholders. Retained earnings (profits {{that have not been}} distributed as dividends) are shown in the shareholders' equity section on the company's balance sheet [...] the same as its <b>issued</b> <b>share</b> <b>capital.</b> Public companies usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may declare a dividend at any time, sometimes called a special dividend to distinguish it from the fixed schedule dividends. Cooperatives, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members' activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.|$|E

5|$|The {{causes of}} Bolckow, Vaughan's failure included: poor {{decision-making}} {{in the period}} from 1900–1910 which delayed the introduction of improved steelmaking technology; optimistic belief in promises of funding made by the British government during the war, leading to excessive reliance on costly bank loans in 1918, instead of <b>issuing</b> <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> (as the firm later did in 1919 and 1923); failure to diversify into profitable steel products such as pipes, sheet steel and shipbuilding plates; and failure to invest in its own coal mines to provide enough for steel production, and for cash.
