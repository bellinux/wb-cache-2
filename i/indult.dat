Gleaston Castle is first mentioned in 1389, although John Harington, 2nd Baron Harington {{is said to}} have died there in 1363. In 1415 John Harington was granted a papal <b>indult</b> for a private chapel and a portable altar for mass. It is likely, however, that the castle would have had its own chapel before this date.|$|E

By 7 December 1345, he had {{received}} a Licentiate in Civil Law. On 20 December 1348 he was at Avignon as an envoy of his university, and while there he obtained a grace regarding his own benefice holding from Pope Clement VI. On 7 October 1349, Pope Clement granted an <b>indult</b> to Walter allowing him to be absent from his cure while he continued his studies at Orléans.|$|E
25|$|Priests {{who hold}} {{additional}} honors may wear a different cassock: Chaplains of His Holiness wear a black cassock with purple piping, buttons, and fascia, while Honorary Prelates and Protonotaries apostolic wear a purple cassock with scarlet piping and buttons with a purple fascia. A black cassock with amaranth piping and buttons, girded with a purple fascia, serves as pian dress (academic dress) for an honorary prelate or protonotary apostolic. Canons may wear the rochet (if the chapter has been granted usus rochetti by papal <b>indult)</b> with a distinctive mozzetta, the particular colors {{of which are}} determined by the chapter.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, faculties are {{general or}} particular: general, when granted for {{indeterminate}} persons, {{though they may}} be limited by time; particular, when granted to designated persons or for particular cases. General faculties conceded to bishops and other ordinaries are also called <b>indults.</b> These <b>indults</b> are given for a definite period, e. g. five years (facultates quinquennales), or for a definite number of cases.|$|R

25|$|In {{this respect}} {{the duties of}} the vicar are of primary importance, since a {{multitude}} of ecclesiastics {{from all parts of the}} world pursue their studies at Rome and receive orders there on presentation of the required authorization of their respective bishops. For every order conferred at Rome there is a special examination conducted by a body of twenty-five learned ecclesiastics from the secular and the regular clergy, which operates in sections of three. Orders are regularly conferred on the days prescribed by ecclesiastical law and in the cathedral of the Bishop of Rome, i. e. in the Lateran Basilica; they may, however, be conferred on other days and in other churches or chapels. They are usually conferred either by the vicar himself or by the vicesgerens; by special delegation from the vicar, however, another bishop may occasionally ordain candidates. For the rights of the cardinals to ordain in their own churches (tituli, diaconia) see Cardinal. By a general pontifical <b>indult</b> any bishop resident in Rome may administer the Sacrament of Confirmation, it being still customary at Rome to confirm all children who seem in danger of death.|$|E
500|$|Bishop Thomas was at Avignon {{again in}} the mid-1390s, as attested by record {{of a series of}} mundane {{transactions}} conducted by him there. On 10 September 1395, he was granted an <b>indult</b> to administer his bishopric in absentia, via a deputy; he is not known to have returned to Scotland.

50|$|Women {{were not}} {{included}} in this law. They, unless special <b>indults</b> were granted, followed the Tridentine regulation until Pope Leo XIII (3 May 1902, Decretum perpensis) enjoined on them the same profession of simple vows for three years prior to the solemn profession, under penalty of nullity.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} between privilege and dispensation {{was not always}} clearly observed, and the term dispensation rather than privilege was used, even when {{the nature of the}} act made it clearly a privilege. Indeed, medieval canonists treated privileges and dispensations as distinct, though related, aspects of the law. Privileges and <b>indults</b> were both special favours. Some writers hold that the former are positive favours, while <b>indults</b> are negative. The pope might confer a degree as a positive privilege in his capacity as a temporal sovereign, or he might do so by way of dispensation from the strict requirements of the canon law. In both cases his authority to do so was found in the canon law. The pope's powers as a temporal sovereign are recognised in the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law of 1983. In practice matters of education are dealt with though the hierarchy of the Church, rather than through that of Vatican City State, the residual part of the Papal States.|$|R

2500|$|In 1528 he {{was named}} Abbot Commendatory of the Abbey of Cluny by King Francis I, a {{benefice}} he held {{until his death in}} 1550. [...] The monks of Cluny had tried to reassert their old rights of election, and had chosen Jacques le Roy, Abbot of Saint-Florent, to be the new abbot of Cluny, but the King and the Pope intervened, in accordance with the Concordat of Bologna of 1516, and Le Roy was made Archbishop of Bourges instead. [...] On 1 August 1530, Pope Clement VII granted the Cardinal of Lorraine an <b>indult</b> allowing him to hold and accumulate the benefices in his diocese of Narbonne and the benefices of his abbeys.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is said to}} {{have had}} his {{education}} in Paris. It is also speculated, however, that he studied at the University of Angers. He had a licenciate in utroque iure (Civil Law and Canon Law). [...] He was a priest of the diocese of Le Mans. He was appointed Bishop of Bayonne by King Francis I, whose appointment was approved by Pope Clement VII on 12 February 1524. He held the position until his transfer to the See of Paris in 1532. [...] On 2 March 1533, Pope Clement granted Bishop du Bellay the privilege of holding multiple benefices both in the diocese of Paris and in other dioceses as well. King Francis confirmed this <b>indult</b> on 1 October 1534. Jean du Bellay was succeeded as Bishop of Paris by his nephew Eustache, on 16 March 1551, after Cardinal Jean was dismissed by King Henry II.|$|E

5000|$|On 31 May 1383, Pope Clement VII (of Avignon) {{provided}} Stephen de Cellario to the bishopric of Brechin; {{the mandate}} of provision noted that Stephen was already bishop-elect and present at the papal curia, and that Patrick had freely resigned the bishopric. On 20 June, two <b>indults</b> and a grant of a pension were made to Patrick, and the grant notes that he had resigned the see because of [...] "his advanced age and infirmity".|$|R

2500|$|The Council of Trent, in {{its final}} session on 4 December 1563, {{entrusted}} the reform of the Breviary to the Pope. On 9 July 1568, Pope Pius V, the successor of the Pope who closed the Council of Trent, promulgated an edition, known as the Roman Breviary, with his Apostolic Constitution Quod a nobis, imposing {{it in the same}} way in which, two years later, he imposed his Roman Missal and using language very similar to that in the bull Quo primum with which he promulgated the Missal, regarding, for instance, the perpetual force of its provisions, the obligation to use the promulgated text in all places, and the total prohibition of adding or omitting anything, declaring in fact: [...] "No one whosoever is permitted to alter this letter or heedlessly to venture to go contrary to this notice of Our permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, <b>indult</b> declaration, will decree and prohibition. Should anyone, however, presume to commit such an act, he should know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, Pope John XXIII (1958–1963) {{ordered the}} {{suppression}} of the word [...] "perfidis" [...] ("unbelieving" [...] i.e. not believing in Jesus), applied to the Jews, in the rites for Good Friday. He revised the rubrics to the Order of Mass and the Breviary. Two years later, in 1962, he made some more minor modifications on the occasion of publishing a new typical edition of the Roman Missal. This is the edition authorized for use by virtue of the Quattuor abhinc annos <b>indult</b> (see below, under Present status of the Tridentine Mass). Among the other changes he made and that were included in the 1962 Missal were: adding St. Joseph's name to the Roman Canon; eliminating the second Confiteor before Communion; suppressing 10 feasts, such as St. Peter's Chair in Rome (or, more accurately, combining both feasts of St Peter's Chair into one, as they originally had been); incorporating the abolition of 4 festal octaves and 9 vigils of feasts and other changes made by Pope Pius XII; and modifying rubrics especially for Solemn High Masses. Among the names that disappeared from the Roman Missal was that of St Philomena: her liturgical celebration had never been admitted to the General Roman Calendar, but from 1920 it had been included (with an indication that the Mass was to be taken entirely from the common) in the section headed [...] "Masses for some places", i.e. only those places for which it had been specially authorized; but her name had already in 1961 been ordered to be removed from all liturgical calendars.|$|E
5000|$|The best-known <b>indult</b> among lay Catholics {{in recent}} times was the one granted by Pope John Paul II in 1984 authorising the world's bishops to permit {{celebrations}} of the Tridentine Mass liturgy in their dioceses.

This <b>indult</b> was superseded in 2007 by new legislation introduced by Pope Benedict XVI in the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum.|$|E
50|$|Beside {{the three}} main classes of dispensation, the Roman Curia was ready to grant {{miscellaneous}} positive concessions to applicants, from individuals to larger organisations, although the former is rare. This host of dispensations, faculties, and <b>indults</b> included permission to eat flesh during Lent, the celebration of offices in chapels of ease and private oratories, and the granting of academic degrees. Those dispensations relating to academic degrees were mostly issued under the sanction of the canon law, {{as stated in the}} constitution of Pope Boniface VIII beginning Cum ex eo.|$|R
50|$|In 1792, he {{returned}} to Spain to replace José Moñino, 1st Count of Floridablanca as secretary of State (Prime minister). After the imprisonment of Louis XVI (August, 1792) and the proclamation of the Republic in France (September), Aranda's Enlightenment leanings seemed incompatible with the total war that several European monarchies were about to declare against revolutionary France. Aranda was therefore replaced by Manuel Godoy in November. After the defeat of Spanish Army in Roussillon, Godoy and Aranda publicly quarreled in the Council of State. That same night Aranda was arrested and confined to Jaén. A year later he was <b>indulted</b> and retired to his estates in Aragon.|$|R
5000|$|The Brown Scapular (also {{known as}} the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, or simply as the Scapular) {{is the most popular}} {{scapular}}. Given to Simon Stock by Our Lady of Mount Carmel, she promised him that [...] "whoever dies clothed in this scapular shall not suffer the eternal flames." [...] Later, she appeared to Pope John XXII as the Mediatrix of all graces, promising him that [...] "whoever shall wear my Scapular faithfully, pray the Divine Office <b>indults</b> have applied in the past and apply today, and exercise chastity in their state of life shall not suffer Hell, and if they should go to Purgatory, I shall bring them to Heaven on the First Saturday after their death."

5000|$|<b>Indult</b> Catholic was a traditionalist Catholic loaded {{term used}} in the early 21st century until [...] as a pejorative label applied to {{conservative}} Catholics who attended only the licit celebrations of the Tridentine Mass in Latin according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal and regulated by the local bishop through an <b>indult</b> that conformed to the 1984 Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments norms in the <b>indult</b> Quattuor abhinc annos.|$|E
5000|$|Universal <b>indult</b> is a {{term that}} was used {{primarily}} by traditionalist Catholics in a very specific sense. Since an <b>indult</b> signifies a favour granted to an individual or limited group, a similar measure applied to every member of a particular class of persons would in reality be a change of the law, not an <b>indult.</b> However, {{in spite of its}} self-contradictory character, traditionalist Catholics used the term [...] "universal indult" [...] to refer to a general permission that they hoped the Pope would grant to all Catholic priests who celebrate Mass in the Roman Rite to do so in its Tridentine Mass form even publicly without first obtaining a specific <b>indult</b> or permission. Groups such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter have standing specific indults to say the Tridentine Mass.|$|E

2500|$|Like other {{bishops of}} Brechin, Forrester {{does not seem}} to have been very active in his diocese, on several {{occasions}} obtaining papal <b>indults</b> legitimizing procurations without visitation. He is recorded presiding over statutes issued by his cathedral chapter in 1410, and later in the year pursued land claims successfully with the support of Governor Albany and his sheriff in Angus. Albany granted him the second tenth of crown revenues from the sheriffdom of Kincardine in 1413 and 1417. He was present at a provincial council of the Scottish church at Perth on 16 July 1419. Historian D. E. R. Watt has summarised that [...] "though he did visit Brechin from time to time and [...] take some interest in [...] organisation and property of his see, it does not add up to much".|$|R
50|$|The Council of Trent (Sess. XXIV, cap. v, De ref. matrim.) {{decreed that}} dispensations {{should be free}} of all charges. Diocesan chanceries are bound to conform to this law (many pontifical documents, and at times clauses in <b>indults,</b> remind them of it) and neither to exact nor accept {{anything}} but the modest contribution to the chancery expenses sanctioned by an Instruction approved by Innocent XI on 8 October 1678, and known as the Innocentian Tax (Taxa Innocentiana). Rosset holds that it is also lawful, when the diocese is poor, to demand payment of the expenses it incurs for dispensations. Sometimes the Holy See grants ampler freedom in this matter, but nearly always with the monition that all revenues from this source shall be employed for some good work, and {{not go to the}} diocesan curia as such. Henceforth every rescript requiring execution will state the sum which the diocesan curia is authorized to collect for its execution.|$|R
5000|$|... =Origin=According to the De officio et jurisdictione datarii necnon de stylo Datariae of Amydenus {{and other}} authorities, the Dataria Apostolica was of very ancient origin, but the {{previous}} transaction by other {{offices of the}} business that was gradually assigned to it contradicts these authorities. The Dataria was principally entrusted with concession of matrimonial dispensations of external jurisdiction and with collation, i. e., conferral, of benefices and rescripts that were reserved to the Apostolic See. To this double faculty was later added the third of granting many other <b>indults</b> and favors. Until the pontificate of Pope Pius IV, matrimonial dispensations were granted through the Apostolic Penitentiaria. Regarding the authority of collation of reserved benefices, {{it could not have}} been granted in ancient times because the institution of those reservations is comparatively recent: although some vestige of the reservations is found prior to the twelfth century, the custom was not frequent before Pope Innocent II, and the reservation of benefices was instituted as a general rule (De pract. et dignit., 3, 4, c. 2 (6°)) only from the pontificate of Pope Clement IV. While the office certainly existed in the fourteenth century, and as an independent one, the date of its institution is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|A {{religious}} {{bound by}} temporary vows may for a grave reason be authorized to leave before expiry {{of the period}} for which the vows were taken.

There was formerly as much discussion of the title of [...] "pro-datary" [...] as of that of [...] "vice chancellor" [...] of the Apostolic Chancery: some contend that the title {{is derived from the}} fact that the office dated the rescripts of the Supreme Pontiff, while others that it is derived from the right to grant (dare) the <b>indults</b> and rescripts for which petition was made to the Supreme Pontiff. It is certain that, on account of these faculties, the Datary enjoyed great prestige during the flourishing of the office, when he was denominated the [...] "Oculus Papae" [...] ("Eye of the Pope"). After the Cardinal Datary came the [...] "Subdatary" [...] ("Subdatarius"), a prelate of the Roman Curia who assisted the Datary and assumed almost all of the faculties of the Datary as his substitute on occasion. After the Subdatary came a number of subordinate officials who, as De Luca stated, had enigmatical and sibyllic titles, e. g. the [...] "Prefect of the Per Obitum", [...] "Prefect of the Concessum", [...] "Cashier of the Componenda", and [...] "Officer of the Missis".|$|R
5000|$|After the Philippines {{ceased to}} become Spanish colony, the first Provincial Council of Manila petitioned the Holy See for the {{privilege}} to continue using blue vestments for the Feast of Immaculate Conception. Pope Pius X granted this request via in a special audience, with the privilege included in a list of <b>indults</b> granted to the Philippines, dated 11 February 1910, executed by Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val. By the Apostolic Letter Impositi Nobis of 12 September 1942, Pope Pius XII, {{at the request of}} the bishops in the Philippines, declared the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception as principal patroness of the Philippines with Saints Pudentiana and Rose of Lima as secondary patronesses, mentioning that the 1907 Provincial Council of Manila invoked [...] "Maria Immaculata" [...] as patroness of the whole Filipino people and that historical documents indicated Saint Pudentiana as Patroness of the Philippines from the 16th century and Saint Rose of Lima from the 17th. The bull only affected those patronesses of the Philippines that were ordinally ranked. Since 1571, Saint Pudentiana was principal patroness of the Philippines; and since 1670, Saint Rose of Lima was principal patroness of the Indies, thereby also becoming a de iure principal patroness of the Philippines. These two patronesses were demoted to secondary rank in deference to the Immaculate Conception.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Bealknap (or Belknap) JP (died 19 January 1401) was a British justice. He {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in June 1351 in a papal register of <b>indults</b> issued to inhabitants of Great Britain, {{where he is}} called a [...] "clerk, of the diocese of Salisbury" [...] in Wiltshire. He next appears in 1353 {{as a member of}} a commission to survey Battle Abbey. This commission was followed by an extensive number of others, as evidenced by extant patent rolls, until 1388, most of which related to oyer and terminer, walliis et fossatis, gaol delivery, sewer, and the peace primarily, but not exclusively, in Kent and other parts of southeastern England. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Kent on 18 May 1362, and at the same time began serving as legal counsel. In July 1362 he served on a commission with William of Wykeham investigating lands granted to the Bishopric of Winchester, which Wykeham at that time held. From this point Belknap's career as a lawyer began to prosper; from 1371 he was retained as a lawyer by Westminster Abbey, and from 1374 by John of Gaunt. He was sent along with John Wycliffe and John Gilbert to Bruges in July 1374 to negotiate papal provisions; he returned in September and on 10 October he was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and was Knighted on 28 December of that same year. From 1375 to 1388 he served as a Trier of Petitions in Parliament, and in 1376 he was involved in investigating Richard Lyons in Essex and Sussex after complaints of embezzlement.|$|R
