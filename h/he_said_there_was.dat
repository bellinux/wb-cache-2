He was interviewed by police in hospital in Perth, but {{was not aware of}} much detail about the final minutes of the flight. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no sign of fire prior to the crash and no announcement to passengers to fasten their seat belts. He died six days after the crash and was buried at the North Road cemetery in Adelaide, his home town.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Hill {{has come}} to public {{attention}} several times. In November 2009, Daily Telegraph blogger James Delingpole credited Bishop Hill with reporting the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs funding of the Climate Outreach and Information Network charity {{in the amount of}} £700,000 over two years. Also in February 2010, Philip Campbell, the editor-in-chief of Nature, resigned from Sir Muir Russell's Independent Climate Change Email Review after Bishop Hill and Channel 4 News drew attention to an interview Campbell had given in 2009 to China Radio International, in which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no evidence the scientists had engaged in a coverup.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecutor}} called Joseph Faulkner, {{a tailor}} who knew Whelan in Montreal, {{hoping that he}} would testify about Whelan's Fenian connections; while he said he recollected Whelan being angered by McGee during the election season, which was contradicted by other witnesses who claimed Whelan showed no interest in politics, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no known Fenian connection. Another witness identified as Turner testified {{that he had heard}} a member of parliament mention that the government had offered Doyle $16,000 and passage to anywhere in the world to restart his life, if he would make a sworn statement against Whelan. However Susan Wheatley later testified that she had heard Turner say he would swear his grandfather's life away for $10,000 or $20,000 and no mention was made of Doyle. Later witnesses were actually directly asked to swear whether they had received any money for their testimony.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, Eric Gomez, {{president}} of Golden Boy Promotions told the LA Times that Álvarez had an immediate rematch clause {{in place on}} his contract, whereas Golovkin, if he loses, won't be guaranteed a rematch. De La Hoya later also revealed {{in an interview with}} ESPN the fight would take place at the full middleweight limit of 160 pounds with no re-hydration clauses, meaning Golovkin and Álvarez would be able to gain unlimited amount of weight following the weigh in. On June 5, the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue of the fight, and would mark the first time Golovkin would fight in the state of Nevada. The AT Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Dodgers Stadium missed out on hosting the fight. Eric Gomez of Golden Boy Promotions {{said in a statement that}} Álvarez would fight for the IBF meaning he would participate in the second day weight in, which the IBF require that each boxer weighs no more than 10 pounds over the 160 pound limit. Although <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no word on whether Álvarez would fight for the WBC title, Álvarez claimed that he would not be. On July 7, 2017 Golden Boy and K2 Promotions individually announced the tickets had sold out.|$|E
500|$|Although all {{the grounds}} (except 11) were {{reviewed}} by the court, {{the reason for the}} referral to the Court of Appeal was ground 15, the discovery of DNA on the silencer, the result of a test not available in 1986. The silencer evidence during the trial came from a Mr. Hayward, a biologist in private practice, formerly of the Forensic Science Laboratory. He had found a [...] "considerable amount of blood" [...] inside the silencer; he had stated that it was human blood and that the blood group was consistent with it having come from Sheila. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "remote possibility" [...] that it was a mixture of blood from Nevill and June.|$|E

500|$|Reuters {{reported}} that Tsakalotos was considering not {{running in the}} September 2015 legislative election, as {{he did not want}} to have to implement the bailout agreement. However, these fears were assuaged by Alexis Tsipras when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no doubt that Tsakalotos would stand in the election. He also claimed that, during the election campaign, without Tsakalotos' involvement, there would have been no bailout package. In recognition of that, Tsakalotos was made to head the list for Syriza in Athens B. In an interview during the campaign, Tsakalotos admitted that the Greek government had suffered [...] "defeat" [...] during negotiations with creditors, implying that some responsibility for this lay with his predecessor, Varoufakis.|$|E
500|$|On May 24, 1964, {{six months}} after the shooting, the New York Herald Tribune {{reported}} that Altgens—the man responsible for [...] "probably the most controversial photograph of the decade", {{and one of the few}} people standing near the motorcade when Kennedy was shot—had not been questioned either by the FBI or by the Warren Commission. A newspaper column printed in Chicago's American the following day made the same observation. FBI investigators interviewed Altgens eight days later, on June 2, 1964; he testified before the Warren Commission on July 22. By this time, Altgens was aware of the individual who resembled Oswald; Lovelady had been interviewed for the Herald Tribune article, and Altgens testified that he too had been contacted. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing to share because he had not taken part in any assignments involving depository employees.|$|E
500|$|VanAirsdale {{cited the}} release date and {{screening}} {{as the third}} and fourth reasons; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that Toronto is [...] "a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month" [...] and that [...] "this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn’t travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and L.A. bows." [...] The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned Ty Burr's review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is [...] "ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization" [...] and that [...] "he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be {{two sides of the same}} coin. Who's the monster, and who made the monster? Sorry if you wanted Heathers with demons, fellas. Equipment's cheap these days; perhaps make your own?" ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the same}} day, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon blamed the Syrian {{government}} for the [...] "unacceptable levels of violence and abuses" [...] occurring every day in Syria. Ban cited the government's continued use of heavy weapons, reports of shelling and [...] "a stepped-up security crackdown by the authorities {{that has led to}} massive violations of human rights by government forces and pro-government militias". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only [...] "small progress" [...] in implementing the UN peace plan.|$|E

On 18 October, US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner stated [...] "It {{is very important for}} people to understand that the United States of America and no country around the world can devalue its way to prosperity and competitiveness." [...] Following this statement {{the value of the dollar}} rose as speculators calculated that at least in the short term it would be less likely for the US to intentionally devalue its currency.|$|E
2500|$|After the 2006 coup, the {{military}} junta appointed {{a committee to}} investigate the anti-drug campaign. Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee's results The Economist reported in January 2008: [...] "Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet this week <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It {{is easy to see}} why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the PPP won last month's elections, those names were omitted." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the press}} conference, Murillo Karam showed a video re-enactment {{of how the}} bodies were transported, and several video interrogations of the suspects, and also video of teeth and bones {{recovered}} at the site. He said that the remains were badly burned, making DNA identification difficult. In order to properly identify the remains, the federal government turned to a team of internationally renowned forensic specialists from the University of Innsbruck in Austria for help, though <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no definite timeframe for the results. The families of the students, however, did not accept the statements of the Attorney General and {{continue to believe that}} their sons are still alive. They said that they will not accept that their children are dead until it is proven scientifically by independent investigators, since they fear that the government is attempting to close the case in order to counter public outrage. Murillo Karam stated that 74 people had been arrested since the case started and another 10 had arrest warrants. He said that until the situation of the students is confirmed, the case remains open and the government formally considers the students [...] "disappeared." ...|$|E

Blair denied {{that he would have}} supported the invasion of Iraq even if he had thought Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction. He said he believed the world was safer {{as a result of the}} invasion. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> [...] "no real difference between wanting regime change and wanting Iraq to disarm: regime change was US policy because Iraq was in breach of its UN obligations." [...] In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Blair apologised for his [...] "mistakes" [...] over Iraq War and admitted there were [...] "elements of truth" [...] to the view that the invasion helped promote the rise of ISIS. The Chilcot Inquiry report of 2016 gave a damning assessment of Blair's role in the Iraq War, though the former prime minister again refused to apologise for his decision to back the US-led invasion.|$|E

[...] He explained his vision of prison chaplaincy by saying that, [...] "My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities—to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars. Mine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart." [...] He would sometimes take rabbinical students with him on his visits, schooling them on counseling techniques he had developed over the years. When he retired from prison chaplaincy work in 1974, as the city was preparing to tear down part of the facility (although it was eventually replaced by new buildings), he reflected over his career, noting that prison conditions had markedly improved, especially since the 1970 [...] "upheavals" [...] at The Tombs. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> [...] "much more cordiality and serenity – if it's possible to have any serenity in a prison."
