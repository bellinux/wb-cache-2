5|$|Unlike typical vomiting, the {{regurgitation}} {{is typically}} described as <b>effortless</b> and unforced. There is seldom nausea preceding the expulsion, and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of stomach acid and bile.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 Gielgud {{made his}} first Hollywood film, the sole {{classical}} actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar, playing Cassius. Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was in awe of him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly <b>effortless</b> skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In adults, the {{diagnosis}} {{is supported by the}} absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is <b>effortless,</b> or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.|$|E
5|$|Rumination syndrome, or Merycism, is an under-diagnosed chronic {{motility}} disorder {{characterized by}} <b>effortless</b> regurgitation of most meals following consumption, {{due to the}} involuntary contraction of the muscles around the abdomen. There is no retching, nausea, heartburn, odour, or abdominal pain associated with the regurgitation, as there is with typical vomiting. The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants, young children, and people with cognitive disabilities (the prevalence {{is as high as}} 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities).|$|E
5|$|When Flynn {{returns from}} Zaphias, he and Yuri come to blows, as each {{believes}} {{the other had}} an <b>effortless</b> assignment. Meanwhile, a platoon of high-ranking knights from central are seen in the forest being slaughtered by monsters. One survives and flees to Shizontonia's front gate, where he delivers a report to an unseen individual in the city. Niren, upon receiving the news that reinforcements would not be arriving anytime soon, decides to take the knights to investigate {{the source of the}} aer, which he believes to be a fortress {{at the center of a}} nearby lake. Flynn disagrees with Niren's decision, viewing it as disobedience of a direct order.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems <b>effortless,</b> but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Rivera joined Panamá Oeste, a local amateur {{baseball}} team, {{as their}} shortstop. Scout Herb Raybourn watched him {{play in a}} baseball tournament but did not project {{him to be a}} major league shortstop. A year later, Panamá Oeste's pitcher performed so poorly in a playoff game that Rivera was asked to replace him, and despite no experience at the position, he pitched well. Teammates Claudino Hernández and Emilio Gáez consequently contacted Chico Heron, a scout for the New York Yankees. Two weeks after his pitching debut, Rivera was invited to a Yankees tryout camp run by Heron in Panama City. Raybourn, who had returned to Panama to scout as the Yankees' director of Latin American operations, received a tip about Rivera. Raybourn was surprised to hear he had switched positions but decided to watch him throw. Although Rivera had no formal pitching training, weighed just , and threw only , Raybourn was impressed by his athleticism and smooth, <b>effortless</b> pitching motion. Viewing Rivera as a raw talent, Raybourn signed the amateur free agent to a contract with the Yankees organization on February17, 1990; the contract included a signing bonus of US$2,500 ($ today), according to Major League Baseball (MLB) records.|$|E

25|$|Learning to read is the {{acquisition}} {{and practice of}} {{the skills necessary to}} understand the meaning behind printed words. For a fairly good reader, the skill of reading often feels simple, <b>effortless,</b> and automatic; however, the process of learning to read is complex and builds on cognitive, linguistic, and social skills developed from a very early age.|$|E

25|$|The {{key to the}} {{effectiveness}} of group practice is held to reside in the harmony of minds and hearts of the participants. When a compatible spiritual group is created, it can greatly accelerate the spiritual evolution of its members. Abhinavagupta declares that such a group can enter a state of oneness and universal consciousness without effort. He explains this by the notion of reflection (pratibimba), a process of unification, an <b>effortless</b> overflow of spiritual energy.|$|E
25|$|Velasquez {{possesses}} a four-octave vocal range. Classified as a lyric coloratura soprano, Velasquez {{is famous for}} her <b>effortless</b> and exceptional sustained belting while doing her vocal acrobatics in the key of her highest pitch. She has exhibited her belting and sheer lung power while singing onstage sitting in lotus position, while lying on bed and even while being suspended up on a harness in mid-air. Velasquez credits this from her father's vocal training technique where she is submerged neck-deep in the sea to strengthen her diaphragm and build up her vocal cords and lung power.|$|E
25|$|The Shiloh Shepherd is powerfully {{built and}} {{well-balanced}} {{and should have}} a proud carriage and smooth, <b>effortless</b> gait. The male Shiloh stands 30inches (76cm) or more in height {{with a minimum of}} 28inches (71cm); he weighs 120 to 140pounds (54–65kg) with a minimum of 110pounds (50kg). The female is smaller, standing 28inches (71cm) or more in height with a minimum of 26inches (66cm) and weighing 100 to 120pounds (45–54kg) with a minimum of 80pounds (36kg). With their even proportions, Shilohs should appear longer than they are tall. They are bigger than German Shepherd Dogs.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have focused}} on Li Bai's strong sense of the {{continuity}} of poetic tradition, his glorification of alcoholic beverages (and, indeed, frank celebration of drunkenness), his use of persona, the fantastic extremes {{of some of his}} imagery, his mastery of formal poetic rules– and his ability to combine all of these with a seemingly <b>effortless</b> virtuosity in order to produce inimitable poetry. Other themes in Li's poetry, noted especially in the 20th century, are sympathy for the common folks and antipathy towards needless wars (even when conducted by the emperor himself).|$|E
25|$|Updike is {{a master}} of <b>effortless</b> motion—between third and first person, from the metaphorical density of {{literary}} prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, from the actual to the numinous, from the scary to the comic. For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style of narration, an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson. This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike.|$|E
25|$|On various Internet forums, some gamers have {{expressed}} disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers {{are more apt}} to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways. But unlike the music industry, which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s, the video game industry continues to grow. Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost <b>effortless,</b> while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.|$|E
25|$|Rip {{currents}} are water {{channels that}} flow {{away from the}} shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current {{appears to be an}} area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and <b>effortless</b> way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.|$|E
25|$|Banmi Shofu Ryu, {{like all}} schools, {{originated}} {{from the first}} school of Ikebana. Bessie Yoneko Banmi Fooks, 1st Generation Headmaster and creator of Banmi Shofu Ryu, received her title in 1962 through the <b>effortless</b> and natural forms her Ikebana creations when she resided in Japan. Frequent visits to Kaohsiung Taiwan allowed Fooks to continue her studies and eventually earn her professor’s certificate and authorization {{for the establishment of}} Banmi Shofu Ryu. Fooks began her teachings in Tainan, Taiwan and continued to exhibit and demonstrate her works in several countries around the world for over 50 years. Fooks characteristically used driftwood to connect her floral arrangements with their living spirit. In Banmi Shofu Ryu, driftwood is the essence of the Ikebana creations.|$|E
25|$|Miss Anderson's {{debut as}} Gilda, {{although}} belated, {{could not have}} been more welcome. The Metropolitan is not rich in artists of this caliber. The tall soprano left America a decade ago to build a phenomenal European career, chiefly in the florid works of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. She demonstrated in a Caro nome of exquisite taste, <b>effortless</b> fluidity and pinpoint precision that she is a master of the bel canto style. She is comfortable above high C, but the lower ranges do not suffer in quality or power. The wide leaps of the Caro nome coda were taken effortlessly and squarely on the note. The Met audience does not often hear a trill as thrushlike and as precise as Miss Anderson's, nor a soprano who can soar as grandly over the ensemble in the quartet.|$|E
25|$|In October 2014, Rippon competed at the 2014 CS Finlandia Trophy {{finishing}} {{first in}} the free program and second overall. At the end of October he finished 7th in the free skate and 10th overall at the 2014 Skate Canada International. In November he finished 5th at the 2014 Trophee Eric Bompard after placing third in the free skate. It was a season plagued with equipment issues. Rippon adjusted his blade brand and mount, took on a new trainer to work with his team and met with renewed consistency at U.S. Championships, landing <b>effortless</b> triple axels and once again including a quad lutz in his short and long programs. He {{went on to win}} the free-skate portion of the competition and finished second overall with the silver medal. He was assigned to both the Four Continents team and the Worlds team.|$|E
25|$|Progressive Jargon Aphasia is a fluent or {{receptive}} aphasia {{in which the}} patient's speech is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and <b>effortless</b> with intact syntax and grammar, but the patient has problems with the selection of nouns. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with sounds. As such, patients with jargon aphasia often use neologisms, and may perseverate {{if they try to}} replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, he set up The Pavarotti International Voice Competition for young singers, performing with the winners in 1982 in excerpts of La bohème and L'elisir d'amore. The second competition, in 1986, staged excerpts of La bohème and Un ballo in maschera. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of his career, he brought the winners of the competition to Italy for gala performances of La bohème in Modena and Genoa, and then to China where they staged performances of La bohème in Beijing (Peking). To conclude the visit, Pavarotti performed the inaugural concert in the Great Hall of the People before 10,000 people, receiving a standing ovation for nine <b>effortless</b> high Cs. The third competition in 1989 again staged performances of L'elisir d'amore and Un ballo in maschera. The winners of the fifth competition accompanied Pavarotti in performances in Philadelphia in 1997.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Sutherland {{was invited}} to sing Lucia di Lammermoor at the Royal Opera House in a {{production}} conducted by Tullio Serafin and staged by Franco Zeffirelli. The role of Edgardo was sung by her fellow Australian Kenneth Neate, who had replaced the scheduled tenor at short notice. It was a breakthrough for Sutherland's career, and, upon {{the completion of the}} famous Mad Scene, she had become a star. In 1960, she recorded the album The Art of the Prima Donna, which remains today one of the most recommended opera albums ever recorded: the double LP set won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance – Vocal Soloist in 1962. The album, a collection consisting mainly of coloratura arias, displays her seemingly <b>effortless</b> coloratura ability, high notes and opulent tones, as well as her exemplary trill. The album was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Melba made {{numerous}} gramophone (phonograph) {{records of}} her voice in England and America between 1904 (when she was already in her 40s) and 1926 for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company and the Victor Talking Machine Company. Most of these recordings, consisting of operatic arias, duets and ensemble pieces and songs, have been re-released on CD. The poor audio fidelity of the Melba recordings reflects {{the limitations of the}} early days of commercial sound recording. Melba's acoustical recordings (especially those made after her initial 1904 session) fail to capture vital overtones to the voice, leaving it without the body and warmth it possessed– albeit to a limited degree– in life. Despite this, they still reveal Melba to have had an almost seamlessly pure lyric soprano voice with <b>effortless</b> coloratura, a smooth legato and accurate intonation. Melba had perfect pitch; the critic Michael Aspinall says of her complete London recordings issued on LP, that there are only two lapses from pitch in the entire set. Like Patti, and unlike the more vibrant-voiced Tetrazzini, Melba's exceptional purity of tone {{was probably one of the}} principal reasons why British audiences, with their strong choral and sacred music traditions, idolised her.|$|E
