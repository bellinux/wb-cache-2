The duvet itself fits into a specially made cover, usually of cotton or a cotton-polyester blend.

50|$|Top {{sheets are}} {{standard}} in the U.S., but much of Europe prefers to use <b>duvet</b> <b>covers.</b> A duvet cover consists of two rectangles sewn together on all but one side to create a sleeve for the duvet, which can be taken off and washed. When no other blankets are lain atop the covered duvet, it can provide several advantages over a top sheet. First, respecting sanitation, with a top sheet the bed occupant could accidentally in the night remove the barrier {{between himself and the}} duvet (which is less washable); with a duvet cover this is impossible. Second, for households with children, a bed with a covered duvet is easier to make: the child need only tug the corners of the duvet back towards the corners of the bed. Tucking in a top sheet before arranging the duvet is an extra step. Third, switching a duvet cover is a cheaper way to change color schemes than buying a new comforter.|$|E

40|$|Whilst the {{benefits}} of the supine sleeping position for infants are now clear, there is no consensus on where the infant should sleep in relation to the parents. The risks associated with different sleeping environments and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been investigated. Methods A three year case-control study conducted in 5 of 14 Health Regions in England (population ~ 17 million, 500, 000 livebirths). Parental interviews were conducted for each infant who died and for four controls matched for age and time of sleep. Ascertainment was over 90 % [1][2]. This analysis includes 325 SIDS and 1300 matched controls. Results In the multivariate analysis infants who bed-shared and were then put back in their own cot were not at an increased risk (OR= 0. 67 [95 %CI: 0. 22 - 2. 00]). There was an increased risk associated with those who bed-shared for the whole sleep or were taken to and found in the parental bed (OR= 9. 78 [95 %CI: 4. 02 - 23. 83]), infants who slept in a separate room from their parents (OR= 10. 49 [95 %CI: 4. 26 - 25. 81]) and infants who shared a sofa (OR= 48. 99 [95 %CI: 5. 04 - 475. 60]). The risk associated with being found in the parental bed was not significant for older infants (> 14 weeks) or for infants of nonsmoking parents. Certain risk factors specifically associated with the cot environment (e. g. prone position, headcovering) served to increase the significance associated with bed-sharing. In a moren relation to the parents. The risksassociated with different sleepingenvironments and sudden infant deathsyndrome (SIDS) has been investigated. restricted a priori model controlling for recent maternal alcohol consumption (> 2 units), <b>duvet</b> <b>covers</b> (> 4 togs), parental tiredness (infant slept = 4 hours for longest sleep in previous 24 hours) and overcrowded housing conditions (> 2 people per room of the house), bed-sharing became nonsignificant. Conclusions There are certain circumstances when bed-sharing should be avoided, particularly relevant for infants less than 4 months old. Sofa-sharing with infants should always be avoided. There is no vidence that bed-sharing is hazardous for infants of non-smoking parents...|$|E

5000|$|A duvet ( [...] , , or {{from the}} French duvet [...] "down") {{is a type of}} bedding {{consisting}} of a soft flat bag filled with down, feathers, wool, silk or a synthetic alternative, and typically protected with a removable cover, analogous to a pillow and pillow case. Sleepers often use a duvet without a top bed sheet, as the <b>duvet</b> <b>cover</b> can readily be removed and laundered as often as the bottom sheet. Duvets originated in rural Europe and were filled with the down feathers of ducks.
