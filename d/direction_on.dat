5|$|A {{storm of}} {{potentially}} Cape Verde origin was {{detected in the}} Virgin Islands at 1800UTC on August5. Initially moving westward, the tropical storm gradually gained in intensity before making a sharp curve towards the north on August8. The storm continued in a northerly motion before a second curvature brought it in a generally westward <b>direction</b> <b>on</b> August9. Shortly after, the tropical storm reached hurricane intensity as a modern-day Category1hurricane. The hurricane eventually made landfall at peak intensity on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina at 2030UTC on September21. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), equivalent to a modern-day Category2hurricane. Once inland, the tropical cyclone gradually weakened, and recurved northeastward before dissipating over the Appalachian Mountains on August14.|$|E

5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular <b>direction</b> <b>on</b> a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E
5|$|Following Mary's childless death, her {{half-sister}} Elizabeth {{inherited the}} throne. One {{of the most}} important concerns during Elizabeth's early reign was religion. Elizabeth could not be Roman Catholic, as that church considered her illegitimate. At the same time, she had observed the turmoil brought about by Edward's introduction of radical Protestant reforms. Communion with the Roman Catholic Church was again severed by Elizabeth. She relied primarily on her chief advisors, Sir William Cecil, as her Secretary of State, and Sir Nicholas Bacon, as the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, for <b>direction</b> <b>on</b> the matter. Chiefly she supported her father's idea of reforming the church but made some minor adjustments. In this way, Elizabeth and her advisors aimed at a church that included most opinions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the interim}} period, work went into {{expanding}} the six lane freeway through Toronto and Markham. In early 1998, the MTO {{announced plans for}} two contracts to widen Highway404 south of Highway7. The first contract converted the grass median into an additional lane in each direction with a central barrier between them. High-mast lighting was also installed, replacing the unique luminaires used on the freeway. The second contract resulted in an additional lane in each <b>direction</b> <b>on</b> the outside the existing freeway south of Steeles Avenue, making it ten lanes wide. The proposal to eventually convert the inner lanes into HOV lanes was announced at the same time.|$|E

In October the band went to the studio to record some demos. The band spent the first week of April recording the album and on 8 April, they released a short video with information about the recording process. It announced that Mark 'Flood' Ellis would be the producer for the album. Earlier on in the year, the sound of the album was said to have a very electric feel; the band often using the Terminator theme song as a reference.|$|E

On 19 July, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a document effectively banning the practice of Falun Gong.

In October the Duke of Wellington's special train was put into use as a dedicated first-class train, making four journeys each day between Liverpool and Manchester in each <b>direction.</b> <b>On</b> 4 December 1830 goods operations on the L began, with Planet hauling 75 tons of freight from Liverpool to Manchester.

At George Stephenson's insistence new locomotives bought by the L were fitted with handbrakes from 1831.|$|E
