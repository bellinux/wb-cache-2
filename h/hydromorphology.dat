This investigation was carried out in the Adour-Garonne basin. Several key findings emerged from the use of a new modeling procedure called “Random Forests”. Firstly, we established a typology of sites showing an upstream/downstream gradient structured by geographical descriptors and catchment hydromorphological features. Secondly, we found that the relationships between <b>hydromorphology</b> and the different spatial scales of land cover responded to a longitudinal gradient. Upstream, no noticeable difference was observed whatever the land cover pattern considered, whereas downstream, larger scales were strongly related to the <b>hydromorphology.</b> Thirdly, a specific land cover effect on each hydromorphological type was seen. Along the gradient, the contribution of the land cover variables structuring the hydromorphological types decreased and become homogeneous. Fourthly, stronger correlations were established with individual hydromorphological variables using the larger scales of land cover. This paper contributes {{to a better understanding of}} landscape ecology and fits well with the European Water Framework Directive that requires long-term sustainable management. In the context of natural conditions, we advise that the catchment scale should be given high priority when connected with land cover/uses; local and riparian environments being more valuable and complementary in the case of impacted sites...|$|E
40|$|Following a {{long history}} of human {{pressures}} on riverine ecosystems, the European Water Framework Directive (WFD, Directive 2000 / 60 /EC) came into force in 2000 and initiated a new period of river management in Europe. The directive aims at improving the ecological and chemical status of rivers in order to achieve the ‘good status’ of all surface waters until the year 2027. In Europe, degraded <b>hydromorphology</b> has been highlighted as a central impact to the ecological status of the rivers. For instance, in countries such as Germany, the <b>hydromorphology</b> of almost all river sections is affected to an extent that they fail to meet the WFD goals. In response, river <b>hydromorphology</b> is nowadays being restored at an increasing rate. Restoration of river <b>hydromorphology</b> has the potential to affect not only structural ecosystem features, including species composition and diversity, but also functional aspects, such as key ecosystem processes and trophic transfers of energy and nutrients. Despite this, the most-widely used parameters for assessing {{the success or failure of}} restoration projects are almost exclusively based on changes in community composition of different biological groups (e. g., fish, benthic invertebrates, and macrophytes). Functional metrics, even though increasingly recognized as a valuable addition to classical assessments, are rarely used to study restoration effects. Consequently, the outcomes of river restoration for key ecosystem processes (e. g., river metabolism) and trophic relationships (e. g., trophic structure of benthic invertebrate communities and trophic connectivity between river and land) remain poorly understood. Against this background, the present thesis focused on the following objectives: (i) The application of stable isotope analysis (δ 13 C, δ 15 N) together with quantitative community metrics to characterize changes in the trophic structure of benthic invertebrate communities following restoration. (ii) The characterization of the isotopic composition (δ 13 C, δ 15 N) of consumers in aquatic, riparian, and terrestrial habitats to assess restoration effects on the trophic connectivity between river and land.

Those are related {{to a system of}} water supply and consumptive use for drinking water. Variation of the groundwater characteristic depends on variation of morphology. Therefore, it is needed to delineate <b>hydromorphology</b> units of the regions as a base on groundwater resources management, especially for drinking water. The aims of the research are: (1) to study of the characteristic and distribution of unconfined groundwater variations base on landform units, (2) to study the factors that affect such variations, and (3) to establish the <b>hydromorphology</b> units of the regions for groundwater resources management, especially for drinking water. The method used in this research is landform approach and field survey. The sampling method is stratified sampling, based on landform as the analysis approach. Result of the research shows that there are some variations of groundwater characteristic at each landform. Landforms which have good groundwater characteristic are <b>Hydromorphology</b> Unit of Fluvio Volcanic Plain of Young Merapi (except Bayat region) and <b>Hydromorphology</b> Unit of Volcanic Foot Plain of Young Merapi. At those units, there are good quality of groundwater, bicarbonate water (hydrochemical type I), having low electric conductivity, shallow of water table, low in fluctuation, and middle to fast class in aquifer permeability. Those units are the most potential unconfined groundwater resources management for drinking water. The units which have poor groundwater characteristic are Hidromorphology Unit in Bayat Region, including Undulating Alluvial Plain, Fluvio Volcanic Plain of Young Merapi, and Swamp Alluvial Plain. Generally, the groundwater quality is medium to poor, the hydrochemical type is Va (initiation process of connate water) and type III (evaporate water), shallow up to medium of water table, and low to middle class of aquifer permeability.

40|$|River hydromorphological {{characterization}} is {{an important}} requirement for modern river management. The process-based river characterizations which are well established in fluvial geomorphology are location-specific and highly demanding in terms of resource and expertise, and their routine application for regional or national river characterizations is not feasible at the present. Reviewing current understanding of river geomorphic processes and making use of novel datasets, such as DEM, and tools, such as GIS, this work tests the feasibility of providing characterizations of <b>hydromorphology</b> that require moderate resources and are potentially applicable at regional or national scale. A framework to characterize river <b>hydromorphology</b> from specific map derived geomorphic controls (namely channel gradient, bankfull flow, specific stream power, Strhaler stream order and degree of channel confinement) is successfully developed. These controls are shown {{to be important in}} the characterization of channel types, to be consistently inter- connected in a hierarchical framework, and to affect frequency and typologies of channel forms. Stream power emerges as a dominant driver of sediment transport and floodplain formation and as an important indicator for characterizing channel sensitivity to erosion and deposition. The proposed characterization of <b>hydromorphology</b> uses automatic procedures of GIS and statistical analysis and demonstrates that these are promising for regional applications. Our understanding of the links between <b>hydromorphology</b> and ecology are also limited. This thesis presents an application of structural equation modelling (SEM) to explore the ecology of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in riverine ecosystems using national-scale biological, water quality and physical habitat data. The statistical model identifies a nurnber of links between the degree of organic pollution, alkalinity, physical habitat conditions, and the distribution of benthic macro invertebrates. SEM develops a confirmatory approach that it requires a-priori, explicit III [...] -= formulations of cause-effect relationships at the model conceptualisation stage.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. With the formal adoption of the Water Framework Directive in 2000, into European legislation it committed all member states {{to ensure that all}} inland waterbodies should reach good ecological status by 2015. As a result examination of the influence of <b>hydromorphology</b> on the ecological health of riverine ecosystems has become an increasingly important priority for statutory monitoring agencies such as the Environment Agency of England and Wales and equivalents {{in other parts of the}} UK. It is anticipated that by increasing our understanding of the role that hydromorphological processes play in shaping river habitats and the ecosystems that they support, river management strategies can be developed that will help lead to waterbodies achieving good ecological status. In this thesis, the influence of river <b>hydromorphology</b> and instream channel management activities on instream macroinvertebrate communities is explored. A two-scale approach was used at a regional macro-scale and local / catchment micro-scale. The macro-scale study examines the ecological, hydrological and geomorphological data for 88 river reaches located within the Environment Agency, Anglian Central and Anglian Northern regions, over a twenty year period (1986 - 2005). At the micro-scale two sub-catchments were selected, the River Bain and River Lymn, both located in Lincolnshire, England for detailed investigation. The micro-scale study was undertaken using ecological, hydrological and geomorphological data collected over three successive seasons (Autumn 2008, Spring 2009 and Summer 2009) enabling the seasonal variations and the influence of both stream size and habitat biotope on macroinvertebrate community composition and structure to be explored. The hydromorphological characteristics and condition of the rivers were quantified using ecologically relevant hydrological indices, calculated from flow discharge paired with geomorphological indices from River Habitat Survey data. The response of the instream macroinvertebrate communities was examined using a range of ecological indices including the Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE). The results of the macro-scale investigation demonstrate that the macroinvertebrate community is directly influenced by instream <b>hydromorphology</b> and the level of anthropogenic modification. The micro-scale study highlights important differences in macroinvertebrate communities associated with instream habitat / biotope composition. The quantification of river <b>hydromorphology,</b> with the use of ecologically relevant hydrological indices and geomorphological indices, derived from River Habitat Survey data, is discussed with regards its ability to help explain the structure and composition of macroinvertebrate communities within highly managed /regulated riverine ecosystems.

40|$|A space-for-time {{substitution}} approach {{was used to}} evaluate potential effects of climate change on stream nutrient uptake by examining the relationship between stream environmental parameters and carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake along an altitudinal gradient. The study was carried out in 14 streams located in the Central Pyrenees (NE Spain) draining calcareous catchments that cover an altitudinal range of 700 ― 2, 100 ma. s. l. In these streams, uptake of inorganic (soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), ammonium and nitrate) and organic (acetate and glycine) nutrients was estimated. Additionally, several physical, chemical and biological parameters were measured. Results showed higher uptake for both SRP, a potentially limiting nutrient in these streams, and glycine, a labile source of dissolved organic N, than {{for the rest of the}} nutrients. Uptake of SRP, nitrate, glycine and acetate varied along stream environmental gradients associated with changes in stream <b>hydromorphology,</b> SRP availability and epilithic biomass. However, these gradients did not vary with altitude.

Several key findings have emerged from this research. Firstly, the hydromorphological characteristics of rivers between different geographical regions of Europe were found to vary considerably with rivers in each region possessing distinctive hydromorphological characteristics. Secondly, the hydromorphological attributes that most strongly influence two existing hydromorphological indices (the Habitat Quality Assessment and the Habitat Modification Score) were identified and attention {{was drawn to the}} accurate definition and recording of these attributes in field surveys and training courses. Thirdly, links between hydromorphological characteristics and macroinvertebrate quality indices were investigated. Two types of bank modification (resectioning and reinforcement) were significantly correlated with two biotic indices (EPT taxa and MTS), while channel modifications were negatively correlated with ASPT. While biotic indices were often strongly correlated with Habitat Quality Assessment they were less strongly related to Habitat Modification Score suggesting that physical habitat diversity may be more important in determining macroinvertebrate community structure than morphological alteration.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. It is widely recognized that anthropogenic activities have resulted in significant changes to the ecology and <b>hydromorphology</b> of riverine ecosystems globally. Across much of lowland England a number of riverine habitats and {{the flora and fauna}} inhabiting them, have been lost or disadvantaged by historic channel modifications. Many of the most significant modifications took place in the decades following World War II, in a drive to increase food security through improved land drainage and associated flood management. A better understanding of the geomorphological, hydrological and biodiversity elements that have been compromised or lost is required in order to characterise the benefits of planned measures to restore and reinstate channel form and function for EU WFD, Habitats Directive and other conservation designations (e. g. SSSI condition assessments). To generate this understanding in an environment where natural processes have been impacted over large spatial scales, an innovative palaeoecological approach is employed in this thesis that provides a window on historic riverine ecology and habitat conditions so that the contemporary channel and community inhabiting it can be gauged prior to the implementation of river restoration programmes. The analysis of historic archival material (maps, photographs, local authority and management records), and the detailed investigation of sedimentary records and sub-fossil insect remains (Trichoptera, Coleoptera and Gastropoda) associated with in-channel bars, weirs, bridges and palaeochannels is used in this thesis in order to achieve this. These records will provide data regarding changes to the aquatic macroinvertebrate community and instream <b>hydromorphology</b> within specific reaches/biotopes/habitats subjected to historical physical modification. The historic data (documents and palaeoenvironmental data) is analysed in parallel with contemporary data on instream habitats and faunal community composition to define benchmark conditions on three Site of Special Scientific Interest rivers. This approach enables a comparison between past and present channel <b>hydromorphology</b> and the instream faunal communities. The characterisation of benchmarks provides a baseline for future conservation and restoration policies within riverine ecosystems {{that can be used to}} help define pre-impacted or reference conditions.

Biology, Chemistry, Ecotoxicology, Physico-chemistry and <b>Hydromorphology.</b> The whole IRA methodology has been implemented as a specific module into a freeware GIS (Geographic Information System) -based Decision Support System, named MODELKEY DSS. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the four supporting LoE (i. e. Chemistry, Ecotoxicology, Physico-chemistry and <b>Hydromorphology),</b> and includes a procedure for a comparison of each indicator with proper thresholds and a subsequent integration process to combine the obtained output with the LoE Biology results in order to provide a single score expressing the Ecological Status classification. The approach supports the identification of the most prominent stressors, which are responsible for the observed alterations in the river basin under investigation. The results provided by the preliminary testing of the IRA methodology through application of the MODELKEY DSS to the Llobregat case study are finally reported and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Colour aerial {{photography}} and multi-spectral imagery acquired from airborne platforms for the River Tummel, Scotland, {{was used in}} conjunction with field survey to assess the feasibility of monitoring <b>hydromorphology</b> and human alteration within the river corridor. The study was undertaken to investigate the possibility of remotely sensing the physical status of a nation’s rivers at the national scale to comply with the requirement of the European Water Framework Directive. Visual assessment and unsupervised and supervised automated classifications of the imagery were undertaken and compared with field survey data. In the absence of overhanging vegetation canopies most features above the water line of interest were visible on the imagery. Below the water line, morphology and substrate composition together with bank materials on vertically cut banks are less easily detected. The overall accuracy of automated classification procedures, compared to field survey, was 60 % for the colour aerial {{photography and}} 68 % for the multi-spectral imagery. Supervised classification was superior to unsupervised classification procedures. Sun glint on water surfaces and shadows caused by high banks, trees and buildings were observed as the cause of most misclassification of features. Overall, the study demonstrates that remotely sensed digital imagery has the potential to allow panoptic mapping of river <b>hydromorphology</b> and human impacts. The possibilities and constraints, in light of the findings of this study, are discussed. In the context of new legislation which requires environmental protection agencies to have robust tools for monitoring the physical status, as part of meeting the objective of good ecological status, of rivers across an entire nation, remote sensing appears t...|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing {{techniques}} {{could enable}} remarkable advances in characterizing rivers <b>hydromorphology</b> by providing spatially and temporally explicit information. Remote mapping of <b>hydromorphology</b> {{can play a}} decisive role {{in a wide range}} of river science and management applications including habitat modeling and river restoration. High resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) has recently emerged as potentially powerful means of mapping riverine environments. This research aims to develop advanced methodologies for processing HRSI to map and quantify a set of key hydromorphological attributes including: (1) river boundaries, (2) bathymetry and (3) riverbed types and compositions. Boundary pixels of rivers are subject to spectral mixture that limits the accuracy of river areas extraction using conventional hard classifiers. To address this problem, unmixing and super resolution mapping (SRM) are focused as two steps, respectively, for estimation and then spatial allocation of water fractions within the mixed pixels. Optimal band analysis for NDWI (OBA-NDWI) is proposed to identify the pair of bands for which the NDWI values yield the highest correlation with water fractions. The OBA-NDWI then incorporates the optimal NDWI as a predictor of water fractions through a regression model. Water fractions obtained from the OBA-NDWI method are benchmarked against the results of simplex projection unmixing (SPU) algorithm. The pixel swapping (PS) and interpolation-based algorithms are applied on water fractions for SRM. In addition, a simple modified binary PS (MBPS) algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational time of the original PS method. Water fractions obtained from the proposed OBA-NDWI method are demonstrated to be in good agreement with those of SPU algorithm (R 2 = 90...|$|E
40|$|The work {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} impact of small hydrotechnical structures on channel <b>hydromorphology</b> {{as a measure of}} river restoration. The experiment was set up in Flinta River in Polish lowland where extensive hydromorphological survey was competed. At the first stage of restoration project containers filled with plant clumps working as sediment traps (plant basket hydraulic structures – PBHS) were introduced. Those structures were relatively small but at the same time, large enough to change the river flow efficiently – working like low crested weirs. Two year monitoring program provided information about the impact of introducing such structures on river morphology and explained the PBHS impact on flow pattern of the river...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of several indices of benthic functioning, {{based on the}} traits of estuarine macroinvertebrates, was tested in the lower Mondego estuary (Portugal), whose two arms exhibit different disturbance levels related to <b>hydromorphology.</b> The results showed that some indices responded clearly {{to this type of}} disturbance and others not so well. We argue that the community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) in combination with the newly developed SR-FRED index provided the best overall picture of how the benthic communities might have been affected by hydromorphological disturbance. This study also showed that certain indices should be used with caution when dealing with communities with few and dominant species, such as in estuarine environments. JRC.

40|$|Many {{approaches}} to the classification of peat-forming (mire) systems have been devised over the years, {{each with its own}} particular focus. The present review restricts itself to those classification systems which focus on peatlands as ecosystems. Such systems are in broad agreement that there is a significant ecological difference between mires which are waterlogged by groundwater or accumulated surface water, broadly known as ‘fens’, and mires which are waterlogged only through direct precipitation, broadly termed ‘bogs’. Within these broad concepts, however, mires have been variously classified according to their vegetation, their chemistry, their source of water and their <b>hydromorphology.</b> This last system of classification is widely employed, and its hierarchical, or ‘Tope’, approach offers the potential to incorporate other classification systems at various levels within the hierarchy...|$|E
30|$|Results and {{discussion}} During the 1920 s, major {{parts of the}} upper Danube River were corrected, thus causing {{dramatic changes in the}} <b>hydromorphology</b> of the river. The macrozoobenthos, which represents an important source of nutrition for several fish species, depends on the morphological conditions of a river; recent investigations, however, could not show any dramatic changes in macrozoobenthos composition. Earlier investigations of the Danube River primarily focused on water quality, which has, indeed, been continuously improved by extensive modernization of wastewater treatment plants. Contamination by priority organic pollutants in sediments was not given any attention until the mid 1990 s, when a clear decline of, e.[*]g., PAH concentrations were documented. However, results of more recent analyses showed very high PAH concentrations in two sediment samples (Schwarzach Σ 16  PAHs =  26  mg/kg; Öpfingen Σ 16  PAHs =  5  mg/kg).|$|E
40|$|High spatial {{resolution}} hyper-spectral imagery (CASI) and {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) imagery acquired for the tidal River Carron and Forth estuary, Scotland, {{were used in}} conjunction with field surveys to assess the feasibility of monitoring <b>hydromorphology</b> and human alterations with satellite and airborne remote sensing data. The study was undertaken {{in the context of the}} European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) that requires member states to monitor hydromorphological elements as a component of the ecological status of rivers, estuaries and shorelines. Visual assessment and automated classifications of the imagery were compared with field survey data for an estuarine reach comprising saline waters, mudflats, a tidal reach of a tributary river and an urban/ industrialised shoreline. The morphology of the estuary and inflowing tidal waters together with most artificial features of interest could be clearly seen in the CASI imagery at 1 m {{spatial resolution}}. Supervised classification of the imagery produced an overall accuracy value of 72 %. Downgrading the imagery to simulate the spatial resolution of 4 m IKONOS satellite data surprisingly improved the accuracy to 74 %. Simulation of 10 m SPOT imagery resulted in an image where many artificial features of interest such as roads, pipelines and jetties were rendered invisible. Adding LiDAR data as an additional data set aided manual and automated identification of features and visualisation of the <b>hydromorphology</b> of the rivers and estuaries in the study area. Shadows cast from tall objects were a feature of the winter imagery and reduced automated classification accuracy. Overall, the study demonstrates that high spatial resolution remotely sensed digital imagery has the potential to be a useful tool for panoptic mapping of the geomorphology and human impact on tidal rivers and estuaries. In the context of the WFD, remote sensing provides a potential way forward for monitoring the physical status of rivers and estuaries at the national scale. The possibilities and constraints, in light of the findings of this study, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{characterisation}} of {{the hydraulic}} environment {{is a key}} step in describing <b>hydromorphology</b> at an ecologically relevant scale which has relevance to several aspects of river management, including monitoring river health, designing environmental flows and evaluating river rehabilitation measures. However, current hydraulic habitat quantification methods oversimplify the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic environment and do not explain or interpret the spatial arrangement of different habitat units sufficiently or define the dynamics of these shifting patterns. This research applied a novel numerical classification method and a landscape ecology framework to quantify the composition and configuration hydraulic patches in three UK lowland river reaches at five different flows. Five spatially coherent hydraulic patches, defined by the joint distribution of depth-velocity, were optimally delineated from hydraulic point data at each reach using the Gustafson-Kessel fuzzy clustering algorithm. Transitional zones between hydraulic patches occupied between 18 - 30...|$|E
