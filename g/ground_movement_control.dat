5000|$|Ground control (sometimes {{known as}} <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> <b>control)</b> is {{responsible}} for the airport [...] "movement" [...] areas, as well as areas not released to the airlines or other users. This generally includes all taxiways, inactive runways, holding areas, and some transitional aprons or intersections where aircraft arrive, having vacated the runway or departure gate. Exact areas and control responsibilities are clearly defined in local documents and agreements at each airport. Any aircraft, vehicle, or person walking or working in these areas is required to have clearance from ground control. This is normally done via VHF/UHF radio, but there may be special cases where other procedures are used. Aircraft or vehicles without radios must respond to ATC instructions via aviation light signals or else be led by vehicles with radios. People working on the airport surface normally have a communications link through which they can communicate with ground control, commonly either by handheld radio or even cell phone. Ground control is vital to the smooth operation of the airport, because this position impacts the sequencing of departure aircraft, affecting the safety and efficiency of the airport's operation.|$|E

Numerical and physical models of excavation-induced building damage were used to vary parameters and develop procedures for assessing distortion and damage. Examples of building distortion and damage are presented for brick bearing wall structures of the 1800 ’s and early 1900 ’s, as well as later frame structures, that illustrate how geometry, era of construction, stiffness, and condition influence building response to <b>ground</b> <b>movement...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{congested}} {{urban areas}} twin-tunnelling projects have an associated requirement for accurate predictions of any <b>ground</b> <b>movements</b> that may arise {{in order to}} minimize possible damage to existing structures. Much previous research has been carried out concerning the <b>ground</b> <b>movements</b> around single tunnels in greenfield conditions and this, along with field observations, forms the basis of most <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> predictions. For twin-tunnel projects the prediction of overall <b>ground</b> <b>movements</b> is often based upon superposition of two equal settlement troughs.

40|$|The Ventnor Undercliff, {{located on}} the south coast of the Isle of Wight, is an ancient {{landslide}} complex of marginal stability that is prone to <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> and occasional landslide events. The impact of <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> on property and services in the town has been significant in the past. Since 1995, the local authority has made a significant investment in continuous monitoring and analysis of weather and <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> data at key sites amongst other landslide management initiatives. These data reveal strong relationships between antecedent rainfall, groundwater and <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> rates, confirming that prolonged periods of heavy winter rainfall and excess groundwater levels are a fundamental control on landslide behaviour. Climate change projections over the next 100 years point to significant increases in sea level and winter rainfall which are expected to result in accelerated <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> rates and more frequent landslide events in the Undercliff. There are concerns that hitherto marginally stable areas of the Undercliff may become unstable due to reactivation of <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> and the occurrence of new landslides. In areas previously affected by <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> or landslides, the frequency and rate of <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> and landsliding is expected to increase. The paper presents historical and new data to demonstrate the relationships between rainfall and <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> and uses these to predict the likely impacts of climate change on future landslide behaviour. The paper concludes that climate change poses a very real threat and significant challenge to the future management and mitigation of the ground instability risks in the Ventnor Undercliff, which may be echoed for other similarly marginally stable ancient landslides in the UK...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{air traffic}} tends to {{increase}} {{and for many}} airports {{it is no longer}} an op-tion to expand terminals and runways, so airports are trying to maximize their op-erational efficiency. Many airports already operate near their maximal capacity. Peak hours imply operational bottlenecks and cause chained delays across flights impacting passengers, airlines and airports. Therefore {{there is a need for}} the opti-mization of the <b>ground</b> <b>movements</b> at the airports. The <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> prob-lem consists of routing the departing planes from the gate to the runway for take-off, and the arriving planes from the runway to the gate, and to schedule their movements. The main goal is to minimize the time spent by the planes during their <b>ground</b> <b>movements</b> while respecting all the rules established by the Ad-vanced Surface <b>Movement,</b> Guidance and <b>Control</b> Systems of the International Civil Aviation. Each aircraft event (arrival or departing authorization) generates a new environment and therefore a new instance of the <b>Ground</b> <b>Movement</b> Prob-lem.

30|$|In {{our present}} research, a GIS based {{computational}} methodology is developed for calculating {{the distribution of}} <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> and deformation at arbitrary surface points (Djamaluddin et al. 2012). The GIS based numerical simulation is validated by two study cases. First is the prediction of 21 -year of ground subsidence due to complex underground mining geometry in Japan. Second is the assessment of dynamic <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> due to underground mining sequence in China. The tight coupling model, the component object model (COM) using GIS, is used to develop a GIS based tool for <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> prediction system. Therefore in this paper, first, the fundamental calculation of <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> over time using the Knothe time model and stochastic prediction model is briefly introduced. Second, a GIS-based prediction methodology for four-dimensional analysis is described. Third, two case studies are given for the validations the GIS-based computational model. Using GIS COM protocol, a computational implementation of the developed tool is discussed for prediction of 4 D ground subsidence from underground mining sequences. Finally, the computational system software of the developed tool within GIS is presented.|$|R

This article describes a method to generate a replacement-prioritisation map for underground drinking water pipe networks using <b>ground</b> <b>movement</b> data.
