5|$|Hammer {{pointed out}} that Edison {{was not the first}} to make an {{electric}} light bulb. He claims instead that Edison made the first commercial electric light bulb that was successful. The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and burned out quickly, making them not practical for use to the general public. Edison first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed bamboo fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected {{at the same time to}} a circuit. Others used filaments of low resistance ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This low resistance not only overloaded the electrical power system, but the wire filaments burned out quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive â€“ not conducive to a commercial market.|$|E
25|$|The E-34 had a {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage formed from steel tubing with <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> bracing. Its cockpits were open. The undercarriage used {{a pair of}} internally sprung mainwheels with balloon tyres and a tailskid. A split axle was mounted on a short V-strut below the fuselage. On the prototype, the undercarriage main legs were short, mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and assisted by short forward struts. The second prototype and production aircraft had longer legs fixed to the upper longerons. The prototype and production series aircraft were powered, as {{the rules of the}} competition required, by a 105hp (78kW) Walter Junior four-cylinder inverted inline engine, although the second prototype was fitted with the more powerful 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major of the same configuration.|$|E

[...] The Lympne aircraft were aimed at the private owner, for whom transport and storage might be an important issue, so the Gannet's wings were hinged at the rear spar so they could be folded back along the fuselage. [...] Both wing centre section trailing edges folded to permit the wing-folding; the upper section was also folded up to aid access to the cockpit.

2500|$|The wing was tapered in {{planform}} and {{was built}} around two spars, {{though there were}} two variants of the internal wing structure. [...] The first three aircraft, type L20 A1, had wings stiffened against torsion by <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> bracing but later aircraft, type L20 B1, used a torsion box formed by plywood skin ahead of the rear spar. [...] Like the later version of the L15, the L20 used a combination of conventional ailerons and unusual wingtip flaps, rotating about an axis well ahead of mid-chord. [...] The ailerons were directly controlled from the cockpit as normal and the tip flaps were linked to them with external rods and cranks. [...] On early examples these flaps were roughly square, with a side less than a half of the chord at the tip, but at some later time they were reshaped to produce wing curved tips. The wings could be detached at the root in about five minutes, reducing {{the width of the}} L20 to [...] for road transport on a trailer pulled by a car.|$|E
2500|$|The L21 had a {{parasol wing}} {{constructed}} in three pieces around two wooden spars. [...] The outer panels were tapered, with sweep only on their trailing edges. [...] On its first flight and tests the centre panel was also tapered {{and the overall}} span was [...] but these early flights revealed an instability around the longitudinal axis. [...] This was cured by extending the centre section span, making it just under half the new overall span of [...] and giving it a rectangular plan. The wing was plywood covered from the forward spar to the leading edge, forming a torsion resisting box, and had <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> bracing. [...] An unusual feature that the L21 shared with the L20 and the earlier L15 was the supplementation of conventional ailerons with short chord tip flaps, each with an area of , rotating on axes toward {{the leading edge of}} the wing and connected to the ailerons by rods and cranks. [...] Both before and after the wing extension lift struts ran from the lower fuselage longerons to the end of the centre section, taking them well outside the engines on the final version. [...] The L21's engines were wing mounted just outside the cabane struts, each cylinder with a tall, ram's horn exhaust discharging over the wing. [...] They were fed from a tank in the central part of the wing.|$|E

50|$|Balloon lights (also called {{lighting}} balloons) are {{a specialized}} type of luminaire used primarily for lighting in {{the motion picture}} industry, night highway construction, incident management, and public security applications such as police checkpoints. These luminaires typically consist {{of one or more}} high-intensity lamps surrounded by a translucent fabric balloon. The balloon acts as a diffuser to soften and disperse the light. The upper portion of the balloon sometimes has a reflective inner coating to direct more of the light downward. Some commercial products use a blower to expand the balloon, while others have an umbrella-like <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> frame. The device is essentially an industrial version of a Japanese paper lantern.|$|E

The outer shell of the grenade is aluminum, containing 43 grams of TNT and dinitronaphthalene with an <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> wrapped around it that turns into shrapnel {{at the time of}} the explosion.

50|$|For VHF and UHF operation, {{one option}} is to mount a small yagi antenna to a pole 1-2 m (3-6 ft) long and haul this to the {{masthead}} using a flag halyard. If the halyard is correctly knotted to the middle {{and bottom of the}} pole, it is easy enough to make the antenna project above the clutter at the masthead into clear air. The problem is in rotating it - it usually needs to be lowered and re-raised to alter the direction of its beam. For the safety of masthead fittings and lights it is better if these yagis are light in weight and made largely of, for example, plastic tubes supporting <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> conductors. Operating in this way is best reserved for when in harbour or at anchor, to avoid interfering with the operation of the boat. Repeated loss of signal due to rolling and pitching would make it impractical for useful communication at sea anyway.|$|E

50|$|The Goring was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{staggered}} wings of unequal span and slight sweep. They were based on spruce spars with <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> bracing. The lower wing was angled downwards briefly as it left the fuselage, enabling a shorter-than-usual undercarriage. Short struts ran from the wing joint of this centre section to mid-fuselage. The fuselage was also a wooden structure of rectangular cross-section formed by ash longerons. Wings and fuselage were fabric covered. The pilot sat below the upper wing trailing edge with a cutout for visibility. The gunner sat behind in a second open cockpit fitted with a Scarff ring for a Vickers machine gun. The rear cockpit also allowed the gunner to assume a prone position for bombing. The tailplane was strut braced and the fin was low with a broad chord. Both rudder and elevators had horn balances which projected beyond the fixed surfaces. The standard undercarriage was a simple single axle arrangement, {{but it could be}} replaced with a split axle unit to allow the carrying and dropping of torpedoes. In addition the Goring could operate as a seaplane. The floats were accompanied by a rudder enlarged by an extension below the fuselage.|$|E
5000|$|The Bristol Racer was a single-engined mid-wing {{monoplane}} with, {{unusual for}} the time, a retractable undercarriage. The 480 hp (360 kW) Bristol Jupiter IV radial engine was entirely enclosed within the circular-section fuselage, with an elaborate arrangement of ducts to channel cooling air over the cylinders. A large spinner with a central opening to admit air, constructed of laminated wood with <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> bracing was fitted. The fuselage, which increased in diameter until {{the trailing edge of}} the wing and then tapered to a point, was built around a pair of circular steel frames to which the wing root stubs were mounted: aft of this structure it was a semi-monocoque built up from three laminations of tulipwood over hoops which were braced with radial wires. [...] The fabric-covered wings had composite steel-and-wood spars and were designed as cantilevers, without bracing wires, and were parallel-chord with raked tips and deep full-span ailerons, which accounted for about 20% of the wing's chord. The undercarriage was operated by a handcrank and chain drive, the legs being housed in channels in the fuselage and the wheels within the wing roots.|$|E
