5|$|Hitler {{had noticed}} one {{potential}} {{flaw in the}} defences. The roofs were flat and unprotected; he <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if a glider, such as the DFS 230, could land on them. Student replied {{that it could be}} done, but only by 12 aircraft and in daylight; this would deliver 80â€“90 paratroopers onto the target.|$|E
5|$|Bryan urged {{a system}} of bank guarantees, so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, {{offering}} a postal savings system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September, Carrie Nation called on Taft and <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> his views. Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take no position on the matter, and Nation left indignant, to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Monitor withdrew, Virginia had {{run aground}} {{at which time}} Commander Jones {{came down from the}} spar deck only to find the gun crews not {{returning}} fire. Jones <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitors resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E
5|$|When {{reporting}} to Secretary Eustis, Harrison informed him the battle occurred near the Tippecanoe River (which {{led to its}} naming), and he feared an imminent reprisal attack. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary at first interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the U.S. victory clear. When no second attack came, {{the defeat of the}} Shawnee was more certain. Eustis <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against attacks. Harrison countered by saying he had considered the position strong enough. The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War that continued into the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E
5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E
5|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined {{that the majority of the}} crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could.|$|E

25|$|During Robinson's spring {{training}} with the Dodgers, {{he had been}} hit repeatedly by white pitchers when he stepped to the plate. Many expected the same to occur in Jersey City. But Sandel had played against Robinson, also a Californian, in baseball games {{on the west coast}} and harbored no ill feelings toward him. After the first several pitches were thrown and the count ran to 2-1, Dick Bouknight, the Giants catcher, walked to the mound and <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if Sandell was going to throw at Robinson. Sandel refused. After running up a 3-2 count, Robinson ground out harmlessly to the shortstop.|$|E
25|$|In the debates, Douglas reiterated {{his support}} of popular sovereignty. He <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether Lincoln would ever vote to admit a new slave state, even if the {{majority}} of settlers favored slavery. He denounced Lincoln for his insistence that slavery was a moral issue {{that had to be}} resolved by the nation as a whole. Douglas described this as causing an unnecessary conflict between free and slave states, which threatened to boil up into disunion and war. He also asserted that Lincoln supported civil and social equality between the races, and insinuated that Lincoln even accepted interracial marriage.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 1973, Longson {{called for}} both Clough's and Taylor's sackings at a board meeting, {{but did not}} gain the support that was needed to do so. Two days later, {{following}} a 1â€“0 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford, Jack Kirkland <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what Taylor's role within the club was. Kirkland instructed Taylor {{to meet him at}} the ground two days later to explain. On the same day, Longson accused Clough of making a V-sign at Sir Matt Busby, and demanded that he apologise. Clough refused to do so, as he vehemently denied making the V-sign in the first place.|$|E

It is Pollione who is led in, and Norma is urged to take the sacrificial knife to stab him but, approaching him, she is unable to perform the deed. The assembled crowd <b>demands</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why, but she dismisses them, stating that she needs to question her victim.|$|R
50|$|Right before {{attempting}} mouth to mouth resuscitation, the Doctor finds that River is merely holding her breath, {{and had been}} chased by Sontarans. As he chastises her, she notices the gold dress he chose for their first visit to Caldoron Beta five years before, hanging near the console. She <b>demands</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who he's brought, and storms {{up the stairs to}} find the hussy. A second later, the earlier River returns from the TARDIS wardrobe, <b>demanding</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who he's talking to. She returns to the wardrobe. The older River returns, <b>demanding</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> whom the Doctor is speaking. When he denies talking to anyone, she resumes her hunt. A third River enters the TARDIS, actually wearing the gold dress. This version of River was expecting to meet the Doctor here, but on seeing an identical gold dress hung by the console, asks why he has bought another. The Doctor asks her to step outside to check if the light on top of the TARDIS is working.|$|R

Gray claimed that he resisted five separate demands from the White House to fire Felt, stating that he believed Felt's assurances that he was not the source. Eventually, Gray <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who was claiming Felt to be leaking. Attorney general Richard Kleindienst told Gray that Roswell Gilpatric, former deputy secretary of defense under John F. Kennedy and now outside general counsel to Time, had told John Mitchell that Felt was leaking to Sandy Smith of Time magazine.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1890s {{it was common}} for novels, prior to full volume publication, to be serialised in {{magazines}} or newspapers, with {{each part of the}} serialisation ending upon a cliff hanger to entice audiences to buy the next edition.

25|$|When {{the final}} {{amendment}} was submitted for ratification, the Democrats attempted {{to leave the}} Senate to deny the body quorum.

Gray promptly responded that it was he, causing an uproar. The Democrats then crowded into a small cloak room and refused {{to vote on the}} measure. After some time passed, and they refused to return to the floor, Gray ordered the clerks to record the Democrats present, but abstaining from voting. The Republicans then proceeded to pass the ratification, over the loud objections of the Democrats. The event would come to cause Gray considerable problems in the future.|$|E
