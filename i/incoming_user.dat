30|$|For {{wireless}} broadcasting, NC {{is usually}} {{motivated by the}} two-user packet exchange example in Figure 1 (see e.g., [19]). Instead of replicating and independently transmitting each user packet, the central node XORs the <b>incoming</b> <b>user</b> packets and broadcasts a single coded packet. As a result, the number of packet transmissions required for two-way packet exchange between users reduces from four to three.|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{broadband}} networks {{are designed to}} provide high quality services to multiple mobile users simultaneously. The IEEE 802. 16 e Mobile WiMAX standard uses Orthogonally Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) schema for frame structure. OFDMA defines rectangular resource allocation of time slots and frequency carriers, separating {{in this way the}} channel into multiple subcarriers. This structure is used for arranging the <b>incoming</b> <b>user</b> requests. Aimed to increase the bandwidth utilization, while arranging the <b>incoming</b> <b>user</b> requests into an effective way, we have considered and evaluated Bin-Packing algorithms. Subsequently in the following sections are presented analysis and design of various Bin packing algorithms developed in our simulator. Moreover, a combined algorithm is proposed, named Guillotine First Fit Algorithm and {{a new version of the}} Shelf First Fit Algorithm. Simulation's results concerning performance of implemented algorithms in different input values are gathered, analyzed and compared. The results are encouraging and provide indications regarding usage of the proposed algorithms in practice...|$|E

30|$|Admission control {{refers to}} the {{mechanism}} of restricting the <b>incoming</b> <b>user</b> load on a server {{in order to prevent}} it from becoming overloaded. Server overload prevention is important because an overloaded server fails to maintain its performance, which translates into a subpar service (higher response time and lower throughput) [19]. Thus, if an overloaded server keeps on accepting new user requests, then not only the new users, but also the existing users may experience a deteriorated performance.|$|E

For this metric, we do {{not take into account the}} edge weight information (i.e., the total number of <b>incoming</b> <b>user</b> profiles), as we want to minimize the support bias due to a large number of users for a given job (organization).|$|E
30|$|For the {{detection}} of App-DDoS attacks, Xie et al. [8] used a hidden semi-Markov model (HsMM) to describe the normal browsing behavior of web users. The HsMM uses the sequence order of web page requests to profile normal web browsing behavior. To detect App-DDoS attacks, they defined a normality threshold and compared it with the model's output values of <b>incoming</b> <b>users.</b> However, the sequence-order-based method can be complex and may cause many false alarms. The sequence order might vary significantly for different individuals and for different browsing behaviors. For example, web users can directly type URLs to request resources or utilize external web links. Furthermore, they can browse {{the resources of the}} web server with multiple browsers, possibly causing changes in the relative sequential positions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{a transit}} network {{involving}} vehicles with rigid capacities, we advocate {{the use of}} strategies for describing consumer behavior. At each boarding node, a user sorts the transit lines in decreasing order of preference, and boards the first vehicle in this list whose residual capacity is nonzero. Since a user’s position in the queue varies from day to day, the delay experienced is stochastic. This leads to an equilibrium problem where, at a solution, users are assigned to strategies that minimize their expected delay. This situation is formulated as a variational inequality, whose cost mapping is discontinuous and strongly asymmetric, due to the priority of current passengers over <b>incoming</b> <b>users.</b> We prove that the solution set is nonempty and provide numerical results obtained by an efficient solution algorithm.

This is a block transmission scheme where the <b>incoming</b> <b>user</b> symbols are grouped, serial-to-parallel (S/P) converted, and modulated onto different subcarriers. Choosing the subcarriers to be orthogonal, and assuming perfect synchronisation, allows the block of symbols to be transmitted in parallel with minimal bandwidth usage and without interference. The S/P conversion allows the transmission rate to {{be reduced to a}} fraction of the original user rate combating in this way the frequency selectivity of the channel.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, a {{bandwidth}} reservation (BR) mechanism {{is also important}} to the provisioning of QoS for some prioritized users like users in a handoff process. Handoff occurs when mobile station (MS) transfers its connection from the original serving BS with worse and worse link qualities to a neighboring BS with better qualities. In general, a handoff user will be prioritized over a new <b>incoming</b> <b>user</b> in order to provide better user-perceived satisfaction especially when it is with real-time applications which have specific QoS requirements, e.g., throughput demands and delay/jitter constraints. Since the reserved bandwidth cannot be taken by a new coming user, the design of BR mechanisms can significantly affect the performance of handoff QoS and also the utilization efficiency of network resources.|$|E

Although notifications are useful to inform users about important information such as new messages and events, the continuous interruptions, the notification duplication, and the rigid delivery can be sources of discomfort. To overcome these issues, we present AwareNotifications, an intelligent system based on user-defined preferences to manage multi-device notifications. AwareNotifications is powered by Semantic Web technologies. By directly exploiting user preferences in the semantic reasoning process, the system is able to identify suitable device(s), modality, and moment(s) to deliver the <b>incoming</b> <b>user</b> notifications.

40|$|A {{standard}} approach to Collaborative Filtering (CF), i. e. prediction of user ratings on items, relies on Matrix Factorization techniques. Representations for both users and items are computed from the observed ratings {{and used for}} prediction.

40|$|Nowadays, {{people have}} been {{increasingly}} interested in exploiting Web Search Engines (WSEs) not only for having access to simple Web pages, but mainly for carrying out even complex activities, namely Web-mediated processes (or taskflows). Therefore, users 2 ̆ 7 information needs will become more complex, and (Web) search and recommender systems should change accordingly for dealing with this shift. We claim that such taskflows and their composing tasks are implicitly present in users 2 ̆ 7 minds when they interact, thus, with a WSE to access the Web. Our first research challenge is thus to evaluate this belief by analyzing a very large, longterm log of queries submitted to a WSE, and associating meaningful semantic labels with the extracted tasks (i. e., clusters of task-related queries) and taskflows. This large knowledge base constitutes {{a good starting point}} for building a model of users 2 ̆ 7 behaviors. The second research challenge is to devise a novel recommender system that goes beyond the simple query suggestion of modern WSEs.

Our approach focuses {{on the use of}} language models and is based on the intuitive notion that similar users and posts tend to use the same language. We compare using language models at two different levels of granularity: at the level of individual posts, and at an aggregated level for each user separately. To detect spam users in the system, we let the users and posts that are most similar to <b>incoming</b> <b>users</b> and their posts determine the spam status of those new users. We first rank all users in the system by KL-divergence of the language models of their posts— separately and combined into user profiles—and the language model of the new post or user.

30|$|To {{the benefit}} of the {{previous}} layer we propose an energy-efficient RRM and optimal transmission layer. This layer deals with the resources trade-offs we already spoke in Section 4 for energy-efficient transmission. The resources for transmission are finites and designers must carefully find a balance among the spectrum, the energy, power and time delays. For the current and future mobile networks, relax the constraints on transmission time delays is something very difficult, due that such networks are increasing more and more the volume of data traffic for real-time applications like video streaming and multimedia phone calls. This latter makes more exigent the time delay constraints in order to guarantee quality. However, we have seen in Section 4 how frequency and space diversity approaches can help in the increase of the energy efficiency of a system. A clear direction to enhance the transmission performance is to continue the research in techniques like OFDMA and MIMO, which will permit to exploit better their capabilities to reduce the energy per bit figures. Moreover, if we consider that the future of mobile RANs goes toward the hybrid macro-femto approaches and BS cooperative transmissions (e.g. CoMP and DAS) {{there is a lot of}} work to do in coordination mechanisms for resource allocation in such approaches. Such RRM mechanisms should additionally permit the coexistence of a cooperative scheme of femto/macro BSs with other elements such as relays, by sharing efficiently the spectrum, avoiding the interference and allocating in a tailored way the resources (e.g. power and spectrum) to serve the <b>incoming</b> <b>users.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we exploit simple {{approximate}} queueing models {{to assess the}} effectiveness of the approaches that have been proposed to save energy in dense wireless local area networks (WLANs), based on the activation of access points (APs) according to the user demand. In particular, we look at a portion of a dense WLAN, where several APs are deployed to provide sufficient capacity to serve a large number of active users during peak traffic hours. To increase capacity, some APs are colocated and provide identical coverage; we say that these APs belong to the same group, and they serve users in the same area. The areas covered by different AP groups only partially overlap, so that some active users can only be served by a group of APs, but a fraction of active users can be served by more groups. Due to daily variations of the number of active users accessing the WLAN, some APs can be switched off to save energy when not all the capacity is needed. A real example of this setting is provided by a floor of one building of Politecnico di Torino in Italy, where a student library is located. The approximate analytical models indicate that the energy saving achievable with the proposed approaches is quite substantial, over 40 % if at least one AP for each group is always kept on, even with no traffic, to be ready to accept <b>incoming</b> <b>users,</b> and it grows to almost 60 % if all APs can be switched off at night, using a separate technology to activate an AP when the first user requests association in the mornin...|$|R
