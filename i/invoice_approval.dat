5000|$|Two {{instances}} of documents discussing {{the use of}} biological disease by the British against North American Indians during Pontiac's Rebellion (1763-66) have been examined by historians, but the actual effectiveness is unknown. In the first, during a parley at Fort Pitt on June 24, 1763, Captain Simeon Ecuyer gave representatives of the besieging Delawares two blankets and a handkerchief enclosed in small metal boxes that {{had been exposed to}} smallpox, hoping to spread the disease to the Natives in order to end the siege. William Trent, the militia commander, sent a bill to the British Army indicating that the purpose of giving the blankets was [...] "to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians."

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In February 2006, we reported on significant internal control deficiencies related to contractor payments and property accountability associated {{with the development of}} the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Trilogy information technology (IT) modernization project. In that audit, we found FBI's <b>invoice</b> review and <b>approval</b> process did not provide an adequate basis to verify that goods and services billed were actually received and that amounts billed were appropriate. We also found that FBI relied extensively on Trilogy contractors to purchase and account for Trilogy equipment without controls or data to verify the accuracy and completeness of the contractor records. Additionally, once FBI took possession of the Trilogy equipment, it did not have adequate controls to safeguard those assets. FBI is now acquiring and deploying a new automated case management system, known as Sentinel, to replace the case management system that was to be delivered as part of the Trilogy project. Sentinel is being developed in four phases at an estimated cost of $ 425 million and is scheduled to be completed in May 2010. Phase 1 of the project was completed in June 2007. In light of the problems we found concerning the predecessor Trilogy project, Congress asked us to review the internal controls over expenditures related to {{the development and implementation of}} Sentinel. Specifically, Congress asked us to assess the design and implementation of FBI's internal controls over the Sentinel project for (1) preventing or detecting improper payments to project contractors and (2) maintaining proper accountability for equipment purchased for the project. Further, to the extent weaknesses were found, you asked us to determine whether those weaknesses resulted in improper payments or missing equipment. ...|$|R
