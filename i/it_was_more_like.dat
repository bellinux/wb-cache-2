5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I. Joe: Yearbook {{differed from the}} typical comic book annual publication in that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a magazine. Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program, {{a summary of the}} comic book's plot to date, and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama. G.I.

25|$|The Joneses were {{assisted}} by many younger archaeologists and 'volunteers' from Britain and abroad {{including more than}} 3,000 students from many countries. The volunteers lived mainly in tents during the warmer months, but in the winter, occupied old caravans and sheds. The organisation of the camp, the feeding, the pay and the volunteers' welfare involved many individuals guided by terse memos signed by the initials 'muj'. Jones sometimes commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a holiday camp than an archaeological dig. In {{the final stages of}} the dig, volunteers were supplemented by local unemployed people, funded by a government job creation scheme. Without this extra assistance, the excavation might not have been completed.|$|E

500|$|During the film's fire scene, Cody {{appears as}} a {{character}} in the barroom. [...] "To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics {{and all that stuff}} which is why I don't know why I asked to be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. [...] "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that Burt Reynolds had done it once", stated Cody. [...] "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough." ...|$|E

500|$|The Helicarriers in {{the film}} were {{completely}} digital. Earl said, [...] "In [...] <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an aircraft carrier, now it’s an aircraft carrier {{with the addition of}} battle ship-sized guns. We were all over the carriers [...] We were on the decks; we were flying next to them. We had a lot of close ups and different angles. And we didn’t just have one; we had three. On top of that, we had to destroy them all." [...] This CGI environment was also used in close ups. Earl said, [...] "The challenge was to get in all of the detail to make it feel like it is a real, working ship. We created details down to the railings and all the human-scale stuff. ... For the shots in which we were destroying them, we had to have the internals as well – the hallways, the storage areas." [...] Many of the shots of Washington, D.C. were digitally created due to numerous flight restrictions in the city which necessitated that locations be recreated by computer. However, aerial footage of the city was filmed and used for live action plate photography for shots involving the Triskelion, which is located on Theodore Roosevelt Island on the Potomac River.|$|E

500|$|Gard was keen to animate the {{character}} realistically, an aspect {{he felt the}} industry at the time had disregarded. He sacrificed quick animations in favour of more fluid movement, believing that players would empathise with {{the character}} more easily. Lara's dual-wielding of pistols {{was inspired by the}} film Hard Boiled and an Æon Flux short. In the first Tomb Raider, Croft's three-dimensional (3D) character model is made of around 230polygons. The character's braid was removed from the model, but added back for subsequent iterations. Gavin Rummery, programmer on the first two Tomb Raider games, explained, [...] "It had been dropped from the original because it just didn't work properly with all the acrobatic moves – <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> she had an electric eel attached to her head that had a life of its own. But on TRII I came {{up with a way to}} get it working and was really pleased how natural it looked." [...] There is a misconception that, while adjusting the character model, Gard accidentally increased the breasts' dimensions by 150 percent and the rest of the creative team argued to keep the change. Gard, however, has stated thasich notion [...] "came out of a silly remark made in an interview". Core Design hired Shelley Blond to voice Croft after the game entered the beta phase of development. Gard left Core Design after completing Tomb Raider, citing a lack of creative freedom and control over marketing decisions related to the ideas he developed (especially Lara Croft).|$|E

Do you think Dürer's work would <b>be</b> better if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that? And would you have me, therefore, leaving the question of technical method of production altogether to the craftsman, consider pictorial engraving simply as the production of a light-and-shade drawing, by some method permitting its multiplication for the public? ...|$|R
2500|$|In addition, Portman's co-star in the film, Mila Kunis, {{also gave}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly in which she said, [...] "Natalie danced her ass off" [...] and that [...] " [...] tell you , no, she was not on pointe when she did a fouetté [...] No one's going to deny that. But she did do every ounce of every one of her dances .... wasn't used for everything. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a safety net.

[...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E
2500|$|Once the film's cast was assembled, {{they spent}} {{three weeks in}} rehearsals. With a budget set at $12.5 million, filming began in August 1991 at the Kaufman Astoria Soundstage in Queens, New York and on {{location}} in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn over 39 days. Harris remembers, [...] "There were five and six-page scenes we would shoot all at once. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> doing a play at times [...] you'd get the continuity going". Alan Arkin said of the script, [...] "What made it [...] was the language and the rhythms, which are enormously difficult to absorb". During filming, members of the cast who {{were not required to}} be on the set certain days would show up anyway to watch the other actors' performances.|$|E

2500|$|Plesiosaurus {{was one of}} {{the first}} of the [...] "antediluvian reptiles" [...] to be {{discovered}} and excited great interest in Victorian England. It was so-named ("near lizard") by William Conybeare and Henry De la Beche, to indicate that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a normal reptile than Ichthyosaurus, which had been found in the same rock strata just a few years earlier. Plesiosaurus is the archetypical genus of Plesiosauria and the first to be described, hence lending its name to the order. Conybeare and De la Beche coined the name for scattered finds from the Bristol region, Dorset, and Lyme Regis in 1821. The type species of Plesiosaurus, P. dolichodeirus, was named and described by Conybeare in 1824 on the basis of Anning's original finds.|$|E
2500|$|Warhol cast Darling {{in a short}} comedic {{scene in}} Flesh (1968) with Jackie Curtis and Joe Dallesandro. After Flesh, Darling was cast in {{a central role in}} Women in Revolt (1971). She played a Long Island socialite, drawn into a woman's liberation group called PIGS (Politically Involved Girls), by a {{character}} played by Curtis. Interrupted by cast disputes encouraged by Warhol, Women in Revolt took longer to film than its predecessor and went through several title changes before it was released. Darling wanted it called Blonde on a Bum Trip since she was the blonde, while Curtis and Woodlawn told her <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Bum on a Blonde Trip", titles which were both used in the film during Darling's interview scene. For a short time, Darling worked as a barmaid at Slugger Ann's, the bar owned by Jackie Curtis's grandmother.|$|E
2500|$|Casualties for the Battle of Lookout Mountain were {{relatively}} light {{by the standards}} of the Civil War: 408 Union, 1,251 Confederate (including 1,064 captured or missing). Sylvanus Cadwallader, a war reporter accompanying Grant's army, wrote that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "magnificent skirmish", than a major battle. General Grant, whose focus was on the northern end of Missionary Ridgeand who was usually partial to the achievements of his key subordinates in the Western armieslater denigrated Hooker's achievement, writing in his memoirs, [...] "The battle of Lookout Mountain is one of the romances of the war. There was no such battle and no action even worthy to be called the battle on Lookout Mountain. It is all poetry." [...] Nevertheless, the action was important in assuring control of the Tennessee River and the railroad into Chattanooga and endangering the entire Confederate line on Missionary Ridge. Brig. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs, quartermaster general of the Union Army, observing the fog-shrouded action from Orchard Knob, was the first writer to name it the [...] "Battle Above the Clouds".|$|E

2500|$|Trouble {{was formed}} in 1979 by Rick Wartell and was joined by guitarist Bruce Franklin, vocalist Eric Wagner, bassist Tim Ian Brown (not to be {{confused}} with lead singer of English band The Stone Roses), and drummer Jeff Olson. Ian Brown was replaced by Sean McAllister in 1983. Drawing from Black Sabbath for inspiration (with occasional nods to the psychedelic sounds of the late 1960s), the band used gloomy down-tuned riffs and spiritual, often openly Bible-inspired lyrics, which led Metal Blade to market the band as [...] "white metal" [...] as opposed to black metal. [...] "I was brought up Catholic", vocalist and primary lyric writer Wagner explains in the liner notes of Psalm 9 re-issue (2006), [...] "but you have to remember, back in the early 1980s, all the metal was kind of satanic, and I did not get into that vibe." [...] Wagner has implied that Metal Blade actually came up with the term in the first place, which the band rejected: [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Metal Blade trying to be cute or something, with everything [...] being called black metal, why not call us white metal, which is a bunch of crap." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{opinions}} regarding an afterlife, Schuldiner responded [...] "I don't know", but elaborated that he believed [...] "this is hell", and that demons are in people, as they [...] "create evil". Although his parents are Jewish, Schuldiner did not go through any formal religious training. In the documentary, [...] "666 at Calling Death", he was asked whether Satanism {{was a part of}} his music. [...] He replied, [...] "Not at all. I really don't want to involve any type of religious theme in our music. I think that's more of a personal thing. [...] Yeah, I'm not a Satanist and I definitely don't put that into our music on purpose. I was really young when the band first started out. I was never really into writing Satanic lyrics at all, personally. [...] We did write gore lyrics, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> kind of tongue-in-cheek, horror-movie type level. Nothing like encouraging people to go out and hurt themselves or anything stupid like that. It's pure fantasy-movie type, scary stuff. And then, I just really got into writing about reality, which is what we all have to deal with." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1970s occult boom {{influenced}} many early {{heavy metal}} bands lyricwise. In the early 1980s, several bands dealt such themes {{in a more}} extreme manner, including Venom, Mercyful Fate and Bathory. During the mid-1980s, heavy metal music divided into many subgenres, and black metal {{emerged as one of}} them, taking its name from a Venom album of the same title. In the 1980s, the term was imprecise with regards to musical attributes, simply referring to all metal bands with Satanic lyrical themes. Although Christian metal bands had existed since the late 1970s, a clear contrast with black metal occurred in 1984 with the doom metal band Trouble who released the Bible-based album Psalm 9. Metal Blade Records marketed them as [...] "white metal" [...] as opposed to black metal. Singer Eric Wagner has explained that [...] "back in the early 1980s, all the metal was kind of satanic," [...] and he has implied that Metal Blade (or the owner Brian Slagel) actually invented the term in the first place: [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Metal Blade trying to be cute or something, with everything being called black metal, so why not call us white metal, which is a bunch of crap." [...] While there were Christian extreme metal bands in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Christian black metal likely did not exist until 1994.|$|E
