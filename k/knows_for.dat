500|$|Most sportswriters, {{unfamiliar}} with the T formation, called it the [...] "Shaughnessy Formation" [...] or [...] "Shaughnessy's new razzle-dazzle attacks." [...] Bill Leiser of the San Francisco Chronicle referred to it correctly when he wrote:"No one <b>knows</b> <b>for</b> sure what kind of football the Indians will play from this new T-Formation...They start from the Notre Dame T and then stop looking like Notre Dame because they don't shift at all and never do get into the famous box formation.

500|$|The {{following}} season Shero led the Flyers to a 50–16–12 record, {{first place}} in the Western Division. The 112 point total also placed the Flyers just one point behind the Boston Bruins for first overall in the NHL. It also marked the first time in franchise history that the Flyers posted a winning percentage over 0.700. The division title and high winning percentage accompanied by a 27-point increase from the previous season led to Shero winning the inaugural Jack Adams Award for coach of the year. In the 1974 playoffs the Flyers' first round match-up was against the Atlanta Flames. Following a game three win in which the Flyers went up 3-0, Shero was involved in an infamous incident. Known for taking late night walks and stopping at local bars and pubs for a drink, Shero decided to go for one of those walks following the game three victory. Though no one <b>knows</b> <b>for</b> sure what happened, Shero was allegedly mugged. Shero didn't divulge any information about what really happened but police responded to a disturbance call at 2 a.m. outside the Flyers hotel. Shero was found with a broken thumb and cuts and bruises to his face. Flyers' management sent him home to recuperate and assistant coach Nykoluk coached the team in the series winning game. In the Semi-final round the Flyers were considered underdogs to the New York Rangers. However, the Flyers had home ice advantage. In the seven game series the home team won every game, giving the Flyers a 4-3 series win. It marked the first time an expansion team defeated an Original Six team in a playoff series. The Flyers advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they played the Boston Bruins. Prior to game one Shero devised an unconventional game plan. The Flyers were to dump the puck to Bobby Orr's side of the rink. Orr was considered {{to be one of the}} league's best players, and the plan was to make him skate hard back to get the puck. In addition the team was to be physically hard on him. Any player who had the opportunity was to check, bump or put a stick on Orr, in an attempt to wear him down. Bobby Clarke later recalled that the strategy did work although it did take some time. Clarke stated that Orr was the best player on the ice in game five, but in game six Orr wasn't the factor he had been in other games. Going into game six, the Flyers had a chance to win the Stanley Cup. Prior to the game Shero wrote his famous quote [...] "Win today, and we walk together forever" [...] on the dressing room blackboard for inspiration to the players. The quote is still used today. The Flyers went on to win game six and the series, thus becoming the first expansion team to win the Stanley Cup. Following the series Flyers' goaltender Bernie Parent was named Conn Smythe as playoff MVP. During the official presentation Parent was given a new car, which he promptly gave to Shero.|$|E

2500|$|The {{meaning of}} the Picture Rock Pass petroglyphs is unknown.

[...] Alternatively, the petroglyphs may have been created to identify tribal territory, record myths, or commemorate important tribal events. [...] Perhaps the simplest {{explanation is that the}} petroglyphs were just fanciful designs cut into the rock by a prehistoric artist.

Since Jefferson was very discreet, no one <b>knows</b> <b>for</b> certain the extent of their relationship. Jefferson eventually stopped writing her until some time later when she contacted him; their renewed correspondence continued until his death.

Their correspondence survives. Before Jefferson left Paris, he wrote her, [...] "I am going to America and you are going to Italy.

2500|$|Nobody <b>knows</b> <b>for</b> {{sure what}} the true value of the total {{physical}} capital stock is, because all statistical estimates of that value involve theoretical extrapolations, with {{a margin of error}} which remains unknown unless very detailed and comprehensive surveys are done. What a fixed asset is worth becomes apparent only upon sale, yet even then assets may be sold above or below their true value – an important reason why statisticians adjust depreciation rates retrospectively and use price deflators. [...] Even where detailed information is available, however, assessments of what an asset is worth still depend on the valuation criteria used. Those criteria often differ from the actual criteria used by business, since they must conform to a standard statistical definition for measurement comparisons.|$|E
2500|$|In the Zohar, Rabbi Jose expounded on [...] "And let every wise-hearted man {{among you}} come and make all that the Lord has commanded."

[...] A wise man <b>knows</b> <b>for</b> himself as much as is required, but the man of discernment apprehends the whole, knowing both his {{own point of view}} and that of others.

2500|$|Jack Souther, {{a leading}} {{authority}} on geothermal resources and volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera has stated, [...] "at present the volcanoes of the Garibaldi Belt are quiet, presumed dead but still not completely cold.

[...] Recent seismic imaging from Geological Survey of Canada employees supported lithoprobe studies {{in the region of}} Mount Cayley in which scientists found a large reflector interpreted to be a pool of molten rock roughly [...] below the surface. The existence of hot springs at Mount Meager and Mount Cayley indicates that magmatic heat is still present beneath or near these volcanoes.
