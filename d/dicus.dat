Former TBI agent Terry <b>Dicus,</b> who was the lead investigator on the case, testified for the defense. He told the jury that he ruled the men out early in the case because their alibis checked out and cell phone records put Zach and Holly several miles apart during the critical time frame.|$|E

Britt {{told investigators that}} his wife stayed home from work that morning to help him install a bathtub. Through the investigation, <b>Dicus</b> discovered that his wife, Janet, had gone to work that morning but Terry called and made her leave [...] "on the biggest news day" [...] of the county's history. The Britts did produce a handwritten receipt for the bathtub, but the store had no record of the sale. According to <b>Dicus,</b> Britt's wife had been with him on previous occasions where Britt had stalked girls. Britt also could not be excluded as the contributor of the handprint. He also testified that following Holly's abduction, Terry Britt allegedly changed his appearance by cutting his hair.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Dicus</b> {{family in}} the United States is mostly descended from William and Mary Dicas, who emigrated from Chester, England, near the border of Wales, to Chestertown, on Maryland's Eastern Shore, a {{generation}} before the American Revolution. Three of their six children began the family's three major branches. John and his children moved into Pennsylvania and New York and then followed the Westward Expansion. James and his children moved across Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore and Ellicott City, Maryland, {{and many of their}} descendants remain in Maryland. Edward and his children moved to the Blue Ridge of Virginia and from there into the southern Appalachians and through the U.S. South. <b>Dicus</b> family etymology was a lifetime avocation of Rufus <b>Dicus</b> of Baltimore, who researched church records in the early to middle 1900s, and a cousin, Jacob <b>Dicus</b> 8th, has built on his work through extensive Internet research in recent years. The former thought the name might originally be Dutch, while the latter found a plausible Welsh derivation.|$|E
