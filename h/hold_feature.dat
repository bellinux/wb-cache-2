50|$|This mode {{attempts}} {{to simulate the}} classic Game Boy version of Tetris. There are two modes within this game. Mode A challenges players to clear as many lines as possible.

This game mode is not available on the Facebook version.|$|E
50|$|SAFER {{was first}} flown on STS-64 September 9, 1994, where an {{untethered}} flight test was performed first by astronaut Mark Lee and then Carl Meade. Both astronauts flew the SAFER {{up and around}} the Shuttle's Robotic Arm along with a demonstration test of the SAFER's automatic attitude <b>hold</b> <b>feature.</b> This feature arrests uncontrolled rotation of a detached crewmember expected in an accidental separation. SAFER has a mass of approximately 83 lb (38 kg) and can provide a total change in velocity (delta-v) of at least 10 ft/s (3 m/s). It was also tested during flight STS-92 when astronauts Wisoff and Lopez-Alegria performed test maneuvers, flying up to 50 feet while remaining tethered to the spacecraft.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The article {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} the Internet Protocol (IP) access interface on the packet loss probability and delay times in the optical packet switched network. The network and node model have been proposed, and the structure of the IP access interface, including assembler and holder, have been included in the analysis. It has been shown that the increase of the maximum optical packet sizes, as well as use of the <b>holding</b> <b>feature</b> as contention resolution mechanism, decrease the packet loss probability, but introduce delays at the optical network access points. Modeling and analysis were based on the discrete event simulation assuming self-similar traffic sources. IP packet lengths were modeled using empirical data...|$|R

30|$|Pavement crack types provide {{important}} information for making pavement maintenance strategies. This paper proposes an automatic pavement crack classification approach, exploiting the spatial distribution features (i.e., direction feature and density feature) of the cracks under a neural network model. In this approach, a direction coding (D-Coding) algorithm {{is presented to}} encode the crack subsections and extract the direction features, and a Delaunay Triangulation technique is employed to analyze the crack region structure and extract the density features. As regarding skeletonized crack sections rather than crack pixels, the spatial distribution <b>features</b> <b>hold</b> considerable <b>feature</b> significance {{for each type of}} cracks. Empirical study indicates a classification precision of over 98 % of the proposed approach.|$|R
