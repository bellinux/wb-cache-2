40|$|JonBenet Patricia Ramsey was a six {{year old}} rising {{star in the}} beauty pageant world when she was found brutally murdered in the {{basement}} of her home in Boulder, Colorado on December 26, 1996. Nineteen years later, the crime remains unsolved and no convictions have ever been made in the case. This could mainly be attributed {{to the fact that the}} Boulder Police Department was extremely inexperienced when it came to homicides, so they did not follow through with typical crime scene procedure when they responded to the 911 call. Also, they did not accept help from more experienced agencies, such as the Denver Police Department, available nearby. This paper reviews and analyzes the procedural mistakes made by the Boulder Police Department in Boulder, Colorado throughout the course of the kidnapping and subsequent murder investigation. These mistakes are specified and interpreted as to how the department should have handled the investigation in order to protect and preserve the crime scene evidence that was eventually damaged due to carelessness. Next, the theory of the main suspects, <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey,</b> as well as a possible intruder are discussed while addressing the physical and circumstantial evidence gathered during the case and how the mistakes of the police investigation might have hindered a conviction. Finally, the paper indicates what former criminal profiler, John Douglas, ultimately believed happened to the miniature beauty queen. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|E

[...] <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey</b> 2 ̆ 7 s {{refusal to}} submit to a lie {{detector}} test - a test they had agreed to take during a nationally televised interview - is a surprise and a shock, says UGA law professor Ron Carlson, a nationally recognized criminal law expert who has provided ongoing commentary of the high profile case. 2 ̆ 2 This {{is probably one of the}} most damaging developments against the parents in the case, as far as public opinion in this matter is concerned, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 I for one have been a supporter of the Ramseys in one particular respect, and that is that I feel they 2 ̆ 7 ve been so pilloried by the tabloids that it 2 ̆ 7 s been relatively unfair to them. This lie detector development helps sway public opinion against them - having said that they were willing to take {{a lie detector test}} and now, refusing to do so. 2 ̆ 2 According to media reports, the Ramseys have refused to take the test because it would be administered by the FBI: they had agreed to take the test if administered by an independent source; since the FBI participated in the investigation of their daughter 2 ̆ 7 s death, they do not consider the FBI to be independent. Carlson says the development is a major backslide for the investigation. 2 ̆ 2 Things are back to square one, which isn 2 ̆ 7 t very good, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 The speculation of a lot of commentators and experts is that the case will simply never be solved in a legal sense, and this is definitely a step backward. If the parents could 2 ̆ 7 ve taken a test, passed it and have been cleared, that would then place the investigative focus out there with the intruder theory, and anything that helps narrow the range of suspects and the range of manners in which this crime could have been committed is helpful, so this is not a good development. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, has litigated many cases and has argued twice before the United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials.

Pharr, (706) 542 - 5172, pharr@arches. uga. edu CONTACT: Ron Carlson, (706) 542 - 5186 (O); (706) / 548 - 6771 (H) UPCOMING RAMSEY INTERVIEWS COULD JUMPSTART INVESTIGATION, SAYS UGA LAW PROF ATHENS, Ga. [...] Monday 2 ̆ 7 s {{scheduled}} {{interviews with}} <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey</b> {{could provide the}} jumpstart that the stalled investigation of their daughter Jon-Benet 2 ̆ 7 s brutal murder needs, says UGA trial and criminal law expert Ron Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 These interviews are a positive sign, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 They signal {{to the public that}} the case remains under active investigation. Second, they bring the Ramseys together with the people responsible for solving this crime - the Boulder police. Such cooperation is virtually always helpful to law enforcement. Finally, while participation in these interviews may not conclusively establish the innocence of the Ramseys, the willingness of John and Patsy to sit for interrogation - which they are not required to do - does impress many people as conduct which is inconsistent with guilt. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson has previously criticized some Colorado police and prosecutors for their refusal to discuss certain aspects of the case, saying that the Ramseys had been 2 ̆ 2 so pilloried, so horribly tried in the media, that in fairness, some of the exonerating evidence should be disclosed. 2 ̆ 2 For example, he cites last fall 2 ̆ 7 s disclosures published by Newsweek magazine: 2 ̆ 2 Newsweek reported that DNA from tissue found under Jon-Benet 2 ̆ 7 s fingernails has not been matched to anyone in the family, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Particularly when citizens have been subjected to trial by tabloid, careful and measured release of some of the investigative information which is helpful to the individual is in the public interest. 2 ̆ 2 The Monday interviews in Atlanta will be the first major sit-down by the Ramseys with the Boulder police in two years. It has been reported that a substantial delegation of authorities will arrive in Atlanta and that the Boulder police chief apparently has new questions and information - prospects Carlson views as encouraging. 2 ̆ 2 The interview potentially promises to be a pivotal step, 2 ̆ 2 he said. Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, has litigated many cases and has argued twice before the United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials.
