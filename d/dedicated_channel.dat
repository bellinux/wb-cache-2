5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of that meeting are vague, but what is clear was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to pursue an alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match of the Day. In February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over lunch to go over his expectations, {{with the idea of}} a Premier League <b>dedicated</b> <b>channel</b> high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|E

Additionally, the model considers the impact of location dependent bandwidths on the spatial user distribution. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated for an example scenario. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{presents}} a performance study of two algorithms for dynamic allocation of the <b>Dedicated</b> <b>CHannels</b> (DCH) in UMTS {{over the air}} interface, namely Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm and an Adaptive algorithm. The algorithms are designed to efficiently share the <b>dedicated</b> <b>channels</b> among users whose traffic patterns are characterized by bursty packet transfers followed by long inactivity periods. Specifically, Web browsing, FTP and Email applications were considered in order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} above mentioned resource allocation algorithms in the context of bursty traffic with relaxed delay constraints and in the presence of delays introduced by the backhaul network...|$|R
