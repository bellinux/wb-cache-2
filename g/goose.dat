5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant <b>goose,</b> pink-footed <b>goose,</b> barnacle <b>goose</b> and Taiga bean <b>goose.</b> The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E
5|$|The greylag <b>goose</b> (Anser anser) was domesticated by the Egyptians {{at least}} 3000 years ago, and a {{different}} wild species, the swan <b>goose</b> (Anser cygnoides), domesticated in Siberia about a thousand years later, {{is known as a}} Chinese <b>goose.</b> The two hybridise with each other and the large knob {{at the base of the}} beak, a noticeable feature of the Chinese <b>goose,</b> is present to a varying extent in these hybrids. The hybrids are fertile and have resulted in several of the modern breeds. Despite their early domestication, geese have never gained the commercial importance of chickens and ducks.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{research}} on migrating bird species. Two model species for migrating birds are the Barnacle <b>geese</b> (Branta leucopsis) and the Brent <b>geese</b> (Branta bernicla). A lot is known about their foraging, migrating and breeding behavior. Most studies focused only on a specific interaction during a specific time of the year. By putting all this information of different interactions and different areas together it is possible to make an interaction network for the whole flyway route of the <b>geese.</b> Brent <b>geese</b> are declining in numbers, while Barnacle <b>geese</b> numbers are growing. Because habitats are overlapping, it could be that, due to competition, the Barnacle <b>geese</b> have a share in the decline of the Brent <b>geese.</b> By comparing the interaction network of Barnacle and Brent <b>geese</b> it is possible to gain an insight into interactions between the two species. The analysis of the flyway route of the Barnacle <b>geese</b> shows that they only share the Wadden Sea wintering area with the Brent <b>geese.</b> It could be possible that the Barnacle <b>geese,</b> which are bigger and in increasing numbers, are “pushing” the Brent <b>geese</b> from their foraging areas. However, the Brent <b>geese</b> were already declining before the Barnacle arrived in the Wadden Sea area. At the moment it seems that the increasing Barnacle <b>geese</b> numbers do not have a direct effect on the numbers of Brent <b>geese.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Gut {{microbial}} {{composition is}} dependent on diet. Geese are herbivores and can digest crude fibre, but the relationship between composition of the microbiota and a fibre-rich diet in <b>geese</b> is not well understood. Here, caecal and faecal samples were collected simultaneously from all-grass-fed <b>geese</b> and high-grain-fed <b>geese</b> and the hypervariable V 3 -V 4 regions of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene were sequenced. The results was identified that high-grass-fed <b>geese</b> possessed significantly higher alpha diversity both in caecum and faeces compared with that in all-grain-fed <b>geese.</b> In addition, the composition of dominant bacterium occurred remarkable shifting due to different diet patterns, Firmicutes were more abundant in all-grass-fed <b>geese,</b> whereas Bacteroidetes were abundant in high-grain-fed <b>geese.</b> Fusobacteria and Deferribacteres were obviously present in high-grain-fed <b>geese</b> and few in all-grass-fed <b>geese.</b> Most importantly, some specific microorgnisms such as Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidaceae which may associated with cellulose-degrading that were characterized to show distinctly diverse between the two diet patterns. PICRUSt analysis revealed the metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were overrepresented in all-grass-fed <b>geese.</b> In conclusion, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were identified abundantly when the <b>geese</b> was fed with all-grass feed and high-grain feed, respectively. And Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidaceae were recognized as main cellulose-degrading bacteria in the <b>geese.</b> The functional profiles of gut microbiota revealed the dominant microbiota communities were involved mainly in the carbohydrate metabolism in all-grass-fed <b>geese...</b>|$|R

The two kinds of <b>geese</b> were free-ranged separately in each outdoor corral (1 a), and they were provided with formula feed (CP: 16. 0 %, ME: 2, 850 kcal/kg) ad libitum.
