A.sobria, given live in the feed, protected the trout when challenged with S.iniae or L.garvieae.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In 2001, Urbani and Palmer {{published}} {{a review of}} the epidemiological situation of helminthiases in the countries of the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization indicating the control needs in the region. Six years after this inspiring article, large-scale preventive chemotherapy <b>for</b> the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> helminthiasis has scaled up dramatically in the region. This paper analyzes the most recent {{published a}}nd unpublished country information on large-scale preventive chemotherapy and summarizes the progress made since 2000. Almost 39 million treatments were provided in 2006 in the region <b>for</b> the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> helminthiasis: nearly 14 million <b>for</b> the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> lymphatic filariasis, more than 22 million <b>for</b> the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and over 2 million <b>for</b> the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> schistosomiasis. In general, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> these helminthiases is progressing well in the Mekong countries and Pacific Islands. In China, despite harboring the majority of the helminth infections of the region, the control activities have not reached the level of coverage of countries with much more limited financial resources. The <b>control</b> <b>of</b> food-borne trematodes is still limited, but pilot activities have been initiated in China, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and Vietnam...|$|R
