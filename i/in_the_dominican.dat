Grau's government stopped the invasion under U.S. pressure, although Castro {{and many of his}} comrades evaded arrest. Returning to Havana, Castro took a leading role in student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards. The protests, accompanied by a crackdown on those considered communists, led to violent clashes between activists and police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten. At this point, his public speeches took on a distinctly leftist slant by condemning social and economic inequality in Cuba. In contrast, his former public criticisms had centered on condemning corruption and U.S. imperialism.|$|E

5|$|The García {{family is}} an example of this phenomenon. In How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in {{altering}} the events of her own life to create fiction.
