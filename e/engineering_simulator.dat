40|$|Flight {{simulators}} can be categorised {{as research}} <b>simulators,</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>simulators</b> and training simulators. Research simulators can be introduced as both test beds for flight simulator research and computational tools for flight systems and human factors research. While <b>engineering</b> <b>simulators</b> are utilised for systems development, training simulators {{are used for}} flight training. The models {{that are used in}} training simulators and also in <b>engineering</b> <b>simulators</b> are more mature and stable. On the other hand, the models in research simulators are subject to a constant change. While Model Based Design and Software Development has brought us agile model development workflows, so that modellers can update their models more easily, it came up with some serious systems integration and testing problems, so systems developers need to establish mechanisms to tackle frequent behaviour and interface changes. DLR’s Institute of Flight Systems (FT) has a long tradition in flight research and simulation of various flight vehicles. Currently a modern research simulator facility is being operated at DLR Braunschweig –AVES (Air Vehicle Simulator). AVES is designed such that interchangeable cockpits of rotorcraft (EC 135) and airplanes (A 320) can be operated on motion and fixed-base platforms according to the particular needs. 2 Simulate is the enabling real-time simulation infrastructure of the AVES.

The first three generations of Nengo developed {{with a focus on}} developing a powerful modelling tool with a simple interface, and scripting system. As the tool became increasingly useful the limitations of the system in terms of speed led to development of a back-end agnostic API. This most recent iteration of Nengo defines a specific Python-based scripting API with back-ends targetting Numpy, OpenCL and Neuromorphic hardware such as Spinnaker. This newest iteration also comes with an interactive GUI (video demo) to help with the quick prototyping of neural models.|$|E

40|$|Simulator {{fidelity}} {{has been}} defined as the conformance of a flight simulator to the characteristics of the real aircraft. Objective fidelity evaluation is an engineering approach that attacks the fidelity problem with comparison of simulator and the actual system behavior over some quantitative measures. Testing can be pronounced as the fundamental mean for this comparison. From the utilization perspective, flight simulators are classified as research, <b>engineering</b> and training <b>simulators.</b> Research simulators are both test beds for flight simulator research and computational tools for flight systems and human factors research. <b>Engineering</b> <b>simulators</b> are used for systems development and training simulators are utilized for flight training. While training simulators are subject to rare or few upgrades or modifications in their lifespan, <b>engineering</b> <b>simulators</b> are under occasional and research simulators are under frequent change. The test cases to evaluate the fidelity of training simulators are guided by standards whereas for <b>engineering</b> and research <b>simulators,</b> test cases may present a great variation depending on the scope of change and the use case. These two characteristics of <b>engineering</b> and research <b>simulators,</b> combined with the complexity of today’s aircrafts necessitate new methodologies for efficient and effective testing. Model-Based Testing (MBT) targets flexibility and adaptability via utilization of models for specification of test cases and proposes workflows for automatic test case generation. The paper presents an MBT approach for objective fidelity evaluation of <b>engineering</b> and research <b>simulators.</b> The proposed approach is exercised with an infrastructure implementation and an example case study.

40|$|Fidelity is a {{word that}} is often used but rarely {{understood}} when talking about groundbased simulation. Assessing the cueing fidelity of a ground based flight simulator requires a comparison to actual flight data either directly or indirectly. Two experiments were conducted at the Vertical Motion Simulator using the GenHel UH- 60 A Black Hawk helicopter math model that was directly compared to flight data. Prior to the experiment the simulator s motion and visual system frequency responses were measured, the aircraft math model was adjusted to account for the simulator motion system delays, and the motion system gains and washouts were tuned for the individual tasks. The tuned motion system fidelity was then assessed against the modified Sinacori criteria. The first experiments showed similar handling qualities ratings (HQRs) to actual flight for a bob-up and sidestep maneuvers. The second experiment showed equivalent HQRs between flight and simulation for the ADS 33 slalom maneuver for the two pilot participants. The ADS 33 vertical maneuver HQRs were mixed with one pilot rating the flight and simulation the same while the second pilot rated the simulation worse.
