5|$|On the April 2, 2007, {{episode of}} Raw, the Hardys won the World Tag Team Championship {{for the sixth}} time in their career after winning a ten team battle royal. After losing singles bouts to both Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, The Hardys {{retained}} their World Tag Team Championship at both Backlash and Judgment Day against the team of Cade and Murdoch. At One Night Stand, Hardyz retained the titles against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) in a ladder match. The next night on Raw, however, the Hardys lost their championship to Cade and Murdoch, when Jeff missed a Swanton Bomb and was pinned by Cade after Murdoch pushed his <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> of the bottom rope of the ring. Cade and Murdoch attacked the Hardys with the championship belts after the match. The Hardys got a rematch at , but was unsuccessful after Jeff {{was hit with a}} sitout spinebuster from Cade.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species of}} birds in the park {{are in danger of}} disappearing. The range of the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is {{restricted}} to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.|$|E

25|$|Chihuahuas {{are also}} known for luxating patella, a genetic {{condition}} that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.|$|E

Tenace's two-out single to left field gave Oakland a 2–1 lead in the fourth inning. The run was controversial to many Tiger fans, as George Hendrick was ruled safe at first base {{just prior to the}} Tenace hit. Hendrick appeared to be out by two steps on a grounder to second, but umpire John Rice ruled that Norm Cash pulled his <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> first base. Replays and photos, however, show that Cash did not pull his foot.

25|$|Carl Froch lost in {{the final}} of the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament in a {{dramatic}} bout against undefeated WBA super-middleweight champion Andre Ward. The vacant The Ring super-middleweight title would be on the line in the fight, as well as Froch and Ward's super-middleweight titles. In the first 7 rounds, Ward outboxed Froch, successfully using his jab to neutralize Froch and beating Froch to the punch from a distance and at close range. In the later rounds, Ward seemed to take his <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the gas, leaving Froch to win a couple of rounds {{near the end of the}} fight, though they were close and fairly competitive rounds. The judges scorecards were 115–113, 115–113 and 118–110, all in favor of Ward. Ward won the vacant The Ring super-middleweight title and is also regarded as becoming Lineal champion with his Super Six World Boxing Classic win against Froch, despite some independent sources rating undefeated IBF title holder Lucian Bute #1 or 2. The fight peaked at 580,000 viewers on Showtime.|$|E
25|$|A first-inning run on an RBI {{ground out}} from Bill Freehan, {{set up by}} a Gene Tenace passed ball that allowed Dick McAuliffe to reach third, gave Detroit an early lead in the {{deciding}} fifth and final game in Detroit. Reggie Jackson's steal of home {{in the second inning}} tied it up, though Jackson was injured in a collision with Freehan and had to leave the game. Tenace's two-out single to left field plated George Hendrick to give Oakland a 2–1 lead in the fourth inning. The run was controversial to many Tiger fans, as Hendrick was ruled safe at first base two batters prior to the Tenace hit. Hendrick appeared to be out by two steps on a grounder to short, but umpire John Rice ruled that Norm Cash pulled his <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> first base.

500|$|Luxating patella {{is another}} health {{issue in the}} Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, through either {{malformation}} or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to [...] "luxate" [...] (jump out of the groove) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain {{is caused by the}} knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur.

500|$|The {{night after}} WrestleMania on Raw, the Hardys competed in a 10-team battle royal for the World Tag Team Championship. They won the titles {{for the sixth}} time from then WWE Champion John Cena and Shawn Michaels after last {{eliminating}} Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch. This started a feud with Cade and Murdoch, and the Hardys successfully retained their World Tag Team Championship in their first title defense at Backlash. The Hardy Boyz would also successfully retain their titles at Judgment Day against Cade and Murdoch. One month later at One Night Stand, they defeated The World's Greatest Tag Team to retain the titles in a Ladder match. [...] The following night on Raw, Vince McMahon demanded that The Hardys once again defend their championships against Cade and Murdoch. The Hardys were defeated after Murdoch pushed Jeff's <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the bottom rope during Cade's pinfall, causing the three count to continue. They invoked their rematch clause against Cade and Murdoch at , but were unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|During an FA Cup tie away against Swindon Town on 23 November, Friday {{began to}} have trouble {{breathing}} and despite leaving the game for five minutes to recuperate with an inhaler was eventually forced to come off for good, coughing violently. After recovering from what {{was reported to be}} a chest infection, he returned to the team on 28 December, having missed four matches, and marked his return with his side's only goal in a 3–1 home defeat to Stockport County. Reading dropped to 12th place on 6 January 1975, and were only three points above the re-election places; however, by the time they took on Workington at home on 3 February they had risen to 10th. Reading won 3–0, with Friday scoring the third goal with a spectacular header: [...] "Diving full length barely a <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the ground, Friday risked life and limb to head home a truly memorable goal", wrote the Evening Post match reporter.

[...] In any case, he immediately felt comfortable playing with Springsteen once more: [...] "Right from the first downbeat of the first rehearsal, it was there again." [...] His drumming for the E Street Band was more relaxed and mature than before, showing more confidence and finesse, and his hands and fingers were in better shape for having done the daily Late Night work. When the tour concluded with ten shows at New York's Madison Square Garden, on several days Weinberg taped the Conan show at Rockefeller Center in the late afternoon, put his hands in ice and changed from his suit into jeans and a vest, and played with Springsteen at night. The experience of doing both left him [...] "professionally speaking, as alive as I've ever felt." [...] Of his position on the drum platform behind Springsteen, he says, [...] "I have the best seat in the house." [...] His energy level was no less, as he could be seen jumping a <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> his seat during some songs. His daughter Ali joined the band on keyboards several times during the tour.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Alive or Just Breathing was generally positive. Erik Thomas from Metalreview.com said [...] "while this album certainly {{is responsible for}} the vast amount of saturation, it stands as a pretty trendsetting, stellar must-own example of metalcore." [...] Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic stated [...] "This is a pure metal album that seemingly has ignored any fashionable trend and instead relies solely on skill and expertise to sculpt some of meatiest heavy metal since the glory days of Metallica and Slayer." [...] Taylor also expressed the impressiveness of the band's [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] work ethic as Dutkiewicz handled all production and D'Antonio [...] "took the time to give much thought on the album's packaging and art direction." [...] Dom Lawson of Kerrang! magazine gave the album five [...] "Ks" [...] (or five out of five stars). He praised the album's unique new sound, music, and vocal performances from Leach. Kevin Boyce of CMJ said, [...] "This album is more addictive than crack cocaine that's been smothered in caffeine and nicotine and drenched with chocolate. Starting with the track 'Numbered Days,' this 12-track platter never takes its <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> of the throttle." [...] Boyce also stated his favorite song from the album was [...] "My Last Serenade," [...] and applauded [...] "Just Barely Breathing," [...] comparing parts of it to Metallica's Ride the Lightning.|$|E

[...] She's been so peripheral and irrelevant over this season, and it felt like a token gesture to foreground her at last. [...] There was a nice pay off though, with a long awaited smooch between her and Jack." [...] Daniel of TMZ graded the episode as a [...] "C+"; however, he wrote that [...] "the Ben/Locke scenes were great and Juliet in a bikini did not disappoint."

I just bowled it right and it was magic really; it just turned a fraction and bounced, and 'Iqqie' nicked it. Brears just dived to his left and caught the ball about a <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the ground, landed in front of Roopey and Willis, Iqqie just looked up the wicket at me, nodded, said, 'Well bowled'; the umpire went bananas, shaking hands and saying, 'I've never seen a hat-trick before, well bowled.'

All the lads around him were adamant he had caught it a <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the ground, but he said, 'No, for the best interests of this series I'm going to bring him back.' So he brought him back – and for the best interests of the series, six of us were lbw in our first innings. It happened, but it was a moment of disappointment because something like that on a Test debut is very special. As somebody once said, 'If bad luck hadn't been invented, we'd have had none at all!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|From then on, Shepherd {{became a}} fixture on the {{international}} scene, his round figure instantly recognisable by players and spectators alike. He was a very jolly character, with red face and white hair under a white flat cap, universally liked {{on and off the}} field. Perhaps his most famous quirk was his habit of lifting one <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the ground whenever the score reached 111, or multiples thereof, they being regarded as unlucky by Shepherd in a ritual dating back to his childhood cricket team days. The number 111 is known as the [...] "Nelson", and is considered unlucky for the batsman. Among other superstitions, he would tie a matchstick to a finger on Friday 13th, so he would be touching wood to bring good luck all day. Also famous was his tendency to shake his hand while signalling fours; to this day, many fans in cricket crowds mimic his action while celebrating fours.|$|E
2500|$|To {{perform the}} [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, the first rider must exit {{the pack and}} coast for about 15 meters in order to slow down. Then the rider on the bike will soft pedal until the right foot is back and level with the left foot in the front. Once the feet are set, the rider will then forcefully pedal backwards. Because the Little 500 Bikes are coaster brakes, this action causes the bike's wheels to stop dead and forces the bike to skid along the cinder track. During this skid, the rider on the bike will take her left <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> the pedal and swing {{it over to the}} right side. Then the left foot will come behind the right and hit the ground, soon {{followed}} by the right foot. This rider will still be running once off the bike and hand it off to the next rider. This is where many riders differ. Some mount the bike by crossing their left foot over and stepping on the left petal and then swinging their right foot over the bike. But more commonly, riders will run and then literally jump onto the bike seat. Both types have their advantages. The step on style can be very slow (if performed incorrectly) and impossible to perform if the pedals are not set properly by the first rider. But it is far less painful for the rider and much more reliable. On the other hand, jumping on the bike guarantees that the rider will get on the bike, and, when performed correctly, is faster than stepping on, but it can be very painful for most riders and often the initial shock of landing causes a momentary delay before the rider starts to get up to speed. This delay can cost crucial seconds when it comes to catching the pack. Also, for men there is the possibility of permanent damage to their reproductive organs. And many women suffer from vaginal bruising. Jumping on is also more dangerous because if performed improperly, riders are likely to take very hard falls.|$|E
