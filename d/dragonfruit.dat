50|$|Having made a {{new life}} on Planet Helheim, Kouta Kazuraba and Mai Takatsukasa find their worldattacked by a {{mechanical}} being called Megahex who abducts Mai. During the epic battle that ensues, assimilating Gaim's memories to learn his language and home world, Megahex opens a portal to the planet.

But Megahex uses Kouta's memories to create a cyborg replica of Ryoma Sengoku to deal with the youth as Kamen Rider Duke <b>Dragonfruit</b> Energy Arms. Retaining his sense of self, Duke has no qualms of being an extension of Megahex as he overpowers Ryugen who is forced to flee with one of the Kurokage Sengoku Drivers. As Mitsuzane is treated by the other Beat Riders who ponder how to deal with this turn of events, he is contacted by Mai in his dreams that she is being held in Megahex's ship.

5000|$|Horticulture, which {{includes}} {{fruits and vegetables}} production, holds {{an important role in}} local Indonesian economy, food security, diet and cuisine. Indonesia possess large variety of horticultural products, with native fruits includes durian, mangosteen, rambutan, salak, banana, jackfruit, mango, kedondong, jambu air, buni, jamblang and kecapi. Majority of local needs of fruits and vegetables are supplied by local traditional farmers. The produces' prices are highly dependent on the seasonal availability and the proximity to production centers, due to transportation and cargo infrastructure restrictions. As the result, the prices of horticulture produces vary greatly throughout Indonesia; the prices might be cheaper in Bandung and Bukittinggi which are closer to horticulture farms, but significantly more expensive in Pekanbaru and Balikpapan which are located far from mountainous production centres. Recently, owed to Indonesian variety of topography, non-tropical horticultural products; such as apple, strawberry, honeydew, grapes and dragon fruit are grown in cooler mountainous region in Indonesia. Mountainous regions around Malang in East Java are known as the production center of apple and <b>dragonfruit,</b> while those around Bandung in West Java are known as strawberry, honeydew and mushroom production center.As the world's fourth largest population, Indonesia possess a large market for horticultural products. Nevertheless, the horticultural sector in Indonesia is deemed as underperforming, which created the need of imported fruits and vegetables. It is often found that the locally grown horticultural produces have inferior quality compared to imported ones. Indonesian horticulture farmers face a problematic situation; the imported horticultural products are often cheaper than the locally produced horticultural products. Compared to neighboring countries with well-developed horticultural sector such as Thailand, Indonesia has much to improve. Currently, Indonesia imported much of its horticultural needs from Thailand (especially durian, carrot and chili pepper), China (especially garlic, orange and pear) and United States (especially soybean and apple). To protect local farmers, Indonesia applied protectionist policy on import settingsfor horticultural products, as well as the restriction of port of entry.Spice is an essential element in Indonesian cuisine. In Indonesian, spice is called rempah, while the mixture of spices is called bumbu, they are chopped finely or ground into paste using traditional stone mortar and pestle, and spread over vegetables, meat, poultry, fish and seafood to add aroma and taste. Known throughout the world as the [...] "Spice Islands", the Indonesian islands of Maluku contributed to the introduction of its native spices to the world. Spices such as pala (nutmeg/mace), cengkeh (clove), daun pandan (Pandan leaves), kluwek (Pangium edule) and laos (galangal) are native to Indonesia. However, surprisingly nutmeg, mace and cloves are seldomly used in Indonesian cuisine.|$|E

In Hawaii, commercial fruit production has recently begun, based on newly introduced varieties. <b>Dragonfruit</b> originating from Vietnam but intercepted in Japan {{has been found}} to be infested by oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, and melon fly, B. cucurbitae. Because both of these tephritid fruit fly species are present in Hawaii, there is risk of infestation by these species in Hawaii, and fruit export requires postharvest quarantine treatment for disinfestation. For <b>dragonfruit</b> production in Hawaii intended both for local sales and for export, there is a need to better understand the risk of infestation and to develop approaches to minimize chances of infestation. In support of the development of <b>dragonfruit</b> as a commercial crop in Hawaii, a <b>dragonfruit</b> orchard on the east side of the island of Hawaii was monitored over the 2007 – 2008 fruiting seasons in order to document the levels and spatial distribution of tephritid fruit fly field populations and the level of infestation, and to develop approaches for suppression of infestation. Low population levels (< 0. 25 flies/trap/day) of both tephritid fruit fly species were present both seasons, with population detection most successful in traps placed in roosting host plants along the orchard border rather than within the orchard. Based on random fruit collections near the end of the production seasons, infestation rate in mature fruits increased from 4. 1 % and 6. 1 % (2007) to 28. 0 % and 8. 0 % (2008) for oriental fruit fly and melon fly, respectively.
