5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.|$|E
5|$|Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, a spirited, tough {{former lover}} of Indiana's. She is the {{daughter}} of Abner Ravenwood, Indiana Jones' mentor, and owns a bar in Nepal. Allen was cast after auditioning with Matheson and John Shea. Spielberg was interested in her, as he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> performance in National Lampoon's Animal House. Sean Young had previously auditioned for the part, while Debra Winger turned it down.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} with Shaw {{led to the}} birth of a daughter in December 1991, although she and Icke had stopped seeing each other by then. Icke wrote in 1993 that he decided not to visit his daughter and <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> only once, at the request of Shaw. Icke's wife gave birth to the couple's second son in November 1992.|$|E

'There {{never was}} a dearer or a blesseder young lady than is my young lady, Sir,' said Susan, 'and I ought to {{know a great deal}} better than some for I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in her grief and I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in her joy (there's not been much of it) and I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> with her brother and I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in her {{loneliness}} and some <b>have</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> and I say to some and all--I do!' and here the black-eyed shook her head, and slightly stamped her foot; 'that she's the blessedest and dearest angel is Miss Floy that ever drew the breath of life, the more that I was torn to pieces Sir the more I'd say it though I may not be a Fox's Martyr..' ...|$|R
50|$|Havias de ter visto a reacção dela ("You should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> reaction") versus Terias visto a reacção dela ("You would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> reaction"). The meaning here {{is quite}} different.|$|R
5|$|Wiesenthal {{was first}} told about Braunsteiner in early 1964 via a chance {{encounter}} in Tel Aviv {{with someone who}} <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> performing selections at Majdanek—deciding who was to be assigned to slave labour and who was to immediately be killed in the gas chambers. When he returned to Vienna he had an operative visit one of her relatives to clandestinely collect information. Wiesenthal soon traced Braunsteiner's whereabouts to Queens, New York, so he notified the Israeli police and the New York Times. In spite of Wiesenthal's efforts to expedite the matter, Braunsteiner was not extradited to Germany until 1973. Her trial {{was part of a}} joint indictment with nine other defendants accused of killing 250,000 people at Majdanek. She was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1981 and died in 1999.|$|E
25|$|After he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> dancing as Lise in La Fille mal gardée in Paris in July 2012, Manuel Legris {{offered her}} to join the Vienna State Ballet as {{principal}} dancer telling her {{at the same time}} to stay the Paris Opera Ballet a little bit more. Mathilde Froustey didn't wait too long.|$|E
25|$|Karen Susan Aldrich, {{a fellow}} patient at the {{hospital}} and friend to Conrad. Released three months before him, and likewise an unsuccessful suicide. When Conrad reads of her later, successful suicide in the newspaper, he is devastated as he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> as a role model for his own successful recovery.|$|E

25|$|Three of Corby's {{travelling}} companions {{claimed in}} their testimony that they <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> pack the bag {{before leaving for}} the airport and that only the flippers and yellow bodyboard were inside it. In contrast to {{the testimony of the}} customs officials, Corby said that she opened the bag herself at the customs counter.|$|E
25|$|Aris died on his 53rd {{birthday}} on 27 March 1999. Since 1989, {{when his}} wife was first placed under house arrest, he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> only five times, the last of which was for Christmas in 1995. She was also separated from her children, {{who live in the}} United Kingdom, but starting in 2011, they have visited her in Burma.|$|E
25|$|The next day, on December 13, Juan Diego {{found his}} uncle fully recovered, as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted {{that he too}} <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> at his bed-side (fifth apparition); that she had {{instructed}} him to inform the bishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; {{and that she had}} told him she desired to be known under the title of Guadalupe.|$|E
60|$|The {{spelling}} is correct, for I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> write it. No {{doubt she}} had been named by ear; but she so splendidly bore the orthography that Tom Moore himself (<b>had</b> he <b>seen</b> <b>her)</b> would <b>have</b> endorsed the phonography.|$|R

25|$|Hattie McDaniel earned {{that gold}} Oscar by her fine {{performance}} of 'Mammy' in Gone with the Wind. If you <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> {{face when she}} {{walked up to the}} platform and took the gold trophy, you would have had the choke in your voice that all of us had when Hattie, hair trimmed with gardenias, face alight, and dress up to the queen's taste, accepted the honor in one of the finest speeches ever given on the Academy floor.|$|E
25|$|Russell next {{appeared}} in August Rush, released in November 2007. She also {{appeared on the}} cover of the New York Posts Page Six magazine on November 11, 2007. Russell later {{appeared in}} Bedtime Stories. In an appearance on The View on December 15, 2008, Russell said she got the part because Adam Sandler's wife Jackie <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in Waitress and suggested her for the movie. Russell voiced Wonder Woman in a direct-to-video animated feature released March 3, 2009.|$|E
25|$|When Theseus {{abandoned}} Ariadne {{sleeping on}} Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. She bore him a son named Oenopion, but {{he committed suicide}} or was killed by Perseus. In some variants, he had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into Hades to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another different account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne {{on the island of}} Naxos for he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never mind, my dear boy,' {{retorted}} Noggs, clapping {{him on the}} shoulder. 'I <b>HAVE</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> You shall <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> I've managed it all.' ...|$|R

25|$|While {{living in}} Los Angeles, Dizon {{worked as a}} promotional model for local car shows. Eventually, her {{photographs}} were posted online. It was reported that there were 2 million Google hits within an entire year, {{with the majority of}} the viewers being located in China and Japan. Much of the attention received was attributed to her unique looks. She was asked by many Japanese fans—who <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> photographs—to work in their country, which eventually prompted her to submit several demo tapes and dance videos to Victor Entertainment. An agent offered and signed her to a recording contract.|$|E
25|$|By March 1822, it {{had been}} two years since she <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> daughter. She plotted to kidnap Allegra from the convent and asked Shelley to forge a letter of {{permission}} from Byron. Shelley refused her request. Byron's seemingly callous treatment of the child was further vilified when Allegra died there at age five from a fever some scholars identify as typhus and others speculate was a malarial-type fever. Clairmont held Byron entirely responsible {{for the loss of}} their daughter and hated him {{for the rest of her}} life. Shelley's death followed only two months later.|$|E
25|$|To the {{surprise}} of her critics, who <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> as embodying liberalism that the Catholic Church disapproved of, she had a close working relationship with the Church. She visited Irish nuns and priests abroad regularly, {{and became the first}} president to host an Áras reception for the Christian Brothers. When on a working trip to Rome, she requested, and was granted, an audience with Pope John Paul II. The outfit she wore was condemned by a controversial young priest, Fr. David O'Hanlon, in The Irish Times for supposedly breaking Vatican dress codes on her visit; the Vatican denied that she had– the Vatican dress codes had been changed early in John Paul's pontificate– an analysis echoed by Ireland's Roman Catholic Bishops who distanced themselves from Fr. O' Hanlon's comments.|$|E

He threw himself back in his chair, and covered his face and wept.|$|R

25|$|The {{wife of a}} local lodging-house deputy, Caroline Maxwell, {{claimed to}} have seen Kelly alive at about 8:30 {{on the morning of}} the murder, though she {{admitted}} to only meeting her once or twice before; moreover, her description did not match that of those who knew Kelly more closely. Maurice Lewis, a tailor, reported seeing Kelly at about 10:00 that same morning in a pub. Both statements were dismissed by the police since they did not fit the accepted time of death; moreover, they could find no one else to confirm the reports. Maxwell may have either mistaken someone else for Kelly, or mixed up the day she <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> Such confusion was used as a plot device in the graphic novel From Hell (and subsequent movie adaptation).|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1995, a 14-year-old girl {{fell from}} her seat on the coaster and died. The park owner at the time, Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc., and ride manufacturer, Dinn Corporation, said she was {{switching}} seats when the accident occurred. A riding companion claimed that safety restraints (a lap bar and seat belt) had come undone on a sharp turn {{at the top of}} one of the ride's hills. But, Worlds of Fun officials claimed that witnesses <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> remove her restraints and tried to switch seats and that there had been no malfunction, though her family disputed this. The ride was temporarily closed pending an investigation of its safety features, which resulted in new lap bar installations. Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc. and Dinn Corporation settled with the family for $200,000. This makes the Timber Wolf the only ride so far at Worlds of Fun with a fatality.|$|E
25|$|Fifth apparition: {{the next}} day Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered, as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he too <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> at his bed-side; that she had {{instructed}} him to inform the bishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; {{and that she had}} told him she desired to be known under the title of Guadalupe. The bishop kept Juan Diego's mantle first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531 a procession formed for taking the miraculous image back to Tepeyac where it was installed in a small hastily erected chapel. In course of this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when an Indian was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays executed in honour of the Virgin. In great distress, the Indians carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim made a full and immediate recovery.|$|E
