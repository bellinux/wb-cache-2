5|$|The {{reaction}} to the award was surprise, with the award's lack of reasoning a particular concern. The Venezuelans were keenly disappointed with the outcome, though they honored their counsel <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>efforts</b> (their delegation's Secretary, Severo Mallet-Prevost, received the Order of the Liberator in 1944), and abided by the award.|$|E

5|$|Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri praised {{his team}} <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>efforts,</b> {{and said that}} despite a few regrets, they could exit with {{confidence}} from their performance.

5|$|Ernst's rule, {{and that}} of his four Wittelsbach successors, {{strengthened}} the position of his family in Imperial politics. The victory of the Catholic party further consolidated the Counter-Reformation in the northwest territories of the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the bishoprics of Münster, Paderborn, Osnabrück and Minden, which were bordered by Protestant territories. Once Ernst's brother or such allies as the Duke of Parma regained control, Jesuits efficiently identified any recalcitrant Protestants and converted them to Catholicism. The Counter-Reformation was thoroughly applied in the lower Rhineland, with the goal that every Protestant, whether Lutheran or Calvinist, would be brought to the Catholic fold. <b>For</b> <b>their</b> <b>efforts,</b> the Spanish acquired important bridgeheads on the Rhine River, securing a land route to the rebellious northern provinces, which helped to extend an already long war of secession well into the next century.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Viet Cong {{had won a}} clear victory over the regular units of the South Vietnamese army, they did not get away with light casualties. After the battle, a {{combined}} total of 126 Viet Cong bodies were recovered within the Special Forces compound and the district headquarters, and several hundred more were strewn all over the battlefield. Indeed, individual Viet Cong soldiers usually spare no efforts to evacuate their dead or wounded comrades; but as military operations were conducted during the rainy season, the Viet Cong struggled to evacuate all their casualties from the battlefield as conditions on the main roads deteriorated. Despite the minor setbacks, the Đồng Xoài campaign marked the rapid maturity of the Viet Cong 9th Division as a fighting force. <b>For</b> <b>their</b> <b>efforts</b> during the battle, the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment received the title of 'Đồng Xoài Regiment' to mark their achievements.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>their</b> <b>efforts</b> the men {{are given}} a week's leave: the {{airfield}} where they are based comes under enemy artillery bombardment; Bell receives a letter from his wife informing him that she has {{fallen in love with}} someone else and wishes to divorce; Captain Staros is relieved of his command by Lieutenant Colonel Tall, who deems him too soft for the pressures of combat and suggests that he apply for reassignment and become a lawyer in the JAG in Washington. He offers to arrange a Purple Heart for Staros, to avoid the unit's name being stained by having an officer removed from command. Witt comes across the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of him and quarrel regularly with one another.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>their</b> <b>efforts,</b> 9 Staffel {{destroyed}} {{at least}} three hangars, hit several other buildings and destroyed eight Hurricanes on the ground. According to other sources, 10 hangars were destroyed, six damaged, the operations room put out of action, and many buildings were destroyed. It would have been worse had the bombs been released higher. A lot of bombs landed horizontally and did not explode on impact. To achieve this level of damage, KG 76 dropped nine tons of bombs. At {{the end of the}} day just one hangar was left operational at Kenley. The low-level raid put the airfield out of commission for two hours. In combat, two Hurricanes were shot down by the Dorniers' return fire. In return 9 Staffel lost four Do 17s, three slightly damaged and two seriously damaged. Low-level attacks were abandoned after The Hardest Day.|$|E

5|$|The adverse {{conditions}} {{faced by the}} keepers resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, but the remote location suited some veterans. Archibald McEachern was assistant keeper for 14 years from 1870–84 and John Nicol was principal from 1890–1903. The latter {{was involved in a}} dramatic rescue when the liner Labrador en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool ran aground on the nearby Mackenzie's Rock in 1899. The lifeboats were manned and two made it to Mull, but one with eighteen passengers reached the lighthouse where they were looked after {{for two and a half}} days before they could be taken to the mainland.
