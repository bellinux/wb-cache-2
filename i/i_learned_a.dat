500|$|After being {{attacked}} by the crows, Homer is seen being treated by Dr. Hibbert at the Springfield General Hospital. While there are no visible scars on him, the character instead has a slightly curled hair. During a color screening of the scene, Homer's body looked [...] "a little too bloody" [...] and damaged, prompting the staff to change it. [...] "One thing <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> long time ago is, you gotta be careful how you change [...] basic model pack", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary.

[...] "They don't mind if [...] falls down a cliff but [...] he should recover." [...] While working on the episode, the series' staff debated what size to make Homer's pupils when he is under the influence of marijuana. Because a common effect of smoking marijuana is to get dilated pupils, the animators initially suggested to widen them, but settled on only dilating Homer's pupils slightly.|$|E
500|$|Jimi Hendrix {{began his}} career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and {{performed}} and recorded with several popular R artists, including the Isley Brothers, Don Covay, and Little Richard. He learned from other R guitarists, including Curtis Mayfield, who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording. [...] Hendrix toured as a support act with Mayfield in 1963. [...] He described the experience: [...] "The best gig was with Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions. [...] Curtis was a really good guitarist... <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> lot in that short time. [...] He probably influenced me more than anyone I'd ever played with up to that time, that sweet sound of his, you know". [...] In 1966, Hendrix recorded a song titled [...] "(My Girl) She's a Fox" [...] with the Icemen, an R duo. Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro has described it as [...] "paced and phrased in the style of Curtis Mayfield, [...] is virtually a blueprint for 'Little Wing'". [...] Later Hendrix producer John McDermott called his contribution to [...] "She's a Fox" [...] (included on the 2010 [...] ) [...] "perhaps the strongest of his pre-Experience career.

500|$|Critics panned Glitter, {{as well as}} its {{accompanying}} soundtrack; {{both were}} unsuccessful commercially. The accompanying soundtrack album, Glitter, became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch dismissed it as [...] "an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that, while not always critically heralded, was at least nearly consistently successful." [...] Following the negative cloud that was ensuing Carey's personal life at the time, as well as the project's poor reception, her unprecedented $100million five-album record deal with Virgin Records America (EMI Records) was bought out for $50million. Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year. Carey later said that her time at Virgin was [...] "a complete and total stress-fest [...] I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> big lesson from that."

She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Tommy Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives.
