The Kingdom of Italy was unhappy with this, and convinced the Allies to share the Austro-Hungarian ships among the victorious powers. As a result, the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were 12 torpedo boats, and they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> their naval forces almost from scratch.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{started in}} May 1965 and NTNF {{planned to use}} {{as much of the}} mining company Kings Bay's {{facilities}} as they could. NTNF was allowed to use buildings as needed for free. In exchange, NTNF maintained the entire village and paid insurance on the buildings they used. Movable property used by NTNF was bought for a moderate price. NTNF <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> several new buildings in addition to utilities such as power cables and water, sewer and heating pipes. The new pipes had to be installed after the previous pipes, installed in 1956, had been subject to frost burst. Instead of building the pipes in a culvert, they were instead placed in wooded boxes above ground. During the summer of 1965, 65 people were working on construction, although it fell to between 40 and 45 during the winter. The following winter, only five people overwintered.|$|E
5|$|Former Germany manager Berti Vogts was {{appointed}} Scotland manager in January 2002. A {{number of players}} retired from international football after Craig Brown resigned, which meant that Vogts <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a new squad. He tried new players and formations, but the team suffered a number of heavy defeats in early friendly fixtures. Scotland reached the UEFA Euro 2004 qualification play-offs and won the first leg at home against the Netherlands, but were then beaten 6–0 in the return match. Vogts continued as manager into the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification matches, but resigned after the team took just two points from their first three matches. Debate about why Vogts had failed centred on whether Scotland had sufficient playing talent to compete, or if poor results had been due to his own failings.|$|E
5|$|In October 1920, the {{question}} was finally settled when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye provided for {{the transfer of the}} obsolete coastal defence ship , eight s, four older s, the repair ship Cyclop, the water carriers Najade and Nixe, the salvage vessel Gigant, three tugs, the yacht Dalmat, four hulks, four river monitors (Bosna, Enns, Körös and Bodrog), one motor launch, three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil lighters. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921. As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats, the new nation <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> its naval forces from scratch.|$|E

5|$|Neighbours is an Australian {{television}} soap opera. It {{was first}} broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It {{was created by}} TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed {{the idea of making}} a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's digital channel, Eleven.|$|E

The new network <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> replica sets when it took over production after Seven destroyed the original sets {{to prevent the}} rival network obtaining them. Ten began screening the series with episode 171 on 20 January 1986. In 1986, the series was bought by the BBC {{as part of their}} new daytime schedule in the United Kingdom. Neighbours made its debut on BBC1 on 27 October 1986 starting with the pilot episode. It soon gained a loyal audience and the show became particularly popular with younger viewers, and before long was watched by up to 16million viewers - more than the entire population of Australia at the time. In 1988 Neighbours became the only television show to have its entire cast flown over to the UK to make an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance in front of the Queen. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and the seventh longest running serial drama still on the air in the world. In 2005, Neighbours celebrated its 20th anniversary and over twenty former cast members returned for a special episode, which saw them sitting down to watch a documentary about Ramsay Street. At the Logie Award ceremony that year, the show was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese sappers built a {{pontoon bridge}} over the Guadiana river which united two Portuguese {{quarters}} in Vado del Moro and allowed Mendes de Vasconcelos' troops to cross the river. Having reinforced Santa Engracia, north of San Critsóbal, and fortified a {{bridge over the}} Gévora river, they built, unmolested, an arc of the circumvallation from Gévora to Vado del Moro. Fort del Mayordomo, located near the Guadiana river, had been abandoned by its Spanish garrison shortly after being built. The Portuguese used it to cover {{the construction of the}} circumvallation line to the Guadiana. They also tried to occupy Cerro del Viento, a hill near Vado del Moro, but were repelled by the Spanish garrison that was there and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the circumvallation line behind it. Given the strategic importance of Cerro del Viento, the nearby hill of Cerro de las Mayas had been earmarked for an improvised star fortification by the Italian general Ventura de Tarragona, but it had not been built, leaving the Fort of San Miguel vulnerable.|$|E

Probably in the next century, the kings also prohibited the building of walls around Muslim settlements.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} signing of the Israel-Jordan {{armistice}} agreement, general Yigal Allon proposed to conquer the West Bank up to the Jordan River as the natural, defensible border of the state. Ben-Gurion refused, although he was aware that the IDF was militarily strong enough to carry out the conquest. He feared the reaction of Western powers and wanted to maintain good relations with the United States and not to provoke the British. More, the results of the war were already satisfactory and Israeli leaders <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a nation.|$|E
25|$|Triremes {{required}} {{a great deal}} of upkeep in order to stay afloat, as references to the replacement of ropes, sails, rudders, oars and masts in the middle of campaigns suggest. They also would become waterlogged if left in the sea for too long. In order to prevent this from happening, ships would have to be pulled from the water during the night. The use of lightwoods meant that the ship could be carried ashore by as few as 140 men. Beaching the ships at night however, would leave the troops vulnerable to surprise attacks. While well-maintained triremes would last up to 25 years, during the Peloponnesian War, Athens <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> nearly 20 triremes a year to maintain their fleet of 300.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, {{nearly half}} a million Allied troops invaded Sicily. Crime soared in the {{upheaval}} and chaos. Many inmates escaped from their prisons, banditry returned, and the black market thrived. During {{the first six months of}} Allied occupation, party politics were banned in Sicily. Most institutions were destroyed, with the exception of the police and carabinieri, and the American occupiers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a new order from scratch. As Fascist mayors were deposed, the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT) simply appointed replacements. Many turned out to be mafiosi, such as Calogero Vizzini and Giuseppe Genco Russo. They could easily present themselves as political dissidents, and their anti-communist position gave them additional credibility. Mafia bosses reformed their clans, absorbing some of the marauding bandits into their ranks.|$|E
25|$|The {{trail is}} located in Hope, New York, 5 {{and a half miles}} South of Wells, NY. It is a 1.8 mile trail, {{including}} 3 waterfalls each ranging between 10 and 30 feet tall. The trail was originally a major logging road that ran to Devorse creek, but the road was abandoned and later the first 2 miles of it began seeing use as a hiking trail. Part of the old road runs along a steep gorge, where loggers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a flying trestle to allow horses to pull logs from nearby camps. Groff mountain has a large population of eastern hemlock and red spruce. Historically, these attracted tanners from nearby towns. Because of the dense forestation, the area is largely shaded, and so often maintains snow throughout the winter. The trail sees use from hikers during the spring and summer, and snowshoers in winter. There is a small parking area for the trail at the end of River road.|$|E
25|$|The stations' {{placement}} in the Empire State Building {{became a major}} issue {{with the construction of}} the World Trade Center's Twin Towers during the late 1960s and early 1970s. As the towers were taller than the Empire State Building, this would cause waves from the Empire State Building to sometimes bounce off the walls of the taller Twin Towers. As a result, some broadcasters decided that {{it would be easier to}} move to the Twin Towers instead, rather than suing the complex's developer, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, to stop construction. Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a mast and transmission equipment in the North Tower, as well as pay the broadcasters' leases in the Empire State Building until 1984. After the leases expired, there were very few broadcasters remaining in the Empire State Building.|$|E
