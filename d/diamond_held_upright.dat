50|$|Rolly {{also has}} a G force sensor (accelerometer) which detects if the player is laying {{horizontally}} or being <b>held</b> <b>upright.</b> When <b>held</b> <b>upright,</b> the track next/previous can be controlled by the top wheel and volume up/down can be controlled by the bottom wheel. Tracks can be shuffled by holding the unit upright, pressing the button once, then shaking the unit up and down (light color changes to purple). You can return to continuous play (light color blue) by simply repeating this process.|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with the seam <b>held</b> <b>upright,</b> with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Of course, consistently hitting the seam is {{not as easy as}} it sounds. The seam has to be <b>held</b> <b>upright</b> between the index finger and the middle finger {{at the time of the}} delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably a perfect example.|$|R

The strings were tunable by adjusting wooden wedges along the cross-bar.|$|R
25|$|Males of some {{indigenous}} {{tribes of}} the Amazon Basin live nude {{except for a}} light string worn around the waistline.

50|$|The whip is <b>held</b> <b>upright</b> in {{the right}} hand, {{going back to the}} {{tradition}} where the sword would be held {{in such a way as}} a salute. This method is rarely practiced today, although still seen used by the Spanish Riding School, the Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre, and the mounted troops of the household cavalry in London, England.|$|R
5|$|The usual form of {{locomotion}} is hopping, {{with both}} feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously. However, birds may run when performing the rodent-run display. Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually <b>held</b> <b>upright</b> and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.|$|R
2500|$|... the kithara, also a strummed string instrument, more {{complicated}} than the lyre. It had a box-type frame with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the sounding box at the bottom; it was <b>held</b> <b>upright</b> and played with a plectrum. The strings were tunable by adjusting wooden wedges along the cross-bar. It is one possible origin of the contemporary [...] guitar.|$|R

5000|$|Because of a {{reliance}} on gravity to coat the ball with ink, ballpoint pens must be <b>held</b> <b>upright</b> in order to properly dispense the ink; {{with the exception of}} Space Pens, ballpoints cannot be used to write upside down.Additionally, [...] "blobbing" [...] of ink on the drawing surface and [...] "skipping" [...] of ink-flow require consideration when using ballpoint pens for artistic purposes.|$|R
