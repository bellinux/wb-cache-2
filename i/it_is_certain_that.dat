5|$|Even though Thomas is {{the first}} known Bishop of Finland, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> {{he was not the}} first bishop overall. An unnamed Bishop of Finland is {{mentioned}} dead in a letter by Pope Innocent III already in 1209. A 15th-century chronicle names bishops Henry, Rodulff and Folquinus before him, but no indisputable records survive of them.|$|E
5|$|Following a Viking raid in 994, a {{peace treaty}} was agreed {{with one of the}} raiders, Olaf Tryggvason. Besides {{receiving}} danegeld, Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> {{most of the}} Christian {{residents}} of Jifna in the 12th century were local inhabitants. Apart from local Christians {{there was also a}} Frankish settlement, as is attested by the ruins of a maison forte (manor) built in {{the lower part of the}} village. In Jifna, like in many other sites in Palestine, the Crusaders built their settlement in the heart of the local Christian settlement.|$|E
5|$|Most {{activities}} {{were open to}} slaves except politics, which was reserved for citizens. The principal use of slaves was in agriculture, but hundreds of slaves were also used in stone quarries or mines, and perhaps two per household were domestic servants. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Athens had the largest slave population, {{with as many as}} 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, with average of three or four slaves per household, except in poor families.|$|E
5|$|Raynald {{accompanied}} Baldwin to Antioch in 1151 {{and settled}} in the principality, according to Steven Runciman. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Raynald fought in Baldwin's army during the Siege of Ascalon in early 1153. He may have already been engaged to Constance of Antioch (as Runciman suggests), or their betrothal took place during Raynald's visit to the principality {{before the end of}} the siege (as Malcolm Barber proposes). They kept their betrothal a secret until Baldwin gave his permission to their marriage.|$|E

5|$|Whether {{the father}} of Constance's second son, Baldwin, was Raymond of Poitiers or Raynald of Châtillon cannot be {{determined}} with certainty. Baldwin died fighting {{at the head of}} a Byzantine cavalry regiment in the Battle of Myriokephalon on September17, 1176. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Raynald fathered Agnes, who became the wife of Béla III of Hungary. Raynald and Constance's second daughter, Alice, became the third wife of Azzo VI of Este in 1204.|$|E
5|$|Chesney's family {{originated}} from Quesnay-Guesnon in the Calvados region of Normandy near Bayeux in France, {{but they had}} settled in the Midlands of England and held lands there, particularly in Oxfordshire. His parents were Roger de Chesney and Alice de Langetot. His brother William de Chesney remained a layman, {{and became one of}} Oxfordshire's leading landowners. Another brother, Reginald, was the abbot of Evesham Abbey. Chesney's sister Agnes was married to Robert Foliot, steward to the Earl of Huntingdon. Agnes and Robert were probably the parents of Gilbert Foliot, later Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Although it is a surmise that Foliot's mother was a sibling of Chesney, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Chesney was Gilbert's uncle.|$|E
5|$|Stan was {{associated}} with a large area of loosely organized but very heavy shower activity existing over Mexico and Central America during this time. Torrential rainfall in this area caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides which were responsible for at least 1,662 deaths in six countries; 1,500 of these casualties occurred in Guatemala alone. Initially, more than a thousand deaths were attributed to Hurricane Stan, but the National Hurricane Center postulates that all but less than 100 of the deaths were more related to the larger weather event. This was not definitively confirmed in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Hurricane Stan, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> only 80-100 deaths resulted from the direct effects of the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} use {{of slavery}} was in agriculture, {{the foundation of}} the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two. An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the Economy of Xenophon or that of Pseudo-Aristotle) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is disputed. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not know of the immense slave populations found on the Roman latifundia.|$|E
5|$|This {{was to be}} {{the last}} {{military}} engagement of Nansouty's long career. On 8 March, {{on the eve of the}} Battle of Laon, Nansouty was at Chavignon, nine kilometres from Laon, where the Emperor was also present and, although the circumstances of Nansouty's departure are unclear, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> he left this village, and his command, that very day. Two days later, Napoleon wrote to his War Minister to inform him that General Nansouty's health did not allow him to exercise his military duties and that he was authorised to take sick leave in Paris. General Belliard had taken interim command of the Guard cavalry during the battle of Laon, with General Sébastiani subsequently given permanent command.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, {{given the lack of}} a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, on average three or four slaves per household. In the 5th century BC, Thucydides remarked on the desertion of 20,890 slaves during the war of Decelea, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of Demosthenes, corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant Demetrius Phalereus ordered a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves. The orator Hypereides, in his Against Areistogiton, recalls that the effort to enlist 15,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Southern Greeks at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), which corresponds to the figures of Ctesicles.|$|E

5|$|There are {{at least}} five {{competing}} theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the book, or perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona, then brought to Kells, where the illuminations were perhaps added, and never finished. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona. Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells. Fourth, {{it may have been}} produced in the north of England, perhaps at Lindisfarne, then brought to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, {{it may have been the}} product of an unknown monastery in Pictish Scotland, though there is no actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland. Although the question of the exact location of the book's production will probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted. Regardless of which theory is true, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} Michael's {{establishment}} in Epirus is obscure. The hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, {{written in the}} late 13th century, maintains that Alexios III had appointed Michael as governor in the Peloponnese and a certain Senachereim, who was Michael's relative by marriage (they both had married first cousins from the Melissenos family), as governor of the Theme of Nicopolis in Epirus. When the local inhabitants rose in revolt against him, Senachereim called upon Michael for aid. Michael rushed to Nicopolis, but not before the locals had killed Senachereim. After that, Michael, himself widowed, took Senachereim's widow as his wife and succeeded him as governor. Although generally regarded as inaccurate due to the many errors it contains, {{this part of the}} hagiography is at least partially corroborated by Villehardouin's account that he married the daughter of a local magnate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Michael was never appointed governor of the Peloponnese, but the hagiography's reference to the peninsula has led to suggestions by modern scholars that he is to be identified with the Michael who led the Peloponnesian Greeks in the Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras against the Crusaders, in the summer of 1205. This commonly held identification has been questioned by more recent research by the historian Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, who suggests that Michael leaving Epirus, which still was not securely under his control, to go on campaign in the Peloponnese would have been extremely unlikely as it would leave Epirus open to attack by Boniface. Loenertz does however consider that Michael may indeed have led another expedition into the Peloponnese a few years later, in 1207–09 (see below).|$|E
25|$|Another {{candidate}} for the psychoactive drug is an opioid derived from the poppy. The cult of the goddess Demeter may have brought the poppy from Crete to Eleusis; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> opium was produced in Crete.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> {{many more}} miles of cave {{passages}} await discovery in the region.

25|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> {{in theory}} hypergamy {{can cause a}} {{shortage}} of marriageable women in the lowest ranks of a caste and promote upwards social movement from the lower Nair subdivisions, the numbers involved {{would have been very}} small. It was not a common practice outside the higher subcaste groups.|$|E
25|$|While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> colonists {{in large}} numbers were {{imported}} {{from all over the}} empire to settle in Roman Dacia, this appears to be true for the newly created Roman towns only. The lack of epigraphic evidence for native Dacian names in the towns suggests an urban–rural split between Roman multi-ethnic urban centres and the native Dacian rural population.|$|E
