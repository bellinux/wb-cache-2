She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask me to do it again, I would do it again. But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design is {{something you have to}} put your hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> track of the whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E

500|$|The Triple Entente {{between the}} United Kingdom, France, and Russia had been signed in 1907. Germany had become {{significantly}} isolated—on the Continent, Germany was {{hemmed in by}} France {{in the west and}} Russia in the east, and the UK, with her powerful navy, was capable of blocking German access to the world shipping lanes. Admiral von Tirpitz reacted to this development with the request for newer and stronger capital ships. His thoughts on the matter were, [...] "The aim which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in view ... for technical and organizing reasons as well as reasons of political finance was to build as steadily as possible." [...] His appeal {{came in the form of}} the proposed Second Amendment to the Naval Law, which was passed on 27 March 1908.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of her self-titled debut album, Carey desired to pen her {{personal}} struggles prior to her signing with Columbia. She hoped to give her fans {{an idea of what}} her life two years prior and to instill relief or inspiration in them. In the song, Carey sings [...] "Not more than three short years ago / I was abandoned and alone / Without a penny to my name / So very young and so afraid / No proper shoes upon my feet / Sometimes I couldn't even eat / I often cried myself to sleep." [...] Later in the song, Carey sings [...] "But still <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on going / I struggled and I prayed / And finally found my way," [...] retelling how her faith helped guide her until her career blossomed and expressing to listeners the importance of finding and connecting with God.

500|$|Liverpool captain Yeats {{collected}} the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II in the Royal box at Wembley Stadium. The victory was the club's {{first in the}} competition. Liverpool manager Shankly was delighted with the result and hailed the achievement: [...] "To think a team like Liverpool had never won the FA up was unbelievable, so many had prayed {{for it to happen}} over all the years, but it had never come to pass. So when we beat Leeds, the emotion was unforgettable." [...] Despite breaking his collarbone in the opening minutes, Liverpool defender Gerry Byrne completed the whole match. Shankly was full of praise for the defender stating: [...] "Byrne was absolutely fantastic. He played the best game of his life." [...] Bryne was concerned about collecting his medal, stating: [...] "I was worried about going up to collect my medal, so many of our fans wanted to slap me on the back. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> twisting and turning to avoid the congratulations." ...|$|E

Having [...] "brushed up the lyrics a bit", {{as he puts it}} in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band. Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled to be asked to play on his record … It was the most exciting thing to happen to me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pinching myself to remember it was real." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. All I had to do was look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E

Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 was that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you have to go back to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder to criss-cross all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a notable}} {{contemporary}} act of conscience, Christian bushwalker Brenda Hean protested against the flooding of Lake Pedder despite threats and that {{ultimately lead to}} her death. Another was the campaign by Ken Saro-Wiwa against oil extraction by multinational corporations in Nigeria {{that led to his}} execution. So too was the act by the Tank Man, or the Unknown Rebel photographed holding his shopping bag in the path of tanks during the protests at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 5 June 1989. The actions of United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld to try and achieve peace in the Congo despite the (eventuating) threat to his life, were strongly motivated by conscience as is reflected in his diary, Vägmärken (Markings). Another example involved the actions of Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, Jr to try and prevent the My Lai Massacre in the Vietnam War. Evan Pederick voluntarily confessed and was convicted of the Sydney Hilton bombing stating that his conscience could not tolerate the guilt and that [...] "I guess I was quite unique in the prison system in that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> proving my guilt, whereas everyone else said they were innocent." [...] Vasili Arkhipov was a Russian naval officer on out-of-radio-contact Soviet submarine B-59 being depth-charged by US warships during the Cuban Missile Crisis whose dissent when two other officers decided to launch a nuclear torpedo (unanimous agreement to launch was required) may have averted a nuclear war. In 1963 Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc performed a famous act of self-immolation to protest against alleged persecution of his faith by the Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem regime.|$|E
500|$|A big storyline {{occurred}} {{for the character}} in 2008, when Phoebe is killed after the car her boyfriend Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder) was driving crashes. Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was so tiny and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my emotions in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and maybe I am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E

However, in the Anderson appeal, Chief Justice Gleeson said Pederick's account of the bombing was [...] "clearly unreliable".

2500|$|It was Mario Bauzá who {{introduced}} bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to the Cuban conga drummer and composer Chano Pozo. Gillespie and Pozo's brief collaboration produced {{some of the}} most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. [...] "Manteca" [...] (1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinatos) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: [...] "If I'd let it go like [...] wanted it, it would have been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge." [...] The bridge gave [...] "Manteca" [...] a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza's modal [...] "Tanga" [...] of a few years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|According to the EastEnders Handbook by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for {{roles in}} EastEnders is usually done locally, so that {{children}} and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree. Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time. This occurred with Steven’s original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. The baby had been scripted to appear at a Guy Fawkes Night party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: [...] "Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pushing her hair back under her hat but lots of [...] still spotted it". Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven’s christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, [...] "When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn’t recover and I kissed him for it." ...|$|E
