Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that [...] "here's always going to be an opposition.

[...] Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, [...] "The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and hurt people, they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries is that the people who feel they should be governed under the Sharia Law, are not a fringe.

Islam can become a religion of peace, if politics is divorced from religion", and she stated that: [...] "The individual that wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam, is inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam, the example of the prophet Mohammed, the clergy that preached to him, and the reward that he will get in the hereafter." ...|$|E
