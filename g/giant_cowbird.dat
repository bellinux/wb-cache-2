5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the <b>giant</b> <b>cowbird</b> — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The <b>giant</b> <b>cowbird</b> is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
50|$|Their icterid hosts breed colonially, {{and defend}} their nests vigorously, so even a large, bold and {{aggressive}} species like the <b>giant</b> <b>cowbird</b> has to cover an extensive territory to find sufficient egg-laying opportunities. Several <b>giant</b> <b>cowbird</b> eggs may be laid in one host nest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>cowbird</b> (Molothrus oryzivorus) {{is a large}} {{passerine}} bird in the New World family Icteridae. It breeds {{from southern}} Mexico south to northern Argentina, and on Trinidad and Tobago. It may have relatively recently colonised the latter island.|$|E
50|$|Inca jays usually build a nest {{in a tree}} or in a thorny bush or thicket, and {{the female}} lays three to five eggs. Only the female incubates, but both parents {{take care of the}} young. In Colombia, Inca jays are {{recorded}} as retaining offspring for several years, and those young help the parents raise more chicks. In Venezuela, they have been observed being victims of nest parasitism by <b>giant</b> <b>cowbirds.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{a colonial}} breeder which builds a hanging woven nest of fibres and vines, 60 - 100 cm long, {{high in a}} tree. There may be 40-50 females and only 4-5 males in a colony. The female lays two dark-marked pale blue eggs which hatch in 17 days and fledge in 30. Botflies (Oestridae) are {{the main cause of}} {{nestling}} mortality, but brood parasitism by <b>giant</b> <b>cowbirds</b> (Molothrus oryzivorus) also occurs, and the young cowbirds will feed on the fly larvae.|$|R
40|$|The {{allocation}} of resources to young that will ultimately be left to die appears counterintuitive. Yet obligate brood reduction has evolved {{in a number of}} species, despite the waste of reproductive investment this may incur. Here we test whether brood parasitism could be one factor leading to the evolution of obligate brood reduction because surplus eggs in the nest during incubation offer some protection from the costs of parasitism. Surplus eggs could benefit females in two ways. First, additional eggs may protect against the direct costs of parasitism by facilitating recognition and removal of parasitic eggs with greater accuracy. Second, additional eggs may protect against the indirect costs of parasitism as parasites often damage or remove host eggs when entering the host nest; surplus eggs may be an essential insurance strategy against this damage. We test these possibilities in the Montezuma Oropendola (Psarocolius Montezuma), a species experiencing high levels of parasitism by <b>Giant</b> <b>Cowbirds</b> (Scaphidura oryzivora) throughout their range. Overall rejection rates of cowbird eggs were high (72 %), and experimental addition of parasitic eggs to empty, one-, and two-egg nests demonstrated that recognition success was unaffected by the presence of additional host eggs for comparison. However, the value of surplus eggs when one egg was removed or damaged by a parasite was high; 31. 6 % of successful two-egg clutches lost a single egg during incubation and would have failed to produce a chick without a second egg. This was directly attributable to parasitism in at least 33 % of all cases. Therefore, despite highly developed host defenses against direct costs of parasitism (recognition and removal of parasitic eggs), the associated indirect costs (egg damage and removal) could {{play an important role in}} selection for a clutch size that results in more chicks than can be raise...|$|R
50|$|Green oropendolas are gregarious, colonial {{birds and}} build long, bag-shaped nests that dangle from the {{branches}} of a tree. The birds are polygamous. The nests of green oropendolas are sometimes parasitised by the <b>giant</b> <b>cowbird</b> (Molothrus oryzivorus) which lays its eggs in their nests.|$|E

50|$|The male <b>giant</b> <b>cowbird</b> is 36 cm long, weighs 180 g and is {{iridescent}} black, {{with a long}} tail, long bill, small head, and a neck ruff {{which is}} expanded in display. The female is smaller, averaging 28 cm long and weighing 135 g. She is less iridescent than the male, {{and the absence of}} the neck ruff makes her look less small-headed. Juvenile males are similar to the adult male, but browner, and with a pale, not black, bill.|$|E
40|$|International audienceStudies {{investigating}} host-parasite systems rarely {{deal with}} multispecies interactions, and mostly explore impacts on hosts as individuals. Much less {{is known about}} the effects at colony level, when parasitism involves host organisms that form societies. We surveyed the effect of an ectoparasitic fungus, Rickia wasmannii, on kin-discrimination abilities of its host ant, Myrmica scabrinodis, identifying potential consequences at social level and subsequent changes in colony infiltration success of other organisms. Analyses of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), known to be involved in insects' discrimination processes, revealed variations in chemical profiles correlated with the infection status of the ants, that could not be explained by genetic variation tested by microsatellites. In behavioural assays, fungus-infected workers were less aggressive towards both non-nestmates and unrelated queens, enhancing the probability of polygyny. Likewise, parasitic larvae of Maculinea butterflies had a higher chance of adoption by infected colonies. Our study indicates that pathogens can modify host recognition abilities, making the society more prone to accept both conspecific and allospecific organisms. In natural ecosystems, relations among different organisms are characterized by a high degree of complexity which makes studies on multispecies systems difficult. For this reason, many investigations focus exclusively on pairwise relationships 1, 2, although the outcomes of these interactions vary and depend on the context 3. For instance, in the classical case of the brood parasitic <b>giant</b> <b>cowbirds</b> (Scaphidura oryzivora), where the presence of other parasites, as botflies, may change the cowbird's effect on the host from damaging to beneficial 4. In the amphipod Gammarus insensibilis the parasite manipulation is less efficient when the host is infested with both nematodes and trematodes, compared to being exclusively parasitized by trematodes 5. Increase in immune function caused by the presence of the mildly antagonistic ectosymbiont Laboulbenia formicarum might boost the survival chances of the host ant Lasius neglectus exposed to the lethal entomopathogen fungus Metarhizium brunneum 6. Interaction between different organisms could have more complex consequences when social animals, as e. g. ants, are targeted. Changes induced by parasites at the individual level may also be reflected in the social system through the interaction of host individuals. Generally, the structure of social insect colonies, in which many similar individuals live together, makes them attractive for social parasites and various pathogens 7, 8. This is especially true in the case of ants due to the stability of their colonies and their mostly ground-based nesting habits, which make their colonies accessible to a plethora of organisms. Among these, fungi are the most important antagonists ants must constantly deal with, and they can occur inside the colony either as ectoparasites on the host cuticle, endoparasites, or endosymbionts 8, 9. Some fungi are even able to manipulate host ant behaviour to increase their own fitness 10. The relationships between the hosts and these fungi often have spectacular outcomes, but as these parasitic species have quite a low prevalence 11, their interference with other parasites is hard to study. Certain fungi, like Rickia wasmannii 9 an ectoparasitic fungus of Myrmica ants, however, are common in some population...|$|R
50|$|Except {{during the}} {{breeding}} season, the red-bellied grackle is usually seen in small, noisy {{groups in the}} canopy. Sometimes these are mixed flocks with other grackles, and sometimes they may include Oropendolas. The grackles feed on fruit and insects, scrambling about among the branches and foliage, and sometimes clinging upside down. Breeding takes place between March and August. The nest is a cup-shaped structure in the fork of a tree, loosely composed of sticks and dead leaves. The eggs are greenish-grey, blotched and streaked with dark brown and lilac. The <b>giant</b> <b>cowbird</b> (Molothrus oryzivorus) sometimes lays its eggs in the grackle's nest.|$|E
40|$|Some {{bird species}} feed on {{external}} parasites, such as ticks and flies, {{on the body}} of mammals (hosts or clients). So called cleaner birds that occur in Brazil were reviewed recently, but gathering of significant new data indicates the need for an update and a brief reappraisal of such association. New records raise the number of known clients for some cleaning birds. The Southern Caracara (Caracara plancus) picks ticks on cattle, and the Black Caracara (Daptrius ater) picks ticks on capybaras. The Wattled Jacana (Jacana jacana) picks ticks, horseflies, arthropods and organic debris on capybaras, and tick-picking on capybaras by the Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) is substantiated by photographs. The Cattle Tyrant (Machetornis rixosa) deftly catches horseflies on capybaras, and these latter clients are recorded posing for the <b>Giant</b> <b>Cowbird</b> (Molothrus oryzivorus), which also pick parasites from the marsh deer. The Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) definitely picks ticks directly on cattle. With the new records, some poorly documented or controversial issues in the literature are here confirmed, a hypothesis is validated, and a suggestion is invalidated...|$|E
