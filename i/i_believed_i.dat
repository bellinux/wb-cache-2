It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> could do it, and I did.|$|E

He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: [...] "I spoil everything I touch. I have always blundered... All my life <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning." ...|$|E

500|$|Hill contributed {{her voice}} to the soundtrack for What Happened, Miss Simone?, a 2015 {{documentary}} {{about the life of}} Nina Simone, an American singer, pianist, and civil rights activist. Hill was originally supposed to record only two songs for the record, but ended up recording six. She also served as a producer on the compilation alongside Robert Glasper. Hill said of her connection to Simone: [...] "Because I fed on this music ... <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> always had a right to have a voice. Her example is clearly a form of sustenance to a generation needing to find theirs. What a gift." [...] NPR critically praised Hill's performance on the soundtrack, stating: [...] "This album mainly showcases Lauryn Hill's breadth and dexterity. Not formally marketed as Hill's comeback album, her six tracks here make this her most comprehensive set of studio recordings since The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1998." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} a gentle piano-and-glockenspiel {{instrumental}} before segueing into [...] "Lawn of Dawns", which introduces Nico's harmonium [...] "of undulating motion weaving against her voice". The song is engulfed in [...] "weird clattering and tintinnabulating", while a [...] "dark twangy guitar... stumbles to a subdued halt in [...] final seconds". It features what may be Nico's first lyrics, inspired by her peyote visions with Jim Morrison: [...] "He blesses you, he blesses me/The day the night caresses,/Caresses you, caresses me,/Can you follow me?/I cannot understand the way I feel/Until I rest on lawns of dawns—/Can you follow me?" [...] Nico explained the peyote-induced experience which inspired the lyrics: [...] "The light of the dawn was a very deep green and <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> was upside down {{and the sky was}} the desert which had become a garden and then the ocean. I do not swim and I was frightened when it was water and more resolved when it was land. I felt embraced by the sky-garden." [...] The lyrics of the next song, [...] "No One Is There", have been described as [...] "in all probability influenced by Jim Morrison" [...] ("Some are calling/Some are sad/Some are calling mad") and are sung over Cale's classical quartet of violas darting in and out of her unusual vocal tempo. [...] "Ari's Song" [...] was dedicated to Nico's young son, Christian Aaron [...] "Ari" [...] Boulogne, her only child with French actor Alain Delon, and has been called [...] "the least-comforting lullaby ever recorded". It begins with the harmonium's clipped, whistling tones as she sings softly, [...] "Sail away/Sail away my little boy". [...] "Facing the Wind" [...] is supported by [...] "Cale-banged piano clusters, scraping of percussion or walls and off-beat tympani"; Nico's voice sounds filtered (possibly through a Leslie speaker), with the [...] "somnambulistic toiling" [...] of her pipe organ accompanied by viola and strident piano.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1887, Thérèse {{approached}} her 63-year-old father Louis, who {{was recovering from}} a small stroke, while {{he sat in the}} garden one Sunday afternoon and told him that she wanted to celebrate the anniversary of [...] "her conversion" [...] by entering Carmel before Christmas. Louis and Thérèse both broke down and cried, but Louis got up, gently picked a little white flower, root intact, and gave it to her, explaining the care with which God brought it into being and preserved it until that day. Thérèse later wrote: [...] "while I listened <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> was hearing my own story". To Therese, the flower seemed a symbol of herself, [...] "destined to live in another soil". Thérèse renewed her attempts to join the Carmel, but the priest-superior of the monastery would not allow it on account of her youth.|$|E

It wasn't that <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> could make it work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back to my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 6. Aria of Ophélie. Ophélie is in {{the garden}} with a book in her hand. She laments Hamlet's distance, feeling his look is {{something}} like reproach (Ophélie: Sa main depuis hier n'a pas touché ma main! [...] "His hand has not touched mine since yesterday"). She reads from her book, at first silently, then aloud (Ophélie: [...] "Adieu, dit-il, ayez-foi!" [...] "'Adieu, he said, trust me!'"). Hamlet appears {{on the other side}} of the garden. (An English horn plays the Theme of Hamlet's Love.) Hamlet sees Ophélie and tarries. Again she reads aloud from her book (Ophélie: [...] "En vous, cruel, j'avais foi! Je vous aimais, aimez moi!" [...] "'In you, O cruel one, <b>I</b> <b>believed.</b> <b>I</b> loved you! Love me too!'"), then looks at Hamlet. However, he remains silent, then rushes away. Ophélie says ruefully: Ah! ce livre a dit vrai! [...] "Ah! This book spoke the truth!" [...] and continues her aria (Ophélie: Les serments on des ailes! [...] "Promises have wings!").|$|E
