Using this system, unskilled operators can operate a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shovel</b> easily and accurately. A mathematical control model of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shovel</b> with a controller was constructed and a control algorithm was developed by simulation.

40|$|Abstract—OEE {{has been}} used in many {{industries}} as measure of performance. However due to limitations of original OEE, it has been modified by various researchers. OEE for mining application is special version of classic equation, carries these limitation over. In this paper it has been aimed to modify the OEE for mining application by introducing the weights to the elements of it and termed as Mine Production index (MPi). As a special application of new index MPishovel has been developed by authors. This can be used for evaluating the shovel effectiveness. Based on analysis, utilization followed by performance and availability were ranked in this order. To check the applicability of this index, a case study was done on four electrical and one <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shovel</b> in a Swedish mine. The results shows that MPishovel can evaluate production effectiveness of shovels and can determine effectiveness values in optimistic view compared to OEE. MPi with calculation not only give the effectiveness but also can predict which elements should be focused for improving the productivity...|$|E
40|$|In {{a surface}} mining {{operation}} the unscheduled downtime due to hose can reach up to 37 % {{of the entire}} unscheduled downtime for a prime mover <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shovel.</b> Reliability Based Maintenance Programs are more effective at improving fleet availability and Total Cost of Ownership. In this regard, correct process management is a fundamental building block of any successful machine reliability centered maintenance program. This can be expressed {{as well as the}} correct management of the application of the machine components, the quality and capability of the human resources involved, the comparative acquisition costs of those components and more importantly the comparative operational performance of those components. The main objective is to quantify the economic value that a reliability centered component maintenance program will bring to the operation in increased safety, machine availability and productivity, environmental compliance and total cost of ownership. This paper will present what this program, called Hose Management Program, looks like for flexible hose assemblies, its applications and the value that it has brought to some mine operators around the world...|$|E
40|$|Fola Coal Company is a mountaintop mining {{operation}} in Clay and Nicholas Counties, employing over 300 people. Using six spreads of equipment to mine 12 seams, Fola produces approximately 4. 5 million clean {{tons per year}} of low sulfur coal, which is sold on the steam market. Coal seams recovered include the Freeport, three splits of the Kittanning, 5 -Block, Clarion, Clarion Leader, Stockton A, Stockton, and three splits of the Coalburg. All seams are not always present and geologic layers vary across the property. The 5 -Block and Coalburgs are the major mining horizons on all permits. In situ sulfur is> 1 % on {{the majority of these}} seams, {{with the exception of the}} Stockton, which has been tested as high as 6 %. Fola tries to maintain an operational balance of 60 % direct ship coal, with the remaining 40 % going to a 550 -ton per hour preparation plant. Clean coal is transported from the plant directly to the train by an overland belt that is approximately 6, 500 feet in length and drops over 500 feet in elevation to a batch loadout. Loading time for a unit train of 115 cars of 100 -ton capacity averages three hours. Mining techniques involve the use of an O&K <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shovel</b> with a 30 cubic yard bucket,...|$|E
5000|$|The {{extraction}} process {{begins with the}} identification and relocation of wildlife in the area slated for intervention. Then the land is cleared and the topsoil is removed and stored in soil banks for the future reclamation of areas intervened by the mining operation. Subsequently, the area is drilled and explosives inserted for blasting so the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shovels</b> can remove the overburden. This waste rock is loaded on 240-tonne and 320-tonne trucks and deposited in waste rock dump sites.|$|R
30|$|The {{design and}} the {{procedures}} used for achieving the objectives of this research involve five interrelated modules. Module I includes rock properties of sandstone and shale, which are the predominant overburden materials in WV. Module II considers drilling and blasting operations. Module III covers digging and loading of overburden material and it specifically addresses mining equipment such as electric and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shovels,</b> and front-end wheel loaders. Module IV focuses on the SM, while Module V is developed to conduct comparative analyses among all mining unit operations. The entire production and cost model is developed in MS Excel. The AHP is used to help select the optimal mining method based on production, cost and environmental criteria.|$|R
40|$|Opencast {{coal mining}} using {{mechanical}} excavators {{has taken place}} in Northern England for over sixty years. In the early years the excavations for coal were relatively shallow and of limited area, typically less than 20 m deep and 50 ha in plan. Nowadays with the deployment of very large draglines and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shovels,</b> opencast mines can be over 200 m deep and up to 1, 000 ha in area. The investigations, excavations and earthworks failures associated with this activity have provided a unique opportunity to study several geotechnical engineering aspects of the drift and solid geology of Northern England, and how they impact on the mine planning, design and operations processes.

40|$|Ground {{excavation}} {{constitutes a}} significant component of production costs in any surface mining operation. The excavation process entails material digging and removal {{in which the}} equipment motion is constrained by the workspace geometry. A major excavation problem is the variability of material properties, resulting in varying mechanical energy input and stress loading of shovel dipper-and-tooth assembly across the working bench. This variability has {{a huge impact on}} the shovel dipper and tooth assembly in hard formations. With this in mind, the primary objectives of the project were to (i) provide the theoretical basis to develop the Intelligent Shovel Excavation (ISE) technology to solve the problems associated with excavation in material formations; (ii) advance knowledge and frontiers in shovel excavation through intelligent navigation; and (iii) submit proposal for the design, development and implementation of the ISE technology for shovel excavation at experimental surface mining sites. The mathematical methods were used to (i) develop shovel's kinematics and dynamics, and (ii) establish the relationship between shovel parameters and the resistive forces from the material formation during excavation process. The ADAMS simulation environment was used to develop the hydraulic and cable shovel virtual prototypes. Two numerical examples are included to test the theoretical hypotheses and the obtained results are discussed. The area of sensor technology was studied. Application of specific wrist-mounted sensors to characterize the material, bucket and frame assembly was determined. Data acquisition, display and control system for shovel loading technology was adopted. The concept of data acquisition and control system was designed and a shovel boom stresses were simulated. A multi-partner collaboration between research organizations, shovel manufacturer, hardware and sensor technology companies, and surface mining companies is proposed to test design features, construct a field ready prototype and perform field testing at the surface mining sites. It is anticipated that 10 % in energy savings including electricity (cable shovel) and fuel (<b>hydraulic</b> <b>shovel)</b> will be achieved by implementation of ISE technology...|$|E
40|$|The device {{we study}} is the {{excavation}} arm of a large <b>hydraulic</b> mining <b>shovel</b> having a multi-loop kinematic form. We describe an iterative algorithm that allows {{the position of the}} bucket to be tracked from measurements of the linear actuator extensions. The important characteristic of this algorithm is that it is numerically well-behaved when the linkage is close to singular configurations. While we focus on a specific device, the algorithm is easy to adapt to other multi-loop linkages. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
2500|$|By 2009, the two {{extraction}} {{methods used}} were in situ extraction, when the bitumen occurs deeper within the ground, (which {{will account for}} 80 percent of oil sands development) and surface or open-pit mining, when the bitumen {{is closer to the}} surface. Only 20 percent of bitumen can be extracted using open pit mining methods, which involves large scale excavation of the land with huge <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>shovels</b> and 400-ton heavy hauler trucks. Surface mining leaves toxic tailings ponds. In contrast, in situ uses more specialized techniques such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). [...] "Eighty percent of the oil sands will be developed in situ which accounts for 97.5 percent of the total surface area of the oil sands region in Alberta." [...] In 2006 the Athabasca deposit was the only large oil sands reservoir in the world which was suitable for large-scale surface mining, although most of this reservoir can only be produced using more recently developed in-situ technology.|$|R
40|$|Approximately, 40 % of {{the total}} energy used in surface mines is related to diesel consumption. Truck haulage is {{responsible}} {{for a majority of}} this. This chapter introduces the principal equipment used to load and haul materials in mines, namely trucks, electric rope <b>shovels,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> excavators and crushing and conveying systems. The chapter discusses factors that contribute to the energy-efficient operation of such equipment. Based on gross weight hauled per unit weight of payload, belt conveyors appear to be the most energy-efficient means of transporting material in surface mines. However, a number of factors, including large upfront capital expenditure and limited ability to relocate and scale up belt capacities, currently restrict their widespread applicability...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, the Catholic University of Chile {{undertook}} a maintenance benchmarking study of six open pit copper mines having mill capacities varying between 18, 000 t/d and 156, 000 t/d, and collectively responsible for 58 % of Chilean copper production. Key performance indices {{were selected to}} measure the effectiveness, efficiency, {{and development of the}} maintenance process. Key effectiveness indices used in the mining industry are equipment availability, reliability, and maintainability and safety indices. Reliability is often measured by mean time between failures (MTBF) and maintainability as the mean time to repair or restore service (MTTR). At the time of undertaking the benchmarking study (2001), only two of the six participating mines routinely measured these parameters. For this reason, the study focused on comparing fleet availabilities. Accident rate and accident severity (expressed as the number of lost time incidents and lost time hours per million man hours, respectively) were solicited for all permanent and contracted maintenance personnel. Financial data provided by the participating companies included total annual maintenance and mining costs, as well as a breakdown of labour, materials, and contractor costs. This data, when combined with ore and waste production data, enabled the unit costs of maintenance to be calculated. Internal efficiency indicators were solicited for: * the percentage of planned maintenance (preventive, predictive, and programmed major component replacement) carried out on each equipment fleet (blasthole drills, <b>hydraulic</b> and cable <b>shovels,</b> wheel loaders, haul trucks, and auxiliary equipment); * scheduled maintenance compliance (actual planned hours versus scheduled planned hours); * organizational efficiency in terms of the ratio of supervisors to maintenance technicians; * investment in maintenance planning as evident from the ratio of planners to maintenance technicians (planning clerks and statisticians were also considered to be maintenance planners); and * efficiency in inventory practices as evident from the stores turnover ratio and service level. Development indices were solicited for the educational level of maintenance employees and the level of commitment to maintenance training by both the companies and their collaborators, in terms of annual training hours and investment per employee. The principal conclusions of the study were as follows: * For the six open pit mines that participated in the study, maintenance costs were found to average 44 % of mining costs. This highlights the importance of the direct cost of maintenance to the financial performance of mines. * Percentage planned maintenance of equipment fleets were low by world standards, averaging 35 %, 56 %, and 44 %, respectively, for blasthole drill, shovel, and haul truck fleets. * Fleet availabilities were significantly influenced by the percentage of planned maintenance achieved. For example, haul truck fleet availabilities were found to increase on average by 1 % for every 4 % increase in planned maintenance over the range examined. * Maintenance cost per equipment was found to decrease non-linearly with increases in percentage planned maintenance. An empirical relationship was determined {{that can be used to}} estimate potential cost savings as a result of improved planned maintenance practices (see figure). * The ratio of maintenance planning staff to maintenance technicians varied between 1 : 10 and 1 : 24, indicating improvement opportunities for some of the participating companies. Investment in technical training (including planned maintenance practice) was found to be low by global industry standards. It was concluded that fleet availability and maintenance costs in Chilean open pit operations could be considerably improved by improving and/or developing maintenance planning standards, and training personnel in planned maintenance technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to combine {{traditional}} power shovel with electronic elements to establish automatic control system. The power <b>shovel</b> is a <b>hydraulic</b> system. This research investigated the relation between the strokes of three <b>hydraulic</b> cylinders and <b>shovel</b> position. MATLAB software was used to simulate the motion of manipulator. The optimum models for regular moving and evading barrier routes were established. The results were applied to control system. LabVIEW software was used to design the control system. The relations between the strokes of three cylinders and elapsed time while hydraulic valve was opened were investigated. Then we can control shovel position by varying these elapsed times. Hardware configuration of control system provides the channel for communication between PC and control valve drivers. It consists of data acquisition card, I/O card, and PLC. The PC handles signal transformation, PLC programming, signal magnifying for relays and the settings of flow rate, pressure, direction of control valves. Accordingly, by using elapsed time to control the stroke of cylinder obtained unsatisfactory result. Therefore, to improve this problem will be the future study. 本研究以PC為基礎，結合田間作業挖土機與電子訊號構件，建立自動控制系統。此挖土機的動力來自油壓設備，主要著重在三組油壓缸行程與作業手臂動作定位關係。首先使用MATLAB軟體模擬機構動作，探討移動路徑與障礙物規避之最佳化模式，進而應用在控制部分，由LabVIEW圖控軟體設計完成：行程－時間關係量測與計時控制介面，以時間控制三缸的行程變化。 控制系統硬體架構負責PC與油壓驅動器的訊號傳遞，包含資料擷取卡、I/O卡、PLC等，其中輸入輸出訊號轉換、PLC動作規劃、繼電器信號放大及各式控制閥流量、壓力、方向的設定均由PC控制。 實驗結果顯示控制油壓缸行程進行定位作業效果不甚理想，更精確的定位方法有待開發。目錄 摘要I ABSTRACTII 目錄III 圖目錄IV 表目錄V 第一章 前言 1 1. 1 研究動機 1 1. 2 研究目的 2 第二章 文獻探討 3 2. 1 機械手臂 3 2. 2 圖控軟體與應用 5 第三章 理論分析 7 3. 1 機器人反運動學理論公式之推導 7 3. 1. 1 Denavit-Hartenberg(D-H) 參數的表示 7 3. 1. 2 參考座標系統之建立 9 3. 1. 3 不同座標間之連桿轉換矩陣 9 3. 1. 4 運動學公式之推導 10 3. 1. 5 鏟斗末端反運動式之推導 13 3. 1. 6 各關節角與其對應油壓缸行程之關係式推導 18 3. 2 最佳化路徑模式之建立 27 3. 3 閃避障礙物模式之建立 30 第四章 實驗設備與方法 34 4. 1 實驗設備 34 4. 1. 1 硬體 34 4. 1. 2 硬體接線說明 41 4. 1. 3 軟體 49 4. 2 實驗方法 49 4. 2. 1 LabVIEW軟體之應用 49 4. 2. 2 訂定不同的工作轉速 50 4. 2. 3 建立活塞行程與時間的關係式 50 4. 2. 4 初步驗證程式可行性 52 4. 2. 5 建立移動路徑資料表 52 第五章 結果與討論 54 5. 1 手臂動作模擬 54 5. 2 最佳化路徑模式 61 5. 3 閃避障礙物模式 67 5. 4 不同工作轉速之行程-時間關係式 73 5. 4. 1 結果分析 74 5. 5 初步試驗結果 77 5. 5. 1 結果分析 79 5. 6 建立固定路徑資料表 87 5. 6. 1 偏差值結果分析 89 5. 6. 2 討論 89 第六章 結論 96 第七章 建議 99 參考文獻 100 圖目錄 圖 3. 1 連桿座標與參數 8 圖 3. 2 挖土手臂之區域座標系統 10 圖 3. 3 挖土手臂之側視 16 圖 3. 4 a 手臂第一部份 18 圖 3. 4 b 第一部份之照片 19 圖 3. 5 a 手臂第二部份 21 圖 3. 5 b 第二部分之照片 21 圖 3. 6 a 手臂第三部份 23 圖 3. 6 b 第三部份之照片 23 圖 3. 7 四連桿機構 24 圖 3. 8 各變數與各點相對位置 31 圖 4. 1 挖土機(YB 10) 34 圖 4. 2 控制箱 36 圖 4. 3 可程式控制器(AXon- 40 MR) 36 圖 4. 4 油壓設備 37 圖 4. 5 DAQ卡(PCI- 6024 E) 37 圖 4. 6 I/O卡(PCL- 730) 38 圖 4. 7 Relay Board(研華PCLD- 785) 39 圖 4. 8 接線盒(CB- 50 Box) 40 圖 4. 9 CB- 50 Box接點功能 40 圖 4. 10 輸入部分接線圖 43 圖 4. 11 輸出部分接線圖 46 圖 4. 12 三缸極限開關 47 圖 4. 13 試驗設備配置示意圖 48 圖 4. 14 冷卻風扇轉速量測 51 圖 4. 15 兩段移動路徑示意 53 圖 5. 1 手臂 2 D 初始位置 54 圖 5. 2 鏟斗運動軌跡 56 圖 5. 3 鏟斗運動模擬使用者介面 57 圖 5. 4 三維鏟斗作動模擬 58 圖 5. 5 a 鏟斗尖端在第二位置(- 52. 15,- 52. 15, 45. 78) 59 圖 5. 5 b 鏟斗尖端在第一位置(- 98. 77,- 57. 02,- 22. 25) 59 圖 5. 5 c 鏟斗尖端回到起始位置(- 47. 66, 0, 127. 69) 60 圖 5. 6 理想路徑 61 圖 5. 7 a 實際路徑(一缸二缸三缸) 62 圖 5. 7 b 實際路徑(三缸二缸一缸) 62 圖 5. 7 c 實際路徑(二缸一缸三缸) 63 圖 5. 8 多點路徑 64 圖 5. 9 不同inst下最佳化路徑 68 圖 5. 10 不同 下最佳化路徑 70 圖 5. 11 不同轉速下最佳化路徑 72 圖 5. 12 LabVIEW程式：前置面板 73 圖 5. 13 時間－行程關係(1200 rpm) 75 圖 5. 14 時間－行程關係(1500 rpm) 76 圖 5. 15 時間－行程關係(2000 rpm) 77 圖 5. 16 油壓缸驅動程式 78 圖 5. 17 三轉速下各點定位分布情形 80 圖 5. 18 第一缸行程 82 圖 5. 19 第二缸行程 84 圖 5. 20 第三缸行程 85 圖 5. 21 三點精準度分布 86 圖 5. 22 5 條路徑模擬之情形 88 表目錄 表 3. 1 挖土手臂各區域座標系統之連桿參數表 11 表 3. 2 各連桿尺寸參數值 17 表 3. 3 油壓缸伸縮距離 17 表 4. 1 YB 10 規格表 35 表 4. 2 TM- 4010 規格 35 表 5. 1 各點間行程變化值 65 表 5. 2 各轉速不同點數耗費之時間 66 表 5. 3 不同inst下最佳值 69 表 5. 4 不同 下最佳值 71 表 5. 5 不同rspeed下最佳值 71 表 5. 6 不同轉速定位數據 79 表 5. 7 路徑第一部份 90 表 5. 8 路徑第二部份 9...|$|R
