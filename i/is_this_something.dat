60|$|I {{have figured}} {{it in my}} last section by the symbol of my destroyer, stark and swift, {{irrelevant}} to most human interests. Sometimes I call this reality Science, sometimes I call it Truth. But it is something we draw by pain and effort ont of the heart of life, that we disentangle and make clear. Other men serve it, I know, in art, in literature, in social invention, and see it in a thousand different figures, under a hundred names. I see it always as austerity, as beauty. This thing we make clear {{is the heart of}} life. It is the one enduring thing. Men and nations, epochs and civilisation pass each making its contribution I do not know what it <b>is,</b> <b>this</b> <b>something,</b> except that it is supreme. It is, a something, a quality, an element, one may find now in colours, now in norms, now in sounds, now in thoughts. It emerges from life with each year one lives and feels, and generation by generation and age by age, but the how and why of it are all beyond the compass of my mind....|$|E
6000|$|Apart from {{definite}} arguments, {{there are}} certain feelings, rather than reasons, which {{stand in the way}} of an acceptance of the mathematical account of motion. To begin with, if a body is moving at all fast, we see its motion just as we see its colour. A slow motion, like that of the hour-hand of a watch, is only known in the way which mathematics would lead us to expect, namely by observing a change of position after a lapse of time; but, when we observe the motion of the second-hand, we do not merely see first one position and then another--we see something as directly sensible as colour. What <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>something</b> that we see, and that we call visible motion? Whatever it is, it is not the successive occupation of successive positions: something beyond the mathematical theory of motion is required to account for it. Opponents of the mathematical theory emphasise this fact. [...] "Your theory," [...] they say, [...] "may be very logical, and might apply admirably to some other world; but in this actual world, actual motions are quite different from what your theory would declare them to be, and require, therefore, some different philosophy from yours for their adequate explanation." ...|$|E

40|$|Lean {{manufacturing}} {{has certainly}} been a hot topic lately for flexo printers and converters. It is rare to attend a conference or look through a trade magazine without seeing the subject as a central focus. Lean seems mysterious, almost Zen-like, partly because we use Japanese terms like muda, kanban, and kaizen instead of just using English translations. For many, we are just getting familiar with the concepts of Lean. Waste identification and reduction are certainly primary themes. Just-in-Time, 5 S, Small-lot Production, and Setup Reduction are all recognizable Lean components. Some have seen improvements in their costs and efficiency, but others have been frustrated with their ability to sustain improvements. So, it begs the questions: Is Lean just another fad? If not, why don 2 ̆ 7 t we see the big improvements sustained over long periods as promised? <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>something</b> that only works in Japan?

40|$|By definition, {{teaching}} is a purposeful activity and responsible {{teachers should be}} able to explain their purposes and defend them … i That each department institute and implement a procedure for reviewing its courses {{at the end of each}} year, so that problems may be identified and redressed for the following year. ii These notes offer suggestions about how routine course reviews may be approached. They assume that courses pre-exist and have evolved through a deliberate curriculum design process which established purposes, relationships with other course offerings, content and organization. A regular review will consider the current relevance of these factors as well as how well they have been achieved. It will also address feedback from students on their experiences in the course, as well as observations of the course lecturers about teaching and examining processes. Good course review practice will evolve (and change) with experience. It is not fruitful to attempt ‘perfection ’ the first time round.
