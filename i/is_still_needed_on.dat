5000|$|The movie {{begins in}} Aiken, South Carolina in 1975. Dannion Brinkley is a Vietnam veteran {{who works as}} a deliveryman in his parents store. A young man with a dark side, he is unfaithful to his loving wife Casey and bullies {{everyone}} else around him, even the residents of a retirement home. His mother expresses disgust with him after he beats up a poor man who shoplifted some items from their store. She tells him she thought she raised him with a heart and that his rage is like a terrible sickness. The angry young man's life takes a dramatic turn when he is struck by lightning while talking on the phone [...] Pronounced dead at the hospital, he miraculously revives and takes an amazing trip to the other side between life and death. A being of light tells him that love makes a difference and shows Dannion the effects that his rage has had on those he hurt from those he bullied on the playground to those he fought in Vietnam. The voice tells him to look at a future without hope and Dannion is shown a collage of images involving natural disasters, famine, poverty and war (footage from the Gulf War is incorporated). The voice tells him this bleak future need not be. The near death experience has a transformative effect on Dannion and he tries to make amends with his parents, wife and the others he has made suffer. He treats the man he had previously beaten up for shoplifting to dinner. Brinkley strikes up a friendship with [...] "near death" [...] expert Doctor Raymond Moody who tries to help him understand his experience. While helping a woman escape her abusive husband, Dannion injures his hand resulting in a catastrophic infection that damages his heart. The doctors tell him {{it is a matter of}} life and death but he has no fear of returning. Doctor Moody convinces him he <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> <b>on</b> earth and Dannion agrees to the operation. He has another near death experience on the table and sees how he has loved and helped others in his new life. He has a beautiful vision of seeing his dead mother reunited in Heaven with her little sister.

With the completion of many shield tunnels in close vicinity of the operational subway tunnels in mainland China, relevant construction technologies have progressed rapidly with the accumulated experiences. For example, according to statics the number of the finished tunnel crossing projects was as high as 41 in Shanghai even before 2012 (Zhu et al. 2012). Meantime, many utility shield tunnels were built near the operational subway tunnels. For instance, Shanghai EXPO Beijing West Road to Huaxia West Road power cable tunnel passed the operational subway lines at 12 locations, and shield machines were used to construct the power cable tunnels at the 10 locations (Gao et al. 2009). In the Shenzhen subway 3 rd phase project (Lines 7, 9, 11) under construction, new shield tunnels are being constructed in close proximity to the existing operational subway tunnels at 13 locations.

The {{number of women}} dying of COPD in the United States now surpasses men. Despite this, research suggests that physicians <b>are</b> <b>still</b> more likely to correctly diagnose men with COPD than women. Increased tobacco use in women likely explains some of the increase in the {{prevalence of}} COPD in women, but data suggest that women may actually be at greater risk of smoking-induced lung function impairment, more severe clyspnea, and poorer health status for the same level of tobacco exposure. The degree to which these observations represent biologic, physiologic, or sociologic differences is not known. Nonsmokers with COPD {{are also more likely to}} be female. In addition, new evidence is emerging that men and women may be phenotypically different in their response to tobacco smoke, with men being more prone to an emphysematous phenotype and women an airway predominant phenotype.

Objective: To exclude a {{higher than normal}} risk for miscarriage and congenital malformation in pregnancies initiated under cabergoline treatment. Design: A retrospective study of 100 pregnancies in 72 hyperprolactinaemic women treated with cabergoline {{at the time of}} conception and follow-up of the 88 born children. Methods: Cabergoline was interrupted in 99 pregnancies and continued in one case. Foetal exposure dose to cabergoline was calculated for each pregnancy. Complications of pregnancy and neonatal status were compared to those observed in an age-and delivery time-matched control group of 163 women. Results: The mean foetal exposure dose to cabergoline was 3. 6  4. 7 mg. The rate of spontaneous miscarriages was 10 %. Three medical terminations of pregnancy were performed for a foetal malformation (3 %). Minor to moderate complications were observed in 31 % of the pregnancies, a figure similar to that found in the control group. An increase in tumour size (2 - 8 mm) was observed in 17 / 37 evaluated cases, needing re-introduction of cabergoline during pregnancy in 5 patients. The 84 deliveries resulted in 88 infants, 3 of them presenting with a malformation (3. 4 %). Neonatal status was comparable to the control group, where a malformation rate of 6. 3 % was observed.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that fibers are {{effective}} in modifying the cracking pattern development of concrete structural element, causing an higher number of cracks and, consequently, lower crack spacing values and narrower crack widths compared to the matrix alone. This effect could be exploited to improve durability of Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures, especially of those exposed to aggressive environments. The analytical prediction of crack width and spacing in Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) structural elements in bending <b>is</b> <b>still</b> an open issue. A crack width relationship for RC elements with fibers similar to those developed for classical RC structural members would be desirable for designers. The recent development of important technical design codes, such as RILEM TC 162 TDF and the new MC 2010, embrace this idea. However further validation of these models by experimental results <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>needed.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the study of the influence of a sustained load on crack width in presence of the fiber reinforcement is a topic almost unexplored and important at the same time.

40|$|Background:Pneumonia is {{the leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality among children < 5 years of age globally. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are known to provide protection against vaccine serotype pneumococcal pneumonia; uncertainty exists regarding the optimum PCV dosing schedule. Methods:We conducted a systematic review of studies published from 1994 to 2010 (supplemented post hoc with studies from 2011) documenting the effect of PCV dosing schedules on clinical and radiologically confirmed pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema among children of ages targeted to receive vaccine. Data on 2 - and 3 -dose schedules were included. Percent change of pneumonia incidence rates from baseline to most recent year post-PCV introduction was calculated. Results:We identified 42 primary citations that evaluated PCV schedules and pneumonia. Thirty-seven (88 %) were from North America, Europe or Australia; 37 (88 %) evaluated PCV 7 and 1 (2 %) PCV 10. Two studies (both observational) compared multiple schedules within the study. We found evidence of reduced clinical and radiologically confirmed pneumonia incidence for all schedules, including 2 + 1 (1 nonrandomized trial, 5 observational studies), 3 + 0 (5 randomized trials, 2 observational studies) and 3 + 1 (5 clinical trials, 24 observational studies) schedules. The magnitude of disease impact did not differ among schedules. Evidence for impact on pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema varied. Conclusions:All schedules (2 + 1, 3 + 0 and 3 + 1) reduced clinical and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Quantifying differences in pneumonia disease impact between schedules was difficult due to heterogeneity among studies in design, case definition and population. These findings support World Health Organization recommendations for 3 -dose schedules administered as either 3 + 0 or 2 + 1 regimens.
