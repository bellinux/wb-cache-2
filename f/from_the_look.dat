5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
500|$|For research, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh visited {{museums and}} art galleries, and also read Austen's letters and novels. She was {{interested}} in both the effects of continental fashions on English clothing and the differences between social classes. While she recognised that 1795 [...] "marked the beginning" [...] of the empire waistline trend, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would have barely been introduced to Austen's circle in the country; rather, the film displayed many costume designs from the early 1790s. She explained, [...] "We wanted to show that transition especially for the women. The look in London is very different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> in the countryside. For the country ball the fashion for the older women is more of the old style but for the younger women we show {{the introduction of the}} Empire line." ...|$|E
500|$|Animation for {{the film}} began in January 2006, with the Itchy & Scratchy short being the first scene to be storyboarded. Groening {{rejected}} making either a live-action or a CGI film, calling the film's animation [...] "deliberately imperfect" [...] and [...] "a tribute {{to the art of}} hand-drawn animation". The film was produced in a widescreen [...] aspect ratio, to distinguish it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the television series, and colored with the largest palette the animators had ever had available to them. A lot of the animation was produced using Wacom Cintiq tablets, which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a computer monitor to facilitate production. Animation production work was divided among four studios around the world: Film Roman in Burbank, California, Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California, and AKOM and Rough Draft's division in Seoul, South Korea. As with the television series, the storyboarding, characters, background layout, and animatic parts of production, were done in America. The overseas studios completed the inbetweening, digital ink and paint, and rendered the animation to tape before being shipped back to the United States.|$|E

500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

2500|$|Because the {{majority}} of Deathly Hallows takes place in various settings away from Hogwarts, David Yates wanted to [...] "shake things up" [...] by using different photographic techniques such as using hand-held cameras and very wide camera lenses. Eduardo Serra said, [...] "Sometimes we are combining elements shot by the main unit, a second unit, and the visual effects unit. You {{have to know what}} is being captured – colours, contrast, et cetera – with mathematical precision." [...] He noted that with Stuart Craig's [...] "amazing sets and the story", the filmmakers could not [...] "stray too far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the previous Harry Potter films." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, Roxette {{went back}} to the studio and {{recorded}} a second album, Look Sharp! which once again returned them to the charts in Sweden. However, Roxette then had an unexpected number one hit in the USA with [...] "The Look" [...] in April 1989. Almost overnight, Fredriksson and Gessle were catapulted from being minor celebrities in Sweden to major artists internationally who suddenly found themselves travelling all over the world, selling millions of records, and receiving awards. Look Sharp! was a massive hit, producing two US No. 1 hits including [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] in November 1989. A third song <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Look</b> Sharp! album, [...] "Dangerous", spent two weeks at the No. 2 spot in February 1990.|$|E
2500|$|The Valiant {{was less}} radical in {{configuration}} than General Motors' compact Chevrolet Corvair, {{which had a}}n air-cooled rear-mounted engine, but was considered more aesthetically daring than the also-new Falcon which had a more conventional look; the Valiant boasted a radical design that continued Exner's Forward Look styling with [...] "sleek, crisp lines which flow forward in a dart or wedge shape." [...] The flush-sided appearance was a carried-over feature from Chrysler's Ghia-built D'Elegance and Adventurer concept cars which also gave the Valiant additional inches of interior room. With its semi-fastback and lengthy hood line, many automotive publications of the time thought the Valiant's styling was European inspired. While the Valiant was all new, specific design elements tied it to other contemporary Chrysler products. Features such as the canted tailfins tipped with cat's-eye shaped tail lamps and the simulated spare tire pressing (or continental tire) on the deck lid were thematically similar to those on the Imperial and the 300F. According to Exner, the stamped wheel design was used not only to establish identity with other Chryslers, but to [...] "dress up the rear deck area without detracting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of directed forward motion." ...|$|E
