[...] Various proposals to revive a streetcar line with this name have been discussed in recent years, but the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority has no current plans to rebuild. [...] Enthusiasts are nicknaming the new St. Claude line the [...] "Desire line", despite the former and latter each having run on separate and distinct routes. [...] For many years, a 1906 Brill-built semi-convertible streetcar was displayed in the French Market with a Desire route sign, {{although there is no}} evidence that cars of this type ever served the <b>Desire</b> <b>Line.</b> [...] At first it was under cover; later out in the open, it deteriorated from the weather, and in the 1990s it was turned over to New Orleans RTA.
