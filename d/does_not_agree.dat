5|$|If a {{publisher}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with the rating {{that they were}} assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but {{it has never been}} used.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{becomes the}} new owner of the caravan park. He becomes good friends with Leah and {{falls in love with}} her. She feels it is to soon after husband Dan's death and does not feel the same, leaving him upset. Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) then helps him track down Jai, a boy from Phuket whom he told he would help, but never did. He comes to live with Miles, their {{relationship}} is strained by Jai's reluctance to trust him, eventually they become close. Religious Christine Jones (Elizabeth Alexander) later starts a campaign to have Miles removed from his job when she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with his choice of book used for teaching. Morag later helps rid of Christine and saves his career. He lets Melody Jones stay with him, but she rebels and causes trouble for him with her new-found bad attitude. He then has a brief relationship with Jazz Curtis (Rachel Gordon).|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Pillai is released. He brings {{news that}} Jackson has been {{transferred}} back to England on Davison's recommendation. At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai {{and his men}} have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men {{to do it because}} of the famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him of injustice. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sunderalingam, overhears this and informs him; he prepares for battle.|$|E
30|$|Design & methods: We sent 1, 300 {{questionnaires}} by email for all {{the participants}} to courses at the EITS (European Institute for Telesurgery) during 2007.

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is excited}} about her {{vacation}} week, until she gets a text message from her assistant, Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), that the hotel she had planned to stay at was overbooked. Liz goes to see Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) who is giving out flu shots at the 30 Rock studios. She learns that the shots are given to select few employees. Her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), asks her {{to let him know}} about the most important individuals in her staff that should receive flu shots. Liz <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with Jack that he should ration out health care, which results in Liz not getting a shot. Jack considers giving the show's page, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), one of the remaining shots, as he is very ill with the flu, though Kenneth refuses. Later, Jack continuously asks Liz, but still refuses. This time, she displays her solidarity in front of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) crew who show her their appreciation. However, as she sees the crew getting sicker, as days go by, she panics and gets the shot.|$|E

25|$|Decisions {{are based}} on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us {{consultation}} is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia.

Mullah Omar will be the highest authority and the government {{will not be able to}} implement any decision to which he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b> General elections are incompatible with Sharia and therefore we reject them.|$|E

After it becomes clear that the lizards will not harm them, Nancy is excited by their presence. She does everything she can to learn about them and make a connection with them. She wants to shake hands with them first.|$|E
25|$|Crossan {{relies heavily}} {{on the work of}} John Kloppenborg, who does not {{outwardly}} support Crossan’s theory. “A documentary hypothesis for the relationship between Q and Thomas must be ruled out.” Kloppenborg points out that there are instances of overlap that scholars believe are Common Sayings Source material found in the wisdom speeches, “Thomas lacks elements present in Q, which had Thomas known Q, would surely have taken over.” Kloppenborg created the stratification theory in Q that Crossan relies on but it seems that Kloppenborg <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with the use of his theory to create a comparison between his layering of Q and the layering of the Gospel of Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Oakland scouts {{are first}} dismissive and then hostile towards Brand's {{non-traditional}} sabermetric approach to scouting players. Grady Fuson aggressively confronts Beane, and is fired. Grady then {{takes to the}} radio airwaves to question the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on-base percentage (OBP). Beane signs the ones Brand suggests, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford, past-his-prime outfielder David Justice, and an injured catcher, Scott Hatteberg. Beane also faces opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics' manager, who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with the new philosophy. Howe disregards Beane's and Brand's strategy and plays a lineup he prefers.|$|E

On his way to the chief judge's office, Dredd meets DeMarco in the bunker's medical wing, where he invites her to apply to rejoin Justice Department, as there will never be a better time. However she refuses, as she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with the Department's mandatory code of celibacy. Dredd again tells her that there is no prospect of any romantic relationship between them, and with this further rejection of her, DeMarco's love for him finally dies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{anthropologist}} Margaret Murray and occultist Aleister Crowley {{are among those}} who questioned {{the involvement of the}} ecclesiastic and secular authorities in the case. Murray, who propagated the witch-cult hypothesis, speculated in her book The Witch-Cult in Western Europe that Gilles de Rais was really a witch and adherent of a fertility cult centered on the pagan goddess, Diana. However, most historians reject Murray's theory. Norman Cohn argues that her theory <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with what is known of Gilles' crimes and trial. Historians do not regard Gilles as a martyr to a pre-Christian religion; other scholars tend to view him as a lapsed Catholic who descended into crime and depravity, whose real crimes caused the land forfeitures.|$|E
25|$|Hadith (reports of Muhammad's sayings {{and deeds}} from {{those close to}} him in his lifetime) on the subject are inconsistent, with {{different}} writers interpreting the Prophet in different ways. Shariah (Islamic law) defines sodomy outside marriage as adultery or fornication or both, and it thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars. In practice, few modern Muslim countries have legal systems based fully on Shariah, and {{an increasing number of}} Muslims do not look to shariah but to the Quran itself for moral guidance. For sodomy within marriage, the majority of Shiite interpreters hold that (1) anal intercourse, while strongly disliked, is not haram (forbidden) provided the wife agrees; and (2), if the wife <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree,</b> then it is preferable to refrain.|$|E
