25|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> was {{substantially}} different. Instead {{of being}} suspended from an alloy cradle {{as on the}} Mark A and B, the engine now sat in a steel cradle bolted to a steeply inclined steel tube that pivoted directly behind the engine through an alloy steering head bracket. This bracket, holding the engine and front wheel unit is bolted to a cast alloy bulkhead which forms a major structural component of the car. The <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> {{was said to have}} been a regular source of failures on both the Mark A and the Mark B, and this new design was again the work of Granville Bradshaw.|$|E
25|$|For the Mark VI, {{launched}} in 1990, the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> points were moved forward to take 1,275cc power units, and includes the HIF carburettor version, plus the single point fuel injected car {{which came out}} in 1991. The 998cc power units were discontinued. Internal bonnet release were fitted from 1992.|$|E
25|$|As a result, Hispano {{substituted}} the 1,300hp Hispano-Suiza 12Z-89 engine, which flew at Barcelona in 1944, {{while the}} first HA-1109-J1L made its maiden flight 2 March 1945 at Seville, using a VDM prop and lash-up <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The other twenty-four airframes were flown during 1947-9 with Escher-Wyss props, but never became operational.|$|E

40|$|Ride comfort is an {{important}} factor in any road vehicle performance. Nonetheless, passenger ride comfort is sometimes affected by the vibrations resulting from the road irregularities. Vehicle ride comfort is also often compromised by <b>engine</b> vibration. <b>Engine</b> <b>mount</b> is one of the devices which act as vibration isolator from unwanted vibration from engine to the driver and passengers. This paper explains the development of the test rig used for laboratory testing of Magnetorheological (MR) <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> characterization. MR <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> was developed to investigate the vibration isolation process. An <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> test machine was designed to measure the displacement, relative velocity and damper force with respect to current supply to characterize the hysteresis behavior of the damper and as force tracking control of the MR <b>engine</b> <b>mount...</b>|$|R
25|$|The KR200 {{replaced}} the KR175 in 1955. While {{using the same}} basic frame as the KR175 with changes to the bodywork (notably including wheel cutouts in the front fenders) and an improved canopy design, the KR200 was otherwise an almost total redesign. The rear suspension and <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> were reworked, and hydraulic shock absorbers were installed at all three wheels. Tire sizes were enlarged to 4.00×8.|$|E
25|$|The Sprat, {{though a}} smaller aircraft, had strong family resemblances {{to the earlier}} Velos torpedo bomber. The Sprat was a staggered, single-bay biplane with equal-span wings that could be folded for carrier stowage. The {{fuselage}} centre section was built around a tubular-steel structure which linked the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> and the wooded-framed rear fuselage. The two dual-control open cockpits were both behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing for optimum visibility. Unusually, the instruments were placed on the rear spar of the upper wing centre section, where they could be read from both cockpits. The rudder area was large compared to that of the fin and a braced tailplane was placed on top of the rear fuselage.|$|E
25|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two control arms, seated on the lower wishbone arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings {{in and out of the}} mounting brackets.|$|E
50|$|The Regera {{will feature}} active <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> for the ICE and {{transmission}} to rest on. The <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> {{are designed to}} stay soft at lower speeds, significantly reducing vibrations and engine noise, adding to the luxury effect of the vehicle. While driving more aggressively or at higher speeds, the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> will firm up, giving greater lateral response to the vehicle.|$|R

25|$|Episode 32 of MythBusters {{investigates the}} urban legend of an {{affordable}} jet pack or rocket pack {{that can be}} built from plans purchased on the Internet. Extensive modifications {{were made by the}} MythBusters team due to vagueness in the plans and because of the infeasibility of the specified <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The jet pack produced by the MythBusters had two ducted fans powered by ultralight-type piston engines. (Fans complained that the use of piston engines destroyed the whole idea of the pack's being truly based on jets, by which, presumably, they meant self-contained gas turbines.) They found it was not powerful enough to lift a person off the ground, and was expensive to build. The plans specified a Rotax 503 ultralight engine, but they intended to use the more powerful and lighter Rotax 583 engine before a similar lighter unnamed engine was substituted.|$|E
25|$|The wings had {{constant}} chord with roughly elliptical tips, with roots joining the upper longerons. On each side, {{a pair of}} streamlined struts from {{the front and rear}} wing spars at mid-span transmitted lift loads {{to the end of the}} stub wing. There was another, slighter pair of struts from each <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> vertically to the wing. The wing structure was mostly metal, with some wooden components, then fabric covered. Each wing carried a pair of ailerons with trim tabs to reduce control loads. The fuselage was built around the usual four metal longerons and covered with an aluminium skin. Pilot and co-pilot sat side by side with dual control in an enclosed cabin just ahead of the leading edge, with fuselage windows on either side for lateral and downward vision. Access to the large passenger cabin, 4.60 m long, was via a radio compartment. The cabin seated ten passengers, five down each side with their own window. At the back were baggage spaces and toilet facilities. Passengers entered by a port-side door and luggage loaded through a door on the other side.|$|E
25|$|The Latécoère 350, or 35-0 as it {{was first}} called, was a direct {{development}} of the successful single-engined passenger carrying Latécoère 28. To increase cruising speed and, in particular to provide reliability for night flying, the new design had three engines. Apart from the immediate changes this involved and a modest increase in wingspan, the 350 and the 28 had much in common, both in structural detail and in general appearance. Both were high wing, strut braced monoplanes with enclosed cockpits and fixed undercarriages. The two extra engines of the 350 were mounted {{at the ends of}} stub wings, more streamlined support structures than lifting surfaces, which extended horizontally from the lower fuselage longerons. Each was further stabilised by a pair of struts from {{the upper part of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> to the wing roots. The outer engines were mounted as close together as possible, to minimize the couple resulting from the loss of power of one of them. They were housed in long, well streamlined cowlings that reached back as far as the wing trailing edge. The third engine was in the nose, as in the Latécoère 28. All the engines were 400hp (298kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Jb V-12 twelve water-cooled units. Three separate radiators for them were fixed under the stub wing.|$|E
40|$|Variation(온도변화), Dynamic Stiffness(동강성) Vehicle {{vibrations}} {{arise from}} engine and road surface excitations. The <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> system of a passenger car sustains the engine weight and insulates the excitation force {{from the engine}} system. The dynamic properties of viscoelastic material used for the vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> have large varia-tion due to environmental factors such as environmental temperature and humidity etc. The present study aims to investigate the variability of dynamic characteristics in rubber <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> consider-ing both environmental temperature change and material model errors/uncertainty. The <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> for a passenger car were modeled using finite element method. Then, the dynamic stiffness varia-bility of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation method. In order to esti-mate the variations in the storage and loss moduli of the viscoelastic materials, the material proper-ties of the synthetic rubber were expressed as a fractional-derivative model.

25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|E

The gimballing motion was used to control the flight path of the missile, replacing {{the system of the}} V-2 missile that used moving fins placed within a fixed engine. The gimbal system adds complexity to the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> but preserves more of the energy of the rocket exhaust during maneuvering.

500|$|On June 6, 1979, {{two weeks}} after the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration {{suspended}} the type certificate for the DC-10, thereby grounding all DC-10s under its jurisdiction. It also enacted a special air regulation banning the DC-10 from U.S. airspace, which prevented foreign DC-10s not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} FAA from flying within the country. This was done while the FAA investigated whether or not the airplane's <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> and pylon design met relevant requirements. Once the FAA was satisfied that maintenance issues were primarily at fault and not the actual design of the aircraft, the type certificate was restored on July 13 and the special air regulation repealed. However, the type certificate was amended, stating that [...] "...removal of the engine and pylon as a unit will immediately render the aircraft un-airworthy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Premier's {{longitudinal}} <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> layout was inherited, as was {{the front}} suspension geometry, {{and parts of the}} braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or rear-wheel drive (designated [...] "LH" [...] and [...] "LX" [...] respectively).

2500|$|The Alizé (Tradewind in English) was {{designed}} in 1936 as a tourer/trainer, {{though in the}} end it served almost entirely as a trainer. Its flat sided, round decked fuselage seated two in open, tandem cockpits, fitted from the outset with dual control. [...] The rear cockpit was at the trailing edge of the parasol wing, which had a small cut-out for improved visibility; the forward cockpit was under the wing. [...] The wing itself was of parallel chord with rounded tips. [...] Like the rest of the Alizé, it had a wooden structure. [...] Two pairs of parallel struts joined the wing to the lower fuselage longerons, assisted by vertical ancillary struts outboard and a cabane structure with two main struts per side, another pair of thinner struts going forward to the upper rear <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> Both vertical and horizontal tail surfaces were straight edged and nearly rectangular. The rudder operated in a cut-out between the elevators, carried on the strut braced stabilizers. The Alizé had a fixed, split axle conventional undercarriage. [...] The main undercarriage legs, each carrying a single mainwheel, were mounted vertically on the forward wing struts, with half-axles hinged from the centre line of the fuselage bottom. [...] Secondary struts ran forward from {{the top and bottom of}} each leg to points on the rear of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{prototype}} Sage Type 4a (serial number N.116) first flew on 3 July 1917. The type demonstrated excellent handing during testing, being capable both {{of flying}} aerobatic manoeuvres while still being stable {{enough to be}} easily flown [...] "hands-off". Despite this, the type was rejected for service as a patrol aircraft, but it was recommended that it instead be adapted into a float-plane trainer. The aircraft was fitted with dual controls and the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> was modified to allow any one {{of a variety of}} 200hp (149kW) engines to be fitted. N.116 was converted to the new standard, being fitted with a Sunbeam Arab and flew as the Sage Type 4b on 17 May 1918.|$|E
2500|$|It was an {{extremely}} advanced design for the period, with a single-unit steel [...] "bathtub" [...] running from just behind the propeller to the rear crew position acting not only as armour, but also as both the main fuselage structure and <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> in one unit. Engine access was provided by armored steel panels, one {{on either side of}} the nose. The armour was [...] thick and weighed [...] It protected the crew, the engine, the fuel tanks, and radio equipment, when fitted. The flight control surfaces were connected to the aircraft's controls by push-rods and bellcranks – not with the usual steel cable control connections of the era as push-rods were less likely to be severed by ground fire.|$|E
2500|$|They {{shared a}} semi-ellipsoidal {{aluminium}} engine cowling, split into a spinner {{from which the}} propeller protruded and with a large opening for cooling air, and a fixed rear part that reached back to the forward cabane. Behind the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> the fuselage was a circular section, tapered monocoque, with the cockpit of the single-seater under a cut-out in {{the trailing edge of}} the upper wing. The absence of internal structure in the fuselage made it straightforward to extend the Limousine's fuselage by 23% to include a second cockpit. [...] At the Salon its two seats were enclosed within a rather blunt canopy or coupé with a flat windscreen and two windows on each side. This was readily detachable and it is not known if the Limousine was flown with it in place.|$|E
