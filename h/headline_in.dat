25|$|The project {{involved}} {{more than}} 3,500 workers at its peak, including 3,439 {{on a single}} day, August 14, 1930. Many of the workers were Irish and Italian immigrants, with a sizable minority of Mohawk ironworkers from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal. According to official accounts, five workers died during the construction, although the New York Daily News gave reports of 14 deaths and a <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> the socialist magazine The New Masses spread unfounded rumors of up to 42 deaths.|$|E
25|$|Specials about Jackson {{aired on}} {{multiple}} television {{stations around the}} world. The British soap opera EastEnders added a last-minute scene, in which the character Denise Johnson discussed the news with Patrick Trueman, to the June 26 episode. While most British newspapers printed pictures of Jackson in his youth or in his prime, The Sun (for {{the day after his}} death) was the only paper to show Jackson from 2009 at his frailest, and keeping to their regular promotion of 'Wacko Jacko.' The next day, The Sun fell into course {{with the rest of the}} newspapers and Jackson was the topic of every front-page <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> The Sun for about two weeks following his death. Magazines including Time published commemorative editions. A scene that had featured Jackson's sister La Toya was cut from the film Brüno out of respect toward Jackson's family.|$|E
25|$|Arachne {{is upset}} that Spider-Man {{has not taken}} her bait, and she visits him in another dream {{in which the two}} of them get married. When that does not work, she uses a <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> the Daily Bugle about 50 stolen pairs of shoes to weasel her way into the office of J. Jonah Jameson. Her furies steal the shoes for {{themselves}} and descend upon Jameson ("Deeply Furious"). Arachne convinces him to run a headline pronouncing Spider-Man a needed hero, and he does. After enjoying the blackout and its intimacy, MJ and Peter come to a standstill: because of the dreams and the added pressure of needing Spider-Man, Peter doesn't think he can be good enough for MJ anymore. She assures him that he is all she needs in the world ("If the World Should End"). On a path of soul-searching, Peter realizes that if MJ loves him then he can go on being Spider-Man; he finds his inner hero and vanquishes the Sinister Six ("The Boy Falls From the Sky").|$|E

25|$|The Can of Worms at ICI was the <b>headline</b> <b>in</b> Business & Finance {{magazine}} on 8 November 1984. The Insurance Corporation of Ireland (ICI) was a wholly owned subsidiary of AIB when it collapsed in 1985 with losses of over £200 million. When {{it was discovered}} in November 1984 that ICI was operating below the statutory reserve ratio, a request for further capital was made to AIB— ICI had returned a profit of more than £80 million the previous year. This collapse occurred {{at a time of}} deep economic recession in Ireland. The level of Government debt at that time was 116% of GDP. But the Irish taxpayer bailed ICI out of its difficulties. The Irish Government did so to ensure a continuation of the insurance business and to protect policyholders. AIB claimed that it could not resolve the problems of ICI without putting its core banking business in jeopardy. The investment of £85 million by AIB in ICI was written off and the cost to the Irish taxpayer was £400 million.|$|E

The Wall Street Journal, in a headline, deemed Bakke [...] "The Decision Everybody Won". According to Oxford University Chair of Jurisprudence Ronald Dworkin, the court's decision [...] "was received by the press and much of the public with great relief, as an act of judicial statesmanship that gave to each party in the national debate what it seemed to want most".|$|E

[...] to encourage speculation as to his whereabouts among the young readership. His co-workers and staff at Tintin magazine were increasingly annoyed by unplanned absences such as this, which affected the entire production; his colleague E. P.

500|$|Shortly after Fridays article, Hearst sent Parsons {{an angry}} letter {{complaining}} {{that he had}} learned about Citizen Kane from Hopper and not her.

On January 10 Parsons and two lawyers working for Hearst were given a private screening of the film. James G. Stewart was present at the screening and said that she walked out of the film. Soon after, Parsons called Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released Kane. She also contacted the management of Radio City Music Hall and demanded that they not screen it.
